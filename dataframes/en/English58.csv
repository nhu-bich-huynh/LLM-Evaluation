". Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking all Members for this lively, controversial and important debate."
"The Commission has been informed by the Portuguese Permanent Representation in Brussels that the 'Women on Waves' association, amongst others, appealed against the decision to refuse entry of the vessel into Portugal."
"As I said earlier, on 6 September 2004 the administrative and fiscal court of Coimbra concluded that there had been no violation of Community law."
"This decision is the subject of a further appeal."
"The Commission intends to seek information on the precise motives and implications of the decision of the Portuguese Government."
"Member States enjoy discretionary powers to determine the scope of the concepts of public policy, public security and public health on the basis of their legislation and national case law."
"However, measures restricting freedom of movement adopted on those grounds must comply with the provisions of Directive 64/221/EEC, which limits Member States' discretionary powers."
"As I have already stated, the Commission believes that any Member State adopting a decision restricting the free movement of persons must respect fundamental rights, including freedom of expression, as general principles of Community law."
"I thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is oral question (B6-0012/2004) on the EU strategic objectives for the 13th meeting of the CITES Convention."
"Mr President, I am wearing several hats this morning, so I apologise for the confusion."
"First of all, on behalf of the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz, I should like formally to move the oral question, the subject of which is the EU strategic objectives for the 13th meeting of the CITES Convention."
"Specifically, what are the key strategic objectives for the European Union at the forthcoming Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora – CITES – to be held in Bangkok, Thailand, from 2 to 14 October 2004?"
"I am also here in the absence of Mr John Bowis, our coordinator, and would like to include my contribution on behalf of the PPE-DE Group while I am on my feet, rather than speaking again after the Commissioner."
"CITES is a global conservation agreement on trade in endangered species of wild flora and fauna, which is implemented in the EU through the even stricter EU wildlife trade regulations."
"However, there is an urgent need for greater cooperation between the 25 Member States' enforcement agencies, especially now that our land borders, post-enlargement, have increased by over one third to more than 3 000 km and also because of the acknowledged links between the significant, though unquantified, illegal wildlife trade and organised crime."
"The EU Enforcement Group, which has been set up under Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97, needs to be revisited somewhat urgently."
"It needs to be made much more effective: we need systematic compilation on the illegal wildlife trade to determine the numbers of seizures and confiscations."
"This must all be put on a database, so that information can be shared by all enforcement officers throughout the EU."
"I underline my concerns and those of my Group on the lack of proper enforcement and assistance to the enforcement agencies in this particularly important area."
"CITES regulates trade in some 30 000 species of plants and animals."
"The EU is a major legal market."
"Over the five years up to 2001, for example, imports into the EU have included 5.4 million live birds, equal to 87% of global trade, with Portugal and Spain being the main importers; over one million live reptiles, equal to 16% of global trade, with Spain and Germany being the main importers; seven million live cacti and 15 million live orchids, mainly going to the Netherlands; and 383 tonnes of sturgeon caviar, 40% of the global trade, which went mainly to France and Germany."
"In July 2004, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council decision on the Community position, to be adopted on certain proposals submitted to the 13th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention."
"This proposal has been discussed at a number of meetings of the Working Party on International Environment Issues, which is made up of scientific and management experts from Member States."
"I understand the final meeting is to take place today."
"It would have been useful if we had known the outcome of the final meeting before this debate, but unfortunately I do not have any information from it and it is probably not possible to obtain it."
"In relation to the CITES itself, Appendix I is reserved for the most critically endangered species."
"International commercial trade in wild-taken specimens of these species is prohibited in Appendix I."
"Appendix II contains most of the species regulated by the Commission."
"Regulated commercial trade in these species is allowed, however, such trade must not be detrimental to the survival of the species concerned."
"It is really only Appendix I and Appendix II that require the sanction of the Conference of the Parties in this area."
"Let me turn to some of the specific points in the resolution before us, which I largely welcome, although I find it rather long and verbose."
"However, I fully support the resolution, as does the PPE-DE Group, with perhaps a couple of caveats."
"First of all, the PPE-DE Group will be having a free vote on paragraph 3, as requested."
"I will be supporting paragraph 3 myself and will be indicating this to my Group, but there are those who have concerns about it."
"Likewise, our Group will have a free vote on paragraph 7, indent 1, on African lions."
"I will be voting against that and I will explain why in a moment."
"In relation to paragraph 5, I need guidance from the Commission."
"It welcomes an Australian proposal to list the great white shark in Appendix II of CITES with a zero quota on precautionary principle grounds."
"I understand, and I would like it confirmed, that the proposers – the Australians – have now withdrawn the proposal for a zero quota."
"As it stands in our resolution, therefore, it may not make sense."
"Perhaps we should finish the point by welcoming the Australian proposal to list the great white shark in CITES, Appendix II, full stop."
"Others may make the case for reintroducing a zero quota if they wish, but as it stands, it makes no sense."
"On the great white shark issue, the Community has generally supported the Appendix II listing, but rejected the zero quota on legal and scientific grounds."
"While I support the precautionary principle, I do not support a 'preventionary' principle."
"Generally, I believe in rewarding those states that have made tremendous efforts in the area of conservation."
"What we do must not dilute the credibility of CITES itself."
"Any decisions we take, even as a Parliament, apart from what the Commission and others might decide, must be scientifically grounded to ensure the credibility of CITES."
"That is the general thrust of the position we have taken in these areas."
"This applies very strongly to the points on the black rhinoceros and the leopard."
"The proposal on the African lion is scientifically weak and is strongly opposed by the range states where the lion population is stable or increasing."
"I have an open position on this."
"I hope that we can find a compromise solution with the range states."
"However, we must not erode the credibility of the Convention by supporting scientifically weak proposals on this."
"Although it is a free vote, I will be recommending that we vote against, in the hope that a compromise will be found in that area."
"In the case of the Irrawaddy dolphin, I recognise that the proposal has some merit."
"I am leaning in favour of it, but the scientific and practical doubts remain."
"Again, I hope that, on the basis of sound scientific principle and with proper use of the precautionary principle, which is not a 'preventionary' principle, we will be able to look after endangered species as we should."
"The rest of the world will follow what the EU-25 does at the Conference of the Parties."
"It is not just our 25 votes, but the other votes that we will attract from among the 166 parties voting on these issues."
"I thank Mr Doyle for elucidating the question and for making a contribution on behalf of his group, even though it meant running slightly over time."
". Mr President, the next conference of the parties to the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species – CITES – has a very full agenda."
"However, I am pleased to inform you that preparations in Council have proceeded smoothly and we have already reached a consensus."
"In doing so, our position on some high-profile issues has evolved."
"For example, we are now leaning in favour of the proposal to outlaw commercial trade in the Irrawaddy dolphin."
"CITES has been in force for nearly 30 years and has proved a very effective tool in reducing the threats to wild fauna and flora posed by unsustainable international trade."
"Since its entry into force, other agreements relating to biodiversity have been adopted, most notably the Convention on Biological Diversity."
"One of the Community's strategic objectives is to achieve greater synergies between these agreements, thereby contributing to a significant reduction in the rate of loss of biological diversity by 2010, as endorsed at the World Summit on Sustainable Development."
"The Community also believes that CITES should remain a vehicle for the sustainable use of wild fauna and flora."
"Increased protection is often required to safeguard the conservation status of some species in trade, but we must also acknowledge the efforts of those countries that have already implemented effective conservation measures."
"For this reason, we have to consider seriously the proposals for easing trade restrictions on some species, such as the Christmas orchid from Colombia, black and white rhinos, the leopard, and so on."
"CITES is a science-based convention, as has already been underlined, and sets out detailed criteria for determining the level of protection that should apply to individual species."
"The Community supports this science-based approach and therefore is hesitant about the proposals concerning the African lion and endemic reptiles."
"Finally, the Community wishes to maximise the efficiency of CITES by minimising unnecessary administrative burdens."
"While we must avoid illegal or unsustainable trade, we should also ensure that parties' resources are directed towards issues of real conservation concern."
"– Mr President, the resolution on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora is an important step in preparation for the 13th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention."
"I agree with its recommendations."
"Because the Convention divides protected species into different categories of commercial exploitation, it provides a sufficiently versatile tool for keeping problems in check."
"The proposal before us now will in some cases mean protection will be more rigid, while in some cases it will be slacker."
"Both of these gestures are appropriate and justified, and they reflect a balanced, scientific perspective."
"A few icons of animal protection, such as the classic bald-headed eagle, will be moved from the total-ban category to one of tightly controlled trade."
"It may be interpreted as an encouraging sign that the fact that it was an icon proved useful."
"Certain protected species have begun to recover."
"A sound basis on which to proceed is scientific evidence: the content of the appendices can be made more stringent or more relaxed if the scientific evidence suggests there is a need to make it so."
"The all-important issue is not strictness, but sustainable development."
"It is nevertheless important that it should be harder to relax the rules than tighten them up."
"The reason is that the stakes are very high indeed: we are gambling with nature, which will not be recovered if it is lost."
"For that reason it is vital that the precautionary principle is still cited as a basic tenet; this, despite the fact that, to the ears of many of my colleagues and associates, that phrase sounds flat and empty, as the use of the phrase ‘the precautionary principle’ has not always meant that the principle has been followed."
"Now, however, the phrase is apt."
"Although the scope of the CITES Convention is only restricted to trade, perhaps models for further international environmental agreements could also be found by analysing it."
"At the same time, we have to remember the concern raised in the resolution and focus more attention on the monitoring of implementation."
"The EU is unfortunately one of the largest markets for the illegal trade in wild animals and plants."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Mrs Doyle has just said when putting our written question to the Commission, this position statement affects not only the 25 Member States of the European Union, but is also a signal to the remainder of the 166 states that have signed up to CITES, known also as the Washington Agreement on the Protection of Species."
"That is what makes it important that we in this House should send out a clear signal."
"At present, the Agreement on the Protection of Species applies to some 30 000 species."
"We know that, beside the destruction of their habitats, international trade is the greatest threat to the survival of many endangered species."
"That is what makes CITES necessary, and that is why I have been heartened by many of the positions taken by the Commission, which, at the conference of states party to the Convention, is speaking out loud and clear in favour of strict restrictions on trade."
"Mrs Korhola said that she sees it as being very, very important that all decisions should be founded on the precautionary principle."
"Discussion of this oral question, and also of today’s resolution, has been dominated by two issues, one being the protection of minke whales and the other the trade in ivory."
"It is no secret that Japan wants to reintroduce commercial whaling and is working towards it."
"It did not manage to get its position accepted at the last meeting of the International Whaling Commission in July 2004."
"We call on the European Union and its Member States to reject Japan’s demand that three types of minke whales be transferred from Appendix I to Appendix II and hence also to unambiguously retain a higher standard of protection for the whales."
"This resolution constitutes a clear demonstration by this House that we welcome the call by Kenya and other African states for the introduction of a 20-year moratorium on trade in ivory."
"Between 1980 and 1989, the number of African elephants dropped dramatically, from 1.2 million to 600 000 and halved again by 2001 to 300 000, a rapid decline explained largely by the demand for ivory."
"The former system of quotas for ivory exports from specified countries did not work, as demand is so great that enormous quantities are smuggled out illegally."
"For consumers and for those who monitor the trade, the situation is highly confusing, but it is a very agreeable one for those who want to smuggle ivory illegally."
"Over and over again, ivory is seized at our European airports because the documentation does not conform to what is required under the Agreement on the Protection of Species."
"Supplying, with intent to deceive, false information on customs declarations and CITES approval forms is widespread in the illegal trade in wild animals."
"Yesterday, we also started considering the issue of African lions."
"My group wants item 7, as it stands in the resolution, to be retained."
"It is clear from the information we have about the threat to the African lion that there has been a dramatic reduction in their numbers over recent years, and so I am very glad to see the Commission take up a clear position on the subject."
"Mr President, as this will probably be the last time that I will speak in a debate on the environment to which Mrs Wallström will respond, I should like to thank her for her commitment and efforts over the past five years."
"I am glad she is not going to be leaving us."
"Faced with the enormity of problems concerning the environment, she once said that we cannot cry about everything all the time."
"That is very true, but, when we consider how we are diminishing life on this planet, it is certainly worth at least some tears."
"Virtually no animal on this planet can exist without the agreement of humans."
"We are the dominant species. If animals are to survive, they do so because we allow them to do so, because there is no economic incentive to kill them or because we actively want them to survive."
"In nearly all cases, habitats have to be managed and somehow protected."
"This is how mankind now manages the natural order."
"The pity is that we are terrible managers."
"We cannot see beyond the present: we think everything is still there for the taking and need not consider the consequences."
"We preside over one of the world's great periods of extinction."
"Within a generation we have wiped out a vast proportion of the animals of Africa and now we are doing the same to the seas."
"Shark numbers in many cases are said to have dropped by 90% since Spielberg's film 'Jaws' was released."
"The great white shark is the ocean's top predator, the lion of the seas."
"To lose a creature that has changed very little in tens of millions of years would not only be a tragedy but would further change the ecology of the waters, upsetting a balance already damaged by over-fishing and certainly entailing damaging consequences."
"Trade in its parts must be curtailed."
"However, the issue of land animals in Africa highlights the complexities involved in securing solutions."
"We know there has been a huge loss in elephant numbers, much of which is attributable to poaching."
"However, curtailing the ivory trade seems to have been successful in preventing a complete wipe-out."
"Yet the picture is mixed: elephant numbers are recovering in some areas, but this causes the destruction of the natural habitat."
"As the government of Botswana pointed out in a very well argued paper, numbers have to be managed if the competing demands of people, vegetation and habitats are to be met."
"In principle, I have no objection to increasing the trade in ivory selectively, provided that the money raised is for conservation purposes."
"For the same reasons I have no objection in principle to trophy hunting, although I cannot understand the mentality of rich people who want to kill great creatures."
"My concern is that the money will not be spent in this way and that the increase in the ivory trade will stimulate poaching everywhere, with catastrophic results."
"I hope Member States will stand firm and support a total ban, but they should also be realistic and accommodating."
"If we in Europe want to deny poor nations the right to sell harvested ivory legitimately and sustainably, should we not be contributing financially to meet our desires and their needs?"
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that we can congratulate ourselves today, as this House is putting forward a resolution supported by all political groups."
"I would very much like all Members to vote for it as it stands."
"Our message is of course also directed to the Council, which is not present, and this is a pity as it is the Council which will represent us in Bangkok. We are also inviting the Commission to comply with this resolution, which will reflect the voice of the peoples of Europe during the final votes in Bangkok."
"The resolution calls for better protection of endangered species, and follows on from the most forceful measures taken in the fight against the decline of wild fauna and flora."
"We are all aware, and it has already been noted by a number of Members, that all possible steps should be taken to support every initiative aimed at saving species which can still be saved, because nature continues to be destroyed at a breathtaking speed."
"Having followed the work carried out in this House on an action plan for biodiversity conservation and on the Convention on Biological Diversity, I can state that biodiversity obviously remains the poor relation among our environmental policies."
"I would even go so far as to say that this is undoubtedly the weak link of sustainable development."
"We are aware that, as the 25 Member States of the European Union, we are the largest consumers of wild species."
"Mrs Doyle has drawn up a list, and it is truly horrifying; millions of species are taken from their habitats around the world for our pleasure alone, not for our survival but for our pleasure alone."
"Legal trade in species is an enormous market."
"It is therefore easy to imagine the volume of illegal trade, and indeed some say that its value is equal to that of drug trafficking."
"This would explain the problems encountered in implementing more stringent protection measures for certain species."
"Be that as it may, we are calling unanimously for the precautionary principle to be adopted as a basic rule for all decisions taken in the framework of CITES."
"Let us take as an example the white shark, made famous by the film ‘Jaws’."
"This is a perfect illustration, as we are well aware of how difficult it is to carry out studies on this animal."
"Given that this species is endangered, we are therefore calling for a zero quota in the name of the precautionary principle, and this is why we continue to support this proposal."
"The 20-year moratorium on all ivory trading proposed by Kenya, and supported by 12 countries which are also home to a large number of African elephants, needs our support."
"As the world expert on elephants, Professor Pfeffer, has said for many years, legal trade in an endangered species has the immediate effect of reviving illegal trade in the species. We know that it is the survival of a species which is at stake, and the 12 African countries concerned have also realised this."
"As European countries, we should therefore support this position, and we must also support the transfer of the lion from Appendix 2 to Appendix 1."
"Why?"
"Because, Mr President, we, as Europeans, are going on holiday and hunting the male lion, which contributes to the destruction of this species on a global scale."
"It is for all these reasons that we should support these proposals, and I would ask you, Mr President, to allow me to say something on the issue of secrecy, which is an extremely important issue."
"We have discussed this issue in committee, and we cannot accept a vote by secret ballot when putting final resolutions to the vote."
"Such a practice would leave the door open to all kinds of bargaining, and out of respect for the Member States’ commitments and for our own principles, a transparent decision-making process should remain the golden rule in international conventions."
"Our group has also signed the motion for a resolution, and we think it is a very good resolution, all parts of which we support."
"I should, however, like the Commission to clarify the position to be adopted by the EU in these negotiations with regard to two points."
"The first concerns the issue of secret ballots."
"There is now a debate about not having open votes with due reporting of the way in which countries vote on a number of positions."
"I think that, if it is to be possible to demand political accountability, it is absolutely crucial that countries be answerable for the way in which they vote on this convention."
"Can we rely upon the EU doing everything in its power to oppose the holding of secret ballots in these votes? That is my first question."
"My second question is a special one concerning the protection of the great white shark."
"On this issue, there appears to be a consensus to the effect that a higher level of protection is required, but I believe that, given the uncertainties that exist concerning what stocks remain, the demand for a zero quota for export is extremely sensible on the grounds of the precautionary principle."
"I wonder if we can rely upon the EU also supporting the demand for a zero quota for export."
"– Mr President, I wholeheartedly endorse this resolution."
"Our primary goal is the conservation of nature, which in the first place means protection of the environment, in other words, the maintenance of the ecological balance."
"Secondarily, it means protecting the diversity of species, which is precious and at risk."
"Thirdly, it means protecting animals, both as regards the trade in them, the protection of their natural habitats, and, of course, the ways in which people keep animals."
"For that reason, I believe that we have to take a very nuanced approach to the trade in animals, as Mr Davies, for one, has done."
"There must of course be restrictions to prevent the extermination of endangered animal species, but there are species that would have disappeared without the trade in animals, without their being bred in zoos, and that would have disappeared had they not been preserved for future generations outside their original areas, which have been ravaged by such things as war, civil strife and natural disasters."
"So let me make it abundantly clear that I am in favour of this resolution, whilst believing that this is where we must not throw the baby out with the bathwater;"
"I believe it to be obvious and reasonable that the trade in animals should continue to be engaged in within certain tight and restrictive parameters."
"Our zoos are doing great things; our geozoo in Munich, for example, has bred very valuable species that would otherwise have disappeared from the face of the earth."
"For that reason, it is crucial that we take a measured approach to this."
"When it comes, though, to such things as elephants and the trade in ivory, or the trade in rhinoceros horn and much else, that is where we have to take very tough action; on that I agree absolutely with my fellow Members."
"As Mrs Isler Béguin said, it is of course the case that it is in these areas that massive profits are to be made, illegally and with relatively little effort, on the black market."
"This is where much more use must be made of Europol."
"Mr President, I am a little surprised that we are to debate lion hunting in this Parliament."
"That is not something I ever thought would happen to me in an assembly with which I would otherwise have thought I was more or less in agreement. Lion hunting was, in fact, what was wanted, as a split vote was requested, and we are in actual fact still short of an explanation from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats as to its wishes in connection with a species 90% of which has disappeared over the last decade."
"A second, and probably just as important, question is one to the Commission as to why it has gone easy on the demand for the protection of freshwater turtles."
"The IUCN regards them as threatened, but millions of them are killed each year."
"They are used for food and for natural medicine, and this, of course, quite obviously threatens these species’ long-term prospects for survival. If I have been informed correctly, there is nonetheless a proposal by the Commission that nothing special should be done to have them protected, and that is a matter in connection with which we should basically very much like an answer."
"Mr President, I would like to say to the Commission and Parliament that I fully support what CITES is doing."
"However, I question why the CITES conference is to be held in Bangkok."
"In Thailand there is still a lot of illegal trading in orang-utans, monkeys and leopards."
"So if the conference is to be held there, we need to question the Thai Government about this problem."
"I have seen examples of 50 illegally imported young orang-utans found hidden in cramped cages in private Thai zoos."
"In my constituency there is an organisation called Monkey World Ape Rescue Centre which wants to get a particular chimpanzee called Naree out of Thailand, but the Thai Government has not been helpful in this regard."
"If the conference is held in Thailand, it is very important for both this Parliament and the Commission to raise these issues with the Thai Government."
"We cannot allow this to happen."
"We have to highlight it."
"This is an opportunity to do so."
"While I welcome CITES and everything it is trying to do, the fact that the conference is to be held in Thailand will give us an opportunity to raise these issues with the Thai Government, so as to help stop such things happening."
"Otherwise this trade might seem to be acceptable because the CITES conference is being held there."
". Mr President, I wish to thank the honourable Members for the debate and Mr Davies, in particular, for his kind words in favour of the conservation of the rare species of Swedish Commissioners!"
"I will comment briefly on some of the questions raised."
"Firstly, on the issue of enforcement and information exchange, last week Member States agreed to step up activities in this area."
"I should like to tell Mr Sjöstedt that we are totally against secret ballots and I can confirm that we will vote against that."
"Mrs Auken mentioned sea turtles."
"The Convention accords the strictest protection to sea turtles and we support the proposed protection for fresh–water turtles as well."
"The location was decided at the last conference and it will not be changed now."
"On the great white shark, Madagascar and Australia have informed us that, in the light of widespread legal and scientific objections, they have amended their proposal, removing the demand for the zero quota."
"We can now give this proposal our unqualified support."
"Finally, we welcome Parliament's initiative in bringing forward this resolution."
"We are pleased that so many of the views expressed on issues such as bush meat, Napoleon fish, minke whale and ramin, are in accordance with the Community consensus."
"Ideally, we would have preferred to see a resolution that balances the need for greater protection of some species with the sometimes conflicting considerations of promoting sustainable use and, above all, respecting the scientific integrity of the Convention."
"This would be in the best interests of CITES and of nature conservation in general."
"Nevertheless, I am pleased that Parliament has prepared a resolution in such a short time and I thank you for the debate."
"I thank the Commissioner and, on behalf of all my fellow Members, I think I can express our universal appreciation of the species of Swedish European Commissioners, who we do not think need specific protection since it is not an endangered species."
"At the end of the debate, I received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 108(5).(1)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"(1)"
"(2)"
"Mr President, I propose adding the following to the end of paragraph 8:"
"... and to ensure that any such sanctions do not add to the suffering of the population of Sudan.'"
". – Are there any objections to this oral amendment being included?"
"(3)"
"I can confirm what Mr Salafranca has just said; the text which has been tabled is the one which Mr Salafranca has just read out."
"A mistake has therefore been made by the services concerned."
"I see that other Members have asked to speak."
"I cannot see any problem with including what you say."
"Mr President, I was referring precisely to the request to repatriate the body of Italian journalist Enzo Baldoni, provided for in the motion for a resolution."
"From what you said, you appear to me to understand that it is unnecessary to table an oral amendment."
"Since three other people have been abducted this morning, however, I feel that the text should be brought up to date with today’s events."
"I would therefore like to request the floor to table an oral amendment in this regard, before we vote on paragraph two."
"You will be able to speak when the time comes, Mr Tajani."
"I have made a note of this."
"Mr President, all the points raised by Mr Salafranca are correct."
"However, I would like to add another point."
"Paragraph three has been submitted in a previous version, whereas it should be replaced with the following wording: ‘asks the Council Presidency, the High Representative and the Commission to support the initiatives which the interested Member States are taking in this regard’."
"Paragraph three must therefore be amended as well."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I understand that it is annoying, but I assure you that we tabled the correct version of the text."
"I know that Mr Tajani will ask to table an oral amendment and I can already foresee that we will agree."
"– There is no problem."
"A few minor errors have been made, but the texts tabled by the different authors, and these texts alone, are the original versions."
"I can provide full reassurance on this point."
"We can now move on to considering the motion for a resolution."
"Mr President, I should like to ask whether paragraph 1, upon which we are about to vote, was originally tabled in English."
"The French and English versions differ, and I presume that the text should be based on the English original, which says ‘the determination of the Iraqi Government’, and not, as in the French version, ‘the determination of the legitimate Iraqi Government’."
"– I have been told that the resolution was indeed tabled in English, so it is the English text which is the original version."
"All the other language versions will be brought into line and your request will be complied with."
"Mr President, as the Members of this House know, this morning in Baghdad three people were abducted from their home, two of whom are US citizens and one a European citizen of British origin."
"I propose to the House an oral amendment to paragraph 2 to add, after the reference to the Italian humanitarian workers, Simona Torretta and Simona Pari, the words ‘and the British citizen’ – followed by his full name – so that the European Parliament can issue a timely call for the release of this other citizen of our Union and guarantee him the support of all the political forces represented within it."
"– Are there any objections to this oral amendment being included?"
"Mr President, an issue has arisen overnight concerning paragraph 5 of our resolution."
"The original paragraph 5 referred to an 'Australian proposal to list the Great White Shark in CITES Appendix II with a zero quota'."
"That was correct on going to print, when all the Groups in this House agreed to the resolution."
"However, the Australians have now withdrawn the reference to a zero quota on legal and scientific grounds, as I mentioned when I moved the question and as the Commissioner has confirmed."
"It would be very untidy of us as a parliament to vote on a contradictory text in light of this most recent information."
"We should not be supporting a reference to a zero quota, which is no longer the Australian position."
"May I remind colleagues who support the zero quota – and I know many do – that withdrawal of this section of paragraph 5 today, that is, all the words after 'Appendix II', would not preclude another party to the conference re-tabling the zero quota request, if they wished to do so."
"I feel we cannot welcome an Australian proposal which is no longer an Australian proposal on this particular issue."
"However, we can welcome the first sentence 'to list the Great White Shark in CITES Appendix II'."
"I need your guidance, as I know it is late procedurally, Mr President, but we need to be sure that what we do and vote on today makes sense and is factually correct."
"Mrs Doyle, I must consider your intervention to be an oral amendment."
"In order to make it clear to the other Members, could you please state very clearly the text you wish to put to the vote?"
"Mr President, my point is purely procedural."
"I am not making any statement in relation to zero quotas or otherwise."
"I would like to amend paragraph 5 of our text: 'welcomes the Australian proposal to list the great white shark in CITES Appendix II'."
"The rest of the text would have to be deleted because the Australians have removed it from their proposal, although that will not preclude others retabling it at the Conference of the Parties, if necessary."
"– That is clear."
"Are there any objections to this oral amendment being included?"
"We do not consider this report to be an issue for the European Parliament and have therefore chosen to abstain in the vote."
"The NATO and EU war against Yugoslavia was unjust and offensive and violated international law and the founding principles of the UN."
"It resulted in the death of thousands of innocent people, tremendous damage and the imposition of occupation on Kosovo and was the climax of the break-up of Yugoslavia and the imperialist intervention in the Balkans."
"Those who should be tried for crimes against humanity are the leaders of NATO who attacked an independent member of the UN."
"The Council regulation brought before the European Parliament for voting today is part of the effort to legalise this American-inspired 'court', which is a parody, as proven by the constant infringements of Milosevic's rights."
"It is clear as the case proceeds that foregone conclusions riddled with holes have been reached in a bid to conceal and expiate the real culprits."
"The rulings by what is referred to as the 'International Criminal Tribunal' are not accepted by the people, who alone have the authority to judge their leaders and sentence any defendants."
"This parody must be stopped, the so-called court disbanded and Slobodan Milosevic freed."
"I voted in favour of Parliament’s draft resolution on the proposal for a Council regulation imposing certain restrictive measures in support of effective implementation of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), because this is a matter of adopting measures relating to defendants who have yet to be captured and who continue to escape justice. These measures are specifically intended to prevent them from travelling and from using their own personal effects."
"My vote in favour is also based on the fact that it is a joint action between the United Nations and EU Member States, by means of applying the specific Treaty provision."
". British Conservatives recognise that climate change is one of the greatest challenges to be faced by our generation and those that will follow us."
"Whilst we cannot predict with certainty the extent to which temperatures will rise, we can be certain that the risk of abrupt climate change exists."
"If we are serious about tackling man-made climate change then we must be serious about reducing global aviation emissions, which are expected to double by 2020."
"That is why we support action to include aviation in a global emissions trading scheme."
"If the global authorities will not act, then the EU must be free to introduce its own scheme."
"We have severe reservations as to the effectiveness of fuel and emissions taxes."
"These would have a negligible effect on demand for most air travel, but would have a disproportionate effect on the budget airline sector."
"It is unlikely that the proceeds of such taxes would be used to mitigate the effect of the emissions, leaving such schemes as nothing more than revenue-raising exercises."
"Nor do we believe that the Commission needs a seat on the ICAO Assembly."
". The coordinator of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Georg Jarzembowski, makes the following statement, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, in relation to the meeting of the ICAO:"
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will abstain in the vote on the joint resolution, as the resolution’s demands are too indiscriminate and as the pressure of time has prevented a nuanced debate, such as these matters require, on these demands with the Member States represented at the ICAO and with the industry and consumers affected."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is firmly of the opinion that further steps to reduce damage to the environment, including that caused by air transport, are necessary at both global and European level."
"At the same time, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats takes the view that the potential side effects of such steps must be carefully discussed with the industry and consumers concerned."
"It will also be necessary to take into account the extremely grave economic damage already sustained by European airlines as a consequence of the events of ‘9/11’ and the drastic rise in the price of oil."
"Hasty reactions by Parliament do not do justice to the seriousness of these issues."
". Aviation has long been a privileged industry."
"Old international agreements prevent the taxes imposed on transport on the ground from being levied on aviation."
"At the time, that was a way of affording a new, up-and-coming, yet economically still weak form of international transport a chance of survival."
"Since then, this situation has been turned on its head."
"Air traffic is growing exponentially, the old airline companies are being elbowed out by cut-price operators, noise pollution is making those living in the vicinity of the ever growing airports ill, global warming is continuing and international rail traffic is being competed out of the market."
"Society must now be protected against this increasing growth in aviation, and this will certainly not happen as long as aviation retains an artificial competitive edge."
"In order to limit the environmental damage, to pay for the costs of pollution caused by aviation and protect other modes of transport, normal taxes should be imposed on air traffic."
"That is why any decision taken at world level and leading to the maintenance of the ban on taxes or prejudicing the reduction in pollution is unacceptable."
"It is astonishing that, on 1 September in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, the largest group opposed, as it is doing now, a resolution intended to put a stop to the United States’ attempts at giving aviation permanently preferential treatment."
"I abstained on the motion for a European Parliament resolution on the 35th session of the International Civil Aviation Authority (ICAO) Assembly of 28 September to 8 October 2004. By voting this way, I wished to express my opinion that Parliament must not meddle in the affairs of the ICAO Assembly before the session gets underway and, what is more, must not adopt positions on matters that, as far as I can tell, are simply proposals for amending a resolution that is to be debated at that Assembly."
"In spite of the fact that this issue is worthy of our attention, the actual text approved by a majority in Parliament provides the basis for our position, given that it acknowledges (No 3) that the Commission should have a seat at the ICAO Assembly."
"In any event, if it does not have that seat, Parliament has no reason to meddle in this matter."
". I share the environmental concerns of those tabling the motion for a resolution."
"I feel that the EU’s relevant institutions should launch an environmental impact study on civil aviation and look into ways in which it can be reduced."
"Nonetheless, I had to abstain."
"The hasty manner in which the resolution has been tabled removes objectivity from an issue that, in view of its seriousness and its importance to the ordinary citizen, requires close scrutiny by, among others, the transport and environment committees."
". – In the run-up to the elections and the referendum, the European Parliament is passing a resolution which is a continuation of the pressure on and coercion of the Government of Belarus and which, unfortunately, is endorsed by all the political groups."
"What touches the selective sensibilities of the ΕU, which interprets existent and non-existent infringements of human rights as it pleases, is that Belarus has not come running on bended knee to ΝΑΤΟ, the ΕU or the other imperialist organisations and refuses to sell off its wealth-producing resources to European and American monopolies."
"Why has the European Parliament not turned its attention to rising fascism in the Baltic States, as Belarus did when it tabled a resolution on the subject before the UN?"
"Why does it maintain absolute silence and not denounce the governments of Member States of the ΕU, the USA, Australia, Japan and so on who voted against it?"
"The people of Belarus alone have the authority to decide on their future."
"Resolutions such as this are underhand and are designed to mislead and confuse the workers and interfere in the internal affairs of Belarus in order to alter the political will of its people."
"That is why we are voting against the resolution."
". I voted in favour of Parliament’s resolution on the situation in Belarus, although I feel that in resolutions such as these there is always a thin line between, on the one hand, the need – the legitimate need – to put international pressure on States and governments that violate democratic principles and the rule of law, and, on the other, interference in a country’s internal affairs, which is a much more delicate issue."
"In view of the fact that Belarus is covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy, which is aimed at increased cooperation with the EU and that serious breaches have taken place of the rights, freedoms and safeguards that are an integral part of the democratic rule of law, the EU and, more specifically, Parliament – in conjunction with the United Nations Committee on Human Rights – must take initiatives such as this one that are geared towards encouraging democratic progress in Belarus and free and fair elections on 17 October."
". As the date of parliamentary elections in Belarus approaches, indications are growing that there has been an alarming rise in the illegal repression and restriction of rights, freedoms and safeguards in that country."
"The referendum on the Constitution scheduled for the same date, which seeks to repeal the article limiting the number of consecutive presidential terms, has taken on worrying plebiscite characteristics."
"Since Parliament naturally advocates strengthening stability, freedom and security in the country, it has been paying careful attention to political developments in Belarus."
"The EU must not let this attention waver and must keep up the pressure on the Belarus authorities to encourage real change that goes beyond mere legal formality and that real changes are made that improve people’s standard of living, effectively promote democracy and enable the citizens to enjoy full political self-determination."
"I voted in favour."
". I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution further to the Council and Commission statements pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure on behalf of the Committee on Development on the Darfur region in the Sudan, and the reports presented to us by the Members of this House who were in Parliament’s delegation to the region between 2 and 7 September."
"Accordingly, whatever the reasons behind the genuine ethnic cleansing that is taking place in Darfur, we have an obligation to condemn acts against civilians that have already led to over 30 000 dead, 1 million persons displaced in Sudan and more than 200 000 refugees in Chad."
"We must also condemn the Sudanese Government politically, not only for supporting attacks on civilians and violating the ceasefire agreement, but also for pursuing a policy of underdevelopment and economic marginalisation in the areas affected by the conflict."
"This is what I wished to express through my vote."
". I have followed the news from Darfur with great concern."
"I feel that this is an opportunity for Parliament to set an example and to demand that the EU’s other institutions follow suit by keeping up their condemnation of the atrocities and seeking solutions to the conflict."
"We must be unequivocal in our condemnation of these outrages and must ensure that the mobilisation of peacekeeping resources goes beyond mere rhetoric. We must not let up in the efforts already under way, which have already begun to achieve such good results."
"As in Bosnia, Rwanda and Burundi, and many others, it is difficult to conceive of the whole drama of yet more mass deaths, not to mention genocide, which we invariably say will be the last."
"The EU must, in my view, maintain the pressure on the Sudanese Government and on those responsible for the conflict, to ensure that the ceasefire, signed as a result of that pressure, is strictly observed."
"The EU, which claims to be a global player, has a golden opportunity to ensure that people do not forget what is happening in Darfur and that those responsible do not go unpunished."
"Apart from Amendment No 12, I voted in favour of the amendments, which have improved upon the Committee on Development’s initial proposal."
"Mr President, last night I fell asleep thinking about the explanation of vote on Iraq and I found myself in the midst of the damned in hell, among whom I spotted Bin Laden, with his beard burning constantly, as in Dante’s inferno."
"In the dream I asked him: ‘Why did you hate us Europeans and Americans so much?’"
"Bin Laden, his beard still burning, replied: ‘I was very ill and I asked the social security authorities in Saudi Arabia for an invalidity pension, but they didn’t give it to me."
"That is why I was so angry with the whole world.’"
"Well then, let us give this invalidity pension to Bin Laden, so at least he will leave us all in peace and tranquillity!"
"Mr President, the Lega Nord delegation’s abstention on the motion for a resolution on Iraq is clearly connected to its wish to express, as we already have done at every stage, our complete solidarity with the two peace and voluntary humanitarian workers, so sadly caught up in the tragedy in Iraq."
"We would, however, like to distance ourselves from the underestimation of the risks run by the free world in taking as true the false and hypocritical humanitarian declarations of support from spurious moderate Islam."
"It is pitiful to see Europe and the West believe the words of those who arm terrorists, who finance terrorist networks and who today say they support the release of the hostages."
"Europe and the West must maintain a clear and firm policy of condemnation and refusal to collaborate with those who encourage terrorist networks."
"We Swedish Social Democrats have decided to abstain from voting on a number of amendments."
"The purpose of this is to ensure that there is a common and vigorous resolution by the European Parliament."
". I support this resolution on Iraq, the primary purpose of which is to voice our concerns for the welfare of hostages and to demand that everything possible be done to secure their early release."
"I deplore the fact that the resolution does not reflect the concerns of our citizens at the unlawful killing of Iraqis by the occupation forces."
"It does not address the question of how the current situation in Iraq evolved over the last two years and therefore fails to criticise the Bush Administration's defiance of the UN in its rush to invade Iraq."
"UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has correctly described that invasion as an illegal act contravening the UN Charter."
"That question cannot be shelved. Therefore, it is particularly important that the Committee on Foreign Affairs urgently draw up, as recommended, a comprehensive report on the situation in Iraq, taking into account the consequences of the war and all problems relating to the withdrawal of the illegally occupying forces, rehabilitation, reconstruction and stabilisation in that country."
". I totally support the European Parliament in condemning in the strongest terms the abductions of hostages in Iraq and in demanding their immediate release."
"I support paragraphs 2 and 3 of the resolution to this effect."
"However, I cannot vote for this joint resolution as a whole as it seeks to justify the illegal and unjust war and the occupation of Iraq."
". The destruction of the Baath regime, the only secular political force in Iraq, was a criminal mistake."
"Today Iraq is in the hands of small and uncontrolled Islamic groups."
"Since Georges Malbrunot and Christian Chesnot were taken hostage, France has also been dragged into the quagmire in Iraq."
"The kidnappers of the French hostages are not demanding the withdrawal of troops, because the French Government refused to take part in the war."
"The terrorists, who belong to the ‘Islamic Army in Iraq’, want more."
"By ordering France to reconsider one of its laws, they are demanding that our country relinquish the free exercise of its sovereignty."
"This demand has been made because they believe that our country, which is home to six million Muslims, should subjugate its laws to those of the Sharia."
"This is the result of 40 years of massive and uncontrolled immigration."
"The negotiations conducted by members of the French Council for the Muslim Faith with Iraqi Islamic leaders, which have been given extensive media coverage, are further proof of this process of dhimmitude."
"Mr Chirac and Mr Raffarin, who refuse to recognise France’s Christian roots under the pretext of secularism, have sent members of Islamic associations to act as ambassadors."
"Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot are victims of a different hostage taking; that of France by its immigration policy."
". The European Parliamentary Labour Party welcomes this resolution, in particular its emphasis on maximising the European Union's involvement and in seeking the unconditional, safe return of French, Italian and other hostages."
"We accept the gravity of the security situation in Iraq but believe it unhelpful to use the wording 'a majority of the Iraqi population' in Amendment 1."
"A transfer of coalition troops or, indeed, a complete withdrawal is unrealistic and risks worsening an already bad situation."
"Whilst we accept that the House is divided on the legal questions, we appeal for unity in looking forward, not back, working together for peace, reconciliation and reconstruction in a democratic Iraq."
". At the beginning of 2003, a majority in this Parliament was opposed to the plan for a pre-emptive war in Iraq."
"Meanwhile, it has been proven that the argument for this war, the possession of weapons of mass destruction by Saddam Hussein’s regime, was unfounded."
"Thanks to the intervention by the United States and its allies in Europe, Iraq has been turned into a breeding ground for fundamentalist Islamic resistance."
"There is now an overriding fear among politicians in Europe of the effects of the occupying forces withdrawing their troops."
"With or without immediate withdrawal, it is becoming urgent for Europe to disassociate from the American positions in Iraq."
"The United States is looking for oil, orders for US companies and the replacement of the euro by dollars for international contracts."
"It is failing to restore power stations, water purification plants, schools and hospitals."
"Europe can take over this civil task and contribute to free elections by giving others, other than the conservative-religious forces and US satellites, a fair chance, such as the communists and the Kurdish parties in the north."
"As long as there are European forces, it should be clear that they limit their mandate to this, and will leave as soon as the Iraqi population asks them to."
"Whilst I object to a resolution which does not call for this, I obviously support the release of hostages, even if the chance of this happening is slim for as long as we cannot offer the Iraqi people any prospect for improvement."
". – We denounce this joint motion, which is a provocation to people the world over who are against the unjust imperialist war in Iraq and are fighting for peace."
"The political powers which endorse the resolution accept and support the occupying forces of Iraq, fighting and are cooperating with the occupying government and call the resistance of the Iraqi people to the occupying forces and the collaborationist government terrorism."
"The European Parliament is turning into a 'crime laundry', confirming the imperialist nature of the ΕU and its identification with the USA."
"On the pretext of freeing hostages, with references to a so-called democratic, independent Iraq, it is helping to create the conditions needed in order for the EU to qualify for a share of the imperialist spoils and in order to secure the interests of big business in the wider area, control wealth-producing resources and oil routes and exploit the people."
"The only people with the authority to resolve the political problem are the Iraqis themselves."
"The people, and the people of Europe, are demanding the immediate withdrawal of all the occupying forces, which must compensate the Iraqi people for their crimes and for the destruction which they have caused."
"The powers which endorse the resolution have opposed the general demand by voting down the amendment calling for the withdrawal of foreign forces and again supporting the war."
"I voted in favour of Parliament’s resolution on Iraq, because I feel that Europe should set a firm example in condemning terrorist attacks against civilians, the police, soldiers from the multinational force and civilian hostages. Parliament must use all of its political influence and weight to obtain the hostages’ immediate release."
"We must also support the interim government’s plans to press ahead with preparations for free and democratic elections in January 2005, which will enable Iraqis to proceed along the road towards democracy and towards dismantling the terrorist networks operating in their country."
"Parliament must, therefore, not waver in the face of the complex nature of these times. We must remain firm within our societies, our alliances must remain solid and loyal and, most importantly, our actions must form part of a concerted struggle for the peace, stability and prosperity to which Iraq and the Iraqi people are unquestionably entitled."
"."
"This is an enormously significant resolution, which has marked out clear boundaries."
"The joint motion demonstrates a consensus between the right and the social democrats, which cannot go unmentioned."
"On what is this consensus based? It is based on acknowledging the Iraqi people’s resistance to terrorism (which exists, which we condemn, but which is not exclusive ... of others)."
"It is based on transforming the dramatic situation of the victims and the journalists and volunteers who have lost their lives or have been taken hostage and not as a consequence of the invasion and the occupation. It is based on attempting to bring under the UN umbrella, in the near future, something that was done on the margins and against the UN and international law."
"The amendments tabled by the Green Group would widen the consensus to the point where we would be the only ones on the outside, and the fact that amendments tabled by our group were not approved appear to provide further evidence that we would be isolated on this crucial question."
"We do not feel that we are so isolated."
"We know that we are with those who reject the illegal and unjust nature of the war, the invasion and the occupation that were perpetrated. We are with those who resist and with those who demand the immediate withdrawal of occupying forces."
"Similarly, it is the people who are against war and in favour of peace that are with us."
". I have been following the developments in Iraq with alarm and, specifically, the difficulties experienced in stabilising the country democratically following the fall of Saddam Hussein’s dictatorial regime."
"The frequent hostage taking and murder of Iraqis and foreigners, which presents a challenge to the international community and to the Iraqi Interim Government, cruelly reflects how much remains to be done in the country."
"The European Union must bring to bear its experience in helping transitional situations and humanitarian emergencies, and must continue to support efforts towards transition, which will hopefully bring to a conclusion the ongoing process of returning self-determination to the Iraqi people and of the emergence of democracy in Iraq."
"The additional contribution proposed by the Commission, which I welcome, is a sign of this commitment."
"I regret that the UN has not yet managed to take on all of its functions in Iraq and I hope that the Security Council continues to support the Interim Government, which it has already underlined by formally recognising its sovereign status."
"I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution, which I feel is well balanced."
"I regret the amendments tabled by the Communists and by the Greens, which are tantamount to demagogy and to a lack of understanding of the situation."
"Fortunately they were rejected."
". I fully support this resolution, which calls for the use of the precautionary principle as the leading principle for decisions on CITES working documents and listing proposals."
"History has shown that large-scale commercial hunting and sale of wild animals frequently pushes species to the brink of extinction."
"The trade in wild animal meat for human consumption is just one part of a wildlife trade which includes ivory, fur and the trade in certain animal body parts – a trade which threatens biodiversity and the ecological balance of areas such as Central and West Africa."
"It is clear that there is a close link between poverty, economic and social development, and bush meat consumption."
"That is why the issue must be addressed in the context of overall development strategy and poverty alleviation."
"At a national level, EU governments must ensure that their development aid policies are ‘conservation-audited’ to support biodiversity and habitat retention."
". Wildlife preservation has been attracting the attention of the EU and, more specifically, Parliament."
"The Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is the main legal instrument in the world for defending and protecting wild fauna and flora."
"There is a greater need today for Member States to work together and exchange information, in order, among other things, to confront the international crime that feeds this trade."
"Externally, I feel that the EU could have an important role to play in establishing means of stable cooperation with third countries, by seeking to develop initiatives aimed at protecting endangered species and encouraging biodiversity."
"I voted in favour."
". – We are voting against the resolution on the situation in Vojvodina, which we see as an attempt to create particularly dangerous conditions in order to pave the way for further gratuitous imperialist intervention in the long-suffering area of the Balkans."
"The increase in the number of clashes and the grave-robbing and racist graffiti, which we denounce whatever their origin, are becoming the pretext for launching accusations and open threats in Serbia-Montenegro and for creating a climate of escalation."
"The decisions about EU peace missions in the area are the climax so far of interventionist action by the EU in Vojvodina and constitute a direct threat of possible military intervention due to the presence of EU military forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the FYROM and the presence of occupying forces in Kosovo."
"We cannot tolerate and we denounce both the efforts to mislead public opinion, as some would wish, and the EU's blatant intention to confirm the threatening and aggressive role of the European army once again in Vojvodina."
". – That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(4)"
"The next item is the topical and urgent debate."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following five motions for resolutions presented by:"
"– Glenys Kinnock, Mauro Zani and Margrietus J. van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in Myanmar/ASEM (B6-0046/2004);"
"– Vittorio Emanuele Agnoletto, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on Myanmar and the forthcoming ASEM Summit (B6-0048/2004);"
"– Nirj Deva, Bernd Posselt, Charles Tannock and Geoffrey Van Orden, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the ASEM Summit (Asia-Europe Meeting) (B6-0056/2004);"
"– Johan Van Hecke, on behalf of the ALDE/ADLE Group, on Myanmar (ASEM Summit) (B6-0059/2004);"
"– Frithjof Schmidt, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Myanmar and the ASEM Summit (B6-0061/2004)."
"Mr President, we in the PSE Group attach great importance to relations between the European Union and the countries of Asia."
"There are economic and commercial reasons for this, but there is also the essential need for political cooperation in order to create a world order of peace and stability."
"It is essential that our Asian partners see us as an economic, industrial, scientific and cultural power, but also that they appreciate our process of continental integration and the democratic values and solidarity on which this process is based."
"We are concerned about the announcement that the Government of Myanmar has been invited to the Asia-Europe Summit to be held in Hanoi."
"We do not believe this invitation to be appropriate."
"The European Union must continue to isolate the Rangoon regime, making clear to its neighbours that we condemn it as one of the most horrendous regimes in Asia and in the whole world."
"The military dictatorship established by General Ne Win has been perpetuated by his successors, suffocating the libertarian efforts of Burmese democrats through suffering and terror."
"For those of us who know and love Burma, the sadness and indignation is all the greater since we know that it was once, with social democratic inspired governments, an example of openness, freedom and democracy, tolerance, co-existence and integration of numerous ethnic groups and, what is more, of social progress."
"All of this was destroyed by the perpetrators of the military coup, the creators of a totalitarian and corrupt regime which has left its country in ruins, its leaders growing rich while its citizens live in misery and turning Myanmar into a significant player in the international drugs trade."
"The European Union must contribute to marginalising that regime, demanding freedom for Aung San Suu Kyi and other prisoners of conscience, and the participation of political parties in any democratically oriented process."
"However much Rangoon tries to cover it up, that is the situation in Myanmar, where totalitarianism, corruption and the abuse of those people we could once trust to promote openness continue to reign."
"By excluding that regime from the Hanoi Summit, the European Union will be doing what is right, but furthermore our determination and consistency will consolidate our credibility in the eyes of our Asian partners and certainly in the eyes of the people of Myanmar."
"Mr President, I just wanted to ask whether we were going to benefit from the presence of the presidency of the Council this afternoon, because the remarks that I want to make – and which I am sure many of my colleagues will be making – are in fact directed at the Council."
"It is a great shame that the Council is not here."
"Could you answer that before I make my other remarks?"
"Mr Van Orden, the representation of the Council is decided by the Council and you can see it here."
"It is perhaps not very extensive, but it is what the Council has decided and Parliament cannot therefore tell the Council how it should be represented in the House’s sittings, although your comment is undoubtedly very valid."
"Mr President, this is the fourth resolution that I have tabled on Burma in the last 18 months, but the situation continues to deteriorate and the Council's reaction is pusillanimous."
"The Burmese military dictatorship is now in its 43rd year of illegitimate rule."
"It is 15 years since Aung San Suu Kyi was first put under house arrest and 14 years since the SPDC decided to disregard the will of the Burmese people as expressed in the 1990 elections."
"In spite of this, the Council's message that is now being sent to the Burmese dictatorship is that it is an acceptable and welcome member of the international community, irrespective of its oppressive activities."
"In 1997 Burma's entry into ASEAN was heralded as a means to exert pressure on the regime."
"All we have heard from ASEAN is mild rebuke."
"The Burmese dictatorship ignored this and nothing more has happened."
"Six years after Burma joined ASEAN, oppression in the country has intensified and any return to democratic rule remains a distant prospect."
"This October ASEAN intends to include Burma at the ASEM V summit in Hanoi."
"I am the first to understand that Europe's relationship with ASEAN is widely based and most important."
"It should not be hostage to Burma, but that is what the ASEAN states are allowing to happen."
"The Asian governments must realise that they may be sacrificing a rewarding partnership with the European Union for the sake of a morally bankrupt regime in Burma."
"We must demand Burma's exclusion from ASEM until it complies with the demands of the international community."
"I am sorry to say that there are some similarities with the situation concerning Zimbabwe."
"There again we have an atrocious regime, which in many respects is even more abusive to its people than the Burma dictatorship."
"There again we have had half-hearted sanctions by the EU going through the motions of taking action, but in effect allowing the regime off the hook because of the self-interested agenda of one or two of our Member States."
"There again neighbouring states have the key to change, but for their own misguided reasons refused to turn it."
"The EU does not put pressure on them."
"We need the ASEAN states to insist on the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi and on freedom for the NLD opposition."
"The EU Foreign Ministers must demand that they do this before Burma is allowed to sit down with them in Hanoi."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in Myanmar, a country that lives under a repressive, violent and enormously cruel regime, is known to us all."
"Even so, whereas incidents concerning the incarceration of Aung San Suu Kyi and the impossibility for the LND, the party which won the elections, to exert its political power are well known, less well known are other extremely serious facts concerning the conscription of child soldiers, the forced labour of a large part of the population and, something which the women in our Parliament, and I believe all civilised people, appreciate as particularly sensitive, the abuse inflicted upon women from ethnic minorities."
"There is substantial documentation at the United Nations which I think should also be examined more thoroughly by this Parliament."
"In this situation, we feel that the EU should accept the request of the ASEAN countries, which have already admitted Myanmar to their forum, to have it attend the next ASEM summit, which sees the European Union engaged in a dialogue of cooperation and political exchange with Asian countries."
"I think that the Foreign Ministers, at an informal meeting, have unexpectedly – if I may say so – already gestured their agreement that it should attend."
"I think that the European Council must adopt a different stance to resolve a situation whereby European citizens cannot see their Heads of State or Government sitting side by side with the representatives of such a bloodthirsty country, with such a violent and repressive regime."
"We therefore ask the European Council to adopt a different position which, through the ASEAN countries, can convince Myanmar to bring about change."
"– Mr President, the Burmese people’s struggle for democracy has been a long one; there was a ray of hope in 1990, when the National League of Democracy, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her work for non-violent change, won the elections with 82% of the votes, but, since then, the country has been ruled by a savage military dictatorship, which has placed her under house arrest and harassed her; there are over 1 000 political prisoners."
"Organisations tell us that, for example, the armed forces have also started using systematic rape as a weapon against ethnic minorities."
"There is widespread violation of human rights."
"From that time onwards, the military dictatorship has been repeatedly denounced by international institutions, the European Parliament and the Council among them, and their constant demands have been threefold: freedom for the NLD to engage in political activity, freedom for Aung San Suu Kyi and the initiation of political dialogue aimed at advancing the country’s democratisation process."
"It was a major breakthrough when, at the 2004 ASEM Summit in Kildare, the Asian states supported these demands as the minimum requirement before Burma would be able to take part in future ASEM summits."
"We can see, then, that there is a broad consensus in the international community that these conditions must be fulfilled, and it is one that this House has repeatedly underlined."
"It is therefore quite incomprehensible and utterly deplorable that the foreign ministers of the European Union have now taken the decision simply to abandon the criteria and political conditions that they themselves imposed and agree to Burma’s participation in ASEM summits without their being complied with."
"Nor is there any reason to suppose that conditions in Burma have changed for the better, or anything like that, in recent months – quite the contrary is the case."
"Such an about-turn is quite incomprehensible and threatens to damage the credibility of European policy, for why, now, should anyone take our resolutions seriously?"
"Who is going to take the resolutions of the Council of Foreign Ministers seriously when they have spent ten years saying, ‘this is the condition that must be met before you can take part’, and then, when the situation presents itself, say, ‘we didn’t mean it like that, we’ll let it go’."
"We all know, of course, that there has been discussion behind the scenes about the business interests involved."
"We all know that it is argued in business circles that we must now take a more cautious approach to Burma, that China wants to grab the Burmese market for itself, and that the European Union’s competitiveness is at risk if we do not take a softer line on Burma."
"Such is the background music to a decision like this, and I believe that we in this House must say, loud and clear, that what is at stake here is the credibility of European foreign policy’s values."
"We have to make it clear that it is by these values that European foreign policy continues to be guided, and that we stand by our own resolutions."
"We have to make it clear that the foreign ministers have taken the wrong decision and that this House continues to take a critical line on the Burmese Government."
"Mr President, I consider it an affront to democracy and humanity that Burma will be represented at the ASEM Meeting in Hanoi in October."
"As the previous speaker, Mr Schmidt, has said, the three necessary conditions for Burma's attendance at the meeting have not been met: the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other National League for Democracy leaders, their freedom to participate freely in the National Convention, and the modification of procedure of the National Convention."
"Meanwhile, according to Amnesty International, there have been thousands of reported cases of rape being used as a political weapon to subdue ethnic minorities."
"As recently as last week, it was reported that the Women's League of Burma maintains that such rape is prevalent in many areas and that victims are frequently under the age of 18 and even under the age of 12 in at least one case."
"It is well known that the Burmese military is also believed to have a higher percentage of child soldiers than any other military in the world."
"I strongly oppose Burma's participation in the forthcoming meeting and I hope that the invitation to Burma will be withdrawn until democracy is restored and Aung San Suu Kyi set free."
"Mr President, the summit in Hanoi will be taking place on 8 and 9 October, and it is, of course, good to see that it is being held, because the dialogue between Asia and Europe is of major importance."
"There are, however, a few observations to be made in respect of the summit."
"Burma has already been mentioned, and I will return to it presently."
"First of all, I have to say that, although holding the summit in Vietnam is naturally a showcase for the reforms achieved in that country, it nevertheless has to be noted that there is still a yawning chasm between the dream of an effective and honest trading environment and reality."
"I have taken a stand in this House before – in October 2001 and also a year ago – for Mr Bin Vinh Trinh in Vietnam, for example."
"After a long-term stay abroad, he had made investments in his home country, and these were taken away from him under false pretences."
"His possessions were confiscated and he was imprisoned."
"Tragic though this was for him and his family, above all, it sent a negative message to potential investors in Vietnam."
"In my view, it is time the Vietnamese Government made a gesture in this respect."
"Secondly, human rights are a topic of discussion also in other countries in the region, and remain so."
"Thailand is a case in point."
"It is true that the Dutch and the Thai Governments have just signed an extradition agreement for the exchange of the Dutch prisoners who have been behind bars for a long time."
"This is a welcome step forward, but in the case of the prisoner, Machiel Kuijt, with which I am particularly concerned, it was agreed that he would appear before the court of cassation before 1 July."
"That still has not happened, and I hope that the Thai Government will deliver on its promise."
"Incidentally, the Commission has made a positive contribution in this area."
"It would be good if the Council could do the same."
"Finally, Burma has been mentioned."
"No other Asian country is struggling with human rights and democracy as much as Burma."
"Moreover, its problems are historical."
"Naturally, the liberals propose a dialogue in principle, provided it is a dialogue in which both parties participate seriously. If not, there is no point whatsoever in sitting around the negotiating table."
"In my view, the other Asian countries, particularly the ASEAN countries, which are so insistent that Burma should take part in those talks, also have a responsibility to ensure finally that Burma is taking this kind of dialogue seriously."
"Mr President, at the end of 2002 I was travelling in Burma and saw that Burma was a police state."
"The Burmese authorities have not cooperated with the UN special envoys, and the latest attack on Aung San Su Kyi and the NDL is a further setback."
"The world must not forget about the rest of the country, which is suffering from serious oppression."
"Discrimination against different ethnic groups, the confiscation of property, and the existence of political prisoners, forced labour, political rape and child soldiers have been well documented, as well as the burning down of villages."
"Fifty per cent of the national budget goes to the military."
"Money comes from foreign business and investment."
"The brutal military dictatorship is the root cause of the problems ravaging Burma."
"Sanctions that would bite have never been strictly applied."
"Burma has not met any of the three criteria set by the EU in April."
"All members of the Committee on Development who have spoken in the debate feel strongly that the EU should not participate in the ASEM Summit in Hanoi with Burma."
"Instead, the EU should increase and toughen sanctions against the regime leaders and should impose sanctions on the European corporations that do business with the Burmese regime, and specifically the French oil company Total."
"The EU should urge countries such as the USA, Australia and Japan to do likewise."
"EU members should ask the United Nations Security Council to impose marked targeted sanctions against the Burmese military regime, since it massively violates human rights, sends refugees into neighbouring countries, and sponsors the production of drugs and crime."
"It would be a shame if at the ASEM Summit the EU allowed Burma to be dismissed as a minor issue in its overall relations with Asia."
". Mr President, the Commission is gravely concerned about the situation in Burma and, since 2001, has been using the Asia-Europe meetings of the ASEM process to reiterate this concern to Heads of State and Government, ministers and senior officials from the ten South-East and North-East Asian countries which participate in the ASEM meetings."
"I do not have to impress on the honourable Members of the European Parliament how important the ASEM summits are in the EU political dialogue with Asia, being the only occasions when EU Heads of State meet South-East and North-East Asian Heads of State in a group-to-group dialogue."
"It is absolutely clear that all members of the European Union remain highly critical of the military regime in Rangoon and the European Union will continue to repeat our demand for the immediate and unconditional release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other leading representatives of the Burmese National League for Democracy."
"Unfortunately, so far the Burmese Government has shown no sign of fulfilling this, or the other two conditions of the Tullamore Gymnich."
"Great efforts have recently been made to find a solution which would allow the ASEM summits to take place."
"The Commission is of the opinion that we have been able to find a compromise which is acceptable to all."
"We have been able to reach this agreement, because we value EU relations with Asia too much to allow our ASEM dialogue to be taken hostage by the behaviour of the regime in Rangoon."
"The EU has reached an agreement on the participation of Burma in the ASEM summit, together with the 10 new EU members, Cambodia and Laos, but the European Union expects Burma to participate at a level lower than Head of State and Government."
"At the same time, in order to send a strong signal to the Burmese regime that we do not agree with its policies, the European Union has decided to strengthen the targeted measures against the Burmese regime if it has not fulfilled the Tullamore conditions by the time of the ASEM summit."
"Ministers have agreed to expand the visa ban list to include serving members of the military of the rank of brigadier-general and above, and members of their families, and prohibit EU-registered companies or organisations from making any finance, such as loans or equity, available to named Burmese state-owned enterprises."
"In addition, EU Member States will vote against extending loans to Burma from international financial institutions."
"The Commission is also looking at ways and means to take concrete action against illegal logging, while extending assistance to the Burmese population, especially on health and education, via international organisations."
"Since the solution to the political situation in Burma will have to be generated within Burma and within the region, I am convinced that our dialogues in ASEM contribute positively towards future reform in Burma."
"The Commission therefore looks forward to the ASEM V summit in Hanoi on 8 and 9 October, which in the context of wider discussions will allow a discussion with Asian leaders on human rights and prospects for reform in Burma and allow us to communicate our concerns to the Burmese representatives there."
"Working closely with the EU Member States and especially the successive EU Council presidencies, the Commission is committed to all the appropriate efforts, whether they are diplomatic, political, or developmental, that might facilitate and accelerate the democratic and human rights reforms within Burma."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place following the debates."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following seven motions for resolutions presented by:"
"– Véronique De Keyser, Johannes (Hannes) Swoboda, Csaba Sándor Tabajdi and Jan Marinus Wiersma, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the harassment of minorities in Vojvodina (B6-0045/2004);"
"– Roberto Musacchio, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in Vojvodina (Serbia and Montenegro) (B6-0049/2004);"
"– Kinga Gál, Doris Pack and Bernd Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on Vojvodina in Serbia and Montenegro (B6-0055/2004);"
"– Adriana Poli Bortone, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the harassment of minorities in Vojvodina (Serbia and Montenegro) (B6-0057/2004);"
"– Jelko Kacin and István Szent-Iványi, on behalf of the ALDE/ADLE Group, on the continuing atrocities against minorities in the province of Vojvodina (Serbia and Montenegro) (B6-0060/2004);"
"– Angelika Beer, Gisela Kallenbach, Joost Lagendijk, Raül Romeva Rueda and Tatjana Ždanoka, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the violence against minorities in Serbia (B6-0062/2004);"
"– Bastiaan Belder, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group, on Vojvodina in Serbia and Montenegro (B6-0064/2004)."
"In the name of the European Socialist faction and the Hungarian Socialist delegation, I welcome today’s resolution proposal by the European Parliament."
"The European Parliament is doing itself proud by resolutely defending the rights of minorities."
"We call upon the Serb Government to take immediate steps to halt anti-Hungarian acts of violence."
"The day before yesterday, when the President of the Hungarian Republic held discussions with President Tadic in a good atmosphere, 15 kilometres from the borders of the European Union, in Szabadka-Subotica, the word ‘death’ was painted on the front door of the house of the man who first dared to complain publicly about the physical injuries he had sustained."
"Today’s resolution of the European Parliament is an important reinforcement of the fact that the rule of law and observing the rights of the minorities are preconditions of a partnership between the European Union and Serbia."
"This is a fundamental political question."
"Serbia and Montenegro is an important strategic partner of the Union."
"The stability of the Federation and the maintenance of security are in the interests of the whole of Europe."
"Today’s resolution is not meant to punish but to encourage the Serbian democratic forces to uncompromisingly confront nationalism and xenophobia."
"This is also in the interests of the Serb majority, the national minorities and the European Union."
"It is important, and positive initial signals have reached us from Belgrade, mostly for President Tadic and Prime Minister Kostunica, to confront the gravity of the situation and investigate the anti-Hungarian actions."
"I am pleased that the Committee on Foreign Affairs has accepted my budgetary amendment proposal to increase the Union’s support by EUR 5 million for the process of democratisation in Serbia."
"Today’s European Parliament’s resolution will encourage the Vojvodina minorities, amongst whom live 300 000 Hungarians, and they will not feel abandoned by Europe."
"Mr President,after a string of violent conflicts in the states of former Yugoslavia between 1992 and 2001, everyone hoped that the survivors would co-exist peacefully."
"Unfortunately in Vojvodina, where citizens were subjected to bombing in what fell short of an ethnic war, non-Serbs are once again being tormented by those around them."
"Today, we will once again express our horror at the situation and call for peace and reconciliation."
"However, we will not solve this problem merely by committing our condemnations and moral indignation to paper."
"If that is the only thing we do, then I fear that we will have to repeat pertinent resolutions of this kind again and again, because they are not being heard by the people who matter."
"Violence and intimidation by ordinary citizens are evident wherever there is a predominant feeling that many of their own people are shut out by state borders, while many others who used to be considered to be the occupiers, are left behind in the people’s own country."
"In Serbian public opinion, the prevalent view is that, in terms of government, the Serbian inhabitants of the north and east of Bosnia and of the north of Kosovo are wrongfully cut off from the home country, and that for that reason, the areas that are recognised as Serbian territory should be made completely Serbian."
"Anyone who opposes this view is considered an enemy and is tarred with the same brush as the former Turkish and German occupiers."
"Political parties identifying with this feeling, shared by many members of the public, can count on a lot of votes, because they have the nerve to do what the public want."
"On the map of 1856, which is displayed on the second floor of this building, anyone can see how ethnically divided Vojvodina was between Hungarians, Croats, Germans, Slovaks, Romanians and Serbs at the time."
"Since the 1918 division, when it became part of Serbia, it has continually become more Serbian and other groups have moved away or have been driven out."
"Since 1989, the autonomy for the large Hungarian-speaking minority has also been driven back considerably."
"The recent riots are part and parcel of this long-term development."
"Without clear and broadly based agreements on linguistic rights, autonomy and administrative borders, it is difficult to avoid future outbursts of ethnic hatred in and around Serbia."
"We should therefore do more than merely adopt this resolution, although it is a step in the right direction."
"– We are pleased that our proposal found agreement and has enjoyed the support of every Parliamentary group."
"The proposal draws attention to a series of violent acts committed, in the first place, against members of a Hungarian minority population and minority groups in Vojdovina."
"Thus, we are sending signals to the Serb authorities that they should take seriously these oft-neglected breaches of rights, which are considered local, in order to prevent graver ethnic conflicts that would necessitate serious efforts of intervention."
"The frequency and increasing severity of violent acts show that the perpetrators and agitators will perceive the absence of legal consequences and the silent tolerance as tacit encouragement."
"I would like to emphasise that it is not our intention to stigmatise Serbia, even less so as the country has European-standard minority legislation."
"Despite all this, these events have been occurring up until today."
"Because of this, the central and local authorities carry enormous responsibility for putting the principles into effective practice."
"Naturally, one must appreciate that the Serbs have finally promised in the last two days that they will do everything to stop these incidents."
"No doubt this is being done as a result of the strong international response."
"At the same time if the European Union does not call them to account, their promises will only remain promises."
"Yesterday for instance there was a new threat, this time a death threat, that drove a young man and his family, who had already previously experienced such incidents, to say that they wished to leave Serbia and seek political asylum."
"It is in our mutual interests to reinstate the tradition of living harmoniously side-by-side in Vojvodina."
"On a simple level this means that youngsters should not be afraid of speaking another language in the street and that if someone goes out at night to have a good time, he should not be slapped in the face because he speaks Hungarian and immediately think of emigrating."
"This is why I ask all my representative colleagues to support the motion."
"Thank you."
"– The process of democratisation in Serbia has faltered over the last year and a half."
"One of the many worrying signs is that assaults against minorities have become commonplace."
"What is even more worrying is the indifference and inaction of the Serb authorities."
"Serbia’s leaders must know that what is at stake is the European future of the country."
"Serbia can achieve closer connections to Europe only if fundamental human rights can be assured and if it can guarantee the rights of minorities as well as their personal safety."
"We do not want words from the Serb leadership but action."
"It is not enough to make reassuring statements on the issue."
"The perpetrators must be apprehended and brought before the courts."
"We can rest assured only when we will see the consequences of these issues."
"If we are not to see any positive change we must keep the issues high on the agenda."
"Mr President, just imagine, as a Member of this House, finding a large kitchen knife pushed under your front door one day, with the accompanying message: ‘We will butcher you’."
"Is there anything more shocking or terrifying than this?"
"Such was the death threat, in Serbian, that Béla Csorba, Vice-President of the Hungarian Democratic Party of Vojvodina, received on 9 April of this year."
"This offence against a Member of the Hungarian minority in the Serbian province is by no means an isolated incident."
"Not for nothing does this draft resolution list the specific expressions of physical and mental violence, to which particularly Serbian citizens of Hungarian origin have been exposed for some time."
"Of how many incidents of hostility is the outside world unaware?"
"After all, typical of the climate of fear and intimidation in Vojvodina is the desire of various victims of ethnic violence to remain anonymous."
"Extensive documentation, currently available, about the present position of the Hungarian minority in Vojvodina is conjuring up a simply alarming image."
"If a teenager speaks Hungarian on the streets or in a public place, then they run the risk of being beaten up by a gang of their Serbian contemporaries."
"There is every chance that the police will look the other way or dismiss the incident soon enough as ‘not ethnically motivated’."
"Equally shocking are the texts of anti-Hungarian graffiti."
"At the crack of dawn on 15 July 2004, a wall in the city of Novi Sad was covered in big letters which read: ‘OK, OK Hungarians, a deep mass grave awaits you’."
"Shortly before that, in early May, many buildings in this capital of Vojvodina were covered with graffiti asserting that ‘Serbia belongs to the Serbs;"
"Hungarians: get lost!’"
"Against the background of an unmistakable radicalisation of the political climate in Vojvodina, I would underline Paragraph 5 of the draft resolution."
"This paragraph asks for an in-depth inquiry to be mounted on the ground by the EP delegation for south-eastern Europe."
"I would already like to give this fact-finding mission a number of urgent questions to take with them, questions that I would also like to address to the Council and Commission."
"What is the situation with regard to language teaching and other cultural provision for the Hungarian minority in Vojvodina, including newspapers, magazines and other media?"
"How much money does the Serbian Government set aside in total for public provision for this specific ethnic group?"
"In short, what exactly are the minority rights of the Hungarians in Vojvodina?"
"Encouraging was this week’s pledge by the Council, through its Dutch Presidency, that it intends to examine the position of the minorities in Vojvodina."
"This House and the Commission will have no choice but to follow suit."
"What is decisive, however, is the attitude of the competent Serbian authorities."
"In the first and last instance, we would urge them to commit to human tolerance in Vojvodina."
"– Mr President, following the wars against the Turks, something one could describe as Europe in miniature came into being in Vojvodina and flourished."
"For centuries, it has been home to a good dozen peoples, who have lived together, sometimes relatively peacefully, sometimes very much so."
"It was not only Poles, Ruthenes, Germans, Hungarians, and Czechs, but also Croats and Slovenes, who established themselves there a long time ago and have co-existed well with each other."
"I might add that it was the Serbs of Vojvodina who contributed much to the tolerance in this region."
"The problem is something quite different: it is that Milosevic deprived Vojvodina of its autonomy by force in order to secure himself a majority in Yugoslavia’s collective state presidency, and that wave after wave of people uprooted and expelled from other parts of Serbia were settled there, thus upsetting the complex ethnic balance, and have to date been socially and politically marginalised, unable to put down real roots."
"It is for that reason that a clear distinction must be drawn between cause and effect."
"We will not solve the problem without building up democracy and the rule of law, autonomy and co-existence in Vojvodina."
"We must support the Hungarians, but also all the other minorities too."
"We also have to tell the old-established Serbs in Vojvodina that we know of the good they have done for this multinational region, that this policy of ours is not anti-Serb, but that it is our concern, in the world of many and varied cultures that is Vojvodina, to re-establish the sort of co-existence that prevailed for centuries."
"That can be done only if we stand firm against the extremist elements and also tell the government in Belgrade that it is by the way they handle this that we will judge their readiness for Europe."
"Mr President, a very sad part of this story is the fact that most of the victims of ethnic harassment are young Hungarians."
"Traditionally, Vojvodina has been a region in which many cultures and languages have existed together, and its youngsters have learned each other's culture and language."
"I am very happy to hear that our Dutch and German colleagues from different political groups understand this, which means that this is also well known to Europe as a whole."
"This issue, as has already been mentioned, is not only a Hungarian one."
"During Tito's decades in power, many nationalities lived together in the autonomous region of Vojvodina: Croatians, Czechs, Slovaks, Romanians, Poles, Germans, Jews and other minorities lived together with Hungarians and Serbs."
"Now this peaceful coexistence is endangered by some extreme nationalists: Serbian politicians, policemen and other wrongdoers."
"The Hungarian youth of Vojvodina has a very rich, special and progressive culture, which is different from the culture in the Hungarian motherland."
"These young people were born into the spirit of a multiethnic culture and they understand both the Hungarian and Serbian cultures and traditions."
"The young should be the future of the Hungarian minority in Vojvodina."
"If they leave their homeland, not only the Hungarian community but also Serbia in its entirety will lose a valuable part of its culture and its democratic future."
"Young Hungarians in Serbia want to be good Hungarians, good citizens of a democratic Serbia, but, above all, good Europeans."
"They want to remain in the land where they were born."
"Let us help them to stay in their homeland."
"The western community reacted too late in many cases to the use of ethnic harassment in the Balkans."
"We have all seen the tragic consequences."
"This time we have to answer without delay and send an encouraging message to the Hungarians, emphasising that they can stay in their homeland in a would-be democratic Vojvodina, in a would-be democratic Serbia of the future."
". – As the atrocities against the Vojvodina Hungarian minorities have continued these past few weeks and politicians of Hungarian origin are being insulted and threatened and people are beaten up purely because they are not members of the majority group, it is our duty to raise our voices against these violations of law."
"Our emphatic intervention is also required because, in the last year and a half, neither the Serb Government nor the local authorities have done anything to restore law and order and failed to protect fundamental human rights."
"We do not know of a single incident where a person in breach of the law has been called to account."
"I find it particularly serious that the local police force is not only turning a cynical blind eye to the beatings of Hungarians, but also actively takes part in these atrocities."
"As a mayor, I would like to express my particular solidarity with the Mayor of Padej, Laszlo Komárom who was twice slapped in the face by a police superintendent."
"In a situation like this it is our duty to condemn the apathy and complicity of the Serb authorities."
"At the same time we must warn the government of Serbia and Montenegro that by tolerating, and even encouraging the atrocities, they will make it impossible for the country to draw near to the European Union."
"Mr President, like the other speakers I have heard in this House, I believe that the unique situation which exists at least in the remaining part of Yugoslavia, where it has been possible to maintain the peaceful co-existence of a number of nations, nearly 20 nations in fact, should be preserved."
"Of course the question is to what extent this resolution, which I have studied carefully, is conducive to this."
"I believe that by adopting such a resolution we would merely signal that we support one side only, and that we are not concerned with Yugoslavia or Serbia remaining a unified state, but only with a biased viewpoint."
"According to the latest reports, the matters to which my Hungarian colleagues have referred also affect a number of other nationalities."
"This is not merely a one-sided attack on the Hungarian minority, it is an attempt to disrupt the peaceful coexistence of the nations which live together in this country."
"We should be aware of the kind of signal we would send out by means of such a resolution, and to whom we would send it."
"Those of my fellow citizens from the former Czechoslovakia who are older than I am heard something similar in the early 1930s, and it resulted in the liquidation of our state."
"I am therefore firmly opposed to this resolution."
"Mr President, in the province of Vojvodina, harassment and physical aggression against non-Serbs, including children, are once again the order of the day."
"Members of the Hungarian minority are pestered on a daily basis, tombstones are damaged and violated, vandalism and anti-Semitic propaganda have become everyday fare."
"Everything seems to suggest that within this province with its different minorities, the Serbs are once again turning more insolent and more radical."
"Since the autumn of last year, we have been inundated with alarming reports about ever worsening violent incidents."
"A recent report by the Hungarian Human Rights Foundation gives a 19-page long, humiliating chronology of the ethnic violence in the province of Vojvodina."
"With this renewed violence, everything seems to suggest that the Serbs want to displace the frustrations that the loss of the province of Kosovo has caused them."
"Fellow Members, I do not only want to point the finger at the Serbs here."
"The sad experiences from the recent past should have taught us that conflicts in so-called multi-cultural or multi-ethnic societies are rooted in recent history, and that we should therefore look for a balanced political solution, whereby consideration is given to the complaints of all those involved, as well as to the conflict’s historical background."
"We should therefore firmly condemn all violence, but we should be careful not to lay the blame on one party alone."
"– Vojvodina is the last multicultural region of the former Yugoslavia that, so far, has largely been free of public violent atrocities."
"The brutality of the organised atrocities and ethnic cleansing by the central authorities in the other parts of the former Yugoslavia, for instance Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo, serves as a warning."
"In the last decade Vojdovina has become the strife-ridden hinterland of Serbia and the former Hungarian national community of half a million has decreased to half its population today."
"Why?"
"Because its members have been chased away by political and economic forces, its youth has been recruited forcibly into the Serb-Bosnian-Croatian-Kosovo conflict and their homes occupied by several hundred thousand Serbs."
"More and more politicians and experts who know the area are convinced that the stirring up of inter-ethnic tension, the beatings of Hungarians, the harassment and the robberies, the public burning of the Hungarian flag, and the desecration of graves in cemeteries are largely perpetrated by the Serbian and Montenegrin Government."
"The Serb central authorities’ attitude to this serious situation fundamentally contradicts general human rights and clashes with the standards of the European minority protection."
"The European Union bears a great responsibility for solving the situation."
"The solution to the Vojvodina question must be based on long-term acceptance and tolerance."
"The incidents against the native Hungarians living in Serbia and Montenegro, or more precisely in Vojdovina, are such that if left to fester, they could turn the region into an uncontrollable tinderbox."
"The guarantee of and respect for human and minority rights are the touchstones of democracy."
"Serbia and Montenegro’s long-term objective is to join the European Union."
"For this, they must establish a lasting and solid democratic value system the basic principles of which constitute a vital element of the Copenhagen criteria."
"A country that refuses to accept this has no place in the European Union."
"As representative of the Hungarian community in Slovakia, I can prove through experience that a minority community is very sensitive to any measures and events that also endanger its existence beyond its identity."
"The political leaders of Serbia make light of and play down the tense situation that has developed."
"Such a development could easily become a chain reaction."
"I support the resolution proposal."
"We have to express our warnings and suggestions in a strict tone."
"It is in a resolute manner that we have to call upon Serbia’s public law dignitaries and state organs to halt the assaults against Hungarian and other national minorities."
"Serbia and Montenegro can join the European Union only if a balanced situation on its territory will safeguard the rights of the minorities living in the region."
"Finally, one cannot agree with the opinions of delegate Kohliček."
"The parallel he has drawn is faulty and deceptive."
". Mr President, the Commission is continuing to monitor the situation of minorities in Serbia and Montenegro as part of our general insistence on respect for the political criteria which form a crucial part of the Stabilisation and Association Process."
"As regards Vojvodina, we strongly condemn the reported violent acts against members of the Hungarian minority."
"The recent visit of the Serbian Prime Minister Kostunica to Vojvodina, as well as the letter sent by the Foreign Minister of Serbia and Montenegro to the President-in-Office of the EU Council of Ministers, were concrete expressions of the declared commitment of authorities in Belgrade to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice and more generally to ensure the protection of minorities."
"We have taken note of these commitments and we will continue to keep the situation under close review, notably through the diplomatic representations in Belgrade, so as to ensure that the authorities deliver on their commitments."
"In the run-up to the provincial elections in Vojvodina on 19 September, it is important that political leaders show a sense of responsibility and promote a continuation of good inter-ethnic relations."
"The visit of the Hungarian President Mr Madl to Belgrade on 14 September was an excellent opportunity to discuss this issue in a constructive way and to confirm the good relations between Budapest and Belgrade."
"For its part, the Commission is committed to contributing to the promotion of good inter-ethnic relations in Vojvodina as well as in other areas through a number of EU-funded projects."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place following the debates."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following five motions for resolutions presented by:"
"– Pasqualina Napoletano, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the human rights situation in the Maldives (B6-0044/2004);"
"– Giusto Catania and Jonas Sjöstedt, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on human rights in the Maldives (B6-0047/2004);"
"– Nirj Deva, Thomas Mann, Charles Tannock and Geoffrey Van Orden, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the Maldives (B6-0054/2004);"
"– Graham R. Watson, on behalf of the ALDE/ADLE Group, on the political situation in the Maldives (B6-0058/2004);"
"– Cristiana Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the Maldives (B6-0063/2004)."
"In the paradise islands of the Maldives, where more than 300 000 European tourists enjoy unforgettable holidays, thousands of local citizens have to endure appalling oppression by a regime that has been in power for 26 years."
"The European Union, for its part, has a moral and political duty not to forget these people who live under a state of emergency, subject to arbitrary mass imprisonment – pro-democracy leaders have been tortured, detained and forbidden from communicating with the outside world – and still have to live under a regime that denies them an independent judiciary."
"The situation is so serious that an EU delegation was denied access to those detainees."
"The EU must demand an immediate end to the state of emergency and the release of all detainees."
"Parliament calls on the Commission and on the Member States to halt non-humanitarian aid to the Maldives immediately and to impose an immediate travel ban to stop members of the Maldives Government and other Maldives officials from entering EU Member States."
"The EU must, in turn, ask Member States to notify tourists planning to go to the Maldives that paradise is not paradise after all, and that there are human beings suffering tremendous oppression in that country."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is inconceivable that we are discussing the Maldives when this name evokes for us all holidays and a scene of paradise."
"In reality, there is systematic violation of human rights on these islands."
"We are faced with a situation in which women and children are denied their fundamental freedoms and, most importantly, a process of arbitrary mass detention of many citizens is under way."
"I think that the European Union must promote a widespread initiative to support an awareness campaign for European citizens in our countries, so that they do not go on holiday to the Maldives until light has been shed on the tragic human rights situation and on the systematic violation of democracy in that land."
"I think that a firm resolution is needed, aiming at ensuring, , that the Maldives really are a paradise, but a paradise in which democracy and the respect of human rights prevail."
"Mr President, why are we talking about the Maldives today?"
"We are talking about the Maldives because we have ignored it for 23 years."
"We have let it be."
"We have not looked at the living conditions or quality of life of the people in that country."
"They have been living under a dictatorship."
"There have been no elections."
"The President runs the country as his private property."
"Though it is classified under the GNP criteria as having a living standard in excess of $3 000 per capita, 50% of the people live for less than a dollar a day."
"But if you were to go there, Mr President, you would have to pay $300 a night to stay in one of those rooms!"
"Where does the money go?"
"Who collects it and where is it banked?"
"Certainly not for the benefit of the people of the Maldives."
"Moreover, recently, on 16 August, 200 people were detained without charge or arrest."
"Eight MPs were detained, MPs who had been tasked with drafting constitutional amendments for increased representation in parliament, including a former candidate for the role of Speaker, former Secretary-General of SAARC Mr Ibrahim Zaki, who has been nominated by some of us for the Sakharov Prize."
"Others have been held in prison without charge."
"Habeas corpus has been suspended and human rights have been abused."
"If the government of the Maldives wants to engage with the European Union, it should first restore the fundamental rights of those people it has imprisoned."
"Then we can talk."
"We do not want to hurt a small archipelago of 1 200 islands."
"We want to help them."
"The only way to help them is to ensure that European travellers visiting the Maldives also have access to fair travel so that they do not feel compelled to live in a country which is abusing its own citizens."
"Mr President, I should like to echo other speakers in saying that the Maldives is not the paradise it appears, and tourists must be made aware of that fact."
"I should also like to join with colleagues in expressing my deep concern about the mass detentions that took place in August, including that of Fathimath Nisreen, a 23-year-old woman who was originally arrested without warrant in February 2002."
"Later, while under house arrest, she joined the demonstration and was arrested again."
"I call on the President of the Maldives to make sure that she, along with the rest of the detainees, is treated humanely and not subjected to torture."
"I gather that some of the detainees have been tortured, although we do not have the precise details."
"The detainees should also have immediate access to their families and to lawyers of their choice – and I specify 'of their choice' – along with medical attention for those who need it."
"Again, I gather that there are some detainees who are in desperate need of such attention."
"I am concerned because they appear to have been detained solely because of the peaceful exercise of their right to freedom of speech and assembly, and for no other reason."
"I call on the authorities to release those detainees immediately, unless they are charged with a recognisable criminal offence."
"– Mr President, against the image of the Maldives as a holiday paradise of one’s dreams, we must set the political reality of uprisings, arbitrary arrests, solitary confinement and restrictions on the freedom of speech, of the press, of the right to assembly and of religion."
"For over 26 years, the President has ruled over the archipelago as a dictator; only his own party is allowed to contest elections, he himself is the supreme judge, appoints one-sixth of the members of parliament, and controls the media, while economic life as a whole is in the hands of his family, something to which Mr Deva referred."
"Two years ago, in response to international protests, he promised democratic reforms, but, as the Commission’s report testifies, the announcement was not followed up by actions."
"There have been expensive PR campaigns aimed at conveying the impression of effective changes, but let us not be taken in by them."
"In August, in order to reinforce his power, the President declared a state of emergency, and had supporters of the pro-democracy movement arrested."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats calls on him to release opposition elements from jail and at last initiate democratic reforms, failing which financial aid from the European Union and its Member States will have to be stopped."
"As Members have pointed out, 300 000 tourists from the European Union visit the Maldives every year."
"It is incumbent upon us to open their eyes to the conditions there, which are not those of a paradise."
"If the President wants to avoid them being warned against travelling to the Maldives on the one hand, and a ban on his government and officials entering the EU on the other, then all he needs to do is to create the conditions for democracy."
"Mr President, you would be hard pressed to discover from the Commission website that there was a problem in the Maldives."
"It says that the political situation in the Maldives has remained remarkably stable over the past two decades, providing a conducive environment for development."
"I suppose you could call 26 years of unbroken dictatorship stability of a sort, but it is hardly conducive to development."
"The Country Strategy Paper states that political developments have progressed over the past two decades, with enhanced democratic practices and increased respect for human rights; but this judgment is unbelievable since the paper subsequently notes problems of arbitrary arrest, incommunicado detention, lack of an independent judiciary and restrictions on free speech, protest and freedom of religion."
"It is incredible that the Commission can, in these circumstances, record President Gayoom's commitment to democratisation."
"The Maldives ambassador was on the phone to me this morning."
"He advised me that the troublesome elements were Islamic fundamentalists."
"That is not my information."
"However, the more the legitimate opposition, such as the Maldivian Democratic Party, and fundamental rights are suppressed, the more people will be driven into the arms of extremists."
"Mr President, Mr Deva made us in the Committee on Development aware a few weeks ago of the tyranny – for there are no other words to describe the situation – which is governing the heavenly Maldives and where in August, a corrupt ruler, motivated by sharia law, once again imprisoned without trial a number of members of the opposition."
"The Maldives are also those islands situated in the Indian Ocean where the many dollars which rich western tourists leave behind in the luxurious temples of five-star tourism only end up in the pockets of a small , while the majority of the population, a proportion of whom work as slaves in order to be at the beck and call of those western tourists, have to survive on less than USD 1 per month."
"This corrupt regime of President Gayoom has survived for many years and continues to vegetate thanks to our travel agents and thanks to glossy magazines extolling to newly-weds the virtues of the palm trees and the white sandy beaches of the archipelago. Wisely, these brochures keep silent about the rest."
"They do not mention the poverty, the tortures or the political prisoners."
"This is an outright disgrace."
"This is why this Parliament must bring pressure to bear on the tourism industry, and the European Union should, if necessary, consider a tourism embargo against the Maldives should it transpire that the man who, as an unenlightened potentate, treats his subjects as slaves, cannot be brought to reason in any other way."
". Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission is as concerned as you are about the state of emergency in the Maldives and the continued detention of members of the constitutional Assembly, opposition leaders and journalists."
"The measures imposed under the ‘state of emergency’ are draconian."
"President Gayoom has clearly overreacted to what amounted to a peaceful protest."
"The EU has already reacted strongly."
"On 17 August, the United Kingdom Foreign Office issued a strong statement calling for the state of emergency to be lifted."
"On 22-24 August, the EU Presidency led a fact-finding mission that met with various ministers, some of the detainees and several eyewitnesses."
"The mission led to an official EU démarche on 6 September, which was not well received by the Maldives Government, and to a strong public statement calling on the President to release prisoners, lift the state of emergency and continue with constitutional reforms."
"The President was clearly stung by these statements."
"He sent the Minister for Tourism to the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy to explain the situation."
"He reassured the European Union that he intends to continue with his promised constitutional reforms."
"He agreed that Amnesty International and the Red Cross should visit the prisons."
"In shaping our response for the future, we should also recognise that the President undertook some reforms before the summer – discussions in the Majlis Assembly and the establishment of the Human Rights Commission – but that he was clearly moving too slowly for the citizens of the Maldives."
"Building on this, a resolution from the European Parliament that would underline the main messages already passed by the EU would be very valuable."
"It should also push the President to move on his offer for the Red Cross to monitor the prisons, stress that the European Union will continue to monitor the situation closely and, if warranted, take up the President’s offer for the EU Representatives to return to the country for further dialogue."
"However, it would, in our view, be premature to consider travel restrictions, suspension of aid and other more punitive actions at this stage."
"If the situation worsens and the state of emergency is not lifted, such measures should be considered."
"But let us first see if the President will respect his promises to return to normal rule and resume the reform process as soon as possible."
"I appreciate the information provided by the honourable Member, Baroness Ludford, concerning the Commission's website."
"I was not aware of it, but I have already given instructions for it to be checked."
"Obviously, there is a need to update the website and that will happen immediately."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"We shall now proceed to the vote on:"
"(1)"
"(2)"
"(3)"
"Parliament has come to the end of its agenda.(1)"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 16 September (1)."
"The next item is the speeches on matters of political importance."
"Mr President, I wish to thank you personally for your efforts and assistance in trying to secure the release of my constituent from Liverpool, Ken Bigley, who was taken hostage in Iraq."
"On Friday we received the very tragic news that he had been executed."
"I should be grateful, Mr President, if you would send our sympathy and condolences to his family on behalf of the Members of this Parliament."
"This request is also being made on behalf of the other Members of the European Parliamentary Labour Party."
"Thank you very much, Mrs McCarthy."
"I must tell you that that letter has been sent, and that I have previously sent my condolences to the family and to the British people."
"The letter of condolence that I have sent to the Bigley family says that we all feel affected by this brutal murder."
"We had previously called on the kidnappers to free Mr Bigley, but that call – like so many from every part of the world – was in vain."
"Now all we can do is mourn his death and express our condolences to his family."
"So, that letter has been sent."
"I thank you for suggesting we should do so."
"Mr President, I rise on the issue of human rights abuses in Colombia."
"I have been approached by the FrontLine organisation, which is an international foundation for the protection of human rights defenders."
"It concentrates on defending human rights defenders who engage in peaceful actions in relation to human rights in their country."
"In February this year a number of trade unionists – members of a peasant farmers' association – were arrested."
"They have not yet been charged and there is no evidence of any possible serious charges against them."
"Up to 30 trade unionists have been assassinated in Colombia this year alone."
"It is a situation which the European Union has addressed from time to time, but there is serious concern amongst human rights defenders, both in Colombia and in Europe, that the European Union is allowing this issue to slide off the agenda."
"I shall forward to you the letter from the FrontLine organisation urging you to demand that the Colombian authorities release immediately the members of Fensuagro in the absence of any valid legal charges, and ensure that lawful trade union organisations can operate free from intimidation."
"Thank you very much, Mr De Rossa."
"That will be done, in response to the issue you have raised."
"Mr President, the UK Environment Agency has revealed that in five months of this year 12 million cubic metres of raw sewage were discharged into the river Thames flowing through London."
"This situation can only worsen with an increase in the violent storms caused by global warming."
"These discharges have not only killed thousands of fish but also resulted in dangerous levels of E. coli and other harmful bacteria."
"This is a European issue because such readings are far above EU bathing water limits and, incidentally, also a cross-border issue since Thames Water is German owned."
"The British Government refuses to provide the GBP 1.5m needed to build an interceptor tunnel to stop these overflows."
"As my colleague on the London Assembly has said, these figures are an absolute disgrace."
"This situation is bad for the environment, prejudicial to human health and damaging to the image of the Thames."
"I would ask colleagues on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to pursue this breach of EU law by the British Government and request that the Commission investigate it."
"– Mr President, I believe it is only right and proper that this Parliament should formally express its shock and outrage at the number of victims of the terrorist attack in Taba last week."
"I believe we should send a message of solidarity and profound condolence to the families of the victims, amongst whom I should like to remember especially the two young Italian women, Jessica and Sabrina, whose only crime was to allow themselves a holiday that they had been really looking forward to after a year’s work."
"Mr President, I would like to remind the House that next week, from 17 to 24 October, is One World Week."
"This is an opportunity for us all to take action and to do something about poverty and injustice in the world."
"One practical way in which we can help is by buying Fair Trade products."
"Parliament has started to buy Fair Trade products."
"In Strasbourg we now receive Fair Trade tea, though in Brussels we still get Liptons tea."
"Perhaps the Quaestors could take up this issue of why we are getting Fair Trade tea in one case but not in another, and consider what more we can do in this House with regard to buying Fair Trade produce."
"It would set a good example to other public administrations."
"I hope that you will support this initiative."
"Thank you very much, Mrs McAvan, for your very pertinent reminder."
"I should like to mention a case in which the Treaties have been violated by several Member States."
"The House must surely be aware that in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty on Accession, one of the signatories to which was the European Union, Polish entrepreneurs have the right to provide services freely in all Member States."
"This is one of the EU’s fundamental freedoms, which was not waived due to accession negotiations and which all Polish citizens could enjoy from day one of membership of the European Union."
"The transitional periods imposed apply only to persons wishing to take up employment on the basis of a contract of employment, and not to persons providing services or taking up activities on a self-employed basis."
"Yet in many Member States Polish service providers fulfilling orders placed by local customers, as well as persons wishing to open their own service establishments, have met with additional administrative requirements which make it difficult to take up such activities."
"If necessary, I can give details of the countries where this is the case."
"I therefore believe that the European Commission should be asked what measures it intends to take in order to examine these practices and to prevent actions such as these that violate the Treaties currently in force."
"– Mr President, I should like to bring an extremely serious event to Parliament’s attention."
"On Thursday, 7 October, the FBI, acting on federal orders, asked Rack Space, a US service provider, to hand over to them the hardware of two servers hosting all of Indymedia’s material, in other words the material from dozens of locations in this international network, which works with non-profit-making groups and associations."
"All the material was handed over without Indymedia even being able to find out the reasons for this action, which was a real act of censorship."
"I believe the European Parliament should always stand up for anyone’s area of freedom of expression and debate."
"I therefore call for the clampdown on Indymedia to be lifted and for the reasons behind it to be queried, at least."
"Mr President, my comments relate to the remarks made earlier on fair trade."
"The European Union is about to introduce a reform of the sugar regime, which will have serious implications for European farmers and sugar workers if it goes ahead as planned."
"However, there are wider issues here."
"I have learned that in Brazil the handful of sugar barons who control the sugar industry are licking their lips in anticipation at our proposed reforms, whereas those who service that industry – the workers and the landless – are living in fear and trepidation of their situation worsening."
"We must not facilitate that process."
"I would urge that when we enter into the detailed negotiations on sugar we not only consider the economic and trade issues but also take on board the social and moral dimensions of our decisions."
"That concludes the speeches on matters of political importance."
"The next item is the statement by the President of the Commission on the stocktaking of the Prodi Commission."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is not without some emotion that I stand before you for the last time as President of the European Commission."
"In a few days, in fact, the road we have been travelling together for five years will come to an end."
"These five years have been marked by major political and institutional changes and momentous events in Europe and around the world."
"I should like to begin this meeting of ours by reminding you where the European Union stood in 1999."
"On the institutional front, there were many who wanted to limit reform to the so-called ‘leftovers’ from Amsterdam and who proposed an institutional agenda that was limited in scope and certainly not up to the new challenges facing the Union."
"In the unfavourable economic climate of the time, there was very strong concern, doubt and scepticism about the actual chances of bringing in the euro."
"Just as strong were the uncertainties about when to carry out enlargement and the number of countries to include."
"Many were pressing to limit enlargement to six countries at most."
"No definite time frame or clear rules had been set out, and the press and public opinion voiced deep-seated fears."
"Then there were the even greater threats of the Balkan situation looming over the whole continent, in the absence of a clear and convincing EU strategy in the region."
"Lastly, the Commission itself was in crisis, shaken by the events of 1998 and 1999."
"Its credibility and authority had fallen to their lowest ebb, and therefore it needed to restore its image by carrying out the first serious, comprehensive overhaul of its administrative structure."
"Ladies and gentlemen, faced with this situation, we took up the challenge."
"Working together with you, we put forward an ambitious agenda for Europe."
"The kingpin of this agenda, the unifying element that drove our actions and gave them coherence, was enlargement."
"The unification of Europe – involving the inclusion of ten new countries, a clear timetable for the other candidate countries and real prospects for the full integration of all the Balkan countries – is the greatest contribution that the European Union could make to the stabilisation and the political, economic and cultural growth of the continent as a whole."
"To meet the challenge of enlargement, we had to strike the right balance."
"We could not move too slowly and run the risk of losing the momentum for joining Europe that was very strong in the candidate countries."
"We could not rush the process either, without ensuring that we had the support of the people in the Union."
"We therefore watched over the reform processes under way in central and eastern Europe and gave them our firm support, and at the same time we took on board the concerns voiced by Europeans about the costs of enlargement, population movements, environmental risks, nuclear safety and corruption."
"Public support in the new Member States exceeded all expectations, as shown by the success of the various referendums."
"We have demonstrated that negotiation and dialogue, though at times difficult, complicated and painstaking, are the only democratic way to export democracy and stability."
"At the same time, the ambitious enlargement of the Union to meet half the continent’s aspirations for freedom, security and democracy meant that we had to be equally ambitious in dealing with the overhaul of our institutional set-up."
"Therefore, at first alone but later with the support of an ever-growing consensus, we pressed for reforms that would be equal to the demands of running a Europe of 25 or more Member States."
"Thus we have been constantly involved in negotiations on institutional reform for the last five years, with the implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Nice Conference, the initial rejection by the Irish of the new treaty and its consequences, the European Convention and the Constitutional Treaty."
"Thanks to the joint efforts of Parliament and the Commission, the convention method has finally established itself, raising the levels of democracy and transparency in Europe."
"Nonetheless, the scepticism surrounding this proposal, which I have supported ever since that night in Nice, was very deep."
"Never have two views on Europe clashed so much as they did then."
"On the one side a strong, political Europe, equal to the global challenges facing us, and on the other a weak Europe, seen merely as an area of prosperity, stability and regulation and not as a real political entity."
"For the rest, Europe has changed considerably compared with the 1980s and 1990s, as have the various governments’ attitudes and policies on Europe, as well."
"Over these years, alliances between governments have very often been pragmatic, one-off affairs, linked to specific proposals or the current domestic or international political situation; there have been no groupings of countries consistently pressing for closer integration."
"We, for our part, have always fought to make our Union stronger, more democratic and more effective."
"We put forward highly innovative proposals – for the EU Foreign Minister, for instance – both at the European Convention and at the Intergovernmental Conference that followed."
"Now we have reached the end of the story."
"In a few days’ time, the Constitutional Treaty will be signed in Rome. This will, without a doubt, be a highly significant event for Europe, bringing greater democracy, greater simplicity and greater transparency, although it does have other, less satisfactory aspects – the situations where unanimity is still needed, for instance."
"This is a story to which we, and especially you, the Members of the European Parliament, have made a fundamental contribution."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have spoken about enlargement, institutional reform and policies for growth and peace: none of that would have been possible if, while we were working on all those areas, we had not restored order, strength, prestige and pride to our own institution, the European Commission."
"Indeed, there can be no change without comprehensive reform of the structures and apparatus of administration."
"The first positive effects are now starting to be felt in several sectors, such as decentralised financial control or external aid programmes."
"Above all, however, the reforms contained strong political messages and were designed to restore the Commission’s legitimacy, independence and efficiency."
"I need only mention the system for the rotation of the directors-general, after long years when certain directorates-general had regularly been allocated to officials of the same nationality; or the nationality rules for Commissioners and their staff; or, lastly, the decision to move the Commissioners closer to the departments they control."
"More than anything else, however, there is one element that has characterised my Commission and of which I am particularly proud: its collegiality."
"I have been able to rely on a close-knit, highly professional team, which has worked together in great harmony."
"Some members of this Commission today hold top positions in their national governments and parliaments."
"These too, I feel, are clear, tangible signs of the renewal and growth of the institution over which I have had the honour of presiding for more than five years."
"I am also sure that the Commission will become even stronger under the presidency of José Manuel Barroso, and I wish him every success."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the process of unifying our continent gives us a great opportunity to extend the stability and prosperity of the Union throughout the region surrounding it."
"Therefore, we have not confined ourselves to pushing the divide, the ‘Wall’, a few hundred kilometres further east or south."
"For years there was talk about the borders of Europe, but no working proposal was ever put forward."
"We have now proposed a new vision for the Union’s borders through our neighbourhood policy, which aims at setting up a genuine special relationship with the whole arc of countries from Russia to Morocco."
"The European Constitution itself recognises the need – which we highlighted – to establish a new relationship between the Union and our neighbouring countries."
"At a time when everybody is talking about a ‘clash of civilisations’ – although I am convinced that it is mostly a ‘clash of ignorance’ – we have given a great boost to intercultural dialogue and mutual understanding, particularly in the Euro-Mediterranean area."
"On the subject of the Mediterranean, I remember well the fierce criticism I received when I wanted to open up to Colonel Gaddafi’s Libya."
"Now, two days after the sanctions against Libya were lifted, that moment really seems a long time ago."
"It has been just four years, but four years of discreet, constant, intense work that have enabled us to set important changes in motion in that country and have paved the way for Libya to be readmitted into the international community."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, throughout these years we have always come out strongly and clearly in favour of multilateralism."
"More world and regional governance, a closer partnership with the United Nations, and less disparity between North and South have been the goals inspiring our actions."
"We have not merely ‘talked’ of multilateralism: we have put it into practice in order to achieve our goals and political options."
"I shall mention just a few examples."
"We have linked the objective of liberalising trade to the need to take greater account of the legitimate demands of civil society and developing countries. We have played a central role in enlarging the World Trade Organisation in order to encourage more effective world governance."
"We have geared our cooperation and development and our humanitarian programmes above all towards the reduction of poverty. We have strengthened our links with other regions of the world, such as Latin America or Asia, and have assisted in new regional integration processes, such as the African Union."
"Lastly, we have made a real contribution to strengthening the transatlantic relationship."
"After the war in Iraq, many claimed that the gap between the two continents could no longer be bridged."
"I have never believed that kind of idea, since I am certain that, in those areas where Europe has its own identity and is not paralysed by national vetoes, it can achieve significant results when working alongside Washington – and on equal terms."
"We have therefore worked hard and effectively with our US partners on practical issues of great importance, both in the area of security and the fight against terrorism, and in certain parts of the world such as the Balkans."
"I have said this before and I say it again: in this difficult, often tragic world, Europe – and Europe alone – has been able to export democracy."
"In the economic field, the euro has without doubt been the star of our mandate."
"From the outset, the euro was to be the cornerstone of the new Europe."
"From the outset, therefore, we regarded the euro as a great political project and not just an economic one; a project for political leaders and not just central bankers; a project requiring vision, authority and coordination."
"Throughout our mandate we have stressed the need for stronger economic governance, because the cost to Europe of not standing united in this area is still too high."
"To this end, we have drawn up several proposals to adapt the Stability and Growth Pact to Europe’s new requirements and new economic reality, and we have finally opened up a debate that several players had called for but none had had the courage to begin."
"I must admit I smiled when, after all the criticism about my stand, a well-known French daily wrote that the Commission’s recent proposals had made the pact ‘smarter’."
"Then we have consistently made our contributions to the Lisbon Strategy and put forward the various proposals needed to achieve our goal of making the Union the world’s most competitive and dynamic economy by 2010."
"To mention just a few examples, just think of the European Research Area, the emphasis placed on innovation in enterprises and on the information society, the new lifelong learning programmes in education and training, and the opening-up of our universities to the world."
"The reform of the competition policy itself is one of our most significant contributions to improving our competitiveness."
"In the social field, the Social Policy Agenda has been the frame of reference for a whole series of measures in the field of employment, social security, health and safety in the workplace, equal opportunities and social inclusion."
"We have to be honest, however, and admit that many objectives in this field have not been met."
"Above all, we have not achieved those objectives where we could not resort to the Community method and were held back by the need for unanimity."
"One of the most telling examples is perhaps the difficulties we encountered with the Community patent, which was repeatedly blocked on linguistic grounds."
"If the Member States do not learn to behave otherwise, the Lisbon strategy is at risk."
"Then there are all the results we have achieved and the proposals we have put forward to set up the area of freedom, security and justice, to improve environmental protection, for the energy and transport sectors, and to strengthen health and consumer protection."
"For example, there is the implementation of the Tampere agenda and the efforts made to respond to the new challenges of international terrorism after the attacks of 11 September 2001."
"There is the Gothenburg sustainable development strategy, the Johannesburg Summit and Europe’s action to further the Kyoto Protocol, which now seems capable of producing its final results."
"In these areas we have truly led the world and demonstrated in practical terms how Europe’s intervention can produce added value in a multilateral context."
"We have combined strategic decisions of enormous significance for the future of Europe – such as the European satellite navigation system Galileo, or the global strategy for the ‘single European sky’ – with prompt reactions in emergency situations, such as the shipwrecks of the in 1999 and the in 2002."
"At the beginning of our mandate there was another sector where it was essential to restore consumer confidence in the wake of the ‘mad cow’ crisis: the food sector."
"We responded with the integrated ‘farm-to-fork’ strategy, alongside measures such as the European Food Safety Agency."
"The reform of the common agricultural policy itself is designed to respond to the new challenges on the domestic and world fronts, aiming at a more sustainable strategy that is more mindful of rural development."
"Finally, we have put forward our political project – our vision – for post-enlargement Europe, with our proposals for the new Financial Perspective."
"This is a political project designed to bring a genuine European citizenship into being, a project for a Union now continental in extent which must take on new responsibilities towards its people and shoulder its own responsibilities on the international stage."
"This, too, has been our ambition: to make Europe a leading player on the world stage, to enable Europe to make its voice heard and work towards creating a world of peace, security and balanced development."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to conclude by mentioning one final point which, I believe, should be laid to the credit of this Commission and the European Parliament."
"It is the drawing-up of the framework agreement between our two institutions for the whole duration of our terms of office."
"The agreement has enhanced our shared initiatives, such as the practice of making it a priority to formally notify Parliament of the Commission’s major initiatives."
"These agreements have strengthened the political role between the Commission and the basis of its democratic legitimacy, which to a great extent lies in the European Parliament."
"This is undeniably an advance in democracy which I value highly and for which I am grateful to you."
"Lastly, I should like to highlight the deep understanding between Parliament and the Commission on legislative matters."
"Conflicts between us can be counted on the fingers of one hand."
"We should be delighted at that: it is one of the great merits of the codecision procedure and shows how well the three institutions involved have applied it."
"At the end of these five years, then, I am pleased with the way constructive relations have developed between the Commission and Parliament."
"I hope and believe that they will remain like that in future."
"If that is the case, it will mean that the outgoing Commission has not only developed good relations with Parliament but has also laid the groundwork for democracy to grow even stronger in Europe."
"Indeed, I am firmly convinced of the need to have even more Europe and even more ‘Union’ in Europe."
"We must commit fully to the European political project and take it forwards with strength, conviction and courage."
"That is what we have done over these years, and I am truly grateful to you for the help and support that you have never failed to give us."
"Thank you very much, Mr Prodi."
"Before giving the floor to the spokespeople of the political groups, I would like – on behalf of Parliament and on my own behalf – to thank you for your work at the head of the Commission, and point out that you took up your post at a particularly difficult time in the history of Europe, and that five years later – at the end of your mandate – Europe has undergone certain historic transformations."
"Yes, they have been truly historic."
"This is not rhetoric but is truly the right word to describe what has happened in Europe during your mandate."
"The effective implementation of the euro, the effective implementation of Monetary Union – which has been dreamt of for so long and which has taken so much work to achieve – will bear the name of the ‘Prodi Commission’."
"The greatest enlargement of the European Union – which will surely never be repeated – has also been carried out under your Presidency."
"This is one of the structural transformations of Europe that history will associate with your name and the Commission you have presided over, and also with your valuable and intense participation in the work on the Constitution, which will be subject to a referendum."
"On the basis of these three issues alone, Mr Prodi, you are leaving the Presidency of the Commission with a fine record, with many achievements, political achievements, which have profoundly transformed the reality of Europe and enhanced its unity."
"My predecessors have told me that you have always taken notice of the European Parliament, which has always found you to be a good listener."
"Although we have perhaps not always followed your advice, the Members of this House have always at least valued your friendliness and your constant accessibility."
"And, first and foremost, your commitment to Europe."
"It was because of that commitment to Europe – which is widely recognised – that you became President of the Commission."
"You can feel satisfied above all because, on leaving the Presidency, that commitment to Europe is even more widely recognised than before."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important debate, one that merits the presence of the Presidency of the Council, and one that also deserves to be attended by the entire Commission."
"What I would like to see in future is the Commission as a whole being present in the plenary not only when it seeks our vote of confidence, but also when assessing results on which our future, too, depends."
"So I would have liked today, to see both the Commission, and also the Council, fully represented."
"This Commission, under Romano Prodi’s presidency, had – as is usual in human and political life – its light as well as its shadows."
"In communication terms, we have a dual role; on the one hand, we are the Commission’s allies, in that we defend the Community model, but we are also there to keep tabs on it, and we are determined to carry on doing so in future."
"I agree with the outgoing President of the Commission when he says that the Interinstitutional Agreement has strengthened democracy and the parliamentary approach, and we see the new Commission, too, as being bound by what we have agreed with the Commission under Mr Prodi."
"In one historic area – that of enlargement – we achieved great things together."
"Our group was always a driving force behind membership for the countries of Central Europe, as well as Malta and Cyprus, and the fact that, as a result of the last elections to the European Parliament in June, Members from the ten new countries are able to take part in this debate in our House is something in which we can all take pride."
"The outgoing President of the Commission used the term ‘intelligent’ with reference to something he once described as stupid, that being the Maastricht criteria."
"This utterance, this comment, by Romano Prodi is something that we still do not regard as his finest hour."
"We do, though, very much appreciate the work of the departing Commissioner who had responsibility for monetary matters – I do not want to name names, for if I did, I would be forced to do so in many other instances – and the way in which the former Commissioner defended the stability of Europe’s currency."
"I hope that the new member of the Commission with responsibility for this, and indeed the new Commission as a whole, will defend the Stability Pact and Europe’s monetary stability."
"We were not exactly satisfied with the proposals on chemicals policy, with which we will have to deal over the coming months and quite possibly for years to come."
"Without wanting to go into detail, I would say that it is important that we enable this Europe of ours to compete rather than pursuing a policy that will end up with a de-industrialised Europe and the loss of jobs."
"We need a sensible balance between ecology and economics, and the best social policy is about creating jobs and keeping the ones we have."
"So it was perhaps a failing on the part both of this House and also, and in particular, of the Commission, that the targets we set as part of the Lisbon strategy were insufficiently ambitious and too diffuse."
"When completing the internal market, we had definite goals and fixed dates, and what we should all learn from that for the future is that we, if we want to make Europe more competitive, have to set strategic goals, and also firm dates, so that Europe is better able to compete."
"Farewells, of course, always involve some regrets, and so let me say to you, Mr Prodi, as President of the Commission, that you know what high regard I have for you as a person, and it would be less than honest of me if I were not to mention today how I found it regrettable that you have, in recent months – one might say, in the last eighteen months or the last two years – given priority to domestic politics in Italy."
"I would have preferred you to have focussed all your efforts on European politics and on your work as President of the Commission."
"All in all, though, I would like us to take our leave of each other on a positive note."
"I would like to thank you all, and if I were to single out one of you, it would be Mrs Loyola de Palacio, who, as Vice-President of the Commission, was responsible for relations with the European Parliament."
"I would, however, like to thank all the members of the Commission for their commitment and wish them all the best."
"In saying that, I am not directly referring to the personal political commitments of all of them, but, personally, I wish you all the best, and I shall take it as read that the Commission as a whole wanted to do its best for this Europe of ours as a community, and that is what we, Commission and Parliament together, must continue to do, so warm thanks and best wishes to you all."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, on behalf of my group, I want to thank you for the work you, together with your whole Commission, have done for the European Union over the past five years."
"Both the President of this House and Mr Poettering have already listed a number of milestones of your term of office."
"You took office at a difficult time; relations between Parliament and the Commission were strained in the aftermath of the fall of the Commission headed by Jacques Santer."
"You achieved , and did it by meeting Parliament halfway, by the way in which you in your personal conduct as President of the Commission, and also that of all your Commission, made apparent the respect that you, within the interinstitutional framework, had for this House as the representative body for Europe’s peoples."
"For that we are grateful to you, for you have thereby set down a milestone in the history of the European Union."
"Your successor will be measured by the standard you have set in your dealings with this House."
"Anyone who wants, as President of the Commission, to enjoy the confidence of this House, cannot do less than Romano Prodi has done."
"There is something else, Mr President of the Commission, of which you can be proud and for which we are grateful to you."
"In a very difficult period for Europe’s European and international policy, you took up a position to which I want again to make reference."
"Here, in this House, President Prodi declared that the use of arms must always and only be the policy of last resort, that recourse may be had to arms only when all the alternatives and all the policy instruments have been exhausted, and that the United Nations is the only forum in which such decisions may legitimately be taken."
"He affirmed that the consequences of warfare would be disastrous and incalculable."
"That was a visionary speech that you made that day."
"As far as the ‘wrong war’ against Iraq is concerned, you, as President of the European Commission, came to the right conclusions, and that I say with gratitude on behalf of our group as a whole."
"Reference has been made to the introduction of the euro."
"Your campaign, and that by your Commissioners, for the Constitution – a campaign that is still going on, for it may be signed in Rome on 29 October, but this will not mean that it has been ratified – this campaign was a cause you stood up for."
"When it came to enlargement, too, you and Commissioner Verheugen, whom I want to mention, worked in an exemplary manner."
"I believe that, when things are weighed in the balance, Romano Prodi can look back with pride on a term of office, in which, as always, there were high and low points that we do not wish to gloss over."
"We Socialists, too, have from time to time had cause to voice criticisms, and when I compare Mr Poettering’s speech at the beginning of your term of office with the one he delivered today, the euphoria has ebbed away a bit over the five years, but that is a fact of political life."
"Mr Prodi, you are now going back to Italy, and you have as yet taken no final decisions as to what you want to do there and actually will do there."
"Let me tell you, though, on behalf of the Socialist Group, that, whatever you decide – and I hope you will make the right decision – the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is alongside you in that decision, not only in mind and heart, but also with political will."
"Many, many thanks for the cooperation over the past five years."
"Mr President, Mr Prodi, five years and one month ago you addressed this house as President-designate of an untested Commission."
"You told us that you wanted to put Europe at the service of the people of Europe."
"Liberals and Democrats backed you then, and five exhausting years later, we back you now."
"Liberals and Democrats believe that in the long view of the Prodi Commission certain things will stand out."
"Your Commission launched the Lisbon Agenda and inaugurated the euro."
"Your Commission began the work of internal reform."
"It was the steward of Europe's enlargement from 15 to 25 states."
"Your Commission moved Europe into the world of common European security against terror."
"You inherited a Commission badly scarred by scandal."
"You promised this House that you would put the Commission's house in order."
"That work is not finished, but it has been courageously championed by Commissioner Kinnock and you leave behind you a Commission in which reform has a firm foothold."
"As part of that process you have worked to make the Commission's relationship with this House open, productive and respectful."
"Your successor will do well to do the same."
"Your Commission inherited a Europe searching for the road to economic reform."
"It leaves behind a Europe which found that road at Lisbon, however hesitantly we have stepped down it."
"In the service of the Lisbon Agenda your Commission has been an engine of intelligent, inventive, reformist single market legislation."
"Liberals and Democrats recognise and honour the exceptional personal stamp that Commissioner Bolkestein has placed on that work."
"In particular, the launch of the euro – the single largest logistical operation in Europe in 60 years – was a practical and political triumph."
"Liberals and Democrats believe that we have not gone far enough on the road to economic reform or achieved what we could have."
"But if Europe is unlikely to achieve the Lisbon goals, the fault lies not with a Commission that failed to set the rules, but with Member States that too often failed to keep them."
"The Lisbon Agenda has too often been subordinated to the Paris Agenda or the Berlin Agenda or the London Agenda."
"Your Commission inherited the battered but hopeful Europe of 1989, still divided by a line from Trieste to Gdansk."
"Today that line is gone, wiped away by an historic enlargement that this Commission has every right to take credit for."
"We recognise your work, and the work of Commissioner Verheugen and the work of the hundreds of dedicated Commission staff who made the climb."
"Mr Prodi, in my country politicians most often get into trouble in their brushes with the other sex!"
"I can think of two in your case: Penelope and Marta."
"You quickly dropped the first, and I am delighted to see today that you have finally ditched the second."
"It is the conviction of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe that the Prodi Commission has honoured the commitments it made to this House five years ago."
"Some will use today the tired claim that you have been more interested in Italian politics than the stewardship of the European Commission."
"But how can one review the achievements of this Commission and then insist that you had only one foot in Brussels."
"It was said of the Emperor Augustus of Rome – another Italian with a European destiny – that he inherited a city of brick and left behind a city of marble."
"Liberals and Democrats believe that handed a city of brick, your Commission leaves behind a bigger, better, wiser Europe."
"I can sum it all up in one Italian word, Mr Prodi: !"
"Mr President, Mr Prodi, over the past five years your relations with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have been through good times and difficult times, as is normal, but allow me to say that, in the light of these weeks’ hearings, I am sure – or rather, I should say I fear – that many of us are going to miss your Commission, particularly some of its members, and this is certainly not good news for Europe or for us."
"We acknowledge the fact that during the reform of the European Union and the work of the Convention, you and your Commission have been able to steer a straight course towards the strengthening and democratisation of the European Union, even amidst attacks not only on you personally, but also on the very existence of an autonomous and truly European institution such as yours."
"I must say – and here I am in agreement with Mr Schultz – that your position on Iraq was also clear and that we agreed with it."
"This, however, did not help to avoid the war because the European Union as a whole refused once again to speak with one voice and to organise itself in such a way as to be able to speak with one voice on issues of war and peace."
"We also acknowledge the fact that your Commission was able to resist the pressures of those governments – which I can only describe as miserly and short-sighted – who think that they can make Europe progress while keeping its budget under 1%."
"Let us hope, indeed, that your successor will be able to hold a firm line on this point."
"Your Commission, as has already been said, is the Commission of the enlargement and in this connection we too recognise the enormous amount of work that has also been done in preparation for the next, future enlargements, particularly with regard to Turkey."
"I will not, however, hide from you our disappointment at the failure to solve the Cyprus issue, regarding which we had long been asking for a firmer initiative from the Commission, which unfortunately was not forthcoming."
"We have certainly welcomed your leadership and that of the majority of your Commission – not all, alas, and here I refer particularly to Commissioner de Palacio – on the issue of the Kyoto protocol and on climate change in general."
"Naturally, we would very much have liked the Commission to have proposed a Stability Pact on climate change too, an honest-to-goodness plan, with clear figures and sanctions."
"This did not happen, but we hope to succeed in bringing this about in the future."
"With regard to the Stability Pact, as you know and as you remember, we very strongly supported your description of it as stupid."
"But there was no immediate initiative."
"We agree and are fairly satisfied with the proposal which your Commission has put forward in this regard, but it has come too late, following a serious crisis within the European Union."
"On at least three issues, however, we have found ourselves on opposing sides."
"We regret this, and hope to convince not only you but also your successor."
"The first issue on which there was serious conflict with our group was undoubtedly genetically modified organisms: it was an error to lift the moratorium and I believe that EU citizens are aware of this."
"Then, in relation to the issue of energy and the environment, very little has been done with regard to stepping up the role of renewable energies, which over these last five years have remained a little like the Cinderella of the debate."
"Finally, Mr President, the PNR affair."
"In our view it was a grave error on the Commission’s part to concentrate on a procedure which definitively and very clearly excluded Parliament from participation in an issue which affects citizens’ rights very closely."
"Let us hope that we no longer have to deal with a Commission that believes that Parliament should not have a say on such matters."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, to evaluate in three minutes the work done over five years by the Commission is rather like trying to square the circle."
"That is why I shall content myself with identifying a few salient features that, in our view, illustrate broad trends that have characterised, and still characterise, the action of the EU’s executive and the EU in general."
"Let me be clear that I am not putting a question mark over individuals."
"I am calling a policy into question."
"Over and above the political and national divisions, the present Commission embraces some brilliant personalities, from Mr Lamy to Mr Patten."
"It is the direction followed that is problematic."
"The first example of this is the Lisbon agenda."
"Four years after the adoption of what the European Council called a new strategic objective for the decade, where are we?"
"One of the proclaimed ambitions, I would point out, was to achieve full employment, whereas the figures of the Commission itself now indicate that, for the first time in ten years, we are destroying more jobs than we are creating."
"The other ambition was to construct the world’s most dynamic knowledge economy, whereas the Commission acknowledges a general decline in investment in key areas such as research, education and training."
"One figure, quoted by the Commission, really makes one shudder: more than 17% of Europe’s 15 year-olds lack the minimum reading, writing and arithmetical skills required."
"One might therefore have expected, at the very least, to see some initial questions asked and some tentative doubt raised as to the relevance of the headlong flight into liberalism of recent years, of which these failures might be the price."
"No, the question is never asked."
"During the crisis, the liberal wave rolls on and grows larger."
"The second example is the 1999 Tampere programme, in particular European policy on asylum and migration."
"Has what human rights militants called Fortress Europe led to satisfactory results in terms of the much-touted control of migration flows?"
"No, the repeated dramas along the Sicilian coast are testimony to the fact."
"Is there, therefore, a resolve to tackle the problems from the other end, that is to say by bringing about a shift in the pitiless rules of the world economy in an attempt to curb, at source, these migrations motivated by the need to survive?"
"Emphatically, no."
"Heedless of the ethical, humanitarian and legal problems, the Commission is launching pilot projects aimed at establishing detention centres on the southern shore of the Mediterranean, intended for refugees intercepted at sea."
"What will be the next stage?"
"The last example is transatlantic relations."
"In the wake of 9/11, the idea had taken root that our expression of solidarity with the American people did not have to mean a docile acceptance of its leaders’ ideas on international security."
"‘Allied but not aligned’ was the message."
"That did not prevent the Commission from declaring to President Bush at the transatlantic summit of June 2003 – in other words, after the start of the war in Iraq – that when Europe and the United States are united, no enemy can stand up to us."
"The fact is, history has not since borne out that bold synopsis."
"What public lesson has, however, been drawn from this turn of events?"
"There’s the rub, Mr President."
"Alternative options are never discussed. It is, as they say, business as usual."
"It is time to breathe some spirit of criticism into our institutions, contradiction being an engine of progress."
"Mr President, there is no getting away from the fact that the way in which the outgoing European Commission acted towards the EU’s new members was exceptionally unjust."
"All of the previous EU enlargements were carried out in accordance with the principle that the same conditions which applied to the countries that were already part of the EU should apply to the new members."
"This was the case not only for countries such as Greece, Portugal and Ireland, which had national incomes as low as that of Poland, but which had market economies and were thus in a position to take rapid advantage of EU mechanisms."
"It was also the case for East Germany, which, like Poland, had to undergo political transformation."
"From the day of its entry to the EU, the German Democratic Republic received agricultural subsidies equivalent to 100% of those paid to farmers in West Germany, as well as production limits that equalled consumption."
"The conditions upon which Poland and the other Eastern Bloc countries were accepted were much worse, as well as being unjust."
"This injustice will continue to serve as a calling card for the work of your Commission, Mr Prodi."
"The EU monitors democracy in various countries outside the EU which do not have the slightest chance of ever joining it, and yet it lacked the courage to examine whether the referendums on EU accession were carried out in a democratic manner, and whether equal media time was available to both supporters and opponents of accession."
"Unfortunately neither equality nor democracy were in evidence, and yet the EU preferred to ignore this fact."
"This is another injustice that characterises the outgoing Commission’s term of office, and there are further causes for dissatisfaction with the work carried out by the Commission under your presidency."
"The draft Constitution was presented during this time, and the Commission’s support for this draft means that the EU is fast heading towards becoming a single state."
"There is talk of the principle of subsidiarity, but at the same time Member States are being deprived of competences in matters they could perfectly well regulate themselves."
"Little by little, plans are being drawn up for the creation of an EU army, a single foreign policy, a common currency, common legislation and a common jurisdiction."
"The Commission is gradually becoming a European government, and yet there is no consensus that this should happen."
"Mr President, at the start of your mandate we voted in favour in the hope that certain crucial knotty issues would be resolved."
"Unfortunately, to date many of these are yet to be untangled."
"The Commission, together with the Council, did not succeed in making the changeover to the euro less costly for citizens and until the other day the Generalised System of Preferences criteria had not yet been laid down, leaving open for years to come the problem of proper development and cooperation between Europe and poorer countries."
"The Food Safety Authority of which we spoke at the start of your mandate has remained partially on paper, and the Council also has some responsibility for this: that is, it is not operational as we had promised."
"Furthermore, measures to combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings have been tackled in, let us say, a marginal way; the fight against terrorism has not been a real priority, despite the signs which even before 11 September were making it obvious that there was a need for stronger political and organisational action."
"For instance, we were ignored every time we highlighted the need for regulation of information technology, at least for EU countries, with the result that today international terrorism has also become mass media terrorism."
"In fact, it has learnt how to use the new technologies against us, whereas these should be used not only to pursue economic goals but also to disseminate the principles of freedom, democracy and human rights."
"There are rules for the press, for television, for the print media, but not for the Internet, and this is an unresolved problem."
"These are only a few of the deficiencies which have gone unremedied over these past years."
"They have, of course, been years of great and positive innovation: from the euro to European reunification and the Constitutional Treaty, and we thank the Commission as a whole and you, Mr President, for having worked to achieve these goals."
"Unfortunately, though, you have not been successful in giving Europe the change the citizens asked for, and that is more subsidiarity, less bureaucracy and more policy."
"Moreover, as Italians we regret the fact, Mr President, that in recent times you have no longer remained above party politics while carrying out your duties, and have thus laid yourself open to criticism on many sides."
"As the proceedings of this Chamber testify, we have on many occasions tried to support and defend the Commission against the criticism it received at the start of the mandate."
"Now, however, we have been left high and dry because of your dual role, that of President of the Commission in Brussels and leader of the centre left in Italy."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, I still remember my first meeting with Mr Prodi, the then Prime Minister of Italy, in Rome six years ago."
"This meeting took place during an official visit by Mr Buzek, who was Prime Minister of Poland at the time and is now a Member of the European Parliament."
"I accompanied Mr Buzek as Minister for European Affairs."
"Even after so many years, I still have warm memories of your friendliness and openness towards my country, Mr Prodi, and would like to thank you for this."
"You have presided over the European Commission during a historic period, which included the fifth and largest enlargement in the history of the EU."
"You have made history and will go down in history."
"Since enlargement the EU has become more European and more representative of our continent, and we hope that given time we will also be able to compete more effectively with America and Asia."
"Yet your term of office was not only one of great change, but also one that raised a great many questions which your Portuguese successor will have to deal with."
"You have left us with high levels of unemployment in the EU and the idea of a two-speed Europe, that is to say, of a superior and an inferior Europe."
"Following in the footsteps of Jacques Delors is not an easy task, although following in those of Jacques Santer is much easier, as his strides were not and are not giant ones."
"In conclusion, however, today we are sitting in a Parliament that represents 25 countries and not 15, and the credit for this is yours, Mr Prodi."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, it is almost an event to see you in this House, given the extent to which your repeated absences in 2004 have been noticed and have been felt as a sign of your lack of interest in our Parliament."
"I fear that, when it comes to taking stock, the role you have played has not come up to our expectations."
"Admittedly, a lot of Commissioners have done some excellent work, and we are sorry to see them go."
"There have been many instances of progress in the field of security in all its forms."
"We thank Mrs de Palacio, whose courage we have appreciated; Mr Liikanen, who has succeeded in carrying a number of important issues forward;"
"Mr Busquin, for his efforts on research; and Mr Barnier, who has offered us a new vision of the regional funds."
"I must also mention the difficulties overcome by Mr Byrne in confronting the problems of food safety, and Mrs Reding and Mr Vitorino, whose skills we have appreciated."
"That being said, Mr Prodi, where was the inspiration so eagerly awaited by MEPs?"
"Although you have successfully carried enlargement through, you have never clearly launched the debate on Europe’s borders and on migration flows."
"You have lacked ambition in implementing the Lisbon strategy, in improving economic governance and in promoting policies in favour of young people."
"Why, Mr Prodi, is the image of the European Commission deteriorating to such an extent in the eyes of our fellow citizens?"
"Here is one practical example: this morning, I learn that, in connection with the Geneva-Lyon-Bordeaux axis, your Commission, urged on by Mr Bolkestein, is being extremely and incomprehensibly rigid in requiring a second European call for tenders for completion of the remaining 50 kilometres at a time when a tender has already been accepted for the Lyon-Bordeaux axis."
"Issuing a second European call for tenders, for the sake of 50 kilometres, is a waste of time and money."
"It is a technocratic decision that goes against common sense."
"How am I to explain to my fellow citizens that this decision will be more expensive and that it will cause delay?"
"I know what they will say to me on the subject of Europe."
"Mr Prodi, if the Commission acts in this way, no amount of communication strategies will prevent your and our efforts on the ground from being in vain."
"If people are to believe in a strong Europe that is closer to the people, there is still everything to be done in this area."
"– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, rather than being offended, you should be amazed – as I am – that there are those – like Mrs Grossetête, who spoke before me – who, being unable to muster courage and a capacity for objectivity at this time, are obliged to be politically partisan."
"I speak on behalf of my group and of many Members of this House when I confirm that you have indeed worked very closely and very well with this House."
"The same can be said of the Vice-Presidents, Mrs de Palacio and Mr Kinnock and of all the members of this Commission."
"A milestone has been reached, standards have been set, and so it shall remain."
"I wonder, Mrs Grossetête, whether the Barroso Commission will adhere to these standards."
"Mr Barroso has not so far demonstrated that, whereas Mr Prodi has."
"Secondly, and contrary to what some Members have said, enlargement and the Mediterranean policy prove you right, and in these areas too, we will have demands to make of Mr Barroso; we will be asking whether he can pursue these to the same extent and with the same care as did the Commission under Mr Prodi."
"This leads me to mention dialogue with Islam."
"As President of the Commission, Mr Prodi pointed out that, if we want greater security, it is not more weapons that we need, but willingness to engage in dialogue with our neighbours as part of the neighbourhood policy, and where did that originate?"
"It came from the Prodi Commission."
"It was a major achievement, and we must not merely say thank you for it, but also follow it through in the future."
"I would have liked more in the field of employment policy and also in many other areas, but here it was not the Commission, but the Council that was, regrettably, very cautious and hesitant, as President Prodi has already pointed out."
"He it was who was the first to have the courage to say, in language that was perhaps rather provocative, that the Stability Pact as it had been applied was not very intelligent."
"Proposals have now been made, and I am convinced that most of us will back them, as will most of the finance ministers."
"As an economist, I say that every economic rule must be applied intelligently rather than dogmatically and bureaucratically."
"I am sure that Professor Prodi was also the first to recognise that."
"Let me say one thing in conclusion with reference to the subject currently under debate, something of which Mr Bourlanges, who is sitting here beside me, can speak with experience."
"Contrary to what journalists would have us believe, what matters is not that a man or anyone should be shot down in flames for belonging to a particular government or following a particular political line."
"What we Social Democrats and the majority in this House are doing is seeking to uphold the standards that this Commission has set in fundamental rights and freedoms and in non-discrimination."
"To these we want a clear response."
"The question will be, in the days to come, whether the Barroso Commission is able, particularly where fundamental rights and freedoms are concerned – the catalogue of which you were very actively involved in drawing up – to uphold these standards."
"The role of women needs to be promoted more, and there must be no discrimination on the grounds of gender or of sexual orientation."
"These standards, set by the Prodi Commission, are what it is all about."
"Mr Barroso must demonstrate his ability to maintain them."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, you are coming to the end of a term of office upon which you will have left the mark of your humane values and your high view of European integration, which we share."
"I wish, in this House, to emphasise the quality of your track record."
"You were given responsibility for launching the euro in coin of the realm."
"It was an onerous responsibility, and you managed to carry it out successfully."
"We were promised a shambles but, ever since the first day of January 2002, and thanks to skilful preparation, our fellow citizens have had no trouble making the single European currency their own."
"Where the environment is concerned, it has been possible to accomplish major progress thanks to the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol, the Water Framework Directive and the directive on waste reduction and recycling.By preparing a genuine common policy on asylum and immigration and stepping up the fight against crime at Community level, progress has been made in promoting freedom of movement and establishment within the EU."
"Measures have also been taken to promote the mobility of students, researchers and workers. All these advances show the degree to which you have been able to place European citizens at the heart of your concerns in order to assure them of a better environment."
"You had to lead the difficult negotiations for enlargement of the EU, this great reunification of the European family."
"In spite of pressure from the European Council, you managed to stay the course without flinching, so that welcoming the ten new states did not lead to the EU becoming paralysed."
"At the institutional level, we cannot but be satisfied with the preparation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the necessary and courageous reform of the Commission."
"Moreover, the positions you defended during the IGC have been taken into account in the draft European Constitution, which will, I hope, enable us in future to help this enlarged EU to thrive all the more."
"In this regard, your budget proposals for the future constitute, moreover, a clear-sighted vision of our needs."
"Mr President of the Commission, the principal objectives you presented to Parliament on 15 February 2000 have been achieved."
"Your actions have been fair and inspired."
"On behalf of the European people that we represent in this House, I wish quite simply to thank you."
"– Mr President, your Commission is rightly proud of its role in the enlargement of the European Union."
"The European Free Alliance parties welcome our new neighbours and look forward to the day when our own countries – Scotland, Wales and Catalonia for example – can take their place at the top table as independent Member States."
"Five years ago, Mr Prodi, you spoke at some length about the need for the European Union to reconnect with its citizens."
"Until five years ago opinion polls showed there to be higher levels of public support for the EU in Scotland than in other parts of the UK."
"However, that support differential has now been eroded."
"One of the principal reasons for that is a policy that has been one of the European Union’s biggest failures – the common fisheries policy."
"Your Commission had the task of reforming the CFP."
"You had an opportunity to give hope to Scotland’s fishing communities, but instead you gave despair."
"You could have taken up proposals from this Parliament to establish meaningful, devolved, regional management of fisheries, but instead you promoted toothless advisory councils."
"The blame cannot be laid solely on the European Commission, as successive UK governments have repeatedly sacrificed Scotland’s interests, but the final straw for my party – a pro-European party – was the illogical decision taken this year to include the CFP as one of only a handful of exclusive competences in the draft Constitution."
"With that clause remaining, we will be voting against the Constitution in any referendum."
"The Commission's end-of-term report, fisheries section, must therefore read 'failed'!"
"Mr President, you know how over all these years we have kept up a constant and also radical criticism of the way in which this Europe of ours is being forged."
"I say ‘ours’ because we are pro-Europe, like you."
"For this reason, rather than just reiterating our criticisms, which are harsh, of the way in which your Commission has acted – criticism of which you are already aware – I will put to you a question on which we can reflect together: where does the European project stand in relation to globalisation?"
"Can we cherish the fond illusion of the excellence of a gradualistic process subordinate to this globalisation, without realising that globalisation is consuming the rights which matured in the welfare states of the twentieth century and is creating new global dynamics of injustice and disenfranchisement?"
"We are, in fact, seeing the return of war, spiralling terrorism, and workers being set against one another – attempts to do this are happening right now in the car industry."
"In this picture, where is Europe?"
"Is not its very Constitution a step backwards when compared with a constitution like Italy’s, which is founded on work and the repudiation of war; is it not almost an acquiescence to the dictates of globalisation?"
"That is why for us Europe can hold out hopes for a different future only if it can be a real alternative, in contrast to what it has been up until now."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, as is right at a time of stocktaking, as well as being pleased with the progress made it is also worth highlighting those goals which have not been achieved, or have not been properly achieved, provided this is done in a way that will be constructive as far as the future is concerned."
"First: the introduction of the euro has of course been an important achievement."
"The Commission, however, could have done more to support the Member States in combating the resulting rise in prices and in helping businesses forced to square accounts with a euro that was too strong."
"Secondly: the problems relating to enlargement are very far from solved."
"The new countries complain of still being thought of as second-class, while the old ones will have to deal with a situation where there is less funding available and a workforce in the enlargement countries that is much cheaper than their own."
"Finally, we must lament the fact that the reform of the Stability Pact, which has been considered an urgent matter since 2001, is still incomplete, particularly after the crisis following 11 September."
"As other Members have done, I would also like to remind you that in this Chamber, or rather in the Chamber of Strasbourg, it was Mr Prodi himself who correctly described the pact as stupid."
"From the future Commission, we expect concrete and rapid answers to these problems, and we expect it to speed up Euro-bureaucracy as much as possible."
"To conclude, it has truly saddened us, Mr Prodi, perhaps because in 1999 we too gave you our trust, to have seen you all too often playing a leading party role in Italian national politics."
"I believe that on this point the only assessment that can be given is a negative one."
"Mr President, in actual fact, it is not really necessary to take stock of the activities of the current Prodi Commission, although much could be said about it."
"I think that we could easily fill a whole sitting with the Eurostat issue alone, for example."
"However, that will be unnecessary because last week, the Prodi Commission pronounced what I regard as a damning final verdict about itself with its own advice about Turkey’s possible accession to the European Union."
"Indeed, in doing so, the Commission performed the ultimate anti-European act."
"The EU’s previous enlargement to include countries of former eastern Europe is open to criticism as regards its timescale or some of the modalities involved, but nobody challenges the principle that those eastern European countries belong to the common European civilisation."
"This favourable response to Turkey, however, a country that is not European, whether in geographical, political, cultural, historical or religious terms, is worse than a mistake."
"It is a crime against the true European idea."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, I have re-read the President of the Commission’s speech of February 2000 about the strategic objectives and the legislative programme, and right at the very end, Mr President of the Commission, you yourself gave a parameter against which you wanted to be measured at the end of your mandate."
"You said that if the turnout at the 2004 European elections were to be higher than in 1999, you would have completed your task successfully."
"Unfortunately, you yourself are aware of the outcome of those elections; you, too, know that 45.7% of the people voted."
"That is not only exceptionally low, but, above all, is also 4% lower than in 1999."
"Obviously, we do not wish to pass judgment in the old way, using one single criterion – certainly as an advocate of the Community method, I would definitely not venture to do anything like that – so I admit that many positive things have happened in each of the four areas for which you set strategic objectives, and for that I am indebted to you."
"I would also like to thank all the Members of the Commission who have probably worked very hard for five years running."
"If, however, I ask myself whether the Union’s benefits are felt and understood by its citizens, if I see how people react to enlargement, if I see how the Commission and all other European institutions are, time and again, associated with fraud, if I conclude that the image of the European institutions has not improved – it is enough to look at the latest Eurobarometer surveys – then I have to say that the policy has certainly failed in one area, and that is building bridges with the public."
"Is this something to do with the substance of the policy, or with the lack of contact and consultation with the representative civil society?"
"Is this attributable to a lack of professionalism in communicating, or is it a combination of the three?"
"I would like to find out from the President of the Commission how he himself deals with this, and whether he has any recommendations to make to his successor as to how to make a better job of it."
"Mr President, Mr Prodi, after five difficult years during which headwinds and stormy seas have not been rare occurrences, the Prodi Commission’s record has been marked by great progress and undeniably positive results."
"I would like to begin with the historic transformation represented by the reunification of Europe, or a major part of Europe, after the Cold War years."
"A great triumph for democracy and stability."
"Over and above individual achievements, which it would be all too easy to enumerate, I believe that the most politically significant aspect of the Prodi Commission’s record is actually in the conception of the Commission’s role: it has been seen not as a bureaucratic body, but as a political body, which has given impetus and vigour to the entire European process."
"The dialogue and cooperation between Commission and Parliament have reinforced that political core itself, that driving force of the Union which, if one adopts a European and federalist vision, as I do, is the only approach which can truly turn Europe into a great supranational political power."
"At times this may have annoyed certain national governments, but there is no doubt that it has represented a great step forward for the Union, and it has been put on an official footing for the first time in the new principles of the Constitutional Treaty."
"Of course, Europe still has difficult challenges ahead in creating peace and security, in combating terrorism in a truly effective way, and not with war, and in restoring impetus to our societies and economies along the Lisbon lines."
"But these are challenges that can be met only if we have stronger institutions, as you said, and a more united Europe, and this is the approach that the Prodi Commission has adopted in its patient and resolute work."
"I would therefore like to see Parliament extend its thanks to you and all the Commissioners, as is indeed happening."
"As far as I am concerned in particular – since five years ago I had the honour, together with Chancellor Schroeder, to put your name forward as Commission President at the Berlin European Council and as I also nominated Mario Monti – I would like to say to you, Romano, and to Mario Monti, that Italy feels honoured by the way in which you, in your European labours, have been a model of the best pro-European and democratic traditions of our country."
"Mr President, Mr Prodi, the last five years have been filled with changes and on some occasions with dramatic events: the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, 11 September and international terrorism, which reached right to the heart of Europe with the Madrid massacre."
"In the face of these challenges, the Member States have not always responded with one voice."
"But the Commission under your command has firmly held its course in the direction of an ever greater and more unified Europe."
"Indeed, no one can deny that you have achieved historic goals, which are certain to change for ever the conception of Europe and its role on the international stage."
"Thanks to your actions, the Commission has regained impetus, respectability and authority."
"The unification of Europe that has been achieved through the accession of ten new countries, the greatest enlargement ever seen in history, has healed the scars of fifty years of divisions and has been the political response to the end of the Cold War."
"The introduction of the euro and its performance on the international markets has increased Europe’s economic stature worldwide and today these are fundamental ingredients for the strengthening of our continent in an era of economic interdependence and globalisation."
"The neighbourhood policy has made it possible to stabilise the Balkans and Europe’s borders."
"Finally, the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe is an historic step and for us represents a new starting point on the route towards the goal of political integration."
"These objectives would not have been achieved without your leadership, your moral integrity and your dedication to the cause of the European Union."
"Our group therefore thanks you for the vision and courage you have displayed over the last five years, laying the foundations for a Europe which is more united within and a leading player on the world stage."
"If I had to sum it all up in two words, I would know exactly which ones to choose: ‘mission accomplished’"
"Mr President, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, there is a consistent thread running through your work and that of the Commission: the desire for Europe’s political union."
"We pursued this demanding objective together with you in having Italy join the euro."
"Thanks to you, Mr Prodi, today we can say that the political union of Europe is closer, and for this very reason I do not believe it is worthwhile repeating the goals that have been achieved in the political and institutional spheres."
"On the other hand, it is worth noting what we still lack in order to have peace as an objective and as a tool with which to resolve political conflicts throughout the world and to achieve true multipolarism as rapidly as possible, with a view to combating the clash between civilisations that is the fruit of preventive war and of terrorism."
"A Europe of social and individual rights, work for all, a modern and efficient welfare state, a multiracial and multicultural society, where each person’s rights become the wealth of all."
"Thank you, Mr Prodi, for what you have done."
"We have been and will continue to be critical on many issues, we have had and will continue to have differing opinions, but we are and will continue to be united for the Europe of peace and progress which we would like to create."
"In view of recent events, we are sure we will miss you."
"Mr President, I wish to begin with some congratulatory remarks."
"One of your key aims was successful enlargement of the European Union."
"In May this year the EU welcomed ten new Member States in the largest expansion since its creation."
"This was a historic moment in the post-Cold War history of our continent and it is only right to acknowledge your role in attaining this political milestone."
"I also wish to say that the Commission has developed some, at least, of the more liberal economic strategies that your successor has now pledged to advance. The Lisbon Strategy was embarked upon under your watch but, sadly, too little progress has been made and Mr Wim Kok’s report to the Council in November will probably reveal this."
"However, the positive remarks about the Commission end there."
"For the past five years the Commission has become fatally addicted to constitutional change."
"When you spoke to Parliament in 2000, setting out your priorities as President, you said: ‘Europe’s citizens are disenchanted and anxious."
"They have lost faith in the European institutions’."
"I am afraid that the intervening period has brought us the Constitutional Convention, the IGC and what may eventually be an EU Constitution."
"It is clear from the turnout in this year’s European elections that this process has failed to inspire."
"Indeed, it has reinforced the perception across Europe that institutions like the Commission are too self-serving."
"In that 2000 speech you also said that a simple benchmark of whether the EU had delivered would be a higher turnout in the 2004 European Parliamentary elections."
"One of the key reasons for your goal not being reached has been this obsession with constitutional change, which means very little to our constituents."
"At the same time – and it saddens me to say this, particularly as Vice-President Kinnock is sitting alongside you in the Chamber – too little progress has been made on the reform of the Commission."
"I regret to say that all this was inevitable, because over the past 12 months the Commission has been rudderless."
"I make no apology for saying that this is in large measure due to your decision to spend a significant amount of your time attacking Mr Berlusconi, the Italian Prime Minister, and constructing alliances to challenge him."
"These activities have undermined the impartiality of the office of the President of the Commission and have ensured that the Commission has come to be seen as something of a lame duck."
"All presidents are entitled to their political opinions, but I regret to say that your political interventions have been …"
"Mr President, President of the Commission, I remember the state of mind that prevailed in this House five years ago when you assumed your responsibilities."
"This Parliament was then in a rather paradoxical situation."
"The problem was that it had for too long been too indulgent towards the institution to which it was closest, namely your own."
"Because it had been too indulgent, Parliament had suddenly had to bang its fist on the table and almost censure your predecessor."
"You arrived filled with a spirit of distrust of our institution because, ever since we had ceased to be indulgent and had banged our fists on the table, the Commission saw us as a threat and seemed to tremble whenever our institution took the slightest initiative."
"For your part, the governing idea of your legislature was that you would be the government of Europe."
"Since then, it seems to me that matters have righted themselves."
"You have renewed the closeness that existed between our two institutions, and you have not become the government of Europe, with or without the Draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, which our nations are now asked to consider."
"You have presided over a college. I should like to salute the track records of a number of its members and, as you will not be surprised to hear, particularly of Mr Vitorino, Mr Lamy, Mr Verheugen, Mr Almunia and his predecessor, and Mr Busquin."
"I believe that it is thanks to the energy of these Commissioners, and of a number of others, that the college over which you have presided has been able to achieve its, and your, present track record."
"Next, I wish to commend one particular feature of your term of office: almost paradoxically, a sometimes too visionary form of perhaps unwarranted intelligence."
"I refer to three of your experiments."
"The first is the occasion on which you appointed a group of ‘wise men’ around Mr Dehaene who, intelligently enough, had proposed that our documents be divided into two parts and that our common policies be revised to reflect the majority opinion."
"There were also the Sapir and Penelope reports."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate you for having presided over a Commission that has contributed so much to the political unification of Europe."
"Under your Presidency the old question of whether Europe can 'widen' and 'deepen' at the same time, which is one that plagued most of your predecessors, has been answered decisively and positively."
"I wonder, on the basis of your five years' experience at the head of the Executive, what your top tip would be for your successor as regards the conduct of relations with this Parliament?"
"I should like to end by wishing you personal success."
"There has only been one former President of the Commission who succeeded in carrying on a political career after retiring from the Commission."
"That was Roy Jenkins, who showed the British that Europe is so important to their national life that radical political change also had to take place inside his own country."
"Mr President, President of the Commission, over recent years Europe has taken many steps forward and some important goals have been achieved: reunification with the eastern countries, the birth of the euro, the signing of the first Constitution; these were achieved through the commitment of all the Union’s institutions: Commission, Council and Parliament."
"I have to be equally honest and say that other objectives which fall within the Commission’s remit have been disregarded."
"First, the Lisbon tasks have been trivialised, and the spring reports have often disappointed us; secondly, in industrial policy there has been a lack of activity in making proposals and planning; thirdly, with regard to legislative activity, the annual programmes have never topped 50%; fourthly, with regard to the reform of the Commission, there has been too much parachuting in from above to fill appointments."
"To sum up, over these last five years there have been many shadows which have dimmed the good work done by so many Commissioners, starting with Mrs Loyola de Palacio."
"For all that, Mr Prodi, your term of office had begun with the best possible omens."
"Parliament had given you its almost unanimous approval."
"Even we, your political opponents in Italy, had given you our vote of confidence for the sake of the greater interests of the European Union and of our country."
"We wanted to show you that national polemics is one thing, but that the leadership of the European institutions is quite another."
"Because of our great sense of responsibility, we have never withdrawn our support from you in this Chamber."
"You, on the other hand, have preferred to use your prestigious post in order to carry out political activities in Italy directed against the government and to take on the leadership of the opposition."
"We have been deeply saddened by this."
"We would have preferred to see you adopt an attitude like that of Jacques Delors, who forsook the leadership of the commune of Clichy before taking on the presidency of the Commission."
"That was an overt way of making it clear that leading the Commission cannot be combined with participating in national politics."
"–Mr President, Members of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, defending the Lisbon Strategy in economic and political terms, in difficult times, is a significant matter."
"I would furthermore like to remind everyone of the reform of the telecommunications sector."
"This is a huge legislative package which has raised our status once again, for example, as a legislator on the world stage, and in putting us in a position to compete once more with the United States."
"Monopolies and duopolies have been dissolved to the benefit of consumers and users, which is important."
"This has been a great achievement."
"We have achieved just as much with regard to energy issues as well."
"We are now acquiring and constructing Trans-European energy networks."
"All of us understand how important this is for a reliable and consumer-friendly system."
"We should be taking better care of those people who, as the barriers come down, remain on the wrong side of our internal borders."
"It is a fact that intellectual and social barriers are becoming ever more rigid."
"Enlargement is an important matter, and we are now reaping its benefits: equality and justice."
"It should make these qualities visible outside Europe as well."
"For this reason I would say that sexual discrimination on the part of the Commission, for example, is an intolerable idea, and this Parliament will not be able to co-exist with a Commission that acts in such a way."
"Mr President, taking my cue from the experience I have had in recent years at the head of a local authority in Italy’s Mezzogiorno, I would like to emphasise one of the elements of the Prodi Commission which has been undeniably positive: the constant attention paid to local authorities and above all to the regions, which, with Agenda 2000, have truly become the main players in European cohesion policy."
"The outlying areas welcomed the working method based on a permanent dialogue with the regions and local authorities, a method which was confirmed by the Commission in its communication of December 2003 and also evidenced by the call to local authority representatives, under the title ‘A thousand debates for Europe’ on the subject of the Constitution, which you launched, Mr Prodi, together with Mr Cox, Parliament’s former president, and the President of the Committee of the Regions."
"Over these past years, with the White Paper on the new system of governance, the Commission has tackled the problem of the EU democratic deficit, relaunching the concept of grassroots democracy."
"With EU policies it has helped the weakest European regions to create institutions to promote development and has introduced a culture of planning, assessment and assimilation of intervention."
"Mr President, the European Commission under Romano Prodi’s leadership is finishing its term."
"It is true that during the term in office of this particular Commission the largest EU enlargement was carried out successfully and my homeland, Lithuania, became a fully-fledged member of the European Union."
"It is most likely that in the near future the name of Romano Prodi will be in the textbooks of Lithuanian children."
"Nevertheless, I would like to make a few comments about one of the Commission’s responsibilities: external relations, and especially the European neighbourhood policy, mentioned by Mr Prodi today."
"This policy, which is of the greatest importance, seeks not just to extend the borders of the EU, but also to extend the area of peace and stability in Europe."
"It is a fact that sometimes our neighbours are countries with a highly developed bureaucracy and controlled democracy."
"Sometimes these are countries where human rights are undermined and violated every day, for example Belarus."
"The European Parliament resolution on EU-Russia policy states that this policy is far from adequate: objectives are not clearly defined, there is a lack of internal coherence, interests and values are not effectively promoted."
"If one looks at the figures on financial assistance for strengthening democracy in Belarus and guaranteeing civil and human rights, comparing the United States of America and the EU one might question whether Belarus is on the eastern border of the United States or the EU."
"I would add Moldova to this list, given that so far there is no EU permanent representation in that country."
"Only six EU Member States have embassies there, in comparison to the presence of EU representatives in many countries that are quite a distance from the EU and are not very important players at all."
"I wish to finish by saying that I sincerely hope that the Lisbon Strategy, with all the high expectations placed in it, will not become an unfinished European project, as have some promising strategies in the past."
"I wish the Members of the Commission well."
"Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Prodi Commission’s term of office will go down in history as the time of the largest and most crucial enlargement in the history of the EU."
"This enlargement brought into the EU countries which were once divided from it by the Iron Curtain."
"Yet although the enlargement itself was a success for the Prodi Commission, it is hard to view the conditions upon which it was carried out as such."
"The Commission imposed tough and unfair negotiating conditions on the candidate countries, and the process of achieving full membership rights and levelling out development differences will be a long one."
"The firmly established division into an old EU and a new EU will cause problems for us all, and it is a pity that this historic opportunity was not exploited fully."
"There was a lack of political imagination, and of a vision of a Europe fully committed to solidarity."
"As a Polish MEP, I am concerned by the tenor of certain changes in agricultural policy."
"Liberalisation and a departure from the previous protection of the EU agricultural market are a blow to European agriculture, and most of all to farmers in the new Member States."
"Polish farmers must face up to competition which is doubly unfair."
"They have to compete on unfair terms both within the EU, as Poland receives significantly lower subsidies, and globally, as the EU is opening up to the global market on a massive scale."
"Measures to fight global poverty must not be implemented at the cost of perpetuating or intensifying poverty within the EU."
"The sugar market reforms proposed by the Commission will result in the bankruptcy of a large part of the European sugar industry, and could lead to utter disaster for farmers and producers in Poland."
"As Polish members of the People’s Party, we want nothing to do with such reforms and such a policy."
"On the other hand, we very much welcome the Commission’s refusal to give in to pressure to reduce the EU budget."
"Such a reduction could rob enlargement of its economic sense, and eventually of its political sense also."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Prodi on having accomplished his mission."
"Mr President, we have an historic enlargement behind us which is one of the reasons why we are now living in a Europe that is better than ever and better for our generation than for any previous generation."
"For that, I think that the Commission and the Member States deserve both thanks and congratulations."
"At the same time, it is a new Europe that is faced with new challenges, and it also has to be said that the present Commission has not been equally successful at dealing with many of those challenges, specifically when it comes to being able to rise above the temptations of national party politics."
"If this cannot be done, there will be insufficient impetus for pressing ahead with the European project of unification."
"We are concerned here with the ability to drive the Lisbon process forward."
"We now face the challenge of ensuring that enlargement is successful in a real, and not just a formal, sense."
"This demands a Lisbon process ensuring that all parts of the EU can become progressively more competitive and that the new Member States are given the opportunity to grow on their own terms, and not on someone else’s."
"It also makes demands of our ability to operate in an international context."
"The European Union must have a credible policy for the Middle East, and that is why it is important for the EU to have the strength and ability to identify those threats to peace that exist."
"The big threat to peace in the Middle East lies not with the small democracy there but with the big dictatorships."
"It lies, in particular, with a country that openly supports terrorism, that has the open aim of destroying another country and that constantly shows the extent to which it is equipped with nuclear and medium-range weapons."
"I believe that the European Union must also develop a policy for the Middle East that dares to get to grips with the problems that Iran now presents."
"Mr President, during the period when Mr Delors led the Commission, Europe witnessed the fall of communism, the restoration of democracy in the East, the emergence of new states, and, concomitantly, the initiation of the political process leading to the unification of Europe."
"The presidency of Mr Santer saw the evolution of the process of bringing the candidate states into the greatest enlargement of the European Union in its history."
"Mr President, under your presidency, after exacting negotiations and accommodations, the ten new Member States have become fully fledged members of the European Union with the expectation that this foundation will result in a truly united Europe, built not just by professional Europeans, but by its citizens, both men and women."
"As I have, on various occasions and in different functions, had the opportunity to participate in this process on the Slovenian side, I am aware of just how much will, coordination, and mutual attention this project has demanded."
"Mr President, I am pleased that the Commission has followed the vision and the priorities that you set out from the very beginning of your presidency, and I am also pleased that your efforts have left a powerful impression on this unique period in the development of the European Union and on European history."
"Please allow me, as leader of the Slovene delegation in the PPE-DE, to express my sincere gratitude for your contribution and particularly for the attention that you have shown towards Slovenia."
"I would also like to thank you for emphasising, with your presence on 1 May 2004 at the celebration marking the enlargement of Europe on the Slovene-Italian border, the south-western edge of the former Iron Curtain, that the era of totalitarianism and a divided Europe was over."
"Allow me, as a former member of the presidency of the European Convention, to express my recognition of the excellent contribution of the European Commission to the agreement reached on the European Constitution."
". Mr President, I will be very brief because I have taken note of the remarks and advice addressed to me and it does not seem to me that it is necessary to give an analytical response now."
"I have noted and digested what you have all said on industrial development, on the need for an economic upturn in Europe and on the fact that the rules which apply to industry ought not to act as a brake on this development."
"The same applies to the suggestions concerning energy, the environment and the progress to be made."
"Instead, I would like to conclude simply with a remark and with my thanks."
"The remark is this: all your speeches – even those that contained criticisms or particular points of view – at bottom were conscious of the fact that the European model has a special character and that we have given the world a lesson in how to achieve progress using a method which is not only the traditional one of power politics, and to do so without being under any illusions, without believing that we are something we are not and without believing that the world is other than it is."
"The priority that we give to multilateralism, our way of seeing the world as a single whole, for the first time ever in so many different realms – that of the environment, the economy, energy – and therefore trying to find working methods that are suited to this view: this is the extraordinary contribution that Europe is striving to give to the globalised world."
"I have quite rightly heard criticism with regard to globalisation: but globalisation exists and is increasing."
"The problem is to interpret it, and only the European method has done this so far."
"Why?"
"Because we have given an example through the way in which we are uniting together and now, at the end of my mandate, I would like to repeat the true, unique, great definition of Europe, which I learnt when I went to the Romanian parliament for the first talks in the negotiations."
"On that occasion I was told: ‘We want to join Europe because Europe is a union of minorities; it is a union in which no one is the arbiter of the others, no one has power over the others’."
"We are, truly, small and large countries gathered in this great, difficult balancing act, and this is a lesson for the world, a great lesson that we are giving."
"Then there are obviously also failures, individual aspects, the difficulties inherent in translating these aspirations and feelings into everyday policy."
"It is an effort, however, that is being increasingly understood."
"In recent weeks I went to the countries of the Caucasus and saw the national flag flying next to the European flag, for no reason at all, if not for that feeling of being safe next to a great structure that has no colonial desires, no desires for domination or desires for supremacy: this is the lesson that we can give to the world."
"This is what we have tried to do in the Commission, within limits and with shortcomings, naturally, but with an enormous sense of harmony."
"In this Commission you have never perceived disputes or tensions; we have never acted spitefully towards each other."
"Perhaps we too have been influenced by that European spirit of being a union of minorities in the Commission itself, and thus absorbing this lesson which, in my opinion, is the greatest legacy that we can give to all the world’s citizens."
"I would like to end with thanks for your cooperation, for your comprehension, and also for having tolerated some excesses and some choices with which you have not agreed, but whose spirit you have perhaps understood: in truth, if we do not have a strong and politically robust Parliament and a strong and politically robust Commission in the future, it will be difficult for us to achieve our objectives, objectives which – as I can see – we truly all share."
"Thank you very much, Mr Prodi."
"The debate is closed."
"– The policies promoted by the outgoing Commission had an adverse impact on the working classes and grass roots sections of society."
"The militarisation of the ΕU proceeded at a fast pace and the EU participated in or tolerated imperialist wars, interested only in its share of the spoils."
"Using 'terrorism' as a pretext, it reinforced and created new mechanisms to repress human rights and freedoms. It adopted the US doctrine of 'preventive war'."
"The Commission contributed to and promoted a deeply reactionary Constitutional Treaty, which will create new ordeals for the workers."
"The ΕU took action to increase the power and profits of big business."
"The consequences are unbearable for the working classes and grass roots sections of society."
"The 'miracle' of EMU signalled new austerity programmes and new programmes to reduce the purchasing power of grass-roots families, massacre the social and political rights which the working classes have fought for, keep unemployment high and cut social spending under the Stability Pact."
"The implementation of the Lisbon strategy confirmed the objective of increasing the profitability of big business by reducing wage costs and creating conditions of insecurity and uncertainty for workers."
"Mr Barroso has stated that he intends to continue at a fast pace with the same anti-grass roots policy."
"The grass-roots movement in Europe is growing stronger and is putting up resistance."
"This is where the people's hope lies for a Europe of peace and grass-roots rights, a socialist Europe."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in the Middle East."
". Mr President, before discussing the subject now on the agenda, and since this is the first time I have appeared before this Parliament which was elected before the summer, I would like to repeat what I said five years ago – on the first occasion I appeared in Parliament: that I will assist and cooperate with this House in every way I can in relation to the issues that fall within my competence."
"I would also like to wish all of you every success, and I hope that through the work of everybody, of all the institutions working together, we can realise the dream we all share: a better Europe at the service of the citizens and also a better Europe at the service of the world."
"I regret, Mr President, that my first appearance before the honourable Members relates to an issue that has caused so much emotion, so much frustration and so much passion over recent years."
"The issue of the Middle East has a place in the hearts of all the citizens of Europe and we feel the suffering of the peoples of that region that is so close to us as if it were our own."
"In Luxembourg last Monday, the 11th, the Council of Ministers of the European Union analysed this issue in great depth – as the honourable Members are aware – and approved a Resolution that I am not going to repeat, because I hope, and I am sure, that all of you have read it."
"I would like, however, in the short speaking time the Presidency is allowing me, to deal with three very clear and specific points so that we can focus the debate on them, if the honourable Members so wish."
"The first point is our view of the recent events that have taken place in that region; the second is to analyse the political situation both in Palestine and in Israel; and thirdly, how the European Union sees the current situation and how, amongst all of us, we might find a way to speed up the peace process and thereby put an end to this spiral of violence we are caught up in."
"With regard to the first point, that of recent events, I would like to go back, Mr President, to the last meeting of the Quartet in New York on 22 September."
"I would like to emphasise four points from the document that emerged from that meeting, because some of them are important to the subsequent debate."
"Some of these points seemed perhaps to have been forgotten or to have been put to sleep, but fortunately, thanks to that meeting of the Quartet on 22 September, they seem to have recovered their place in people’s hearts."
"Of those four points, I will comment on the following: the need for reforms within the Palestinian Authority – we all agree on this – and also our complete and utter condemnation of terrorism."
"But that resolution also talks of the need to stop the settlements, of the fact that the members of the Quartet should take note of the Decision of the International Criminal Court on the wall and that we members of the Quartet want the process of withdrawal from Gaza, which has been put into motion in Israel, to be part of broader political process and that it should genuinely lead to a resolution of the problem in its entirety."
"Since then, 22 September, the situation on the ground in Gaza has unfortunately deteriorated."
"What we have seen in recent days and weeks around Gaza has made us all suffer and, above all, has made us all reflect on what point there is to certain actions on the ground."
"It is true that at one point the violence began when Palestinian terrorists launched Qassam rockets in the north of the Gaza Strip, but it is also the case that Israel’s response has not been what we European democrats would have expected."
"It has been a response which we believe goes beyond what could be described as proportional: 119 deaths, a third of them of under-18s, amongst Palestinians; five deaths amongst Israelis, including two children."
"It is not possible to go on living in this spiral of violence, in which people die senselessly, and continue to die senselessly, and this whole process of violence does nothing to take the peace process forward a single millimetre."
"How can we stop it?"
"How can we stop this violence from continuing?"
"We in the European Union have done everything possible over these weeks – in constant contact with the authorities of Israel, Palestine, Egypt and Jordan – to see whether it is possible to bring about a comprehensive peace, a comprehensive ceasefire."
"It has been impossible."
"We have not achieved it, and we have not even managed to bring about any kind of pause in order to deal with humanitarian issues."
"We therefore feel frustration, emotion and sadness as a result of the events of recent days."
"The situation was complicated even further by the terrorist attack on Thursday night in Taba, which was also dreadful."
"It was dreadful because of its senselessness, because of the people who died, Israelis taking their holidays, Egyptians looking after hotels, some European citizens who were there on holiday."
"I would, therefore, like to express my total condemnation of this attack which made sense to the terrorists: to try to destabilise a country, Egypt, which is cooperating in the peace process in an admirable way."
"I would, therefore, once again appeal to everybody who can hear us via this European Parliament for common sense, peace, an end to the violence, so that Israel’s process of withdrawal from Gaza can go ahead in peace and tranquillity, with no more victims on any side."
"The second point I wanted to comment on is the situation in Palestine: you know it very well; you are well aware of the European Union’s position."
"Palestine now needs a government, a Palestinian Authority with the capacity to act as such, as a government. We have asked, and we will do everything to ensure, that the rules which have been more or less agreed by President Arafat be signed by him, that he turn them into reality through a Prime Minister with real powers to operate in relation to what are fundamentally the elements defining a State: security, on the one hand, and the economy on the other."
"With regard to the economic element, Mr President, I believe that our good friend the Minister for Finance is doing an admirable job."
"Everybody knows this."
"In the realm of security, however, there remains much to be done, and it is the responsibility of President Arafat to delegate real powers to his Prime Minister in relation to security; so that he can act and actually does act by means of his Interior Minister."
"Until this happens, it will be more difficult to combat terrorism, to control the situation in terms of terrorism, peace and order in the occupied territories."
"I would also like to say that it is very important that there be a clear interlocutor on the Palestinian side."
"Israel keeps saying day after day that it cannot find an interlocutor with whom it can discuss the peace process. This may become an excuse for those people who do not want to make progress, and the Palestinians should be capable of organising their own political life in such a way that that excuse cannot be used by those who do not want the peace process to move forward."
"I would, therefore, like once again to appeal on behalf of the European Union – just as my personal delegate, Mr Marc Otte, is currently doing in Palestine – for a Palestinian Authority capable of carrying out its responsibilities in terms of internal reforms."
"It is not just in Palestine, however, that a situation of this nature is arising."
"I would like to point out that Israel is also currently experiencing a degree of political instability; this may also have repercussions for some of the measures being taken at the moment."
"The negative vote two days ago in the Knesset raises a political problem for Prime Minister Sharon with regard to the decisions to be taken on the plan to withdraw from Gaza: the essential vote on funding, on the process of disengagement from Gaza, I believe, is also creating difficulties within Israeli political society."
"Over the coming weeks, therefore, it is very likely that we will see new political realignments in Israel, which may even lead to the formation of a new coalition government."
"In any event, however, it is also very probable that the elections scheduled for 2006 may have to be brought forward to 2005 for the reasons I have just explained."
"Anyway, as far as we are concerned the important thing is that the peace process does not move any slower than it is at the moment."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the road map talked of a peace process that should lead to two States by the end of 2005."
"The most we will have in 2005 is the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, nothing more."
"And that is a great failure on all our parts and very specifically on the part of Israel and Palestine and on the part of the Quartet and the international community."
"I would also like to say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that the recent statements made by certain Israeli politicians are not acceptable to the European Union."
"The nerve of these statements is completely unacceptable, to us at least."
"To say these things about the meaning of disengagement from Gaza, the meaning of a complete and utter rejection of the road map, which the Israeli Government has endorsed, seems to me to be something we must condemn in the clearest possible terms."
"We cannot accept that way of working in politics."
"That kind of statement leads to a lack of trust, not only amongst us, but throughout the Arab world, in the neighbouring countries, amongst the Palestinians themselves and amongst a large section of Israeli society, and we cannot go on like that."
"To say one thing and then say the opposite in the newspapers is not an honest way to behave in politics."
"And it is not just any person who is saying it, but a person of weight, a significant and important person, one of the closest people to the Prime Minister of Israel."
"Having said that, the question we are all asking is: what should we do?"
"What can we do from a European point of view?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, the European Union has a clear direction, set out in the road map, which is also the result of the efforts of the Europeans, the Americans, the United Nations and the Russian Federation."
"We shall defend it from the beginning to the end and we will not be in agreement with anybody who does not defend it from the beginning to the end."
"We do, and, therefore, anything we are able or wish to contribute at this point, we will contribute within the framework of that road map."
"What could we do to speed up this process in the short and medium term?"
"I believe that in the short term we should work on four areas, with a view to ratifying them and implementing them at the next Council of Ministers in March, and certainly at the March European Council."
"The first is security."
"The European Union has the will and has a plan and an approach to help the Palestinian Authority to improve its situation in terms of policing; so that it can carry out its duties in a serious and rigorous manner, in accordance with law and order, and combating terrorism."
"We are prepared to do so."
"We have a plan for doing so, we have the people to do it and we have the will to do it."
"Secondly, reforms."
"The European Union is going to help the Palestinian Authority in every way it can to ensure that the process of reform which has begun is carried through to its conclusion."
"The leaders of the Palestinian Authority have our absolute assurance that, if they want to progress towards reform, we will always stand by them."
"Thirdly, actions of an economic nature."
"Commissioner Patten will talk about this in more detail, but, in any event, you must be aware that we are prepared to continue helping to ensure that, from an economic point of view, this peace process does not have to suffer from a lack of resources from the European Union."
"We must also say clearly, however, that the European citizens, who pay taxes in Europe, cannot be paying out money permanently if the operations being funded do not lead to the desired objective, which is peace."
"And I would like to point out that, if the process of disengagement from Gaza is aimed solely and exclusively at Gaza, the citizens and leaders of Israel must be in no doubt that they cannot count on the European Union's money."
"The Gaza process must be part of a longer process, a process that truly leads to two States, which is the fundamental objective of the road map."
"Fourthly, and finally, I believe we must work seriously on the electoral process."
"We must help to establish an electoral process in the Territories which the Palestinians can lead; to establish an electoral commission which is reliable and which has the trust of the people, so that the electoral process can create a leadership – the leadership the Palestinian citizens want – which can lead that country towards its ultimate dream, a dream many of us share, the dream of two States."
"I have said this in relation to the short term, Mr President."
"Can we continue with just a gradual, step-by-step method, or has the time come to do more?"
"Or has the time come to take a greater leap, to play a much more courageous role, if that is possible, but one which leads much more quickly to a definitive solution?"
"We believe it has, that the step-by-step approach, the small step by small step approach, is surely about to come to an end, and that, within the context of the road map, progress can be made, or made more quickly, if the political will is there."
"We have that will and, once the elections have taken place in the United States of America, we will try to continue working with them, with our Russian friends and with our friends in the United Nations, to see whether it is possible to speed up the road map, so that this slowness which leads to suffering and frustration – and nothing positive for the Palestinians, nor for the Israelis, nor for the region, nor for us or our societies – comes to an end and much quicker progress genuinely begins and leads us to what we all dream of, which is – as I have said before – the two States."
"We have talked a lot about the two States, but we have never defined the form the Palestinian State should take, what borders it should have."
"All of these issues remain open and have not been closed."
"I would like to say once again that, from the European Union’s point of view, some of the elements of the final debate on these parameters are clear to us."
"We believe the borders of this Palestinian State must be the 1967 borders."
"We state this very clearly, we said it on Monday at the meeting of Foreign Affairs Ministers, we have said it through the European Council and we are repeating it today formally in this House."
"And, on the basis of those 1967 borders, the two parties must negotiate any exchanges of territory they consider necessary."
"But that must be the basis for the negotiation and progress must be made on that basis – and I hope we can do so before the end of the year – and we must find a way to make more direct and rapid progress towards defining the final parameters, which can make this dream shared by so many people a reality and lead to a political process that contradicts some of the statements made over recent days by responsible and respectable people on behalf of Israel."
"Having spoken, as we have in recent days, to the leaders of Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, I would like to point out that they all have the same feeling that, without knowing exactly where we are going, nor what the borders of the new Palestinian State are, nor when that leap forward is going to happen, the stability of their own countries is to a certain degree in jeopardy."
"Jordan is essentially a country whose borders are yet to be defined, which does yet know who its neighbour is going to be and which wants to know, and has the right to know, what the borders of its new neighbour, the Palestinian State, are going to be."
"Mr President, the situation – as I have said – is sad and frustrating for those who have dedicated so many hours of their lives to trying to find a path to peace."
"It is important that a solution is found, because the whole of the Middle East – not just the peace process, but the whole of the Middle East – has been plunged into a profound crisis and we all want to get out of it."
"But we will probably have to do this by means of a faster and more effective peace process, with more involvement by the international community and by the fundamental players, which are Israel and Palestine."
"Mr President, I have little more to say to you this afternoon, but I would like to say from the bottom of my heart that we will continue working between now and the next Council of Ministers to see whether we can implement a small plan which, within the context of the road map, can speed up the process in the way I have described to this House."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the sadness, frustration, and at the same time emotion, that all these issues bring to anybody who discusses them – including all of you – I would say to you once again that we shall continue to work day and night to achieve that objective."
"Mr President, divine intervention notwithstanding, I imagine that this will be the last speech – certainly on the Middle East – that I make in this House."
"I have lost count of the number of debates on this subject there have been since I took office."
"On a sensitive issue like this, it is only natural that our exchanges have sometimes been a little difficult."
"I hope that they have been of some use."
"I certainly hope they have not done any damage."
"As I approach the end of my term as a Commissioner – I underline ‘as a Commissioner’ – I have started going to the theatre again."
"I recently saw a new interpretation by that admirable Irish playwright, Frank McGuinness, of Hecuba by Euripides."
"The classicists and theatregoers among you may recall that this is a bleak and bloody drama of death, hate and revenge."
"Perhaps all too suitably for this production, the backdrop to the stage was a tall black wall inscribed with the names of the Israelis and Palestinians who have died in the last few years – hatred, revenge and blood."
"It is certainly true, looking back, that despite the heroic efforts of my friend and colleague the High Representative and others we unfortunately have scant progress to report."
"Just the other day, as the High Representative pointed out, we saw the dreadful massacre of Israeli tourists in Egypt."
"Time and again one hope after another has been dashed."
"We had Camp David, Taba and the understandings reached there, and excellent reports from Mitchell, Tennet and Zinni, all of which were to no avail."
"Indeed, since Taba the sombre balance is that a total of 4 360 people have died: 1 026 Israelis and 3 334 Palestinians."
"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth – after which, as Gandhi said, everybody ends up blind."
"Innocent children for innocent children."
"The latest initiative is Prime Minister Sharon’s proposals for unilateral disengagement in Gaza."
"Any steps towards withdrawal from occupied territory – albeit limited – are to be welcomed."
"However, there are, as the High Representative pointed out, many questions that need to be clarified, not least in the broader context of the roadmap."
"Although we have our reservations, this initiative does foresee the beginning of the removal of settlements – an important aspect and one in line with what we have been saying for a very long time."
"Therefore, we are prepared to give it a try, although we have to be clear, as the High Representative said, that the parties will factor in the five elements which the European Council has identified as being essential for the plan to work."
"We must insist that those points are respected."
"The scepticism that has undoubtedly surrounded this initiative has increased, as the High Representative very diplomatically said, as a result of the extraordinary remarks made recently by the Israeli Prime Minister’s Chief of Staff and senior adviser, which have been deeply damaging."
"I hope that despite such remarks the two-state solution continues to be recognised as the only hope for an end to the conflict."
"To be realistic, we should not expect too much – except, alas, perhaps more death and destruction – until after the US presidential elections."
"Even then it would be unwise to expect miracles."
"However, at the very least the international community should engage boldly with the Israeli Government to establish its commitment to the two-state solution, and with the Palestinians to establish their commitment to security and reform."
"That is the only way to end the conflict."
"The roadmap shows how to do it, so the challenge for the European Union is to steer the parties and others in the international community towards the roadmap."
"Otherwise people may come to believe that Mr Weisglass was right and that his only mistake was to let the cat out of the bag."
"During the course of my mandate, I have tried with the support of the majority of Parliament to build a reformed Palestinian Authority capable of governing Palestine in due course and of negotiating and reaching a settlement with Israel."
"During that period the Israeli Government has been seeking to marginalise President Arafat himself."
"However, at the end of the day President Arafat is still there while, unfortunately, the Palestinian Authority itself has been battered to pieces."
"I accept that President Arafat might be part of the problem, but he is not the only problem."
"What I have always been clear about is that a reformed Palestinian Authority is part of the solution."
"It is not clear whether, under the current internal and external circumstances, the Palestinian Authority is in much of a position to deliver on a two-state solution."
"The deadly combination of too little action on the Palestinian side and what has perhaps been too much action on the Israeli side, has quite successfully destroyed most of the authority that the Palestinian Authority might otherwise have had."
"We need to find a way to give the Palestinian Authority more political room for manoeuvre and to do this in return for cast-iron guarantees on security and reform."
"The High Representative noted the general work that we have done to support economic development as well as institutional development and humanitarian relief in Palestine."
"This Union has done far more than anyone else."
"This Parliament has voted for and supported far more assistance than anybody else has provided."
"I expect that this Parliament will now start asking itself some searching questions about the continuation of assistance on the present scale."
"Let me make one obvious point."
"We are the biggest supporters of the World Bank's Palestinian Development Fund."
"To say we are the biggest supporters is in fact an understatement."
"Hardly anyone else is contributing any money to it at all."
"We want to see that money used to lay the foundations for an economy in the Palestinian territories that can provide jobs, revenues and at least a modicum of economic growth so that people can live a better life with greater dignity, have a better chance of a job, and so on."
"We are all entitled to question whether that money will be nugatory expenditure, and whether any expenditure will be worthwhile unless we can obtain certain guarantees from Israel on its withdrawal from Gaza, on the way that is going to be handled, and on Gaza's medium- and long-term prospects."
"I am sure Parliament would not want to feel that we were simply footing the bill for the consequences of whatever the Israeli Defence Forces did."
"We have to make it clear that our role – the role we want to play in helping to support reconstruction – must be dependent on a real political dialogue with the Israeli authorities."
"Otherwise the money will simply be wasted, in the same way that too much of what we have done already has been wasted."
"I repeat that, working on the basis of the report by the Council on Foreign Relations, working on the basis of the work initiated by Mr Rocard and his colleagues on that Council, we have done more than anyone else to put in place reformed institutions in Palestine."
"I salute the work of people like Mr Salam Fayyad, who has bravely tried to ensure that Palestine has a decent and transparent government."
"It must be said, however, that without political progress, without an improvement in the security situation and without a more effective dialogue with Israel, it is going to be incredibly difficult to continue to justify that sort of help and that sort of expenditure."
"There is no more important problem facing the international community than this one, not only because of the bloodshed that it continues to produce, unresolved, but also because of the damage it does to the relationship between the West and the Islamic world."
"Nobody should be in any doubt at all about the impact of the struggle between Israel and Palestine and about the impact that it has on attitudes in the Islamic world."
"We must work even harder to try to shape the parameters of a solution to this bloody conflict."
"If we do not succeed in that then to return to what is – I think – the last line of Euripedes’ Hecuba: ‘fate compels and none can resist’."
"Bloodshed after bloodshed after bloodshed, revenge after revenge after revenge, unless people in Washington, in Europe and, above all, in Israel and Palestine, have the political courage to try to deliver what their people deserve and what the whole world requires."
"– Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, you have said that this was your last speech in this House, and I think that many of us feel – as I myself do despite our many differences of opinion – that you were one of the most important and outstanding personalities in this Commission, who gave foreign policy a quite special edge, for which I would like to thank you most warmly on behalf of our group."
"The occasion for today’s debate is, as is invariable in the case of matters of topical and urgent importance, an escalation of violence."
"Rarely do we have good news to announce about the Middle East; on the contrary, the situation is often a very grave one."
"Hamas rockets landing on Israeli towns, excessive military actions and then the attack in Taba, in Taba of all places, a place associated with so many peace agreements, peace negotiations and concepts of peace. In Israel’s neighbour, Egypt, a new dimension of terror waged against innocent civilians, Europeans, Egyptians and Israelis, brings home to us the whole tragedy of the situation, and so I agree with what Mr Solana has had to say here today, that the road map is still the only way ahead."
"Mr Sharon, the Prime Minister, spoke about this on Monday in the Knesset, and I believe that we Europeans should also insist on that; it is this position that unites the Council, the Commission and Parliament."
"And the road map means a two-state solution, ultimately a Palestinian state and an Israeli state."
"What must now happen in the coming weeks?"
"I am very grateful to Mr Solana for having, today, reminded us in very clear terms of Arafat’s responsibility; for reminding us that the Prime Minister must now be able to function independently; that the security forces, too, must be taken out of Mr Arafat’s control and made subject to an independent police authority, with all the powers needed to combat terrorism."
"You then had something to say about money and economic cooperation."
"In recent years, we have gained the impression that the more the situation escalated, the more money Europe gave, in order to try and bring about social stability."
"It would be a good thing, though, for the police forces to be reformed and for Europe to then provide more funds for reconstruction, so that it becomes clear to the people on the ground that where peace is, there is also aid from Europe, but that it is not unconditional and not at any cost."
"For that reason, our group endorses the courses of action you have outlined, and we wish you much success in carrying them out."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the people of Europe ask, when foreign policy is being debated, why they should be interested in it."
"What, they ask, do we as Europeans actually have to do with the topic?"
"The sense of not being involved is something I frequently experience when I meet visitors who have come to listen to debates in this House."
"‘What business is that of ours, actually?’"
"Let me pick up on something that Commissioner Patten said, that, if peace in the Middle East is unattainable or hard to achieve, it is, in the long term, our own security that is also increasingly destabilised as a result of the increasing radicalisation of people which is associated with the failure to achieve peace."
"There is a causal connection between this regional conflict and worldwide radicalisation."
"For that reason, we Europeans are directly affected, and that is why we are part of the road map, to which – as everyone has said – there can be no alternative."
"It is good that the Prime Minister of Israel, in his statement on Monday, gave his backing to it."
"Commissioner Patten, you referred to Hecuba."
"Rather than delve so deeply into the world of drama, I just want to quote a sentence that I cannot get out of my head about terrorism and torture."
"It is this: ‘At the end of any series of cruel acts, their source no longer matters; we just want them to stop.’"
"That is how many of the people affected feel, and it is understandable, but it is not enough."
"That statement is inadequate, for those who commit the acts of cruelty need to be shown where the limits are."
"Those who understand only the language of violence – and they are present on both sides – need to be isolated."
"It is true to say that the reform of the security forces is tied together with this phenomenon."
"Reforming the security forces and the police means playing a part in ensuring that the scope available to the men of violence for their activities is limited."
"The radicals can, above all, be kept in check by working hand in hand with the moderates."
"That Egypt and other moderate Arab states have offered to cooperate with Israel in bringing about a ceasefire is a good sign, but it is an offer that the Israeli side must accept."
"There must then be a dialogue between equals, rather than exclusive negotiations in which mutual dialogue is abandoned when demands are made and not met."
"We, then, as Europeans, need the courage to encourage and openly back those in the region who are prepared to commence dialogue with one another, without preconditions if at all possible."
"That is the substantial contribution that we Europeans can and must make."
"It also involves committing ourselves to the two-state model."
"Let me add at this point that the two-state model cannot be a matter of withdrawal from the West Bank and nothing more."
"The viability of the second state must also be guaranteed, and Mr Laschet is right to say that that requires that funds be mobilised for reconstruction, and we must commit ourselves to that, for it is in the interests of our own security to do so."
"Mr President, the situation in the Middle East appears to be one of complete deadlock."
"Arafat is there in his headquarters – old, isolated, in poor health and unable to lead his people."
"Sharon fails again and again in his plan to withdraw from Gaza."
"He appears to have lost touch with both his party and the electorate."
"The question is that of whether he is the man who can lead Israel to peace."
"I do not believe he is."
"The future of the Gaza plan is now extremely uncertain, and violence in the area appears to be increasing."
"It is worse than it has been for a very long time."
"I do not believe that these gentlemen can bring about lasting peace in the Middle East."
"They cannot put an end to the killing."
"They cannot put an end to the violence and the acts of terrorism, and they cannot bring about what all of us in this House want to see: two states living peacefully side by side and with respect for one another."
"This conflict has gone on for so many decades and has involved so much suffering, for the Palestinian people, of course, but also for the Israeli people, who live in constant fear of acts of terrorism and of suicide bombs."
"We have made so many plans, had so many conferences and meetings and held so many debates in this House, but nothing happens."
"We must consider having a practical international presence in the region that can supervise the withdrawal from Gaza and perhaps also remain there in the longer term."
"Following the American presidential election, and no matter who wins, the EU and the United States must sit down and formulate a common strategy, based perhaps upon the road map, in which they talk the same language and give out the same signals to these two leaders."
"The whole world stands to gain from peace in the Middle East, and it is also an important part of the fight against international terrorism."
"Mr President, it is the case that, as pointed out by the School of Culture and Peace of the Autonomous University of Barcelona, the situation in Israel and Palestine has far from improved over recent months, in fact quite the opposite."
"The judgment of the International Court of Justice on the separation wall built by Israel, the refusal of that country to comply with it, the feeling in diplomatic circles that the Quartet’s road map is on the brink of failure and the protests from Palestinian groups at the corruption in Gaza are just some examples of these steps backwards."
"Furthermore, it is clear that we cannot separate the delicate situation in Palestine and Israel from the international context and the dreadful consequences of the absurd way the United States and some of its European allies are dealing with terrorism at international level, an approach which I believe is providing more fuel for the fanaticism of Al Qaeda every day."
"For all these reasons, the European Union must adopt a much more determined attitude with regard to what is happening in the Middle East."
"I have two proposals: to pursue and support the proposal to provide all the resources necessary to create a normal and transparent election process in Palestine so that Sharon can no longer use the argument that there is no legitimate and valid interlocutor on the Palestinian side, but also, in view of the insulting disregard Sharon has shown not only for human rights but also for international law, rather than continuing to export arms to Israel – as no small number of European countries have been doing over recent years, of which I would mention Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, amongst others – I believe the time has come for the European Union to take much more determined measures in order to put pressure on the current Israeli Government, and I would not rule out the possibility of cancelling the association agreement."
"Charlie Chaplin put it very clearly in the film Monsieur Verdoux: if you kill five people you are a murderer, if you kill 5 000 you are a hero."
"Please let us not treat Mr Sharon as a hero."
"– Mr President, I should like to express my sorrow and concern about recent operations by the Israeli army."
"The results, once again, have been tragic, with dozens of Palestinians, mainly civilians and children, killed or injured."
"I am truly saddened by the fact that, despite the global outcry, the Israeli Government persists in this undeclared war and bloodshed."
"What we see unfolding before the eyes of the whole world are crimes against humanity."
"The European Parliament too should call on the Israeli Government to stop at once the attacks on and the murder of civilians in the Gaza Strip, to stop building the wall, the sole objective of which is to isolate the Palestinians, to stop tearing down homes and to comply with the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights and the Geneva Convention."
"At the same time, we should also denounce in the strongest possible terms the rocket attacks and bombings in Egypt last week, which resulted in the death of numerous Israeli and Egyptian civilians, because the last thing that did was to help the peace process."
"We should also call on both sides to apply the road map."
"Finally, I should like, on behalf of my group, to express our undivided support for the Palestinian people, who continue to resist and fight for their independence, and for the forces for peace in Israel acting to put an end to the bloodshed."
"Mr President, terror and trauma go hand in hand in the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians; they are the dual results of one single craving for destruction shared by the terrorist organisations Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah."
"Meanwhile, the Palestinian politician, Mustafa Barghouti, wrote that – and I quote – ‘the silent majority of the Palestinian people do not identify with the terrorists or with the Palestinian authority’."
"Looking towards the crucial local elections in December, Barghouti urges Europe, once and for all, to give firm support to the democratic forces and processes in the Palestinian regions instead of to Arafat’s gigantic apparatus of oppression."
"I would like to hear what the Council’s High Representative has to say in response to this insistent appeal."
"The Palestinian appeal is at the same time a test of the European Union’s willingness to fight terrorism effectively."
"Do the Council and Commission think that the conclusion of an association agreement with Syria compatible with this?"
"Secondly, it is well enough known that the Assad regime facilitates terrorist operations against the State of Israel by Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah."
"Yesterday, there was an article in the German press – in ‘Die Welt’ to be precise – about the way in which terror has made the Israeli people a traumatised nation."
"A trauma expert confirms that Israel is still a country made up of survivors."
"It is not only for reasons of history that this should be of concern to us in Europe."
"Mr President, the Israeli defence forces are currently continuing with the largest incursion into Gaza since the beginning of the Intifada and death tolls are continuing to rise."
"Some estimates have suggested that at least half of the hundreds of the Palestinians killed have been civilians."
"The actions of the Israeli army are simply disproportionate and this is a view that is shared by Kofi Annan, the EU foreign ministers and many more."
"I cautiously welcome Prime Minister Sharon's announced intention of complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, but there are a number of conditions that must be met in the context of future Israeli withdrawal from Gaza."
"This withdrawal must take place in the context of the Quartet's roadmap agreement."
"It must be a step in a two–state solution."
"It must not involve a transfer of settlement activity to the West Bank."
"There must be an organised and negotiated handover of responsibility to the Palestinian Authority."
"Israel must also facilitate the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Gaza."
"The bottom line is simply this: the roadmap remains the mostly likely framework within which to achieve a resolution to the Israel–Palestine conflict."
"The members of the international Quartet, namely the European Union, Russia, the United States and the United Nations, are all committed to this roadmap plan."
"However, the current cycle of violence is causing widespread suffering and this is taking the parties even further away from a negotiated settlement."
"The most important step is for both sides to desist from further acts of violence."
"Leadership is needed on both sides, and that is not easy."
"I am an Irish Member of the European Parliament and we in Ireland know how difficult that can be."
"We know only too well the cycle of violence, the tit–for–tat, the eye for an eye."
"But we also know only too well the enormous benefits that accrue to everyone when violence ends and real negotiation and dialogue take place."
"That takes courage on both sides."
"I believe we should be asking both sides in this conflict to have this courage and show their leadership."
"It is not easy to be in a situation of leadership, it takes a lot of courage."
"I often feel that in this conflict, courage is not being shown."
"As I said, we who come from Ireland know the benefits that can accrue for the people of the Middle East if courage and leadership are shown by the people there."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate you on your presidency of the European Parliament."
"You are certainly the right person in the right place."
"The subject under discussion is the situation in the Middle East, as it was a few months ago, and as it was a year ago and even 15 years ago, as Commissioner Patten pointed out earlier."
"Incidentally, Mr Patten has been awarded an honorary doctorate by a Polish university."
"Maybe the time has finally come to stop using polite diplomatic language and start using the language of hard facts."
"It is simply not the case that both parties to the conflict in the Middle East are equally guilty and that the truth lies somewhere in between."
"We are currently facing a new situation."
"Since early this year, Israeli towns have been struck by nearly 150 rockets manufactured locally by Hamas."
"Rockets of this kind have been causing material damage and spreading panic for several years, but now they are also killing people and even children."
"This proves that the conflict has escalated."
"It also proves that responsibility for the escalation must now be borne by the Palestinian side."
"How are we to react to this?"
"Are we to remain passive, or can we and do we maybe even want to play at being an arbitrator and move the Israeli Government and Arafat around like figures on a chessboard?"
"Neither of these approaches would be right."
"We are constantly discussing great plans and road maps."
"It might be more appropriate first to have a long hard look at where EU money is going."
"It is important to establish whether sometimes, contrary to our intentions, this money actually goes directly to those who bring death to the Middle East."
"This matter was already discussed by the previous European Parliament."
"In conclusion, let us be generous, but let us examine what our money is being spent on."
"Mr President, in his speech Mr Solana acknowledged Europe’s helplessness in the face of the Israel-Palestine conflict, yet it is not only Europe that is helpless."
"The same applies to the United Nations and the United States."
"Mr Solana, however, posed the question as to what is to be done in such a situation."
"He went on to give us the correct answer."
"The road map must be adhered to, as the road map also acts as a signpost for the European Union."
"That is all well and good, but there can be no doubt that our position should be more open and flexible, and that more should be done to adapt our policies to the changing political situation."
"Our policy in the Middle East should also be more nuanced."
"If a serious project is put forward, such as Israel’s unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, it should be heartily welcomed, and not merely ‘recognised as a significant step’, to quote the Council’s communication."
"Thought must also be given to the steps and measures that should be taken in order to support this project."
"If there is a desire to continue supporting Palestinian Authority, as you stated in your four-point programme, consideration must be given to a point mentioned a moment ago."
"I refer to the fact that having seen some of our money wasted, it is important to ensure that the money we are spending to support the stabilisation of Palestinian Authority is not wasted again."
"In other words appropriate control mechanisms are needed to manage this aid effectively."
"In my opinion, Mr Solana, a regional approach was lacking in your speech."
"After all a solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict will involve the entire region, the region known as the wider or greater Middle East."
"We have discussed this approach during previous debates on strengthening the peace and stabilisation process in Iraq, and this is also the right policy to pursue with regard to Iran and Libya."
"We are experiencing success both in the fight against terrorism and in measures to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, as in the case of Libya."
"Unfortunately we are also experiencing setbacks, such as in the recent case of Iran."
"This policy must be rationalised."
"The Presidency has produced good work so far."
"It is to be hoped that it will respond to this request from the House, and that the Commission and the Secretariat will also."
"Madam President, some people have stated that the war in Iraq will have favoured a rapid solution to the conflict in the Middle East."
"A cynical forecast, instrumental in justifying a wrong and illegal war."
"A forecast belied by the terrible picture before our eyes: despair in the Palestinian camp, growing terrorism and fundamentalism, crisis in the Palestinian Authority and fear in Israeli society, which gives Prime Minister Sharon the opportunity to unleash indiscriminate repression and to proceed undaunted with the construction of the wall."
"The withdrawal from Gaza that has been announced has by no means been said to be paving the way for the restitution of the occupied territories of the West Bank."
"On the contrary, it could be the prelude, via the settlement activity which is being stepped up, to the definitive acquisition by Israel of the majority of those territories, confining the Palestinians within enclaves which have nothing to do with the sovereign state to which they are entitled."
"The road map has not provided the tools with which to prevent the negotiation process from once more being overwhelmed by violence."
"The international community, and above all the Middle East Quartet, ought to draw some conclusions from all this and reflect on this fact."
"As for the possibility of a solution to the conflict, the Geneva negotiators, in contrast to Camp David, have demonstrated that it is possible to find dignified solutions to which both sides can agree on all the points of conflict, even on the most sensitive and thorny issues, such as the status of Jerusalem and the right to return up until the final status."
"The Middle East question ought, moreover, to have absolute priority in the relations between the European Union and the United States – in the hope that there will be a change in the administration there."
"Today we can also rely on the positive role played by some Arab countries – Egypt and Jordan – and on the improvement of our relations with Syria and the normalisation of relations with Libya."
"Tomorrow, this state of affairs could be very different."
"If yesterday Europe’s security was linked to developments to the east, today it depends on the southern and south-eastern dimension."
"It is also for these reasons that the Middle East conflict is not something which has nothing to do with us, but is the central issue in the future of European security."
"Madam President, Mr Solana said that we could not continue to give money."
"Something had to happen."
"What the EU will, in actual fact, do is of course a matter for speculation."
"The fact is, the EU has not done much other than make payments and adopt statements."
"I would very much recommend that, firstly, attention be given to the proposal from Mr Romeva i Rueda about cancelling the cooperation agreement so that there are at least some minimum consequences of continually breaching the agreements."
"Secondly, I wish to support what was said just now about giving the Geneva Agreement a much clearer status on this road map. It might then be seen where the road is heading and an appeal finally made for more cogent discussion of the subject."
"It seems, in fact, that a terrorist is being defined as someone who kills himself."
"Anyone who has military helicopters and missiles is not however a terrorist, but a soldier, and it is immaterial whether very many more civilians are killed by these means than by suicide bombs."
"It cannot help that we continue to engage in double-speak in this connection."
"We must talk to Israel in the same way that we talk to other grown-up states and demand that a democratic nation be alert to these matters."
"The way things are now heading, we are not going to have two viable states."
"We shall have no viable states because Israel will die in the process, and it is therefore vital for both Israel and Palestine that we begin also to speak to the Israelis as if they could tolerate being talked to as grown-up people."
"Madam President, 3 500 Palestinians dead, and over 1 000 Israelis: my dear Mr Solana, you speak of an ‘appeal’ and talk of hoping that the Israeli forces will withdraw from Gaza."
"Frankly, I have been listening for six years now in this Parliament to wise words, which ascribe responsibility to one side or the other for the situation, but today Palestinians continue to die, killed by an occupying army."
"Occupying."
"In fact, the truth is simple: there is no asymmetry, there is symmetry."
"What we see before us is an occupied country and international law being totally rejected."
"You should believe Sharon when he tells Winston Churchill’s descendant that he will squeeze the Palestinians of Gaza and the West Bank like a pastrami sandwich."
"Dove Weisglass is not lying when he clearly asserts that withdrawing from Gaza simply means mothballing the peace process."
"These are not lies; this is the truth, and this is the political line that Sharon is taking."
"Certainly, there can be no justification for the criminal acts that the Palestinian terrorists may carry out against Israeli citizens."
"But can we really only make appeals?"
"Does Europe really not have the authority to say to Israel ‘It is time to end the Israeli military occupation’?"
"This is not simplistic or ingenuous: this is the truth."
"I am tired of our hypocrisies, tired of this way of going on, where every day houses are being destroyed and children are being killed."
"Ayman, 13 years old, who was going to school with his schoolbag on and was shot dead, is the symbol of the barbarity to which an army of military occupation can stoop, just as, obviously, it is barbarous that Hamas should send Palestinian children to throw bombs at Israeli citizens."
"I believe, though, that we have the authority and the power not just to make appeals, but to say that the Israeli military occupation must stop."
"Let us rather give a voice to the Palestinians and Israelis who together are fighting for peace: there are many of them!"
"It is these voices to which we should listen."
"Madam President, unlike the previous speaker I refuse to condemn so forcefully the government of Israel or the Israeli defence force in its operation on 29 September in Gaza to prevent Hamas – an organisation banned by both the US and the EU – from launching Qassam rockets which recently killed two Israeli children and wounded ten civilians in Sderot."
"No government anywhere can tolerate civilian fatalities killed by a deadly and implacable enemy without reserving the right to retaliate with all the means at its disposal, and the Palestinian Authority has clearly not reined in its terrorists."
"For years Hamas rockets were fortunately more like fire-crackers than bombs, but since the start of 2004, 149 high-explosive rockets have been launched from Gaza."
"The BBC, not renowned as a friend of Israel, has reported that 15 out of 16 of the Palestinian men killed by the IDF were known terrorist militants."
"All of us have a common enemy in fighting international Islamist terrorism."
"Last week in Taba innocent Israeli holidaymakers were killed by a bomb attack which has all the hallmarks of al-Qa’ida."
"It must also be emphasised that Israel took great care during the operation in Gaza to provide medical and humanitarian support for all the casualties, as well as innocent Palestinian civilians."
"Prime Minister Sharon, in spite of fierce Likud opposition, is pressing ahead with withdrawal of settlements from Gaza as a way of kick-starting the roadmap for peace in the Middle East again and bringing about a two-state solution."
"But I call on the Palestinian Authority to crack down on Hamas, Islamic Jihad and al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, otherwise Israel will be very reluctant to withdraw from the West Bank, which poses a much bigger challenge and is ultimately a much bigger prize."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Solana, concerning the situation in the Middle East, what conclusions might we, as Members of the European Parliament, draw one year after the Geneva agreements, which we greeted with hope since the road map was getting bogged down, one year after plenary debates on the application of the association agreement between Israel and the European Union, and a few months after the condemnation of the wall, both by the United Nations Commission on Human Rightsin Geneva and by the International Court of Justice in The Hague?"
"As has been said, the overall outcome amounts to a blood bath; and, as Mr Patten said, he who lives by the sword will perish by the sword."
"Since the second intifada, there have been 4 350 deaths, including the deaths of 3 500 Palestinians; 33 600 houses have been destroyed; and, since the ‘Day of Penitence’ operation orchestrated by the Sharon government, 120 Palestinians and three Israelis have been killed."
"Three Israelis are, indeed, three too many, Mr Tannock, but so too are the 120 Palestinians, and I should not have dared to mention, as you did, that two Israeli children were killed when it is known that, two days ago, a little Palestinian girl carrying a schoolbag was murdered by Israeli soldiers and finished off by an officer, who shot her in the head."
"I should not have dared to bring up such matters, but I do so today."
"So what are we, the European Parliament, able to do?"
"We would question you as to the role that the European Union can play at Quartet level."
"What, however, can we, as MEPs, do other than return continually in this House to the association agreements and again condemn what is indefensible in international law?"
"What can we do?"
"Our powerlessness is combined with anger."
"There are many of us who travel to Palestine."
"I spent half of my holidays there with Palestinian teachers dealing with the Palestinian children traumatised by the war."
"Here in this Parliament, we are neither an NGO nor people who sign blank cheques, for we monitor the issuing of our cheques. We cannot, however, resign ourselves to this powerlessness and to the idea that Europe would forget international law."
"Madam President, I agree with Mr Solana that the step-by-step policy is no longer valid."
"What alternative does he have in mind in order to aim higher?"
"For the reality is very tough."
"Firstly, the Palestinian Authority has hardly any control and is not effective in the occupied territories."
"Furthermore, as a result of the of the United States, the road map is practically dead and it will be very difficult to bring it back to life."
"The policy in relation to the settlements, the wall, the horrendous violence of the Israelis and Palestinians, have left the Quartet’s objectives in tatters."
"We have practically reached rock bottom."
"There is absolutely no sign that Israel is complying with the Council’s conditions for supporting the withdrawal from Gaza."
"What is more, Sharon has already said that he rules out further Israeli concessions and in reality he is showing no intention of seeking peace beyond the withdrawal from Gaza."
"We should be aware that time is running out and the room for manoeuvre required for a fair and viable solution for the Palestinian people and the security of Israel is disappearing."
"If the European Union cannot get Middle East peace back on track quickly, this issue will continue to poison peace and security in the Middle East and throughout the Mediterranean."
"Madam President, there is widespread frustration and bafflement in Europe at the failure of the Middle East peace process to make any headway, even though we all think we know what the result of that process should be: two states and the territorial disputes sorted out amicably."
"To that end we demand of Israel that no more settlements be established, that the existing ones should not be extended, and that the West Bank wall should not be taken as a political fact when shaping the borders of the future."
"When I see, though, that this hideous edifice has saved human lives by substantially reducing the number of suicide bombings, I cannot really criticise Israel for building it, but I can criticise it for the fact that the wall does not follow the recognised border."
"No doubt, alas, the wall must remain in place until such time as the Palestinian Autonomous Authority itself becomes willing to use its own police and security forces to arrest those who carry out these attacks."
"It is Mr Arafat who is standing in the way of this sort of effective reorganisation."
"Gaza is another point at issue."
"I find it inexplicable that more Kassam rockets should be fired at Israel even after it had announced, without conditions, its military and civil withdrawal."
"It is evident that certain Palestinian elements are almost afraid of the prospect of an Israeli withdrawal, for, in that event, Palestinians in Gaza would at last have to get themselves organised and get stuck into rebuilding the city and its surroundings."
"So far, Israel has served as a reason why, with the struggle against the occupation, no real progress was made with these necessary measures."
"Its withdrawal should also open up a way back to implementing the road map, which is what the quartet demanded on 22 September."
"When I see though, the way in which, in this little piece of land in Gaza, Palestinian police and security forces in their thousands are evidently incapable of preventing these Kassam rockets from being launched, I really do start to suspect that Israel is being provoked into staying put in Gaza."
"We must not allow this attempt to succeed, for there are, in Israel too, people who do not want withdrawal from Gaza, and these elements should not be lent support."
"It is in the interests of all of us that we should start as soon as possible on putting the road map into practice."
"All parties have signed up to it and must do what they have undertaken to do."
"– Madam President, the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs has said that, in relation to the Middle East conflict, there have been too many statements and little action and that it is now time to act."
"Until that happens, I would like to stress that some representatives of the Union have made statements that I do not believe to be appropriate."
"For example, the statement of the Middle East envoy, Mr Marc Otte, who told the that – and I quote – ‘the Israeli separation wall has a role to play’."
"Perhaps its role is to prevent the establishment of a viable Palestinian state?"
"Equally unacceptable to me is Point 2 of the conclusions of the Foreign Relations Council of 11 October, which I believe once again displays blatant double standards."
"Why does the Council condemn all forms of terrorism, ‘including rocket attacks on Israel’?"
"Why, when it states that it condemns all forms of terrorism, does it not add: ‘including that which has killed more than 40 Palestinian children and injured more than 120 so far in Gaza in just 12 days’?"
"Why does the Council state that Israel has the right to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks, without adding that the Palestinians have exactly the same right?"
"If the Council restricts itself to condemning the disproportionate nature of Israeli military action in Gaza, why does it not use that hackneyed euphemism when referring to the Palestinians?"
"Double standards?"
"Ineffectiveness?"
"Yes, in my view, yes."
"And I believe we have heard quite enough speeches."
"The Palestinians are still waiting."
"How long must they wait?"
"They have been waiting since the Union's Venice Declaration of 13 June 1980."
"Madam President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, I would like to start by apologising for the fact that another commitment will require me to leave shortly after I have finished speaking."
"There is a specific question I wanted to put to you, Mr Solana, or rather, a comment I wanted to make following on from what Commissioner Patten said."
"I am in full agreement with what you plan to do in your four points."
"I regard them as well balanced and right."
"The only thing is, are both sides willing that we should actually be able to put these plans into effect?"
"I agree with Mr Gahler that security must be established, but how many security facilities has Israel destroyed over recent years?"
"Was there really willingness that the Palestinians, insofar as they so wished – and not all did – should really be responsible for security?"
"Turning to reform of the Authority, how can the Authority be reformed when the sealing of the borders is making Arafat a hero to the Palestinians?"
"He had been less highly regarded by the Palestinians, and that is where Israel helped him out."
"As for economic support, I will vote in favour of it in this House only when I am certain, or can at least take it for granted, that what is invested in infrastructure will not again be destroyed by Israel."
"This is a precondition, for the taxpayer – to whom both of you have rightly referred – cannot be expected to rebuild infrastructure only to see it destroyed."
"The same is true of elections, which are necessary, and I am absolutely in favour of them."
"I also discussed them with the finance minister, for whom you too have high regard, whose hope it is that new young blood will join the Palestinian Authority, but who also told me that the elections must be feasible in terms of the whole infrastructure, and, here again, it is for Israel to make them possible."
"So I fully support your programme, which I regard as good, well balanced, and right, but it needs both sides if it is to be capable of being implemented, failing which it will be as vacuous as others have been."
"It follows that Israel really must play a full part in it and be willing to put these things into practice."
"If it does, then I am in favour of our being as critical as we can be of the Palestinian Authority and as tough as possible in our dealings with it."
". Madam President, I shall begin by responding briefly to the last comments of my good friend, Mr Swoboda."
"The four points I have referred to undoubtedly require the participation of the two parties, not only of the Palestinian Authority – which must participate – but also of Israel."
"That is why we are working in that direction."
"But we honestly believe – to respond to the request made by Mr Menéndez del Valle a little while ago – that words are not sufficient, that we need to present initiatives, to try to act."
"That is what we are going to try to do."
"What I have presented this afternoon is a small programme – not small in terms of its breadth but in terms of its profundity – moving in the direction of our fundamental objective: bringing the road map to its conclusion and in good time, not in the next hundred years."
"Rest assured that we will take all the measures we can."
"I would also like to stress that the withdrawal from Gaza, if carried out within the context of the road map process, is something we support and which would be a good thing."
"It would be good if there were the law approved by the Knesset allowing withdrawal of the settlements and funding to allow the people living there to leave."
"Previously they were funded so that they could create settlements."
"If it is the case that we can achieve the approval of a law to do the opposite within two weeks, it will be a success for Gaza and for the future of the West Bank."
"We will see whether this is achieved within a few days."
"Will there be sufficient votes to do so?"
"I believe there will, because in this case the Labour Party is going to support Prime Minister Sharon so that this law can be implemented."
"I would insist, however, that the four points I have mentioned require the contribution, support and understanding of the Palestinians and of the Israeli Government."
"I would also like to stress, however, that I have talked about something else; we cannot carry on simply with a gradual process."
"I believe we must take a more courageous step forward and begin to define the final parameters on which the two parties must agree."
"To this end it is naturally essential that there be an interlocutor accepted by both parties."
"That is why the support we are going to give the Palestinians is so important, so that they are genuinely able, in their current circumstances, to find the formula for establishing a solid and representative Palestinian Authority which is able to act as a viable interlocutor with Israel."
"That is what we would call rationality."
"The irrational approach would take a different view. I regret to say that irrationality may be winning out over rationality."
"Unfortunately, we have seen this on numerous occasions."
"We politicians must continue to support rational actions."
"If the people responsible for leading other countries do not unfortunately feel the same, we must seek the best way to operate in those circumstances."
"I would like to say just three more things."
"The first is that I have not tried to avoid talking about the regional issue."
"It seemed to me that the time set aside for the debate was not sufficient to talk about all the issues of the region."
"There is no question that the issue of Iraq, of Iran and all the issues the honourable Member has raised are priorities on our agenda."
"It did not seem to me to be the day to go into them and I have not therefore done so."
"Secondly, I wished to say to my good friend most respectfully that I have not made any appeal for good will."
"We do not belong to charitable organisations."
"We are politicians who want the problems to be resolved."
"At the end of my speech I made an appeal of a moral nature, but the rest was full of concrete, specific measures, which, if put into practice, must lead to positive results."
"I would finally like to defend my personal representative and the representative of the whole of the European Union, Mr Marc Otte, and I would ask Mr Menéndez del Valle to read his comments in their entirety."
"Madam President, if you will allow me to change subject, I believe this is the last time I will be in this House, in the European Parliament, with a good friend, Commissioner Chris Patten."
"We have spent five years together."
"Many people sitting here today thought that we were both going to be disasters, he and I, and doubly so by working together."
"Quite the opposite has proven to be the case, and we have shown that two plus two do not necessarily make four, but can in fact make six."
"For this, I believe we must thank Chris Patten for his cooperation and particularly for his intelligence."
"His good sense and his intelligence have taught us all a lesson in good practice – at least for me, Chris – and I hope that from Oxford your advice will continue to reach us across the airwaves, via the Internet, through your words, books, by whatever means, but that they continue to reach us."
"Thank you, Chris, for your cooperation over the last five years."
"We will not forget you."
"At this point, I will close the debate on this topic."
"The current situation in the Middle East is appalling, and of particular concern is the grave situation in Palestine, where the Sharon government is committing the most terrible crimes against the Palestinian people."
"Israel’s provocative arrogance and its government’s State terrorism, which has enjoyed the Bush administration’s unwavering support and which, in common with the occupying forces in Iraq, is killing the elderly, women and children on a daily basis, cannot continue to go unpunished."
"The European Union cannot continue to maintain a weak position."
"It is time that the European Council took firm measures, turned Parliament’s opinion into action, suspended the Association Agreement with Israel and demanded compliance with UN decisions."
"The provocative arrogance of Sharon and his government, which enjoys the Bush administration’s support, is appalling."
"The Bush administration vetoed a draft resolution condemning Israel’s terrorist activities, whilst the people are fighting for their right to freedom and dignity."
"The Palestinian people, just like the Iraqi people, have the right to a State, the right to determine their own destiny and the right to live in peace."
"– We express our repugnance and condemnation of the constant crime being committed against the Palestinian people by the Israeli Government."
"The tragic count at the end of the 'Days of Repentance' was 111 Palestinians dead in 15 days, including children and students."
"We condemn those fuelling Israeli aggression."
"We condemn the USA for backing and arming the Israeli Government."
"We condemn the ΕU, which is against the genocide of the Palestinians in word, but tolerates it in deed by putting both sides on an equal footing."
"Condemnation in word only is hypocrisy."
"The ΕU continues to provide economic support for Israel through association agreements and to arm it."
"Not one delegate from a Member State of the ΕU went to the Hague Tribunal to testify on the Israeli wall."
"The 'holy family' at the ΝΑΤΟ summit in Istanbul unanimously upheld US imperialist plans for a new 'Greater Middle East', which make provision for NATO's relations with Israel to be upgraded."
"We are therefore calling for economic and political measures to be taken immediately, including the immediate suspension of the association and cooperation agreement with Israel, in order to force the Israeli Government to stop the slaughter of the Palestinian people, to withdraw the Israeli occupying forces from Palestinian soil, to demolish the wall of shame and to create an independent Palestinian state with its capital in eastern Jerusalem."
"The next item is the statement by the Council on the situation in Georgia."
". Madam President, I am going to talk about Georgia, a very important subject, and I am sure that the majority of the people here are very concerned about the situation there."
"From the outset of political change in Georgia, the European Union has been fully engaged with the new government and the new political leaders who have been in Georgia since the so-called ‘rose revolution’."
"I would like to tell you what we have done so far."
"Firstly, we have appointed a special representative, Mr Heikki Talvitie, who represents us in the region, and particularly in Georgia."
"The role he has played has been greatly appreciated by everybody, by President Saakashvili, by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, by the government as a whole, and by the countries of the region."
"He has been able to act as a link between Georgia and Russia, which, as you can imagine, is a very important element in the situation today."
"Secondly, and very importantly, we have included Georgia and two other countries in the region, Azerbaijan and Armenia, in the neighbourhood policy."
"This has been the most important way in which we were able to help these countries move closer to the European Union."
"We did it rapidly, and you can imagine the happiness this decision has created for the people and leaders of Georgia."
"I would also like to say that the European Union has already organised a donors conference for Georgia."
"It was a success, right after the change in government."
"In July we launched the first ESDP operation for the rule of law in Georgia."
"It is working very well."
"It is an innovation, one of the many operations and actions the European Union can carry out among the whole panoply of capabilities we have for helping countries in transition."
"The situation in Georgia is not good from an economic point of view."
"GDP has decreased by almost 60%, which is of very serious concern."
"60% of the population are probably below the poverty line and there are still around 300 000 displaced persons as a result of the wars in Georgia."
"I cannot finish talking about Georgia without talking about the conflicts and the problems facing the country."
"Georgia has solved one problem through the autonomy of Ajaria, but there are still two big problems which will not be solved so easily: the problem of South Ossetia and the problem of Abkhazia."
"The OECD has a role to play there."
"Mr Talvitie, representing us, will continue to work on that."
"But the solution of those problems will not be as simple and easy as the one I mentioned before, which was resolved quite smoothly through the autonomy process."
"This is going to be more difficult."
"It is going to require a good understanding of Russia."
"We are ready to play that role if necessary, but we have the impression that these two issues are going to take more time and will be more difficult."
"But in any case they have to be resolved."
"Without the resolution of the problem there, Georgia's integrity will never be a reality."
"I would also like to say a word on regional cooperation."
"Georgia cannot be isolated from its two other neighbours in the southern Caucasus: Azerbaijan and Armenia."
"We have a relationship with the three countries."
"We would like to construct a relationship with the three countries which is vivid, which is important and which is close to the European Union and the European Union dream."
"I therefore want to say that President Saakashvili has the support of the European Union."
"It was clear from the very beginning that he had enormous problems in front of him."
"We are going to help him with the reforms he has to make internally and in Georgia's relations with neighbouring countries, in particular its relations with Russia, which will be highly important."
"As you know, there are still Russian troops in Georgia."
"President Saakashvili has said he will not accept forces from any other country in his territory and therefore he will give guarantees to the Russians that they can leave without the risk of any forces from any other country appearing in Georgia."
"Georgia has a difficult time ahead and needs the help of its friends."
"Here we are."
"We are friends of Georgia."
"Madam President, let me briefly address three questions."
"How far has Georgia come since the 'rose revolution' eleven months ago?"
"How have we tried to assist Georgia in this process?"
"What are the challenges ahead in EU–Georgia relations?"
"First of all, Georgia's achievements."
"Most importantly of course, all observers judged Georgia's presidential and parliamentary elections in January and March of this year to be the freest and fairest in Georgia's post-Soviet history."
"Georgia now has a president and government with a very strong popular mandate to carry out the profound political and economic reforms which we all know are so necessary."
"A good start has been made in addressing the structural problems facing Georgia, tackling for example endemic corruption, which has harmed every facet of life in Georgia."
"Georgia's state finances have been put on a more stable path to recovery."
"Revenue collection has increased, allowing the Georgian Government to pay salaries on time."
"Reform of the law enforcement agencies has begun and a new tax code has been presented to the parliament."
"It is only a start, but Georgia has done well in the last eleven months."
"How have we helped since November last year?"
"Firstly, we have offered consistent political support to the new leadership and we have encouraged it along the path of reform."
"We have been in close touch with it and with the special representative, who has done such an excellent job."
"Only recently President Prodi visited Georgia as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan."
"It was the first visit to the South Caucasus by a Commission President and it visibly demonstrated earlier this month the Commission's support to Georgia."
"We have also helped to mobilise significant international financial support for the reform agenda of the Georgian Government."
"Colleagues will be aware of the very successful conference that we co-hosted with the World Bank in June."
"It went very well."
"In June we doubled to EUR 137 million our commitment to Georgia over the years 2004 to 2006."
"So we have made a substantially increased contribution to supporting reform in Georgia."
"The third way in which we have assisted Georgia is the inclusion of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan in the European neighbourhood policy."
"That has been widely supported throughout the House."
"What are the challenges that lie ahead?"
"Firstly, Georgia has got to keep up the pace of reform."
"Turning reform commitments into realities on the ground is, of course, the hardest job, particularly for a country such as Georgia whose state institutions have been so hollowed out, so weakened over recent years."
"Secondly, we have to work to exploit the possibilities opened up by the inclusion of the South Caucasus countries in the neighbourhood policy that I referred to."
"As far as Georgia is concerned, the onus will be on that country to demonstrate genuine commitment to achieving political and economic reform, which is the only way of guaranteeing Georgia’s long-term stability."
"That will be at the heart of the action plan which we hope in due course to negotiate with the Georgian authorities."
"The other challenge is the conflicts on Georgia’s territory."
"We welcome – and this point was made by the High Representative – President Saakashvili’s statement at the UN General Assembly confirming Georgia’s commitment to solve the conflicts through solely peaceful means."
"Our position in the EU is clear: we support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia; we call on all parties to work for solutions to the conflicts through negotiation, confidence-building and exclusively peaceful means."
"Our rehabilitation programmes in South Ossetia and Abkhazia can help to build confidence between the communities."
"It is essential – if we are to solve conflicts and secure Georgia’s long-term stability – to see a serious improvement in the relations between Georgia and Russia."
"We hope that the presidents and governments of those countries can work to find solutions to the bilateral differences in full respect of each country’s sovereignty."
"From our perspective, the South Caucasus is an extremely important part of the common neighbourhood of the European Union and Russia."
"We will continue to place this region high on our bilateral dialogue with Russia."
"Our view, as you know, is that strong, stable and prosperous neighbours make the best neighbours."
"That is what we mean by working for a better common neighbourhood."
"I hope that is also the view of the government of the Russian Federation."
"That is the most sensible way of looking at methods of securing a peaceful Europe and European neighbourhood for the years that lie ahead."
"Finally, I wish to express my gratitude to my friend, the High Representative, for what he said which – to borrow a remark – my father would have greatly enjoyed and my mother would have believed."
"It has been a great pleasure working with Javier Solana over the last five years."
"It is true to say that even the most scholarly pedagogues and PhD students would have some difficulty in finding any issue on which it was possible to slip a piece of tissue paper between what the High Representative has said in the last five years and what I have said."
"It has been a pleasure to work with him."
"There is a lot of cynicism about politics, but I just want to underline that he has been a friend through these five years, he will remain a friend for the future, and I wish him the very best of luck as the Constitutional Treaty comes into place and he takes up the responsibilities of Foreign Minister."
"I wish my successors as European Commissioners responsible for the portfolio which I have enjoyed the best of good fortune as well."
"Finally, I wish to apologise to honourable Members for the fact that I cannot stay for the whole of this debate."
"I have a medical appointment which involves manipulation of my neck – though not in as permanent a way as some Members of the House might have wanted from time to time!"
"Well, Mr Patten, I can only hope for your sake that the doctor uses the right hold, and I propose that we now embark on the debate."
"– Madam President, representative of the European Union, we watch Georgia with hope as it demonstrates a resolved self-determination to establish a democratic legal state."
"Its people, who are our European neighbours, need this."
"For many years they suffered a Soviet dictatorship, after which they have had to endure internal conflict, foreign interference and corruption."
"We must support Georgia as a country which has affirmed its Euroatlantic aspirations and has already begun to take concrete steps to move closer to the principles and standards of the European Union."
"It may be that Georgia will have to choose one of the hard alternatives, if the two most important challenges appear too difficult to be solved simultaneously."
"Due to the well-known forced division of Georgia into one main and two separate parts, the alternatives for this country are as follows: to either establish a European democracy in that part of Georgia which is loyal to and governed by Tbilisi, i.e. legislative power with a free economy and rights for minorities, or to endeavour to end the division as soon as possible, and to restore the legislative power and administrative control of the Georgian state throughout the country's entire territory."
"Of these tests, I would advise that that first challenge should be given priority – the building of a democratic state in the area which today is ruled by Georgia."
"However, Georgia's looking to the West, to its European neighbours and the European Union, also presents a test for the European Union."
"That is the principle of European openness."
"When we consider the Continent of Europe itself, which is home to the land of Antique legends and the Golden Fleece, Georgia is one of the oldest Christian states."
"May those countries which accept our ideals, move closer to us in all respects."
"And the goodwill of the European Union will encourage their progress."
"Thank you."
"Madam President, ever since it declared independence in 1991, Georgia has had major problems with regard to guaranteeing sovereignty across its entire territory."
"Very quickly, separatist movements in South Ossetia and Abkhazia have managed, by dint of armed conflict, to wrest important parts of the country from central government control."
"Despite almost unceasing attempts by both the UN in Abkhazia and the OSCE in South Ossetia to reach a peaceful political settlement of these conflicts, not a great deal of progress has been made to date."
"The continued existence of these hotbeds of conflict constitutes a permanent threat to stability in Georgia."
"The outbreaks of fighting in South Ossetia in August of this year are only a poignant illustration of this, as are the unlawful, so-called presidential elections in Abkhazia, which jeopardise the development of democracy in Georgia."
"Further to today’s topic, I should like to make a few more general remarks about the role of the European Union."
"We support the line as set out by Mr Solana and Commissioner Patten, and other Members of this House will undoubtedly make more detailed remarks."
"After eight new Member States from Central Europe joined the European Union, the problems of the neighbouring countries, particularly the states that were once part of the Soviet Union, have drawn a lot closer to us."
"With Romania’s imminent accession, the lingering conflict over Moldavia about the separation of Transnistria will form a continuing threat to safety and stability at one of the EU’s new external borders."
"I can assure you that the situation in Transnistria is very similar to that in Georgia."
"These developments give us no choice but to follow what is going on in the countries around us much more closely."
"The European Union is required to shoulder much greater responsibility to a far greater extent than before in order to reinforce democracy and stability in those countries."
"It follows that a sudden outbreak of conflicts and a permanent suppression of human rights on our doorstep constitutes a threat to stability and democracy in the Member States of the EU itself."
"The conclusion of partnership and cooperation agreements and the development by the Commission of the strategy for the new neighbours and the action plans ensuing from this were a first step in the direction of shouldering this greater responsibility."
"On behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I would urge the Commission and Council to promptly translate these initiatives into concrete measures, both in the field of reinforcing democracy and in the field of a thorough reform of economic and social policy in the relevant countries."
"The European Union’s responsibility will need to go further than that, though."
"It will also need to include greater involvement in looking for a peaceful solution to the conflicts in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and not only there, but also in Transnistria and Nagorno-Karabakh."
"The European Union cannot manage to do this on its own."
"It will need to seek an alliance with Russia, but the Russian Government will also need to stop playing a dual role in many of those conflict areas; it is unacceptable that Russia should act as an intermediary while at the same time siding with, and supporting, one of the parties involved in the conflicts, whether this be in Transnistria or in Georgia."
"For the European Union, this is not about wanting to elbow Russia out of that part of Europe and extending its own geostrategic interest in Eastern Europe."
"The European Union – where possible in tandem with Russia – has an interest in establishing peace, stability, economic and social progress on or near its borders."
"Thank you."
"Madam President, when I visited Tbilisi with Parliament’s delegation to Georgia and the South Caucasus, I was struck not only by the sheer decency and friendliness of the people of Georgia, but also by how much there is to change in that country in such a difficult situation."
"The sheer lawlessness and the need for stronger law and order; the need for the Russian troops to fulfil their promise and withdraw; the need above all for tolerance between neighbouring peoples in the South Caucasus, to adopt the EU model – the way of learning to live in peace and tolerance and respecting each other, which they have to do."
"We all agree that it is clearly strongly in our interests to help the Georgian peoples because they are our neighbours and we share a future."
"I wish to pay a strong tribute to my friend, Mr Patten, who I see has left to see the doctor already."
"He has been a great success as a Commissioner."
"We owe him a great vote of thanks and I am sorry we are losing him."
"Madam President, Mr Solana, the popular enthusiasm that led Georgia to conduct its velvet revolution has caused people to have huge expectations. They aspire to better living conditions and political stability and to seeing corruption fought and a state established that is governed by the rule of law."
"This new impetus must not weaken, and we all have a responsibility for supporting this peaceful movement."
"The escalation in violence, together with the killings and woundings condemned last summer in South Ossetia show the extent to which Georgia, like the whole of this Southern Caucasus region, remains fragile and in danger of tipping over into armed conflict."
"This fear is, unfortunately, exacerbated by recent statements by the Russian authorities, who might carry out pre-emptive strikes in the Southern Caucasus under the banner of their security doctrine."
"We condemned such strikes in Iraq, and we condemn them in this case."
"Russia remains, however, in a key position to resolve these regional conflicts, and not only in Georgia. It cannot, however, continue to engage in double-dealing by, on the one hand, supporting the international community in its efforts to help the Georgian authorities establish a state governed by the rule of law and, on the other hand, supporting the Abkhazian and Ossetian separatists by, for example, granting them Russian passports or opening the railway line linking Soukhumi and Russia."
"My first question is simple: what are the undertakings that the European Union intends to request of Russia in order to bring about a lasting resolution in this region of the conflicts that have died down but that have not been resolved?"
"The EU’s commitment in this region has certainly been stepped up, as you said, in the form of the EU’s Special Representative and the Rule of Law Mission to Georgia – a first, as you emphasised."
"The urgency of the situation is such, however, that the EU needs to go further."
"It must prepare a genuine road map for its representative, who might serve as a facilitator or negotiator in successfully bringing about a peaceful resolution of the conflicts."
"His help might, for example, be valuable at the next meeting between Georgian prime minister Mr Jvania and the separatist leader of South Ossetia, Mr Kokoity."
"Georgia is one piece of a giant Caucasian puzzle, and these countries, let us not forget, are European countries."
"They will be the last candidates for joining a successfully completed EU."
"In this context, the other issue is that of integration."
"Is the EU to remain deaf to the public request made by Mr Saakashvili, President of Georgia, for integration with the European Union?"
"That is a serious and legitimate question."
"We shall not be satisfied with a commitment to the New Neighbourhood policy whereby we, the European Parliament, have forced the hand of the Council with regard to integrating the Southern Caucasus into that new neighbourhood."
"Let us not leave these countries alone in facing the issue of European borders."
"Mr Solana, can we open the doors to the Balkans and close them to the Caucasus?"
"Madam President, Mr Solana, I am genuinely delighted at the statements made by Mr Solana and Mr Patten on Georgia."
"The head of the Georgian state was elected on 4 January 2004, when President Saakashvili received a democratic mandate unprecedented in our part of the world."
"He has important tasks ahead of him, which involve reform of the state and not merely the restoration of Georgia’s territorial integrity."
"President Saakashvili’s mandate is also a time of great hope for the entire Georgian people."
"As a representative of Poland, I am well aware of the immense difficulty involved in sustaining such hope, yet hope is necessary to carry out reforms as important as those which await Georgia."
"I was particularly interested in Mr Patten’s comments on placing the issue of support for Georgia and President Saakashvili’s ambitions on the agenda for bilateral talks with Russia."
"I believe we should adopt a very determined approach during these talks, as Russia’s position is key to solving Georgia’s problems in the near future."
"It is also crucial to resolving a situation which, as can be seen from our motion for a resolution, we all agree is at stalemate, despite all the efforts of the international community."
"We would like the pressure exerted by Russia to be reduced somewhat, and for cooperation with separatists both ..."
"Madam President, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party represented in this Chamber by myself and Mr De Michelis."
"The Caucasus is a region which, for geopolitical and economic reasons, runs the risk of being exploited."
"A region where different cultures and ethnic groups, Christians and Muslims, breathe the same air, with all the difficulties which that engenders."
"Beslan, the ‘rose revolution’ in November 2003 and the troubles in Georgia this past summer are only the tip of the iceberg."
"We understand Russian concerns to defend national security and their own borders, and to combat terrorism."
"This, however, will not happen through arms and reprisals, and much less by neglecting peaceful and transparent dialogue with all the parties involved."
"It is therefore important for the European Union to take prompt action to promote the reform of the legal, prison and taxation systems in order to combat corruption and enable the territory to be controlled effectively; to increase the resources available to the EU’s special representative in the Caucasus; to help to redefine the relationship between the centre and the regions, through the transfer of public assets from the centre to those areas that are most economically depressed and at the same time ethnically diverse, so as to prevent new centrifugal forces; to strengthen the role of civil society, particularly in the secessionist regions; and, finally, to use every possible means to prevent renewed military activity, in coordination with the OECD."
"–Madam President, Mr Solana, we want complete demilitarisation of the region; we want Russia to withdraw from the area."
"I wonder what sort of peace the Americans are building by training Georgian soldiers there, and who is currently benefiting from this oil pipeline project."
"In the European Union, we teach the rule of law, not how to fire a gun, and this difference should always be made clear to our friends."
"The elections that were held were a good example of progress."
"Special envoy Heikki Talvitie has done a good job there, but the Caucasus region shows all the symptoms of deepening and continuing conflicts: ethnic, economic, religious, military and political."
"In fact, the situation has got out of hand, as far as everyone is concerned, including the Russians in Russia, especially those close to the border."
"This is a huge problem for us."
"It continues to advance and is difficult to halt."
"It is good that Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan are covered by our good neighbour policy, but that is not enough."
"I think that in this case the key to the situation lies in the relationship between Georgia and Russia."
"I would like to ask you something, Mr Solana."
"You will soon be meeting President Putin."
"Will you mention relations between Georgia and Russia when you meet him?"
"– Madam President, I should like to thank Mr Solana for his report."
"The continuing conflict in Georgia concerns us all, because it creates the conditions for the destabilisation of the Caucasus as a whole, with repercussions on the strategic security interests of the European Union and its Member States, the Balkans and the south-eastern Mediterranean and Middle East as a whole."
"Bearing in mind the energy-related risks in the area, the European Union should immediately take specific initiatives to promote a peaceful resolution to the conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia."
"Within this framework, convening an international conference under the aegis of the UN might help in finding a peaceful and diplomatic solution."
"At the same time, the European Union should work out specific initiatives within the framework of the European neighbourhood policy and make its strategic presence in the area more visible."
"Strategic planning is required, together with strong economic aid in the form of assistance from the European Investment Bank and preferential trade relations with Georgia and the other countries in the Caucasus."
"Developments in Georgia also concern Greece, because thousands of citizens of Greek descent live in Georgia in a state of insecurity."
"Greece has taken important initiatives at bilateral level over recent years to fund infrastructure projects in the sectors of health, education and cultural and educational exchanges, in order to build a democratic civil society."
"I should like to close by highlighting the crucial role played by Russia in the area."
"The European Union needs to dynamically integrate relations with the Caucasus into political dialogue with Russia."
"At the same time, we need to express our constant opposition to the stand of the Putin administration on preventive military intervention, just as we have consistently done on the US doctrine of the Bush administration."
"This stand jeopardises peace because it feeds conflict, it feeds the vicious circle of terrorism and organised crime."
"Madam President, I shall be brief because I believe that we are all in agreement about what is to be done and said about Georgia and about the countries neighbouring our enlarged Europe."
"I should like to emphasise three points that, in my opinion, are significant and important."
"Political reforms are needed, and we need to support these."
"We also need to cooperate with these countries concerning economic reforms, particularly in Georgia."
"Finally, we need to help them resolve regional problems."
"I should like, however, to emphasise two other points in particular: first of all, relations with Russia, as several of you mentioned."
"I can tell you that the issue of relations with the countries of the region is raised at all the meetings we have with our Russian friends, and at all levels; with President Putin, Minister Ivanov and everyone."
"I can tell you that, at the meetings in New York, we talked in depth with our Russian friends and examined from all angles and in all ways the issue of the countries bordering upon Russia and the enlarged Europe."
"I should also like to emphasise the role of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which no one has mentioned."
"The OSCE is the organisation that is qualified to manage the issues between these regions and that also has responsibility for implementing the commitments of the Istanbul declaration concerning the withdrawal of Russian troops from Georgia in particular."
"My friend Mr Wiersma talked about this."
"That being the case, I can tell you that we are all in agreement as to the need to cooperate with these countries and to provide them with all the political and economic aid they need."
"These countries, with their European values, belong in Europe. For the time being, however, we must continue to operate within the framework of the neighbourhood policy and continue to make use of all the opportunities afforded to us by this mechanism."
"I thank the Council and all those who took part in this debate."
"I should like to end by informing the House that the Bureau has received six motions for resolutions and that the vote will take place tomorrow."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the future of the area of freedom, security and justice, which will also be put to the vote tomorrow in the report by Mr Bourlanges."
"I give the floor to Mr Donner to speak for ten minutes on behalf of the Council."
". Thank you, Mr President."
"I would also like to thank you for the invitation to the presidency to exchange ideas with you about the multi-annual programme on Justice and Home Affairs."
"Not only have contacts already been established, but there is also a satisfying level of interest in the subject; for example, Mr Bourlanges and Mr Gargani attended the informal meeting of Justice and Home Affairs ministers on 30 September and 1 October, which was entirely devoted to the multi-annual programme."
"The presidency has, of course, read the report that Mr Bourlanges has, as rapporteur, drawn up on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"As I have already told the Council, this preparation offers the opportunity of distancing ourselves somewhat from current concerns and of considering the medium term."
"The Presidency believes that the core questions are: ‘What should we in the European Union be capable of in five years’ time?’ or ‘What should the area of freedom, security and justice look like at that time in order to meet the then requirements of our citizens?’"
"The latter is crucial."
"The Area does indeed exist for the citizens and not the other way round."
"Thinking back to the discussions that have been held in the Council and to Mr Bourlanges’ report, it is evident that the Council and the European Parliament are, by and large, giving their attention to the same items."
"Accordingly, I can report to you that the proposals for political guidelines currently being submitted for discussion by the presidency deal with a considerable number of items mentioned in the resolution."
"It is indeed important that we can, in that way, give due consideration to this resolution when we reach the final stages."
"I do not want to run ahead of this discussion."
"To date, only an informal meeting has taken place."
"I would, though, in this connection refer to such matters as the extension of the scope of the codecision procedure, civil rights, training police and judicial authorities, mutual recognition and, linked to this, common minimum standards, contingency plans, reinforcement of Europol and Eurojust and also the items concerning immigration, combating illegal immigration, asylum, repatriation and border control."
"Those items are also addressed within the meaning mentioned in the resolution."
"Needless to say, preventing and fighting terrorism is also an item on the agenda."
"At the same time, although – as I also said in the Council’s introduction – terrorism is at present an acute threat, cooperation in the framework of the area of freedom, security and justice cannot be based on that."
"It will instead need to be founded on the positive interests and added value that it brings with it."
"With regard to the resolution, I should like to mention one more point, namely the proposed extension of jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice."
"The presidency has deliberately not adopted this item, the reason being that with the already increased workload as a result of enlargement, it would be irresponsible to burden the Court now immediately with the jurisdiction across the board of Justice and Home Affairs."
"As you all know, preliminary rulings at present take more than two years."
"By accepting the decisions in the field of asylum and possibly also in the field of criminal cases, preliminary rulings can be sought about the interpretation of Community directives in current policy matters."
"It is unacceptable that in those procedures, two-year timeframes should apply to legal proceedings where these involve people being detained for that time."
"The Constitutional Treaty allows for these eventualities by insisting, in Article III-369, on the prompt handling of cases involving detained persons or aliens in custody."
"It follows that the presidency is of the view that additional measures will be needed to enable the Court to implement this provision."
"This necessity has also been mentioned in the draft conclusions."
"It is therefore not a question of whether or not extending the Court’s jurisdiction is rejected but rather about making a different choice with regard to the priorities."
"Incidentally, I have read with much interest what the resolution specifies about the decision-making by qualified majority in the fields in which this is already provided for in previous treaties."
"There are proposals that go in a direction that is certainly backed by the Netherlands and the Dutch Presidency, and I hope that it will be possible for the Justice and Home Affairs Council, and possibly the European Council at a later stage, to make an important step in that direction."
"The discussions about the draft conclusions will be held in the next few weeks."
"The intention is for the Council, composed of the Justice and Home Affairs ministers, to reach a political agreement on 26 October on the whole package, upon which it will be possible for the European Council to finalise matters on 5 November."
"Perhaps I might be permitted to end my introductory speech at this point."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this will probably be my last speech in this House as Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs."
"I should like to take this opportunity to thank Parliament, and in particular the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and its chairman, Mr Bourlanges, for its constant support in developing the Tampere Agenda over the past five years."
"My participation today in this debate is extremely simple, because I could limit myself to saying that I welcome the resolution tabled by Mr Bourlanges, virtually in its entirety."
"This would help me beat the brevity record to which you referred, Mr President, but being so brief would naturally set a terrible precedent for my fellow Commissioners."
"I shall add just three brief points."
"The first of these, to which you have just alluded, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is that I feel that the next European Council should celebrate the decision that Article 67 of the current Treaty can be implemented in full, so that a range of issues can be put to the vote, by codecision and by majority, as the Treaties already allow at the moment."
"This decision will raise Parliament’s political profile, and will safeguard the principle of democratic legitimacy, which is crucial to introducing provisions in such sensitive areas as immigration policy, asylum policy and policies involving the citizens’ fundamental rights."
"I welcome the initiatives taken by the Dutch Presidency in this regard and I hope that they will be successful at the European Council of 5 November."
"My second point concerns the question of priorities."
"A five-year multi-annual plan runs the risk of gradually taking on the appearance of a Christmas tree; everybody wants to see in it a little of what is closest to his heart."
"This programme needs a clear political profile, and that political profile must be the result of setting out a crucial number of priorities in such a way that people can understand them."
"I feel that Mr Bourlanges has touched a raw nerve."
"It strikes me that the main priority at the moment is to step up cooperation at operational level – cooperation between security forces, between police forces and between judiciaries – in the fight against terrorism."
"We shall only be effective if we can build up an atmosphere of trust between the 25 Member States, which will help the security forces to cooperate more effectively in preventing terrorist attacks and in the fight against terrorism in general."
"I feel that the second priority is the question of transposing legislation that has been passed into national legislation."
"A significant body of legislation has been produced over the past five years."
"The deadlines for transposing that legislation into the national legal order of each of the Member States must now be met and the mechanisms for ensuring the quality of that transposition must be safeguarded; in other words, national laws that give practical form to European laws must remain faithful to the spirit of the European laws and be subject to necessary and adequate quality control."
"I believe that it is important, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for Parliament to send out a strong message to the Members of the European Council."
"Indeed, the Commission, for its part, set out its priorities clearly in the communication that we sent out in June of this year."
"In the dialogue with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs, we were able to enter into greater detail on these matters."
"What I should like to reiterate, therefore, in this final debate, is that what the Commission has found – based on the public consultation that we have carried out, and in the process of tabling our own proposals – is that the citizens have three fundamental concerns."
"The first is that priority should be given, on the one hand, to civil and commercial justice, to cooperation in the field of criminal justice, and to the fight against terrorism, and, on the other, to joint criminal trials that ensure compliance with the values of the democratic rule of law and to pro-active action in protecting all victims of crime and, in particular, victims of terrorism."
"The second concern is a strong desire to see the completion of the second stage of developing a European asylum system based on common procedure and on a common statute for recognising refugees and asylum seekers."
"Thirdly and lastly, there is clear concern over security issues."
"While the citizens have shown that they recognise Europe’s added value in the fight against terrorism, there is work still to do as regards demonstrating the importance of certain common instruments that have been created, such as Europol and Eurojust, and the need to ensure that, in the fight against organised crime and terrorism, the legislation that has been introduced guarantees that the general public’s fundamental rights and personal information will be protected."
"I shall conclude, Mr President, by saying that probably one of the areas in which the past five years have been less productive is that of regulating legal immigration."
"I appreciate that, with regard to this question, we are still a long way from creating the conditions needed to approve joint legislation."
"Let us be under no illusions, however; over the next five years priority must be given to common regulation and a common legal immigration policy for the countries of the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would therefore like to leave you with the message that I am sure that, with the acknowledged efficiency of the Dutch Presidency and with Parliament’s extremely substantial and welcome contribution, the multi-annual programme for the next five years will be taken forward successfully by my successor, whom I wish every success in building Europe as an area of freedom, security and justice."
"Thank you very much."
"Thank you very much for your brevity, Mr Vitorino, but please allow me to say that only time will tell whether this is to be your last speech in this House or whether it was simply the last one before the one you deliver on your return one day to this House."
"I now give the floor to Mr Bourlanges, chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, for five minutes."
"Mr President, something has gone wrong: I have forgotten my notes."
"I have therefore spent the last five minutes trying to put them together again."
"My speech will therefore be that much livelier, even if it is rather lacking in coherence."
"Allow me firstly to thank Commissioner Vitorino for his valuable comments."
"I believe that relations between the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and yourself have indeed been exemplary and very satisfying."
"You said that this was your last speech as Commissioner in this House. I would say to you that tomorrow is another day."
"I should also like to thank the Dutch Presidency, which ever since it came into office has demonstrated a very great capacity to listen to the European Parliament, and in particular Mr Donner who has shown himself to be very sensitive to the arguments we have put forward in favour of using Article 67(2), for the purpose of extending qualified majority voting, codecision and, I hope, the guarantees associated with the Court of Justice to the whole of Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community."
"You said, Mr President-in-Office, that, where the Court of Justice was concerned, we should have to wait a little."
"I understand your reasoning and the difficulty you are in, but allow me to point out to you what a strange argument this is."
"Just because a hospital is overcrowded, are people told that they need only go elsewhere to die?"
"The Court of Justice does indeed have problems."
"Fine, let us try to solve them but, in the meantime, this does not signify that people awaiting trial are not entitled to justice."
"Let us acknowledge, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that the report I am presenting to you is evidence of the considerable unity of the committee I chair, a unity that has not always been in evidence."
"The central point of this report, and the one we are emphasising, is the extension of qualified majority voting and codecision to Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community."
"We think that qualified majority voting is a guarantee of efficiency, and we think that codecision is a guarantee of democracy."
"We would add that supervision by the Court of Justice is a guarantee of legal certainty."
"Mr President, what is the Council’s position in this case?"
"With the Treaties of Amsterdam and Nice, you have the legal option of implementing the extension."
"The political will would also seem to be there, since all the governments have agreed upon a draft Constitution or Constitutional Treaty that provides for this extension."
"If, then, both the option and the political will are available to you, allow me to say that you have a duty to implement the extension, unless – most untypically for you, Mr President-in-Office – you are to give way to heaven knows what schizophrenic tendencies that are apparently causing worry within the Council."
"If, at institutional level, you have a great many things to do in support of the Constitutional Treaty, you therefore have something specific to do in this particular area, in order, as you have said, for this momentous change to take place in April."
"There is also the issue of transparency in the Council."
"There are a lot of things I could emphasise, for example the protection of fundamental rights."
"This Parliament sets great store not only by the protection of fundamental rights, but also by their promotion."
"All European legislation must be aimed specifically at extending these rights and at their not simply being perceived in the light of any distortions that they might undergo."
"This is a change of direction that also makes us want to see the human rights agency quickly put in place."
"Regarding asylum and integration – highly sensitive subjects at the present time that, much more than other topics on the agenda, have certainly been at the root of a number of worries on the part of the members of my committee – let me state very clearly, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, that, if there are to be detention centres for asylum seekers, the central issue, on which everything depends, is that of being clear about what is the administrative and legal authority that has jurisdiction over these asylum seekers."
"It is inconceivable, as far as our committee is concerned, that it can be any authority other than that of a Member State or of the European Union itself."
"In this context, a wide variety of solutions must be considered, provided that there is no desire to impose upon people placed in these detention centres conditions of semi-imprisonment such as are seen in certain places."
"In any case, we are convinced, where this point is concerned, that the problem will not be resolved without increased financial solidarity."
"Mr Vitorino thus appealed to the ‘Justice and Home Affairs’ Council as follows: if solidarity is to be exercised, money is required."
"I shall conclude with a few words on terrorism and fundamental rights."
"I would highlight the following paradox, which surprises me."
"Now, at a time when everyone would like police forces to be able to exchange information but when, however, prudence is the order of the day when it comes to the transmission of data, the following situation arises: police forces clearly have a lot of difficulties exchanging information, whereas data is spread to every corner of the world under unsatisfactory legal conditions."
"We are expecting the November Council to restore some logic to the matter and to ensure that people’s fundamental rights will be guaranteed where data protection is concerned."
"I cannot thank you for making a concise speech, but can certainly thank you for the passion with which you spoke."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the short time I have in which to speak, I will limit myself to one important demand in the area of freedom, security and justice, that being for discrimination of every kind to be combated."
"In his report, Mr Bourlanges is right to demand that the Charter of Fundamental Rights be made the pillar of future policy and, to quote him, that they – that is, the fundamental rights – should be ‘applied everywhere and at all times with the same rigour’."
"In the case of many Members of this House, however, these lofty principles fail them when it comes to decisions at home."
"Freedom of opinion? – yes, that is self-evident, but the opinion must accord with the views of the Member in question."
"If not, then the dissidents can expect, at least, to be banned from any participation in the work of the European Union."
"They are then left, at best – if I may use our President, Mr Borrell’s words – to look after beetroots."
"Freedom of religion? – of course; it is one of our fundamental freedoms, but you should, if at all possible, be a Shintoist, a Confucian, a Moslem, a Buddhist or a Wahhabi."
"If you are a Christian, or a Catholic, then Social Democrats, Liberals, Greens and Communists will declare that such antiquated thinking makes you incapable of implementing the values of the European Union."
"Anti-discrimination?"
"You are allowed to be incapable, but not to be a Christian."
"If that is not discrimination, what is?"
"It is a tragic irony that certain members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, while fondly imagining themselves to be a bulwark in defence of fundamental freedoms and rights, are at present treading these rights underfoot."
"Mr Bourlanges’ fine report should encourage us, for we may demand much, but it is for each of us as individuals to act in accordance with the standards we ourselves set."
"Mr President, at the 5 November Council, the Member States are going to decide upon new political directions in pursuit of the area of freedom, security and justice."
"Given Europeans’ growing expectations in this area, it is essential for us to be ambitious in defining our new priorities."
"We have arrived at a crucial moment for the area of freedom, security and justice."
"What is certain is that many advances have been made since Tampere."
"The ambitious objectives then set enabled the European arrest warrant to be adopted, albeit with difficulty. This is an essential tool in the fight against terrorism and organised crime."
"We have also managed to define minimum standards in the field of asylum, even though we might lament the fact that these are bottom-up standards."
"Even so, the overall outcome is still unsatisfactory."
"The results obtained fall well short of what we might have expected following the Tampere Summit."
"There is a striking lack of political will on the part of the Member States, and the unanimity rule has, in many cases, reduced us to paralysis."
"As a result, the Member States have failed to transpose European decisions in good time."
"Implementation of a large part of European legislation has, at best, sustained unacceptable delays."
"In the area of asylum, the unanimity rule has reduced us to settling for the lowest common denominator."
"The European context should, on the contrary, permit upward harmonisation, particularly when it comes to the protection of fundamental rights, asylum procedures and the fight against forms of discrimination."
"Finally, European immigration policy has been reduced by the Member States to its repressive apparatus."
"Thus, the Council has adopted, against Parliament’s advice, provisions for joint flights for the purpose of removing refugees."
"As we have all said, insufficient efforts are being made to permit legal immigration."
"Unfortunately, the last ‘Justice and Home Affairs’ Council does not augur well."
"The EU’s part in supporting the creation of national asylum systems in Mauritania, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya again conveys the impression that the Member States’ priority is to push the problems back outside their borders."
"Nor must the debate on the handling of asylum requests and on transit camps outside the EU ever lead to asylum being dealt with externally."
"The new priorities of the area of freedom, security and justice must, above all, enable all the European decisions adopted to date to be implemented."
"The new objectives that have been set must, among other things, do more to promote fundamental rights and genuine harmonisation of asylum."
"I would therefore ask the Council and the Commission what has become of the directive relating to minimum standards concerning the procedure for granting and withdrawing refugee status."
"Steps should also be taken in future to ensure that the Member States are forced, within the period allowed, to transpose European decisions into national law."
"It is, finally, essential that the European Parliament be fully involved in the area of liberty, security and justice."
"I would thus appeal to the Council to follow the lead of our rapporteur and chairman of our committee, who asks the Member States to take the decisions necessary for codecision to be applied in this area."
"I shall make use of the few seconds remaining to me to thank Commissioner Vitorino for the work of very high quality that he has undertaken and pursued with the European Parliament."
"It is customary to say that no one is indispensable, but when someone is right for the job, they are missed when they are no longer there."
"Mr President, before I begin my planned remarks, I wish to correct the PPE attempt to rewrite history: the PPE and its right-wing allies voted on Monday to stop Mr Buttiglione being a Commissioner at all."
"In the next five years of constructing an area of freedom, security and justice, we need effective and coherent action, democratic legitimacy, legal certainty and respect for fundamental rights."
"That would be a great improvement over the last five years."
"In spite of the valiant efforts of Mr Vitorino – whom I salute and will greatly miss – even he cannot work miracles on the Council."
"Let us look at effectiveness."
"As the Commission’s communication said, the justice and home affairs dimension is now firmly identified as one of the Union’s priority policies."
"However, when the Commission cites the volume of justice and home affairs business being done in the European institutions and the regular appearance of such items on the European Council’s agenda as evidence of their vital importance, I fear the wrong benchmark has been chosen, for while justice and home affairs generates 30% of translation work in the Council, it only produces 5% of the decisions."
"We also know that intelligence and police liaison is inadequate: the German and Spanish authorities had different bits of information that could have identified the 9/11 terrorists, even if it could not have prevented that atrocity."
"The record of implementation of EU decisions that are taken is poor."
"Italy, the country in which Mr Buttiglione is still a minister, has not implemented the European arrest warrant."
"Meanwhile that country is breaching the UN Refugee Convention by deporting migrants to Libya and preventing their access to an asylum determination procedure."
"Therefore, coach and horses are being driven through the rule of law by the government that purports to supply the next Commissioner for Freedom, Security and Justice."
"The EU record on upholding fundamental rights, already fragile, is at risk and needs to improve radically."
"The measures on asylum and immigration in the last five years are incomplete and unbalanced and have incorporated some of the worst aspects of national policies."
"In particular, we have made almost no progress on avenues for legal immigration."
"No wonder the smugglers and traffickers are laughing all the way to the bank."
"We face increasing threats to privacy from various directions, including proposals for traffic data retention, transfer of air passenger data, profiling, merging of various databases, etc. Meanwhile, data protection authorities are under-powered and under-resourced and there are no European rules specifically for the criminal justice area."
"We must uphold our standards and values in future, not erode them further."
"The EU should seek positively to raise standards of protection of citizens’ rights and a culture of respect for fundamental freedoms in order to create the mutual trust necessary for mutual recognition."
"The Human Rights Agency, which I hope will be set up soon, should monitor and evaluate against the standards in the Treaties."
"Last, but certainly not least, we urgently need transparency and democratic scrutiny."
"Why, as Mr Bourlanges said, is the Council dragging its feet and defying the Treaty of Nice, which requires a semi-automatic passage to codecision as well as qualified majority voting?"
"The myriad of arrangements on judicial and police cooperation between national officials – not eurocrats, let us note – need to come within the ambit of parliamentary scrutiny, as do the activities of the Anti-Terrorism Coordinator."
"Mr President, I should like to draw your attention to the risks that our shameful, indeed culpable, silence is bringing to bear upon what is happening at this very moment on the island of Lampedusa, events that clearly have the blessing of the Council, the Commission and all the authorised bodies, despite the fact that the practices concerned – collective expulsions with no opportunity of appeal – are very obviously taking place contrary to, and in total and utter violation of, extremely important commitments."
"That being the case, I cannot believe, listening to you, Commissioners and members of the Council, that we are heading towards reinforcing our common asylum policy and promoting fundamental rights, when we allow to take place, under our very eyes and without any reaction on our part, what is nothing but a wholly illegal act of force, seriously damaging our desire and our efforts – laborious as they of course are – to progress towards a common asylum and immigration policy."
"Which country, moreover, does the EU nation concerned choose as a place to which to send those who have been expelled?"
"It turns to a country that is notorious for attacking human freedoms, for acting outside any legal framework in arresting and persecuting people, for giving immigrants the worst possible welcome and for carrying out acts of torture."
"This country is, moreover, regularly targeted and cited in international reports."
"There are therefore many ways in which it breaches several European and international undertakings."
"I do not genuinely think that our desire to progress towards a common asylum and immigration policy could survive our silence – and, in my view, a culpable silence – regarding what is happening."
"Any Member State could see such silence as an opportunity to put in place bilateral agreements that would totally undo our laborious efforts to devise a common policy."
"I would therefore ask you, Presidents of the Commission and of the Council, to express your total disapproval of this type of agreement."
"Mr President, this report invokes democracy and the rule of law."
"The report’s nicely polished exterior is, however, a legal ‘Potemkin facade’."
"Firstly, the whole project of establishing an area of freedom, security and justice is, first and foremost, a device for bringing about a federal EU."
"It is that outcome, and not a concern for justice, that gives the project impetus here in Parliament."
"Federalism in conjunction with supranational power means, however, a weakening of the legal systems that have their democratic basis in the Member States."
"Secondly, the report overlooks the threats to the rule of law presented by the construction in recent years of huge police and monitoring systems – Schengen, Europol etc – which cannot be monitored and of which it is impossible to take an overall view."
"There lies the real threat to the state governed by law."
"There is nothing in the report about this."
"In short, the report fails to restore the balance between security imperatives and respect for human rights, in favour of the latter."
"That is a quotation from one of, in all, eleven amendments by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left which, together, serve to remedy the report’s striking deficiencies in one practical field, namely respect for immigrants and asylum seekers."
"Mr President, the words spoken a little while ago on the situation in Lampedusa would have received a cold reception last Saturday and Sunday at the international colloquium in which important representatives of African countries of ECOWAS participated, who met with us from the European Parliament to discuss these very subjects."
"I have the impression that the new African leadership has far clearer ideas on the subjects in question than someone who talks about such problems from a rather theoretical viewpoint."
"They can see with their own eyes the activities of criminal and Mafia organisations, which organise illegal immigration and carry it out, and which in fact devise ways of exploiting the methods and rules which lay down the right of asylum so that they can organise illegal immigration."
"The African leaders alert us to such manoeuvres and activities and say that they are ready, provided that they are supported by the European countries from the social and economic point of view, to activate control procedures and policies, including police procedures, on African territory."
"That is what the new African leaders are saying, and they are clearly more realistic and take a much more practical and serious view of the problem."
"We therefore do not agree with many aspects of this report, particularly where, as supporters of the sovereignty of individual Member States, we hear requests, even on such a sensitive issue, for a qualified majority vote and even for it to be brought in early before the Constitution enters into force."
"We believe, in contrast, that Lampedusa actually demonstrates the importance of the role still played by the countries of origin."
"Finally, to conclude, I ask myself where the European Union was and where the Commission was when we needed to set up an emergency office to protect the victims of terrorism."
"Where was Mr Prodi’s European Commission when European citizens were, as they are now, in the hands of terrorist criminals, at the mercy of their blackmail, their assassins’ methods, their threats and their barbarous actions?"
"Where was the European Commission?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, freedom is a criterion that should always be taken into consideration when making important decisions of any kind."
"After all, it is thanks to a thirst for freedom that the European Union exists today, as freedom provided a basis for its creation."
"It is thanks to the thirst for freedom of seven of the new Member States, which for half a century were subject in turn to German and Communist domination, were able to join these institutions and become fully fledged members of the European Union."
"The two main threats to freedom today are terrorism, and immigration, in that order."
"These threats, may also be perceived as a challenge."
"We must rise to it, find a way forward, and deal with the issue of immigration once and for all."
"Rising levels of crime represent the next obvious threat to freedom."
"I would also like to draw particular attention to the threat to freedom posed by the intrusion of the state into areas of life to which it should not have access, namely areas of private life."
"This is an extremely serious problem, because it really is a major threat to freedom."
"New technologies also pose a great threat, as they make it possible to monitor citizens to a much greater degree than has previously been possible."
"The challenge facing the European institutions and all Europeans is to strike a balance between the desire for a peaceful and safe life and the wish to live in freedom."
"I would like to ask whether some of the members of the Commission who voted against Mr Buttiglione were not by any chance guided by religious criteria, thus violating the extremely serious issue of religious freedom."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the European Commission judged in its recommendation about Turkey that that country does not sufficiently respect the political criteria of Copenhagen."
"A very novel and original concept was thus concocted by way of a criterion for accession to our area of freedom, security and justice."
"So it is that torture is allowed these days, provided that it is not carried out systematically."
"It follows that in the Commission’s opinion, there is no longer a fundamental human rights problem in Turkey."
"According to the recommendation, Turkey respects priority being given to international law, the rights of the Kurdish minority are finally respected – albeit only verbally – and the Turks finally enjoy fundamental rights and freedoms."
"What happens now, though?"
"On the very same day on which the Commission qualifies Turkey as a constitutional state, the Austrian newspaper reports that 14% of the asylum applications from Turkey are recognised, and as Reinhard Müller stated only two days ago in the , refugees are people who have fled their countries of origin out of reasonable fear of persecution."
"It follows that these asylum applications are either justified and human rights are still being violated in Turkey, or Erdogan is right in his cynical claim before the Council last week that organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch are indeed linked to international terrorism."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to thank and congratulate Mr Bourlanges on his report, not only on its content, but on his ability to accept the many amendments we have presented to him."
"I thank you for that, Mr Bourlanges."
"I am going to restrict myself to two comments on what this new stage in the development of the European policing area of freedom and justice may mean."
"The first is that, in the field of security of the Tampere Summit, I would stress two initiatives which I believe have been very significant in terms of creating this area."
"Firstly, the European arrest warrant, which was undoubtedly the consequence of the horrendous attacks of 11 September, and secondly, the action plan against terrorism, which was also the consequence of the horrendous attacks in Madrid, initiatives which we owe largely to Mr Vitorino."
"Today, I believe, is a good day to acknowledge this."
"An area of freedom and justice, however, cannot be built on the basis of responses or reactions to attacks and we do not want to see the third significant initiative relating to this area being taken following attacks."
"We must be capable of replacing reaction with initiative and replacing isolated measures, although they may be part of a plan, with a genuine political plan."
"The second consideration must provide us with a methodology on which to base this second phase in the development of the area."
"Firstly, diagnosis: the Council must ask the governments what the main security problem facing those countries is and we need to identify the main problem affecting the security of the Europeans."
"Like Mr Vitorino, I believe that today it is Islamist terrorism and that, in my view, is the main security problem facing the Europeans."
"Secondly, following this diagnosis, we must understand that a political project is more than an action plan; it is not simply a series of measures, it requires effort by the governments, the Council and the Commission in order to deal with the problem."
"Terrorism cannot be dealt with in a generalised fashion."
"We have to decide how we are going to deal with a specific terrorist organisation in a specific way."
"And, after the diagnosis and after the political project, we will then know exactly how to shape and define a European police and judicial area."
"But that is the order in which we must do things, not the other way round, as is the case sometimes."
"I will end by saying that a European area of freedom, security and justice must be twinned with the diagnosis of a problem and must be efficient in order to resolve problems."
"And if we are not capable of being efficient and if we do not relate the area to the resolution of the problem, there will be no common police and judicial area."
"Mr President, on the eve of this most important, not to say crucial, Council concerning the construction of the European judicial area, I should like firstly to express a wish: that there finally be a genuine debate with the Council and that the Council finally listen to what the European Parliament is saying."
"My main aim in addressing this House is to inform you of our basic demands in the light of our new political agenda."
"Firstly, I think it essential that a genuinely proactive policy on legal immigration finally be adopted."
"As, moreover, Mr Vitorino sincerely acknowledged a few minutes ago, it has, until now, been mainly the repressive side of asylum and immigration policy that has been given prominence and, as a result, many aspects of this legal immigration policy have been left on one side."
"Matters absolutely cannot continue in this way."
"Allow me to say a few words about the plan to construct, at the gates of Europe, so-called assistance centres for refugees, which are out-and-out camps."
"Let me tell you how totally opposed I am to such a project."
"It would in fact be an unprecedented retrograde step in Europe’s exercise of its responsibilities towards populations fleeing from conflicts and would show complete contempt for human rights, something that is absolutely unacceptable."
"Nor, certainly, can we be reassured by the recent declarations made by the Commissioner-designate, Mr Buttiglione, nor, for that matter, by those I have heard made this evening by Mrs Klamt. Beyond the strict rules for administering migratory flows, there are equally elementary rules concerning respect for individual rights."
"On the subject of the priority given to the fight against terrorism, there is of course agreement concerning the basis and essential features of this fight, but there are two things we expect from the Council."
"The first is that it implements genuinely effective measures that go beyond mere statements of intent in the manner of the appointment, following the Madrid bombings, of Mr de Vries who was provided with no resources for taking action."
"Secondly, we want the fight against terrorism to involve seeking a balance between people’s security and people’s freedom and for us not to imitate our American friends who, in their battle against the terrorist enemy, flout the most fundamental of essential rights."
"I shall conclude by saying that the demands we are making seem to us to be absolutely indispensable and that we hope that the next Justice and Home Affairs Council will finally give these demands a genuine hearing."
"Mr President, our fellow human beings are drowning before our very eyes in their quest for a better existence, and we sensitive Europeans, because we cannot bear the sight of drowning people, propose to dump the problem on the doorstep of North Africa."
"That is not a solution, that is avoiding the issue, for what is really needed is the European immigration policy for which we have been waiting for so long, which will enable people to enter the European Union legally."
"I also have a very concrete question, one that I have raised before and have also submitted to the Council in writing; it has to do with civil rights and freedom of movement."
"What initiatives will the Dutch Presidency be taking for the recognition of married homosexual couples, so that homosexuals no longer run the risk of losing their social security, pension, property rights and the right to family reunification when they move to another EU State?"
"Mr President, I speak particularly for the UK Independence Party."
"The course of justice and security in Europe took a backward step when internal border controls were abolished."
"This has encouraged large-scale movements of people across the continent, not to say much illegal immigration, all of which provides a perfect cover and condition for those you fear most: criminals such as the traffickers in human beings, and terrorists."
"They are now free to flourish."
"The UK Independence Party will re-establish Britain’s border controls and take back the right to say who shall enter our country."
"For centuries we accepted people from all over the world, but in small numbers so that they could settle peacefully and productively."
"Now our crowded islands are full and we seek to balance the number of those coming in against the number of those leaving."
"We believe in the sovereignty of the democratic nation-state."
"Countries are perfectly capable of establishing their own humane criteria for asylum seekers and of managing their own security systems."
"The capacities and needs of one country are not the same as any other."
"We do not believe in EU style harmonisation!"
"Mr President, I wish to turn the focus of this debate on organised crime and to draw some lessons from our experience in Northern Ireland."
"Following the ceasefires in Northern Ireland, we have seen a marked diversion of terrorist muscle and effort, both Loyalist and Republican, to organised crime."
"The Provisional IRA is now a key player in this field."
"Organised crime has become the main source of income and wealth for Sinn Féin/IRA."
"IRA Army Council member 'Slab' Murphy is a leading crime boss in Ireland presiding over a border empire built on fuel smuggling."
"The IRA stands exposed by the Dublin Justice Minister as deeply implicated in organised crime centred on Dublin port."
"Serial hijacking of huge consignments of cigarettes is acknowledged to be the work of the IRA."
"The inescapable truth is that Sinn Féin, which masquerades as a democratic party and has two shameless Members in this House, is largely funded by organised criminal activity."
"Little wonder it is the richest party in Ireland."
"Loyalist terrorists have also made organised crime their forte, particularly in the despicable drugs trade."
"They too stand exposed as the grubby gangsters that they are."
"My call in this House is that across Europe, under the aegis of each nation-state, organised crime should be relentlessly pursued."
"I shall now give the floor to Mr Donner, President-in-Office of the Council, given that pursuant to the Council Rules of Procedure he has the right to the floor whenever he requests it."
"Before I give him the floor, however, I should like to point out to the Dutch Presidency that, in the sittings in which the Council speaks and makes statements, the Presidency’s agenda must be set in such a way that it can attend all debates."
"This is because debates with Parliament are not mere formalities, but are a crucial element in the relationship between the Council and Parliament."
"Mr Donner has the floor."
". Thank you, Mr President."
"In response to your last remark, let me say that I did my level best to do this and ascertained beforehand how much time was needed, and was given that amount of time, as a result of which I was able to plan my other engagements accordingly."
"I am truly sorry that the time factor prevented things from going as planned, but it is too late to make amends now."
"So I need to go."
"The Dutch Presidency will in any event still be represented."
"Although this is not my last meeting with Mr Vitorino, I think it is appropriate to take this opportunity of thanking him warmly, also on behalf of the Council, for the cooperation between the Council and Commission in this whole issue."
"Thanks to his commitment, the European Union managed to make much progress."
"It was not least thanks to his personal charm that it was possible for the Council to reach compromises, and his insight has led to innovative solutions."
"I am indeed of the opinion that he was a sound Commissioner for the Union."
"The area of freedom, security and justice, which we are in the process of building, has been the subject of all kinds of comments from various quarters."
"It was described as a step towards a federal Europe that would prejudice freedom and democracy, because the latter is established from the bottom up."
"I myself come from a country where democracy was invented some time in the Middle Ages and took an awfully long time to prevail."
"One condition for democracy is that our communities can live in safety, which is what we are trying to achieve here."
"After all, cooperation among the countries of Europe implies that an alternative is found to guarantee that our citizens can exercise their rights in freedom and can live in safety."
"This freedom and safety are under threat, not primarily by governments, but mainly by those who are our fellow citizens."
"In a well-organised society, governments are the first guarantee for citizens’ freedoms and rights."
"Needless to say, these governments will need to be monitored and their powers will need to be curtailed, but the absence of an authority is generally the best guarantee for chaos in which the citizens’ rights are the first to be sacrificed."
"If, however, government action is based on fear, the rights are often also the first to suffer."
"It is becoming evident, however, that it is increasingly difficult for individual countries to deliver on those guarantees, so we are obliged to pool resources, provided that diversity and tradition in this regard are respected."
"As already stated, the most important freedoms that are liable to be pushed aside are the freedoms that are sacrificed in the face of crimes against the life of our fellow human beings."
"The subject of terrorism has been mentioned in this connection."
"I have already stated in this respect that this is an important item at present, but that we should not make the mistake of using fear of terrorism as a basis on which to cooperate in this area within Europe."
"We must build on the added value of cooperation, on the actual interests and needs of society."
"It goes without saying that, in the short term, no effort should be spared in combating terrorism."
"Following the attacks in Madrid, the Council drafted a long list with the necessary measures."
"At a given time, the Council showed determination, albeit in another capacity, and adopted a directive and various measures in the area of safeguarding personal privacy."
"Those rules apply and are also enforced within the Union."
"In addition, there is cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs on the one hand and wider cooperation within the Union, on the other."
"Those two should not be kept separate in a schizophrenic fashion which would mean that in the area of justice and home affairs, everything should be duplicated in respect of what has already been achieved in the European Union."
"I would now like to address a number of remarks that have been made here about the development and future of asylum and immigration policy."
"That is undoubtedly a key item and your Commission representatives who were present know that the presidency intends to make good progress on this score too in the coming months."
"Initially, this will inevitably involve striking a compromise and finding a basis that some will, at first sight, regard as a lowest common denominator."
"Taking that as a basis will, in fact, enable us to make progress at a later date by going into the detail of the matter."
"I have already indicated, and admit wholeheartedly, that the Dutch Presidency intends to put decision-making by qualified majority in place, precisely to make this possible."
"This can only be done, though, if the initial basis has been laid by unanimity and that we can continue to build on that basis."
"Various things have been said in this House, about such things as what has allegedly been decided during the informal Council on reception centres in North Africa."
"Let me point out that our first responsibility and first priority are dictated by the fact that even now, people are still drowning in the Mediterranean on a daily basis in their attempts to reach Europe."
"Europe has regulated legal migration, but has failed to regulate illegal migration, which is what is at issue here."
"As has also been discussed during the informal Council, it is up to the Member States to find an answer to the question as to how we can solve this matter."
"In this connection, during the Justice and Home Affairs Council, talks were held with the High Commissioner for refugees, Mr Lubbers, but Commissioner Vitorino also gave his view on the external dimension of asylum and migration policy."
"The concern to find an effective and suitable solution to the issue in the Mediterranean was evident in these three speakers."
"This was also recognised by the ministers present."
"At the same time, it became clear that existing initiatives can be used as a basis for many things."
"Statements have been made here about the Italian State, and the presidency has in any case asked Italy about its approach to the issue and what action is taken in the case of people submitting asylum applications."
"The presidency has received the guarantee from the Italian Government that those people are admitted to the national asylum procedure and that the High Commissioner is involved in dealing with this."
"It is the case, however, that if no asylum application is submitted, people can be returned to the country of origin, or at least of transit."
"If people are picked up on the high seas, they can be taken back to the country of transit."
"It is then our responsibility to ensure that reception is possible in those countries of transit, which can also be done under the remit of the High Commissioner for refugees."
"This is not by definition an issue for the nation states."
"There was also the question about the directive for minimum standards with regard to the asylum procedure."
"The Dutch presidency aims to complete the decision-making process before the end of its term."
"I would like to make a few separate observations, particularly with regard to Mr Bourlanges’ initial remarks further to my comment about the Court of Justice."
"It is not the case that by extending the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice in a field where absolutely no judges operate, judges will only now act."
"Immigration law and criminal law are fields in which there has been quite extensive legal protection in all the Member States from the earliest times."
"In this respect, the key function of the Court is therefore the uniform interpretation of provisions."
"I have noted that if the Union uses decisions to step on the areas of immigration and criminal law, this will necessitate a uniform interpretation."
"It is then the Union’s prime responsibility to ensure that the interpretation of those provisions in the procedures in which the freedom of people is at stake, is done promptly."
"If not, it will be true, as the saying goes, that ‘justice delayed is justice denied’."
"That is the Union’s first responsibility and that is the reason why I have highlighted this."
"As for your remarks about decision-making by qualified majority, I have already indicated the presidency’s minimum ambitions on this score."
"In this connection, we will need to await the further course of events."
"With regard to your remark about the Human Rights Agency, I should like to say the following."
"As you know, the European Council took a decision on this in September, and the Dutch Presidency will ensure at the earliest opportunity that …"
"Mr Donner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as a matter of institutional courtesy, the Bureau naturally does not set fixed time limits for the Council or the Commission, but time must be allocated on the basis of fair access to the floor."
"This is at least how it was allocated to the Members of this House."
"The Council was scheduled to speak for five minutes at the end of the debate."
"I am well aware that you are speaking in the middle, not at the end of the debate, but please allow me to draw your attention to the fact that we are now coming up to twelve minutes."
"I should therefore request that you be somewhat brief, so that the Members of this House have some time to speak."
"Thank you very much."
". I have tried to be as succinct as need be and had reached a natural conclusion with my comments insofar as the questions are intended for the Council."
"Thank you."
"In that case, I apologise most humbly for hearing this much-anticipated end."
"Let us therefore return to the agenda."
"I give the floor to Mrs Kudrycka."
"I should like to thank you, Mr President, for protecting Members’ rights."
"Mr President, the Member States that joined the European Union in 2004 were the first to have to meet demanding requirements with regard to the protection of external borders, and in the course of accession negotiations the European Commission gave a very positive assessment of their efforts."
"Since 1 May 2004, these ten countries have participated in cooperation measures under the Schengen Agreement, yet a fundamental obstacle to their equal participation in such joint measures is lack of access to the Schengen Information System."
"This hampers reciprocal implementation of the commitments entered into under the Treaty with regard to legal assistance in criminal matters, such as the European arrest warrant, police cooperation and a common immigration policy."
"Consequently, for example, the new Member States are prevented from issuing uniform Schengen lists, and, most importantly, the time period during which checks must be carried out at the EU’s internal borders has been greatly prolonged."
"This problem is viewed in a negative light by the majority of citizens of Poland and of the other new Member States."
"It is difficult for them to understand why the pre-accession strategy, which the EU and the candidate countries took nearly ten years to implement, could not have ensured that the information system was ready to accept additional users on 1 January 2004."
"In 2003, the European Commission and the Member States set a date of late 2006 for completion of the second-generation Schengen Information System."
"Currently, however, the estimated date is given as 1 May 2007."
"I believe the Commission and the Council should keep to the original deadline of 31 December 2006 as the date when the second-generation Schengen Information System must be ready for operation."
"Integration of the new Member States’ IT systems and transfer of data from the old system to the new system must also be completed by that date."
"The European Commission should make available to the Council the report containing positive evaluations and assessments by EU experts based on objective indicators of the situation at the eastern external border."
"I regret to say that press reports still uphold the stereotype and myth that the new Member States do not provide satisfactory protection of the EU’s common borders."
"I believe dissemination of appropriate information by the Commission would not only encourage recognition of the efforts made by the new Member States, but also help to ensure their positive impact was appreciated."
"During a hearing before our committee, Professor Buttiglione gave a very positive assessment of the state of preparedness for implementation of the second-generation Schengen Information System at the European Union’s eastern border."
"At the same time he committed himself to accelerating operational measures in this field."
"I hope that, in planning the future of the area of freedom, the Commission and the Council will rise to the challenge of ensuring that freedom of movement for European citizens, one of the EU’s fundamental freedoms, is implemented as rapidly as possible without discrimination."
"This would be the fastest way of achieving the highest possible level of security."
"It would also enable us to combat terrorism more effectively."
"I thank you."
"As I take the Chair, I would like to call once again upon all Members to keep strictly to the time limits."
"It is already late, there is a long list of speakers and we still have another item to consider."
"Mr President, any future development of the area of freedom, security and justice must take account, amongst other considerations, of the eruption of Islamic fundamentalist terrorism in Europe, which struck the Union in the heart of Madrid."
"It is a threat we have to face in addition to the threat from the nationalist terrorism of ETA, which is weaker than ever, it is true, but which still has the capacity to kill."
"Islamic fundamentalist terrorism shares both ETA’s objective of destroying democracy and the fanaticism with which ETA takes action against its victims, who are always innocent, but they differ in terms of their strategy, their organisation, the way they act and the support they receive."
"So, in order to combat both, we must create this area of freedom, security and justice with a shared objective: to defeat them, arresting and bringing to justice the instigators and authors of these crimes and by matching our tactics, and also our strategy, to the size, the context and the structure of each terrorist organisation."
"Recent history has shown us that we are capable of acting together after an attack, but on the other hand we are incapable of mobilising all the instruments of the Rule of Law in order to prevent them."
"I will give you an example: the Council has adopted a series of framework decisions which have yet to be transposed into the national legislations of certain countries and, therefore, apart from the fine expressions of solidarity from their Heads of State and Government, they are not operational."
"What are they waiting for?"
"What has got to happen?"
"How many more trains have to be blown to bits before they understand that the fight against terror is our responsibility, that it is a tragedy for those who are victims of it, but that the policy for preventing it and destroying it must be European?"
"I wonder, ladies and gentlemen, whether the time has come, if such a case arises, for a State to be penalised for endangering the security of its neighbours by not applying common rules in the fight against terrorism."
"I know it is the third pillar, but it depends on political will."
"This situation can change."
"I would insist that it only requires political will."
"Should we penalise a State which does not comply with the Stability Pact but not a State which jeopardises the lives of its neighbours by not applying Community legislation?"
"This is the tragic paradox."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it would be very useful if the new Commission could produce and present to Parliament an assessment report on the way framework decisions have been transposed into national legislations and on the added value they have provided."
"Mr President, I am coming to an end, but please allow me to address Mr Vitorino very briefly: I know that, from our desks, we sometimes forget that the ultimate beneficiaries of political action are real citizens."
"I know you are not guilty of this, and I would like to say that, as a result of your tenacity, your work and your intelligence, many European citizens, many of my neighbours, have felt freer."
"Mr President, many among us have read, even studied this document, the 9/11 Commission report."
"We all know what it is, we know what it says."
"It is the reaction – multipartisan, objective, rigorous – of the politicians of a society trying to protect that society, trying to be self-critical of their own institutions and to identify what was not working within them."
"Then, if we turn to Europe, we find these documents, one of which was produced yesterday by the Council."
"It is the Council report, dated 12 October, following the report by the Commission dated 8 June 2004, and it tries to fill the gap."
"What has happened with the framework decision on terrorism?"
"These documents are almost clandestine, because big political decisions are made in public, yet this one is not."
"This is depressing."
"It shows that not even the Netherlands Presidency has given the Commission the answers it needs in order to produce these documents."
"But the Netherlands Presidency is not alone in this: only 13 countries out of 25 have done their homework."
"Less words and more work: legislation is work."
"It is all very well to come and say fine words and try to protect the states and the image of the states instead of protecting citizens."
"But that is not working."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am horrified at what has been said in the House today."
"One after another, speakers have affirmed their belief in the Union and in its splendid achievements."
"What indeed can be more splendid than equality, freedom, brotherhood and an area of freedom, security and justice?"
"But where is this area, I ask myself?"
"Where is the justice and where are the equal rights, if you cannot even manage to provide interpreters during committee meetings, something all Member States and Members of this House are entitled to under the Treaties?"
"Where are the justice, ethics and morals, if you fight against child pornography on the Internet, but at the same time promote access to pornography in general in the name of so-called citizens’ freedoms?"
"Is this not a case of split personality and a peculiar schizophrenia?"
"In my opinion, the European Union is currently at a crossroads."
"It is trying to build on quicksand, having rejected the principles of civilised ethics and Christian ethics, which have acted as a foundation for millennia."
"It is claimed that the spirit of the old foundation is being retained, as it is replaced by a new one, namely law and human rights."
"Yet at the same time I have sat through worrying debates, even within my committee, which is actually called the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"I have heard of the need to combat the criminal actions of paedophiles on the Internet. Simultaneously various sexual deviations are being allowed to proliferate in the name of this very freedom."
"So I wonder, Mr President, whether this whole edifice is not set to come tumbling down."
"In the name of these principles, I would like to end by referring to a Polish poet who said that anyone who dares to take sparks from the devil’s forge to scorch the devil’s power blasphemes against eternal wisdom and forces the world into outer darkness."
"Let this serve as a warning!"
"Mr President, I must make an overall observation."
"The EU now faces the difficult challenge of successfully devising common legal rules for the newly enlarged EU and, soon, the even more enlarged EU."
"The demand for the rule of law must be the same in an EU both of 30 and of 25 countries."
"We Swedes are expected right now to extradite a 21 year-old, Kalle Jonsson, to Greece in accordance with a warrant for his arrest."
"Kalle Jonsson has been waiting to be tried since 2001."
"Is it fair that a young person should have to wait three years?"
"The EU’s legal system is based upon mutual trust: trust in each other’s legal systems."
"Most people in my country believe that the EU is about trade and the internal market."
"They have no idea that we have to recognise each other’s court judgments, and to do so also in the further enlarged EU of the future, irrespective of, for example, the circumstances of such recognition."
"The EU already has – and will have more – problematic areas within its own external borders."
"People need, at the same time, to be given the necessary confidence in the legal systems in all the Member States."
"That is more difficult than obtaining popular support for the treaty."
"If no such popular support is successfully obtained within the scheduled time, enlargement will be delayed, legal cooperation weakened or the rule of law even tampered with."
"Quite simply: how is the Commission successfully to carry out this task, or is the idea of its doing so utopian and a mere dream?"
"Finally, a sincere thank you, Mr Vitorino, for having helped bring us closer to that dream, and a sincere thank you, Mr Bourlanges, for showing that you intend trying to speed up this process."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, how, in future, are we to fashion the area of freedom, security and justice so that it meets the needs of Europeans in the twenty-first century?"
"We have to ensure that the EU continues to stand for openness to the world, for liberality and tolerance."
"We are agreed that we must act decisively against international terrorism and organised crime, but the measures we take to deal with them have to be appropriate."
"To take one example, we set great store by the European arrest warrant, but, unfortunately, not everyone does."
"We, on the other hand, have no desire to take action for the sake of it, nor any headlong zeal for collecting every conceivable item of data about people, storing them for unspecified periods of time, and passing them on to every official body."
"The greater security this promises is illusory, and civil liberties and the protection of the individual, for which we have struggled for so long, must not be sacrificed to it."
"These values must underpin everything we do in the sphere of justice and internal affairs."
"Tampere I made that clear, and to that we must hold fast."
"We still need a common asylum policy and a policy enabling us to bring illegal immigration under control and to prevent people-trafficking, without diluting or even abandoning the principle of solidarity."
"What, in the future, is to be Europe’s concept of men, women, and freedom – that of the nineteenth century, or that of the twenty-first, which meets the needs of its people?"
"We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament favour that of the twenty-first century."
"Brilliant though Mrs Klamt’s speech was, there is a saying in Bavarian football to the effect that ‘narrowly wide is still not a goal’."
"I should also like to say a few words to Mr Vitorino."
"Thank you very much for your excellent work."
"I wish you all the best for the future. I can say, on behalf of my political group, that you will be missed here, genuinely missed."
"Thank you very much."
"Mr President, in looking to the future of an area of justice, could we also focus more attention on cooperation and access to justice in civil and commercial matters?"
"It tends to be the Cinderella area pushed out by more topical issues, yet it touches the daily lives of our citizens and businesses."
"A coherent civil and commercial legal order would ensure the proper functioning of the internal market and thereby the attainment of the Lisbon goals."
"The basis of our approach must be mutual recognition, showing respect for our differing legal traditions and cultures."
"However, we should also question whether we are not creating a more tangled legal web and a two-tier system of justice, one for cross-border cases and another for so-called internal cases, as with the legal aid directive."
"An additional, optional, European cross-border justice system, which may emerge from the European payment order proposal, could bring less certainty and more confusion."
"On 25 October we are meant to be celebrating the European Day of Civil Justice."
"I wonder if many people will notice the celebration."
"I would ask that we make it more visible in years to come."
"Mr President, as we debate an area of freedom, security and justice it is somewhat derisory that this proposed area extends all over Europe but does not appear to be available here in the European Parliament."
"For Members to attack the purely personal views – and the right to express those views – of Commission candidates because they do not comply with their own is an example of intolerance which demeans our Assembly and the parties concerned."
"If those are the principles of socialism and liberalism, they are deeply undesirable in this place."
"In relation to the main issues, we do not need a prescriptive envelope."
"It benefits us sometimes, in our area of freedom, security and justice, to have more bilateral and multilateral agreements, such as the agreement on joint investigation teams, an initiative I was proud to be involved in at the time."
"However, we do not cooperate enough."
"It is arguable that if we concentrated on more cooperation between Member States and organisations, instead of creating complex and over-reaching structures, we would achieve more practical results for our citizens and we would thereby encourage greater acceptance of the sort of Europe that they can really accept and benefit from."
"In conclusion, I do not think I voted for Mr Vitorino."
"I do not think I even liked him very much at first."
"However, I want to make it clear that I think he has been an extremely effective and cooperative Commissioner and that he respected this House."
"That, in my view, certainly puts him into a top category and I wish him the very best for the future."
"Mr President, Mr Vitorino, in this new phase of the Union, the area of freedom, security and justice must be strengthened in order to achieve greater efficiency and legitimacy in view of the new challenges facing us, which in some cases are genuine, acute, proven, dormant or latent threats to our fundamental values."
"We believe it is essential for the European Union to commit itself to a common anti-terrorist political strategy which is able, unhesitatingly and with the determination allowed by the law, on the basis of reason and the desire to protect lives, to neutralise any terrorist organisation that acts within our area of freedoms or from our area of freedoms."
"In that way we will enhance the credibility and trust in our democratic institutions amongst our citizens."
"Mr President, we cannot promote or enhance our freedoms or rights unless we are able to defend them."
"And those rights and freedoms are our greatest heritage."
"Mr President, in order to contribute to this aim and this inescapable obligation we also need to respond to certain problems, such as the problem of asylum."
"We need a common procedure and effective measures to protect refugees and to tackle the mafias who run the cruel traffic in those refugees."
"We need common management of our external borders and, finally, it is essential to make great progress on judicial and criminal cooperation, particularly in the criminal field."
"I am delighted at the level of agreement between the Council and Parliament, despite the reservations on the competences of the Court of Justice."
"I would like to praise the Dutch Presidency for its sensitivity and to correct it: yes, terrorism is our principal and fundamental problem."
"I will end, Mr President, by congratulating Mr Bourlanges and particularly Commissioner Vitorino, with whose speech I agree entirely."
"Mr Bourlanges’s excellent report has come as we approach the fifth anniversary of Tampere in 1999, which attempted to establish an area of freedom, security and justice."
"In some respects, the situation we are facing in this plenary is a snapshot of what we have experienced over the past five years."
"The Commission has always been present, with Mr Vitorino’s intelligence and tenacity – and I wish to extend my greetings to him – and the Council, when it has not been absent, has proved incapable of making decisions."
"I look at the Council’s empty chair and I have the image of what has happened over the past five years in the area of freedom, security and justice."
"I would like to believe that the European Council of 5 November will be what Parliament was asking for in Mr Ribeiro e Castro’s resolution."
"What we proposed was a Tampere II to evaluate the area of freedom, security and justice and to set fresh targets and timetables, with urgency and determination."
"I must say, Mr Vitorino, that I feel that the agenda for the 5 November Council, to which the Commission also contributed greatly, is a highly practical approach. I agree with the overall principles of the political guidelines for the multi-annual programme."
"The main priority must be to fight international terrorism by means of an across-the-board anti-terrorist strategy, at both EU Member State level and on a worldwide scale."
"At the same time, there must be a policy of protecting and promoting fundamental rights and freedoms."
"Special attention must also be paid to aspects such as controlling migratory flows, running the Border Management Agency, starting up the Visa Information System (VIS) and the second generation of the Schengen Information System, and stepping up security in the area of travel documents and visas."
"Lastly, I should like to say to the absent Council that if setting up this area of freedom, security and justice is really one of the EU’s main political priorities, this must be clearly reflected in the allocation of sufficient funding in the coming Financial Perspectives."
"Thank you very much."
"Mr President, I would like to start by registering my strong protest at the lack of interpretation facilities in Maltese."
"It is an official language of the European Union and yet the interpretation booth up there is empty."
"These are shortcomings that are quite inconvenient and frankly unacceptable."
"I wanted to take the floor to draw attention to the very serious situation that my country is facing on the issue of illegal immigration."
"During the first nine months of this year alone, 1 200 boat people landed in Malta."
"Some may think that 1 200 is not such an extraordinary number, but when you consider the size of Malta and its very high population density, one would immediately acknowledge that the situation is indeed very grave."
"To give you a clearer picture, 1 200 immigrants landing in Malta are roughly equivalent – in terms of impact – to as many as 140 000 people landing in Sicily."
"And this in the first nine months of this year alone."
"Therefore, the impact is massive and it is clear that my country needs support to be able to cope with this serious situation."
"On the issue of illegal immigration, it is very easy to point fingers at others."
"It is less easy to shoulder the responsibility of dealing with a constant influx of boat people when you have insufficient means to cope with them."
"Therefore, as a minimum, we must acknowledge that this is not just one country's problem, or that of a few countries: it is a common European problem."
"As such we should seek a common European solution."
"The European Union should therefore put its money where its mouth is and help the affected countries equip themselves better to cope with the situation."
"In particular, adequate financial resources should be allocated to help them improve their infrastructure and services to be better able to handle the situation."
"We say the European Union is built on the principle of subsidiarity."
"On this issue the time has come to move from words to action and to express solidarity in practice."
"I should like to apologise for the lack of interpretation from Maltese, which is due to a shortage of interpreters."
"This is of course no justification, and I hope that the situation will be rectified soon."
"–Mr President, in my statement I would like to concentrate on the freedom of movement of citizens of the European Union."
"This area of freedom and justice must justify its name in the coming years, not just on paper, but also in practice."
"The citizens of the New Member States in particular will not feel themselves to be full citizens of the European Union until borders are actually removed for all EU citizens."
"Unfortunately, the present documents do not adequately deal with existing problems regarding the implementation of the freedoms of European Union citizens, including the application of the so-called ‘variable geometry scheme’."
"I believe that existing divisions also need to be addressed more clearly in the European Council’s Tampere II programme."
"We should avoid situations where citizens of third countries, for whom special regimes and regulations apply, are in a more favourable position compared to citizens of the New Member States."
"In the near future, one practical question requiring serious work is the enlargement of the Schengen system to include the new members as quickly as possible."
"We need to concentrate our political will, so that this opportunity can be created by 2007, not in theory but in practice."
"The Council and the Commission need to allocate funds for this, in order to set up the necessary visa information system and ensure the availability of experts to carry out missions to the New Member States."
"This process also involves targeted policies on the part of the European Union, which aim to bring to a conclusion the process of border agreement negotiation between the New Member States and their neighbours, for which the new members have done everything in their power."
"Finally, I would like to thank Commissioner Vitorino for his very effective and valuable work in managing EU internal affairs and his considerable contribution to the European Convention."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I really am glad that today’s agenda includes this topic, which is of such importance to every citizen of the EU, and I am very sad that many of the groups have left the Chamber."
"In this area, too, our enlarged Union is facing new challenges, simply because our external borders have been moved, and we have to be able to guarantee that these will be well secured."
"A coordinated border policy is a priority, and the securing of our external borders must be jointly funded, but I regard with some scepticism the establishment of a Corps of Border Guards for the EU."
"Our future objective must be the creation of common asylum law and clear rules on migration, with the fixing of quotas being reserved to the Member States."
"In this context, it is important that action be taken against illegal immigration."
"Sacrosanct though the right to asylum is, immigration cannot be a right."
"We also have to work towards greater cooperation with the states bordering the EU in dealing with asylum and migratory flows."
"The protection of our citizens demands that we take action against terrorism and organised crime, and, in the area of data protection related to this, it is important that we come up with a good compromise between counter-terrorism, our economic interests and the rights of citizens."
"Our policy must increasingly focus on combating child pornography, the traffic in women and drugs, corruption and on stabilising the Balkans."
"In conclusion, and speaking on behalf of my own country, let me emphatically thank Commissioner Vitorino for his commitment and for his very positive efforts for the Europe in which we share."
"I should like to turn to the issue of asylum policy in the context of the new Member States."
"The European Union’s enlargement in 2004 was accompanied by a significant rise in applications for asylum in the new Member States."
"According to the predictions of the UN High Commissioner for refugees, who recently paid a study visit to Poland, Slovakia and Hungary, numbers will continue to rise at the present rate in these countries for at least the next few years."
"For example, following the escalation of the conflict in the North Caucasus, Poland is currently accepting the largest number of Chechen refugees."
"Since mid-September their number has risen by several hundred per cent."
"Every day, around 50 Chechen citizens cross Poland’s eastern border."
"Most of them are mothers with children, and a great many are unaccompanied children."
"Work on a common asylum policy needs to be stepped up, and measures should and must be taken to set up a joint funding mechanism based on solidarity between Member States, as well as an organisational mechanism for the integration of persons granted refugee status."
"An integrated system for border management and the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders also need to be created rapidly."
"The Agency should commence its activities as soon as possible in order to establish common standards for protection of the European Union’s external borders."
"The most suitable place for the Agency to be located is Poland, as Poland has the longest land border in the European Union."
"That concludes the debate on the report."
"I would like to invite Mr Vittorino to take the floor."
"Mr President, first of all, with regard to Members' remarks on the new generation of the Schengen information system, I would reiterate that according to our initial planning, the Commission is fully on time in its effort to guarantee that the new generation system will enter into force by 2007."
"We hope that the new Member States will make maximum use of the Schengen facility to prepare themselves for the important moment when internal border controls are abolished."
"My second remark is about the Lampedusa situation."
"We recognise that the Italian authorities are under enormous pressure, but we have been reassured by the Italian Government that all those who arrive at Lampedusa asking for asylum are treated in accordance with international conventions, in particular the Geneva Convention."
"Therefore, their requests for asylum have been analysed by the authorities in the field."
"I would emphasise that it is up to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to verify the situation there."
"Thirdly, I should like to reiterate that the pilot project that the Commission and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees intend to develop in Morocco, Mauritania, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya does not include anything about camps."
"There is confusion on this point: the aim of the project is to strengthen national asylum systems."
"It does have anything to do with camps."
"I share the views of several Members of the House who have emphasised the need to guarantee that in the next financial perspectives there are sufficient financial tools to improve solidarity in the management of internal borders and in the management of migratory and asylum flows."
"I hope that we can count on the support of the House on the Commission's proposal on this matter."
"Finally, I would like very much to thank several Members of the House for the very kind words that they addressed to me."
"I left this House as a Member of Parliament ten years ago, and I am now leaving as a Member of the Commission."
"Goodness knows in what capacity I might come back!"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the report (A6-0013/2004) by Mrs Gill on Draft amending budget No 9 of the European Union for the financial year 2004."
". Mr President, I would like to set out the history and the role of European Data Protection Supervisor and the reasons for draft amending budget No 9."
"Earlier this year the European Data-Protection Supervisor and the Assistant Supervisor were appointed."
"This is three years after the regulation came into force."
"In February this year the Commission presented preliminary draft amending budget No 2, providing the appropriations for the budget lines in Section VIII (B) of the 2004 budget."
"The Commission proposed an overall amount of EUR 1.2 million for the Data Protection Supervisor to start his activities."
"The proposal was endorsed at the time by the Council and Parliament, and the new Data Protection Supervisor Mr Hustinx and the Assistant Supervisor Mr Delgado have started working and are based in the premises of the European Parliament."
"So, this amending budget No 9 will modify the appropriations of the EDPS by topping up the amount granted in amending budget No 2, which was passed earlier this year."
"However, it should be noted that the figures that were originally foreseen in amending budget No 2 were only for nine months."
"They were predicted in 2001 and the fact is that the Data Protection Supervisor came into being in 2004."
"As a result of this delay of two years, this particular amending budget is necessary because we need to increase the appropriations in commitments by over EUR 670 000 and in revenue by EUR 170 000."
"Furthermore, additional amounts of some EUR 300 000 are needed to cover ongoing legal commitments."
"This includes remuneration of members of the institution; there is an adjustment to the appropriations for staff; there are also issues with regard to graduate traineeships and exchanges of officials."
"In addition, there is a requirement for rent and for data processing and telecommunications."
"I am also proposing that we enter EUR 200 000 in the reserve."
"We will be reducing some of the appropriations for mission expenses, secretarial allowances, translation and interpretation costs, as well as expenditure on publishing and information."
"As I said earlier, these problems came about because the European Parliament and the Council adopted the regulation in 2001."
"The main purpose of this regulation is the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies."
"With regard to the free movement of such data, this regulation established an independent supervisory authority, called the European Data Protection Supervisor."
"This Supervisor is responsible for monitoring the processing of personal data by Community institutions and will work with each institution and its data protection officer."
"The Supervisor will deal with sensitive personal data, relating for example to health methods and evaluation of staff."
"I am pleased to inform the House that the Council has adopted this draft amending budget."
"However, I need to point out that in the debate in the Committee on Budgets there were some reservations about the costs."
"Given that this is a newly established institution, we are prepared to accept this particular budget as it is."
"Yet I do want to make it clear that in the future we want to see greater budgetary rigour as well as better planning and forecasting on the part both of the Commission and these new institutions that we are establishing."
"I appreciate that there are constraints in relation to how the money can be spent, the legal basis, and so on. However, we have to ensure that we have better forecasting."
"Looking at the number of amending budgets and so forth, we must also remember that we are at a critical point and that Parliament will be establishing a new temporary committee on the financial perspectives."
"It is therefore important that whilst we fight for our main political objectives – which will be enshrined in the new financial perspectives – we also examine some of the internal structures, as well as inter–institutional arrangements."
"Our internal procedures are often too complicated for the EU citizen to understand."
"We need to simplify the budgetary process."
"It is important to remember that what we are doing today is not just a question of technical information in the report: it matters to my constituents in West Midlands and it matters to everybody's constituents across Europe."
"This new institution will protect our citizens in relation to data processing, which is ever–increasing."
"That is a good thing and I am very pleased to recommend to the House that we adopt this amending budget as it stands."
"Mr President, Mrs Gill, ladies and gentlemen, the report that has now been presented deals with practical implementation of Article 8 of the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights, which covers the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data, which has been yet another of the European Union’s successes in recent years."
"The role of European Data Protection Supervisor was established as long ago as 1997 by the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Protection of fundamental rights in the EU, including the protection of personal data, was advanced in particular by the adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in 2000."
"On 22 December 2003, the European Parliament and the Council agreed to the appointment of the European Data Protection Supervisor, which became effective on 17 January 2004."
"The European Data Protection Supervisor has the task of ensuring the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data through the Community institutions and bodies established by this Treaty or on the basis of it."
"This is the third time in this year that this new supervisory body has been the subject of an amending budget."
"On 9 May, your House adopted the Second Amending Budget, which allocated the Data Protection Supervisor the sum of EUR 1.272 million and 15 posts in the 2004 Budget."
"The organisation plan takes into account the Fourth Amending Budget relating to the introduction of the new Staff Regulations for officials and other servants."
"Mrs Gill’s report proposes that the draft Ninth Amending Budget be adopted without amendment."
"The amending estimates for 2004 are based on assumed expenditure of EUR 670 279 and assumed income of EUR 172 443."
"Section VIII, Part B for the 2004 Budget year amounts to EUR 1.9 million in total and provides for the conversion of three permanent posts into temporary ones, with no change in the number of staff employed, as approved in this year’s Second Amending Budget."
"To the rapporteur, I extend my very warm thanks for the support given to this draft, for the report itself, and for Parliament’s support in this area."
"Mr President, I speak on behalf of Mr Ferber, who is unable to be with us this evening, and also in my capacity as PPE-DE Group shadow rapporteur to Mrs Gill."
"The committee has been disappointed at the perceived inability to control the budget for the body in question, although I accept that it was only introduced this year."
"I was delighted when an institutional administrative cooperation agreement was signed in June between the Commission, Parliament and the Council."
"This was designed firstly to ensure that this body took advantage of the experience gained in other institutions in the administrative and financial fields through the transfer of know-how; secondly to enable it immediately to take its place as an institution by exercising its functions and prerogatives; and, finally, to ensure compliance with the golden rule of good financial management through the introduction of economies of scale."
"We have not seen enough of the latter, which is why the PPE-DE Group abstained when it came to the vote on this particular supplementary and amending budget."
"We did not want to cause any disruption to the process and passage of the budget, but what we did – and Mrs Gill will bear this out – was to urge extreme caution for 2005."
"This will be a matter for another rapporteur, I know, but given that the EUR 1.2 million initially required rose to 1.9 million, as the Commissioner has just said, and 2.8 million is being requested for next year, I would urge the greatest of caution, because we expect better financial management than this."
"We have no grumbles or gripes about what this organisation does – it is badly needed – but we do have our concerns about how it does it."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, my greetings to the Commission."
"Establishing the Office of the Data Protection Supervisor is an appropriate and necessary step."
"The draft amending budget under discussion is a routine matter connected with this, which we should adopt in accordance with Mrs Gill’s proposal."
"In connection with this, I would like to remind the Commission that it ought to take more drastic action in getting the work of the European Chemicals Agency underway as soon as the legislation on chemicals has been passed."
"The decision to set up a Chemicals Agency has been made by the European Council."
"It will not start its work in good time, however, unless preparatory work is done to provide office space and undertake other tasks to establish the Agency in Helsinki; faster, moreover, than has currently been the case with the establishment of the Office of the Data Protection Supervisor."
"There has been an astonishing amount of time wasted with regard to this project."
"The number of offices and agencies has already grown from seven to 23 since the start of the millennium, and in just the same way as we are now about to open the Office of the Data Protection Supervisor in Greece, we must also, in a credible manner, set about the task of fulfilling the promise made to Finland."
"The work of the Chemicals Agency must begin at the first opportunity."
"Mr President, all one can say is here we go again folks, roll up and see the incredible bureaucrats of Brussels make another 1.2 million pounds of taxpayers money vanish in the blink of an eye."
"Watch in amazement as they create yet another unwanted institution designed to bury our hard-pressed business community in realms of delightful new paperwork."
"Before your very eyes see the European Union keep on getting bigger and bigger."
"At the stroke of a pen a new interfering busybody will be given a gigantic budget with which to expand their personal fiefdom and create another mountain of red tape."
"Mr President, the nation states can and do make their own arrangements on data protection."
"Britain has its own data–protection register and very detailed regulations to go with it."
"We simply do not need this post of European Data–Protection Supervisor and I strongly urge Members to vote against this amending budget and, just for once, to say 'no' to the EU empire builders."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the good thing about the tail end of a debate is always that one can listen attentively, and I, personally, would say that every one of the speeches made had something plausible about it."
"To come to the point, though, my position is that it makes sense, when there are so many European regulations, that there should be, and must be, a European Data Protection Supervisor."
"I do believe, though, that it makes little sense to do this in the way that is being attempted now."
"I think the conservatives had good reason to abstain, and that there are very, very good reasons for voting against."
"Instead of making much more efficient use of what we have and retrieving things that have long been available, we are again attempting to add on new things, and to that I am indeed opposed."
"I see the Data Protection Supervisor as another example of how one could manage efficiently with much less."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to support the proposed draft for the amended budget of the European Union for 2004 regarding the European Data Protection Supervisor item."
"At the same time, however, in connection with the budgetary management of the European Union in the first seven months of 2004, I would like to express my concern at the obvious discrepancy between the handover of contributions, 74% of which have been paid, and the handover of payments, only 54% of which have been paid and which are lagging behind quite noticeably."
"When projected onto the budget of the Slovak Republic for the first nine months of 2004, this represents a 70% fulfilment of contributions to the budgets of the European Union while just 15% of the projected yearly payments from the European Union budget have been made."
"This situation means that instead of receiving post-entry aid, Slovakia and the other new Member States have become net contributors to the European Union budget."
"This state of affairs should be subjected to urgent scrutiny, both at the level of the European Commission and at the level of the Council of Europe and the national governments."
"Thank you very much."
"That brings us to the end of the list of speakers."
"I declare today’s sitting closed."

"(1)"
"Mr President, I rise to speak on statements made in France by one of the Members of this House, Mr Gollnisch."
"I would like to give two or three examples of remarks which he has recently made; ‘there is not a serious historian alive today who adheres completely to the conclusions of the Nuremberg trial’, ‘as to the existence of the gas chambers, that is up to the historians to determine’, and ‘I question the number of victims of the Holocaust’."
"Such comments cannot be allowed to go unchallenged, and I would ask you, Mr President, to refer the matter to the Bureau."
"These comments, made by a Member of Parliament, are an attack on the values which formed a basis for the construction of both the EU itself and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, as included in the Constitutional Treaty. I should like to say from the outset that if a debate were to be held on parliamentary immunity as a result of the legal proceedings which cannot fail to be instigated, I would be in favour of waiving this immunity."
"– Mr President, I have a request to make of you."
"Yesterday, the Conference of Presidents, which both Mr Watson and I attended, decided to ask the President of Parliament, Mr Borrell, to forward to the President-designate of the Commission, Mr Barroso, the letters from the various committees of this House containing the outcomes of the hearings, so that he could take note of them and draw his own conclusions from them."
"I read in yesterday’s evening newspapers and in yesterday evening’s press agency reports that Mr Barroso, even though these letters are not yet in his possession, is already making statements about the outcomes of the hearings, to the effect that he is not interested in what the letters contain, regards – in as many words – his own Commission as perfectly suitable, and is unwilling to make any changes."
"I would ask you, Mr President, to ensure that Mr Barroso is given to understand that my group is no longer prepared to be on the receiving end of this sort of talk."
"If Mr Barroso wants the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to have any confidence in him, he will have to take a different approach to this House."
"The fact is that this is not just about Mr Buttiglione, but now also about Mr Barroso himself."
"I would ask you, Mr President, to see to it that Mr Barroso, when he receives these letters, also receives along with them the message that we expect a different attitude from the President-designate of the Commission."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Bureau has been examining the issue raised by Mr Poignant since yesterday evening, and the President’s thoughts on the matter are very similar to those which you have just expressed."
"Mr Schulz’s remark will naturally be forwarded to the relevant bodies."
"Before opening the debate, I have a statement to make."
"I have received from Mr Matsakis a letter and a legal opinion concerning the request from the public prosecutor of the Republic of Cyprus to waive his parliamentary immunity, which was noted by the European Parliament on 13 October 2004."
"In his letter, Mr Matsakis challenges the public prosecutor’s authority to make such a request."
"Pursuant to Rule 6(3), the letter has been forwarded to the Committee on Legal Affairs, the only committee competent to deal with such matters, to verify the public prosecutor’s authority to make the request."
"The next item is oral questions to the Council and the Commission on the function of the Community’s Generalised System of Preferences for the ten-year period from 2006 to 2015."
"I hope that the Commission will join us as soon as possible, and in the meantime I should like to begin by giving the floor to Mrs Morgantini, the author of the question."
"I hope that today’s debate will only mark the beginning of a useful and necessary collaboration between institutions and between committees of this Parliament on a question of the greatest importance for the Committee on Development, a committee that I have the honour – not too greatly merited perhaps – to chair, and which I am representing today."
"Since its creation in 1971, the Generalised System of Preferences has become an essential instrument of the development policy of the European Union."
"I should also like to emphasise the good name that accrues to the European Community, in that it was the first to put this system into practice from 1971 and today, in actual fact, it is still the major donor in terms of trade concessions to developing countries."
"In examining the Commission communication, we started from a principle according to which the main objective of the Generalised System of Preferences is, and must above all continue to be, the economic and social development of those countries, pursued in the spirit of international solidarity that should govern the foreign policy of the Union."
"In this context, we welcome the objectives put in place by the communication, namely the simplification of the regimes, the concentration of preferences on those developing countries that need them most and, above all, the promotion of sustainable development."
"We are fully cognisant that in order to attain these objectives the current system will have to undergo substantial reform."
"We cannot, however, ignore the fact that any change to the current system will have considerable effects in the countries that currently benefit from that system."
"There will be favourable effects but also, as representatives of various countries have pointed out, adverse effects."
"It is for this reason that the European Parliament has wished to make its voice heard from the very beginning of the reform process, namely to take note of the concerns, the opinions and the points of view of stakeholder countries."
"It seems to me that this democratic necessity is even more essential and important at this time, when the Commission has, to tell the truth, most regrettably not consulted adequately with interested parties before formulating its proposals."
"One must take into account, on the other hand, that the Council did take the opportunity to consult the European Parliament at its last meeting."
"The opinions I am expressing today, as Chairman of the Committee on Development, are therefore only preliminary opinions, but they also appear in the motion that all the political groups have deemed it advisable to sign."
"Hence I trust that today’s debate will nevertheless help to clarify the issue and above all will allow the Commission to include some of our demands in the regulation that must be adopted by the Commissioners probably on 20 October."
"Consequently, I should wish to request the Commission to reply to the questions that we have posed in our examination."
"In detail, there are three issues on which I should like to insist: the graduation mechanism, the functioning of GSP+ and the reform of the system of rules of origin."
"With regard to the first, while we welcome the simplification of the graduation mechanism, the fact that the Commission is proposing to base it exclusively on the criterion of market share, leaving aside any indicators of development and poverty, almost fills us with dismay."
"We cannot overlook the fact that these arrangements could have very negative consequences for major exporters."
"Without being necessarily hostile, we should therefore like to join the Commission and the Council in studying the consequences and the modality of this proposal in great detail in the coming months."
"In relation to the new GSP+ system, which we consider to be of benefit, given that it supports sustainable development, it seems essential to us, however, to define criteria that are clear, reliable and at the same time realistic."
"We should like to see a firm commitment by the Commission to supply the necessary technical assistance."
"In conclusion, I should like to stress that one of the obstacles to an efficient use of the system has, as we know, been the system of rules of origin."
"That is why we welcome a substantial reform of the system which favours regional expansion, although we hope that good intentions will result in concrete initiatives: a proposal, therefore, and an examination of the systems applied by other countries."
"I shall stop here, aware that I have highlighted only a few aspects of this difficult subject, but that is all I can do in the time allotted to me."
"As for the rest, I very much want to hear my dear fellow Member, Mr Barón Crespo, Chairman of the Committee on International Trade, and, of course, my other fellow Members, as well as the replies – which I trust will be detailed – that the Commission and the Council may possibly provide. I truly hope that we can have a fruitful collaboration that can yield positive results."
"Commissioner, Luisa, I am delighted to be able to present a question jointly with the Chairman of the Committee on Development."
"As you know, it is normal amongst parliamentary committees to fight for competences but, in this case, I believe that working together is a good omen for this new term in office."
"Turning to the Commission – in relation to the Communication it has presented on the Generalised System of Preferences –I would like to add to Mrs Morgatini’s positive assessment with the following observations:"
"Firstly, we believe it would be very useful – and this can be done when the proposal for a Regulation is presented – for there to be an assessment of the functioning of the system, for us to work on the basis of more than ten years experience and for the interested parties to be consulted."
"I believe this would be useful for everybody, including the Commission."
"With regard to the general elements of the Communication, I would like to point out firstly that if we want the GSP to make a greater and better contribution to the development of the neediest countries, the commercial preferences must reflect the comparative advantages and export interests of those countries."
"It is also important that the preferences cover more products and, above all, that a significant number of products currently considered sensitive be transferred to the non-sensitive category."
"To this end, we must consider the possibility of broadening the preferential margin."
"Secondly, I would also like to say that our committees are pleased with the Commission’s determination to improve and simplify the system of rules of origin."
"I would urge the Commission to promote an accumulation of trans-regional origin and to move towards harmonising the rules of origin systems in the various existing commercial agreements and systems."
"Finally, please allow me to refer to the new single system of additional preferences – known as GSP+."
"Although the creation of this new system responds, at least in part, to the need to dismantle the current ‘Drug System’ following the decision of the WTO panel, I believe it is very important to ensure that the current beneficiaries of the system enjoy a reasonable transitional period in order to meet the new requirements that the GSP+ imposes on them, so that they are not suddenly faced with the loss of preferences which they very much need and which they have justly deserved until now."
"With a view to guaranteeing a reasonable degree of transparency and democratic control, I would ask the Commission and the Council to begin a process of consultation on the first Regulation on the application of the new GSP sufficiently in advance for the associated countries, the non-governmental agents and the institutions of the European Union – including the European Parliament first and foremost – to participate and be adequately consulted."
"In this regard, I believe the Council’s conclusions approved in Luxembourg on 11 October are positive, since they refer to the need for explicit consultation with Parliament, thus going further than what is currently laid down in the Treaties."
"I hope that both Mr Lamy and Mr Nicolaï will make a firm commitment in this regard."
"I would like to end my speech, Mr President, by highlighting the presence here today of Commissioner Lamy, which is an example – perhaps the last example – of his excellent willingness to cooperate with this House."
"As you all know, Mr Lamy has been an enthusiastic interlocutor with Parliament throughout the last term in office and a defender of joint work."
"Since I do not know whether I will have another opportunity to do so, I will end by inviting my fellow Members to join me in thanking the Commissioner for his excellent work on the Trade portfolio and in particular for the spirit of cooperation he has demonstrated in his work as Commissioner."
"[Mr Lamy, I wish you every success in your next reincarnation]."
"Mr President, thank you. Like the honourable Members of this House, the Council welcomes the Commission’s communication on developing countries, international trade and sustainable development, the role of the Community’s Generalised System of Preferences for the period 2006-2015 and, above all, the general objective outlined therein."
"The GSP should be stable, predictable, objective, simple, transparent and compatible with the WTO, and it must take account of the developing countries’ specific needs."
"The Council backs the Commission’s efforts towards a comprehensive simplification of the GSP, the general objective of which is to help the developing countries drive back poverty and promote sustainable development."
"For that purpose, the countries eligible for GSP must be selected on the basis of objective development criteria."
"Like the European Parliament, the Council notes that further information is required about implementation before a definitive position can be adopted, so that it can, at this stage, say only a few words about the basic principles that are explained in the Commission’s communication."
"As is stated in the Council’s and Commission’s declaration about the European Community’s development policy, the Council takes the view that the common trade policy can lend force to the objectives of the development policy, with specific reference to the eradication of poverty and the promotion of sustainable development, of which the fight against drugs forms an integral component."
"Preferential access to the markets of the developed countries is a contributory factor in the economic development of the developing countries and helps to integrate them into the global economy."
"I would now like to address a number of specific questions raised by the honourable Members of this House, and I should like to start with the GSP+."
"The Council is prepared to give favourable consideration to the GSP+ proposal."
"The substantial preferential rights conferred by GSP+ encourage developing countries to abide by treaties in the areas of human rights, labour rights, the environment and good governance, of which the fight against drugs forms an important component."
"However, a number of crucial aspects still need to be addressed, including a list of relevant treaties, the question of which treaties will be compulsory, the conditions and procedures for awarding and withdrawing the GSP+, fourthly, the monitoring systems that will be used; fifthly, any additional criteria which are tied in with the beneficiaries’ development needs, and, finally, the possible transitional regulation for the beneficiaries of the present incentive regulations which are unlikely to qualify for the GSP."
". Mr President, the Generalised System of Preferences has now been in existence for nearly 30 years."
"It consists of granting preferential tariffs, or reductions in customs duties, to nearly 180 developing countries, on the basis of general principles which we revise every ten years."
"As it encourages European importers to source supplies from these countries, the Generalised System of Preferences is in fact an aid to development through trade."
"The system which was adopted ten years ago will expire in late 2005, and in 2006 a new ten-year cycle will begin."
"This is why I presented a Commission communication to the Council and to Parliament last July, the aim of which was to outline the general principles which will act as a basis for implementing legislation during this new period."
"This legislation will in turn provide a framework for Council regulations, and it will be possible to revise these regulations every three years in order to adapt them to economic realities, if experience shows that these have changed."
"The European Union is the most generous partner by a long way with regard to trade preferences, and nearly EUR 53 billion of trade flows benefit from them, without mentioning the ACP regime."
"These figures mean that we exceed by a long way all the other countries in this field, as only USD 17 billion of trade flows benefit from preferences granted by the United States, which is the second largest donor."
"In addition, we are all aware that the EU’s enlargement to include ten new Member States can only increase its superiority in this area."
"In response to Mrs Morgantini and Mr Barón Crespo, the results produced by the GSP have been evaluated, and we have been provided with all the figures which are currently available."
"The evaluation shows that, broadly speaking, the system has produced positive results, but that there is still room for improvement. Be that as it may, the system has produced positive results; for example, the latest definitive figures available show that, between 2000 and 2002, our imports under this system grew from EUR 47 billion to EUR 53 billion, which is a significant growth, especially as certain products were removed from the GSP list for technical reasons."
"Similarly, the GSP utilisation rate, or the ratio of trade flows which are theoretically eligible for GSP to imports which actually benefit from GSP, has regularly increased over the past few years, and currently stands at nearly 55%."
"These are therefore the positive aspects, which demonstrate that the system works."
"In contrast, the current incentive regimes, and in particular all matters relating to the application of the social and environmental clauses, have had little success, as only two beneficiary countries, Sri Lanka and Moldova, which are not exactly giants of global trade, benefit from the social clause."
"We should take these experiences into account, and the objectives of the Commission’s proposed reform are therefore to make the system of preferences simpler, more generous, more targeted at the countries which need it and more objective."
"Firstly, the system must be made simpler."
"Why?"
"Because a simpler system will be more targeted at developing countries and at operators in these countries who need security."
"This is why we propose moving from a five-pillar system, which is what we have at present, to a three-pillar system."
"The five pillars include the general arrangements, the social clause, the environmental clause, the drugs regime and the ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative, which is in force for the least advanced countries."
"I propose a move from five pillars to three; general arrangements will be kept in place, and the ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative will exist for the least advanced countries."
"There will also be an intermediary regime called GSP Plus, which will encourage sustainable development in all its aspects, including those relating to social, environmental and good governance issues and to the fight against drugs."
"GSP Plus will abolish customs duties for beneficiary countries which have committed themselves to ratifying and applying the main international conventions in the field."
"Which conventions would this involve?"
"We propose choosing conventions which are, so to speak, ‘unquestioned’ in the international arena, such as the United Nations pacts on political, economic, social and cultural rights, the International Labour Organisation’s fundamental Conventions, or the United Nations Convention against Corruption."
"Accession to some of these conventions will be mandatory in order for countries to benefit from GSP Plus, for example the two United Nations pacts, the eight International Labour Organisation Conventions, conventions against racial discrimination or that concerning women and all conventions relating to torture, children’s rights and genocide."
"We will of course demand that these conventions be ratified, and indeed not merely ratified but also applied effectively – this in response to Mrs Morgantini’s second comment."
"We expect there to be a two-fold evaluation in this area, the first being carried out when applications are assessed, as access to GSP Plus will be refused to beneficiary countries which make no commitments in this field."
"The second evaluation will consist of asking the competent international organisations to carry out some kind of evaluation of the application of each convention."
"A country such as Belarus, for example, whatever progress it makes with ratifying these conventions, could not at present be eligible."
"So much for conventions."
"The system will therefore be simpler, and also more generous."
"Why more generous?"
"Because customs duties are frequently eroded during multilateral trade negotiations, which means that the comparative advantage for countries benefiting from the system of preferences is also eroded."
"We must therefore compensate for this tariff erosion if we wish to maintain the benefits gained by developing countries from the GSP, and we propose extending the coverage of the GSP to include a certain number of new products, so that this tariff erosion is compensated by a growth of the export base."
"We are in the process of discussing this growth within the Commission, with a new deadline next week, and this is a point to which I shall return."
"We will deal with issues which are difficult, delicate and sensitive, but upon which we wish to make progress, as is the case with fisheries products."
"Still on the subject of a greater generosity, and in response to Mrs Morgantini’s third comment, we intend to put forward proposals to adapt the rules of origin."
"As has been shown in a large number of studies, the rules of origin are a necessary condition for access to trade preferences."
"The conditions which we impose with regard to the origin of products do not exist in order to take with the left hand what we give with the right, but in order to guarantee that preferences actually benefit the country at which we are targeting them, and not others instead."
"In order to achieve this, conditions regulating origin and checks of origin are required."
"That said, it is true that the rules in force today were drawn up several decades ago, at a time when the European Union was more defensive in its trade policy than is the case today."
"We must therefore adjust them in order to move away from the old system and to take into account the fact that processes today have changed."
"For example, in the context of globalisation and international division, as a result of which production processes have been splintered among different countries, renewed attention must be paid to the issue of whether there should be a cumulation of origin between the country from which the goods originate and certain countries from which other inputs used in the manufacture of the same goods may come."
"It is therefore in this spirit that we intend to put forward proposals, following the Green Paper which we published with Mr Bolkestein late last year."
"For example, and as just suggested by Mr Barón Crespo, research could be carried out into ways in which the system could be relaxed in order to encourage the regional integration of countries benefiting from preferences."
"The reform’s third objective is to target preferences at the countries which need them most."
"This is clearly a politically sensitive issue, as there will be winners and losers as a result of any reform of this kind."
"We intend to target the system of preferences at the beneficiary countries which need it most, which in reality means the smallest developing countries, those which are landlocked and those which are the most vulnerable, and not the large countries which already occupy positions of increasing significance in international trade, such as China’s position in the international textile and clothing trade."
"We will of course keep the ‘Everything But Arms’ system in place for the poorest countries, as trade integration under this system is one of the characteristic features of the EU’s development policy."
"As well as limiting the criteria, we will therefore also need to continue helping a certain number of countries to gain access to our market and, once they have done so, to follow this up with a system of graduation."
"Quite simply, and in response to Mrs Morgantini’s first comment, we wish to carry out a radical simplification of the graduation system in order to meet the requirements of the World Trade Organisation, following cases against India on the drugs regime which were heard before WTO panels and which we lost at least partially."
"Our response on this issue will be to target graduation at the idea of competitiveness of beneficiary products."
"The key criterion will be market share, and the trigger for graduation will be a given percentage of imports into the Community."
"From the moment when a developing country achieves a certain share of the market in the European Union, we will consider that we have done what is necessary to help it export and that, to use a metaphor, the country can now fly with its own wings."
"Where will the threshold lie?"
"It is still a little early to give you any figures, as we are in the process of discussing the issue within the Commission."
"This will clearly have consequences for the countries concerned."
"That said, I can already assure you that whatever the final figure we choose, it will be the very large exporter countries which could be affected, and not the majority of our beneficiaries, of which there are a total of 180, as I just mentioned."
"The last point upon which I wish to speak, Mr President, is in response to the oral questions."
"I understand from Mrs Morgantini’s speech that she is concerned that this House should be able to express its opinion fully on this new project."
"It goes without saying that we hope that this House will give its opinion, as this reform is important both from the point of view of development and from that of trade policy, and I should like to thank Mr Barón Crespo for his comments on the work of this Commission, in particular in its relations with Parliament, an aspect which will remain unchanged."
"It is quite simply the case that we have a number of time constraints, to which I referred very recently when I spoke before the parliamentary committee which is responsible for such issues."
"Firstly, we could not begin this reform before the arrival of the new Member States last May."
"It is absolutely essential that we involve them in a decision which will be binding upon the Union until 2015."
"Secondly, it was necessary to wait for the decision on a dispute brought before the WTO, namely the proceedings instituted against us by India with regard to the drugs regime."
"This decision was taken in April 2004, and it was then that we were able to start in-depth work."
"In addition, as this reform is to enter into force on 1 January 2006, it should be completed one year earlier if possible."
"Why one year earlier?"
"In order to allow beneficiary countries and economic operators to adapt to it."
"This means that the first implementing regulation should be adopted during the next few months."
"Next week, on 20 October, I will present it to my colleagues, and it will be available to you immediately afterwards."
"I am aware and I understand that Parliament requires a certain amount of time; we will of course do all that we can to ensure that it has this time, and, as you know, our staff is entirely at your disposal."
"To put it in simple terms, the goal is to help developing countries to export goods to us."
"These are developing countries and, by definition, they need more time than others to adjust to rules which can sometimes be complicated, even if the system we are putting in place will be a simplified one."
"My feelings are therefore that they will need at least nine to ten months, and this is the message I would like to convey to this House."
"I am sure that those of you who are committed to the system for development policy reasons will understand my concern on this point."
"Mr President, it has already been stated that the Generalised System of Preferences offers trade benefits to the countries that are most in need of them."
"In the European Union, we have established millennium objectives for development and have committed to those."
"They are, above all, focused on fighting poverty."
"The economic development is a key condition in this respect, and so we think it is upon this that the revision should focus."
"It is unfortunate that we need to do this under time pressure now that the complaint lodged by India with the WTO has been declared founded."
"Our group is of the opinion – one fortunately shared by the Commissioner – that, firstly, the poorest countries should not become poorer still."
"In those cases where preferences have been eroded by lowering the rates for most-favoured nations, we would therefore ask the Commission to consider what else could be done."
"Secondly, we think that the system of graduation must meet its objective that the only countries or sectors to be excluded should be those that are already operating sufficiently competitively within the market and thus no longer need the GSP."
"Also, it is our view that good governance should certainly be given a place in the new GSP+."
"Finally, revision should also mean that the countries for which the GSP+ is specifically designed could make more use of it."
"What should become the most important instrument is being used only for 52%, or 55%, as the Commissioner stated a moment ago."
"This increase is positive, but the result is not yet satisfactory."
"I have two questions for the Commission."
"The idea behind the GSP’s revision is sound and clear; the intention is to create a simpler, more transparent and more objective system, and here, it goes without saying, we are completely behind the Commission."
"What is less clear is how exactly this can be achieved."
"For example, how does the Commission aim to prevent the planned GSP+ regulation, which admittedly will become one single regulation, from not becoming too complex in terms of implementation, adherence and control so that there is in practice too little of the proposed simplification and transparency?"
"The other question, which has already been raised, concerns assessment."
"According to the communication, there is no assessment, or no sound assessment at any rate, a statement denied by both Mr Mandelson and Mr Lamy."
"If this assessment is available, could Parliament have this without delay?"
"Thank you."
"Mr President, Mr Lamy, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you, Mr Lamy, for the detailed information you have provided us with on the way in which this reform will be implemented."
"Against a background of trade globalisation, the reform demonstrates the will of the European Union to make market laws subject to the development objectives of the poorest countries and to human rights objectives, as well as testifying to our ambition to make globalisation more moral."
"In this context, a thorough evaluation must be carried out of the previous system, and in particular of its impact on the goal of poverty reduction."
"The complex and partial nature of agreements has sometimes made it impossible to achieve any kind of overview of the way in which the system works, especially as the close relations between exporting countries and certain multinational companies have prevented a thorough evaluation of the system’s impact."
"The Commission’s proposal to simplify the system is therefore to be welcomed."
"I should also like to emphasise how important it is to clarify the conditions according to which preferential tariffs are granted, in particular with regard to respect for core labour standards."
"The need to promote core labour standards goes well beyond relations between poor nations and rich nations."
"Two conditions must be fulfilled in order to ensure that the system is as meaningful and effective as possible; industrialised countries must naturally be prepared to comply with it, but beneficiary developing nations must also take advantage of it to reduce inequalities within their countries and to improve living and working conditions for their populations."
"The way to achieve this, of course, is to incorporate criteria and conditions into the system which guarantee respect for workers’ rights and for the human rights conventions to which you referred."
"In this respect, it is essential that a distinction be made between the ratification of international conventions and their effective application."
"All our attention must be directed towards ensuring that future regulations clearly indicate the need for beneficiary countries both to have ratified international conventions on core labour standards and to apply them effectively and in full."
"Procedures for evaluating these two aspects must therefore also be laid down."
"Whilst on the subject of procedures, why should social partners not be involved in these evaluations by means of consultations?"
"This would provide a guarantee that the experience and practical knowledge held by trade unions in the field of core labour standards would be put to use."
"More specifically, the European Union should endeavour to promote a greater effectiveness of the instruments of the International Labour Organisation, for example by the possible opening of enquiries to monitor respect for core labour standards under the GSP procedure."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European preferential system is certainly, post-enlargement, the most important and most generous system in the world by far."
"It follows that any change to the system has crucial implications for everyone concerned."
"The livelihoods of many producers in developing countries, but also in Europe, depend on it."
"I share the Commission’s view that the system should be simplified and should focus more on the countries in greatest need of it in order to be able to compete within the global market."
"What is important is that the system should become more flexible so that there can be systematic investigation of whether some sectors in beneficiary countries still really need the system in order to be competitive."
"If a country is guilty of unfair trading practices, of violating the WTO rules or human rights, a temporary suspension should always be possible."
"In short, I support the Commission’s objectives with regard to the GSP, but like Mrs Martens, I have my doubts whether the proposed reforms will reach far enough in order to achieve the planned objectives."
"It is, for example, unclear why the number of beneficiary countries is not subject to a thorough review, so that countries that are in the Top 20 in terms of world trade no longer walk away with preferences that are, in fact, intended for the poorest."
"It is also very much the question, Commissioner, whether the proposed reform is in keeping with the WTO’s current Doha round, at the end of which the poorest countries are to be awarded full quota-free and tariff-free imports."
"I can understand Commissioner Lamy when he states that prompt action is needed, but like the Council, I should like to insist on thorough consultation with the European Parliament and on all parties involved being given the time to adapt."
"It appears from the resolution on which we will be voting today that there is broad consensus about this revision."
"I therefore hope that the Commission will be making every effort to take Parliament’s opinion, which is unanimous, into consideration."
"Mr President, I welcome the plans for serious revision of the GSP, which is long overdue."
"I also welcome the Council's recent conclusions, which very clearly demand meaningful consultation with the European Parliament."
"It is a matter of regret that the Commission's Communication was not the result of a full stakeholder consultation and did not appear sufficiently in advance to allow for meaningful consultation before the release of the next regulation."
"It is vital that Parliament and all other interested stakeholders have a proper opportunity to input into this very important process, and I am glad that Commissioner Lamy has agreed to that."
"In terms of substance, it is clear that the GSP urgently needs to be simplified since it is clearly not working properly."
"The rules of origin requirements are far too strict, with the result that a large proportion of developing-country exports to the EU fail to gain preferential access because they are deemed to be non-originating."
"One of the justifications for strict rules of origin is that they should promote so-called backward linkages, i.e. the production of intermediate goods in developing countries themselves."
"Yet the experience of this clearly demonstrates that rules of origin are not an appropriate instrument to achieve that goal."
"In fact, most developing countries are small, with little capacity to develop a full supply chain."
"Sri Lanka is a classic example, having developed a thriving garment sector but still not having the capacity to supply textiles to support that industry."
"It relies essentially on an indirect instrument of trade policy to foster a supply response in developing countries that is likely to be much less efficient and much more vulnerable to abuse than straightforward financial incentives or technical assistance or infrastructure provision for the industries concerned."
"I am pleased that Mr Lamy says that we are going to have some real action on rules of origin."
"The Commission should be looking at far-reaching proposals, such as proposals that would in general allow a least-developed country export to qualify for duty-free access to the EU if at least 40% of a good's value is added in a least-developed country that is not necessarily the final country of export."
"In the case of textiles and clothing, we clearly need to go even further, because some of the poorest countries will face enormous shocks when the Multifibre Agreement is withdrawn."
"Organisations like Oxfam have made some very detailed proposals in this area."
"My last point relates to textiles again."
"When the MFA is withdrawn, some of the poorest countries will face major problems."
"I would suggest that developing countries which are highly dependent on textiles and clothing, but are not necessarily classified as least-developed countries, should be exempted temporarily from the existing rules of origin requirements."
"This applies particularly to countries that obtain more than 50% of their current export revenue from textiles and clothing."
"I would be very interested in the views of the Commission and Council on that proposal."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, it is apparent from the separate motions for a resolution submitted by the individual groups in response to one Commission communication that a very large number of their demands were identical."
"What that means is that there exists in this House a certain consensus, particularly as regards graduation, the preferences that are to be changed, and the form that additional concessions are to take in the future."
"What amazed me about the debate was that, if one wants to change systems of preference – which we do – there has to be an analysis first."
"Trade is not an end in itself; it serves to promote countries’ economic and social development, and so it follows that an analysis has to be produced, stating what existing trade under the existing conditions under the preference systems has achieved."
"Did it make countries poorer or less poor?"
"Did it or did it not promote industrialisation?"
"Did it help to improve health service provision in underdeveloped countries, or did it not?"
"Have their young people become better trained and educated or less so?"
"What that means, then, is that we need in the first place objective criteria in order to evaluate what the existing systems have achieved in the way of development."
"I regret that I have seen no analysis of this whatever."
"Today, Commissioner Lamy said that such an analysis exists."
"There must be in-depth debate of these components in this House before the new Regulation is hammered out."
"There are two more comments I would like to make."
"Firstly, when dealing with the systems of preferences, we will, in future too, have to work on the assumption that certain countries must be evaluated in different ways."
"It may be that markets in the developing countries will have to be protected if they are to be able to develop at all."
"There is a place for that."
"I cannot ‘open up’ every market if I want to promote countries’ development, particularly as regards food safety, agriculture and so on. Secondly, this is not just about trade, but also about the fact that, if things are produced in countries in which we want to promote social measures, the jobs involved must be proper and dignified ones."
"I believe that this should also feature in the analysis."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that the two parliamentary committees have initiated this debate."
"Since its signature nearly ten years ago, the Marrakesh Agreement has resulted in fundamental changes to the nature of the relations entered into by the European Union, and by France in particular, with their developing country partners."
"Today we have a new Commission communication presenting a project for reforming and improving the Generalised System of Preferences."
"It should firstly be noted that the Generalised System of Preferences has been a battlefield between two world views: on the one hand, that of a Europe – and more specifically of France – which is committed to its developing country partners and conscious of its responsibilities and historical ties, and, on the other hand, that of a Europe which believes that exposure to global free trade should be the only real means of economic and social development."
"I fear that this new Commission communication merely serves as a smoke screen to disguise the simple fact that it renounces our previous commitments in favour of those arising from our participation in the World Trade Organisation."
"This is what is euphemistically known as a WTO-compatible system."
"In reality, and more generally, this House and the Council have allowed the Commission to pursue two contradictory policies at the same time, namely an external trade policy of absolute free trade, and a policy of providing development aid to privileged partners."
"If we did not wish to allow the WTO to dismantle the Lomé Convention systematically, instrument by instrument, the Council should have acted as a supervisor and recognised authority, in order to provide coherent definitions and a determined defence of clear and long-term strategies, including all external policy instruments, in broad fields of common interest such as development."
"This fundamental contradiction affects all of the policies which we intend to pursue together."
"How can we ask our fishermen to reduce pressure on fish stocks, at the same time as signing trade agreements with countries which do not wish to agree to make the same efforts?"
"How can we impose environmental standards, social constraints and solidarity commitments on our companies, while exposing them to a competition which bears none of these burdens?"
"Finally, how can we ask our partners from the South to believe in the long-term commitment of the EU and its Member States to their development, if, with advantages that are now barely appreciable, we expose them, reform by reform, to the forces of the single global market?"
"I am speaking on behalf of the French delegation of my group."
"We are in no way opposed to the market, and we believe in free enterprise, in initiative and in individual responsibility, but we also believe that the State should play its role as regulator and strategist, both to protect its citizens and in the interests of its poorest international partners, as in the absence of this the market is nothing but a jungle."
"Given that the prosperity of our continent was mainly established in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries under relatively protected conditions, how can we demand of our partners from the South that they expose their nascent economies to the four winds?"
"Maybe the young shoots of developing countries require assistance in some form from us on a provisional basis."
"Although admittedly imperfect, our GSP system must be kept in place. I also fear that, as in a great many other cases, the Commission proposal is not based on any impact study or evaluation of the system as a whole."
"I hope that this House will vote on a detailed proposal, but we must demand, ladies and gentlemen, that this only take place if we have been informed of the consequences which this reform will have."
"Mr President, I welcome the objectives that the Commission has set for simplification, stabilisation and clarification of the regimes."
"The European cooperation policy, which has as its goal the eradication of poverty in the world, cannot in fact be limited to development programmes, however detailed, substantial and advantageous they may be in many cases, but must make use of all the means at its disposal to promote growth in the most disadvantaged countries and thereby facilitate the economies and the exports of those countries as much as possible."
"This must naturally take place not only transparently and fully in the open, and therefore after an exceptionally scrupulous analysis of the effects of the proposed action plan cuts, but also with the utmost speed so that poor countries may take advantage of these facilities as soon as possible."
"In addition to purely economic factors, such as market share, other criteria such as the level of development and the commitment of beneficiary countries to follow the path of democracy should then be taken into consideration, and preference should be given to trade in those products that frequently play a distinctive role in the economy of a given country, such as textiles for Sri Lanka, bananas for Barbados, and cocoa in the case of Côte d’Ivoire."
"Most of all this must be carried out in strict coordination with the World Trade Organisation, in order to avoid going behind the backs of the countries involved and to avoid performing the job of regulation within the Commission itself, as has happened in the past, when it is a matter that should instead remain within the strict competence of the WTO and of the entire international community."
"Mr President, I welcome the Commissioner and wish to pick up on something he referred to rather poignantly: development aid through trade."
"As a member of the Committee on International Trade, I believe very strongly in this and we welcome the 2006-2015 reforms to the Generalised System of Preferences."
"They cover areas such as textiles, which is a particularly big area."
"However, there are potential dangers for developing countries in this revision; one country that has been mentioned already is Sri Lanka."
"I feel therefore that graduation is needed for some countries that are now independently competitive in this area."
"In connection with graduation, it is important to extend the scheme to new products."
"One of our concerns relates to the new products the Commission proposes to add to the GSP system."
"The proposals appear to be rather vague and the graduation extension must be fully explained in the Commission’s legislative process."
"We also need to bear in mind that the GSP system was designed for the least-developed countries."
"I agree with the Commissioner that resources should therefore be focused on them."
"This brings me to a point that Mr Van Hecke raised: first of all we must try to ensure that rules of origin take into account second-stage products, which help countries to industrialise, and particularly ones such as cotton."
"However, we need to ensure that when the detailed proposals are set out on the rules of origin, which allow countries to industrialise without the scheme being too far-reaching, we also look at the way in which countries apply them."
"There has been some dispute as to whether countries have been apply them to transit products, thereby adding value to these."
"This is something about which we feel very strongly."
"Finally, Commissioner, the Commission Communication itself suggests self-regulation for LDCs under the GSP."
"We argue against this in the resolution, because the time is not yet ripe."
"We request technical assistance in the implementation of new schemes, especially with regard to self-policing."
"It is important that the Commission shows how this is to be done."
"Mr President, the European Union is a community of values and we would like to put this across to the different regions in the world."
"In the West, we have basic services, such as water, education and care, and we want these to be available elsewhere too."
"International trade plays an important part in this."
"Trade revenue can help increase the level of investments in basic services, but, in developing countries, particularly on the African continent, world trade plays far too small a role."
"The African continent accounts for only a 2% share in it."
"The European Union can, and must, change this."
"It is of the utmost importance that we, as the world’s largest trading bloc, should open up our markets to products from the least developed countries and, by way of positive sanctions, give development in the poorest countries an opportunity."
"As has been said before, the present system of trade preferences has, in practice, worked to only a limited extent, particularly socially speaking."
"Only Sri Lanka and Moldavia have benefited from it, and, as Mr Sturdy stated a moment ago, the complexity of the rules and limited capacity have meant that even Sri Lanka has, in fact, made too little use of the potential."
"That is why it is a good thing that we are moving towards a GSP+ system, one that is far simpler and involves fewer countries, but yields major benefits gradually and new products, which also creates real incentives."
"Indeed, if we really want fundamental working standards, to name but one major aspect, to be adhered to in practice in those countries and to be given a chance in them, we must actively focus our efforts."
"We resist the lobbying that would result in an enormous patchwork quilt of goals and countries, from which a huge number of people draw benefit, but where the poorest countries lose out."
"Commissioner Lamy should be praised for the excellent work he is making of the EPA (Economic Partnership Agreement) regulation, and we must carry on in the same vein."
"If the Caribbean Sea area and the Pacific Ocean experience special problems, which they do, we should try to use EPAs as a targeted and generous solution to them."
"We should adopt a harder line with regard to the new upcoming superpowers China, Brazil and India and impose stricter requirements where fundamental working standards are concerned."
"Finally, we should not pursue fair trade alone, but also, with regard to the protection of our own employees, fair competition."
"With regard to the rules of origin, I would request the Commission to focus on benefits for the least developed countries and agree to relax rules of origin, and to regional and developmental cumulation."
"Finally, if we want to encourage the regional economy, we must be open-handed in this respect too."
"An incentive of this kind, which is hugely concentrated, could really help the African continent to take a step forward."
"Mr President, local markets must be maintained, at the same time as exports are strengthened."
"In order to do this, trade must operate within the framework set by the environment, and human rights must be respected and social cohesion strengthened."
"In order to reduce suffering and poverty, the GSP must be made more generous."
"Social and environmental clauses must be developed, and we should help countries develop environmental labelling so that they might be better paid for their products."
"The ACP countries make use of the Cotonou Agreement."
"In actual fact, their use of the Everything But Armsinitiative is confined to 2.6%."
"There are just a few ACP countries that have succeeded in exploiting Cotonou to the maximum."
"We must now help the rest of them to make greater use of both Cotonou and Everything But Arms."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to applaud the Commission's initiative to present a Communication prior to the reform of the GSP system, and I also applaud the timely initiative of our two parliamentary committees to present this oral question with debate jointly, the terms of which are indicative of Parliament’s desire for clarification of the Communication and, even more importantly, of the future legislation to modify the current GSP system."
"We agree with the Commission that we need to simplify, concentrate and ultimately improve the system in order to make it more effective in terms of achieving its aims."
"There are still grey areas, such as the improvement of rules of origin, the key element of the system, which must play a vital role in helping the countries benefiting from the GSP system through clear operating rules."
"The same can be said of the simplification of the GSP+ system, which we agree with, but which we believe still requires clarification in terms of the ratification or application of international standards which do not in practice represent an obstacle to the genuine application of the GSP system, as stated by certain Latin American countries such as El Salvador, or key aspects relating to incentives in the fight against drug-trafficking, which are crucial to countries such as Colombia and Bolivia."
"For all these reasons, ladies and gentlemen, we are in favour of the objective of simplifying, concentrating and improving the GSP system, although we feel it prudent to wait to see how it translates into the Commission’s forthcoming legislative text."
"At this point we would draw attention to the need to set clear criteria with regard to rules of origin and maintaining the GSP system for the benefiting Latin American countries and, in particular, the rules relating to combating drugs, which still need to be refined."
"I will end, Mr President, by saying that we support the joint resolution presented today as a joint compromise amongst the different political groups putting their signature to it, which has meant everybody giving ground for the sake of consensus."
"We therefore reject the amendments which go further than this compromise and which create ambiguity in the treatment of rules of origin, which we wish to make as clear, transparent and precise as possible in order to help third countries, while preventing fraud in their application."
"Mr President, I too welcome what is an extremely necessary and timely initiative by the Commissioner, and I would also like to thank him very much for his cooperation and hard work during his time as Commissioner, which Parliament has appreciated very much."
"However, although I welcome the initiative, it must be said that it is very general."
"The Commissioner himself acknowledges that it contains a lot of very broad proposals."
"We want more information on thresholds for graduation and on how much the GSP will be improved for countries that are not graduated."
"I also look forward to more details on the rules of origin, because it is quite difficult to judge at this point whether what is being proposed is anything more than cosmetic."
"I would like to know whether the Commissioner agrees with my assessment that if the EU substantially enhances its preference system, it could meet the requirements of the improved GSP option, the EPA alternative, which some non-LDCs are continuing to call for, as the Commissioner is well aware."
"At the meeting in Gaborone, the EU agreed to postpone until 2006 the anticipated review of the situation of non-LDCs that are not in a position to enter into EPAs."
"It also seems to me that WTO rules allow for differentiation between developing countries in non-reciprocal trade preference schemes, provided that such arrangements are based on objective criteria and that identical treatment is available to all similarly-situated developing countries."
"On the basis of that analysis, I would like the Commissioner to be more specific on whether, when Cotonou was negotiated, an enhanced GSP was looked at as an option for those that could not or did not want to enter into EPA negotiations."
"I asked for this information in committee, but I was not entirely satisfied with the answer."
"Finally, I should like the Commissioner to provide more information and clarity on what is meant by 'vulnerable', 'special development needs' and 'small economies'."
"The Commissioner talked about landlocked countries, etc., but he needs to spell things out more clearly so that we know exactly what he means."
"I should like to echo the words of thanks expressed by my fellow Members to Commissioner Lamy for the cooperation and to wish him well in his future career."
"I should also like to thank him for his clarifications today;"
"I agree with him that the Generalised System of Preferences is, in principle, a sound instrument for giving development opportunities via trade, but that the system is clearly in need of revision."
"I have two questions for the Commissioner."
"I share his view that phasing out the trade barriers does, in fact, partly erode the Generalised System of Preferences and that it is thus more than necessary for us to concentrate on the countries that need this the most."
"I therefore share Mrs Lucas’ concern about the future of some developing countries when the textile quota lapses."
"I would very much appreciate it, Commissioner, if you could explain once more how this system of graduation can be deployed to help those least developed countries."
"You mentioned China as a very obvious example, but what about the position of Pakistan and India, for example?"
"Secondly, the GSP+ system does indeed make it possible to use trade as a lever for human rights, labour rights, the environment and good governance."
"I welcome the fact that the existing regulations are being combined, for what is the use of awarding GSP+ to Pakistan on account of its drugs policy if child labour is still rampant?"
"Commissioner, you explained that it is not only about ratification, but also about application, but quite honestly, it was not entirely clear to me which treaties you have in mind."
"You gave a whole list of items and tried to explain how those should be monitored, but I fear that the list you have given will make the GSP+ system completely inoperable."
"You also failed to mention in what way sanctions will be tied in with non-compliance with those fundamental treaties and how this system can be implemented effectively."
"All too often, GSP+ or the linking to working standards or treaties become ineffective instruments, because non-compliance is simply not followed up by sanctions."
"If you could explain this once again, I would be very grateful."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this reform of the Generalised System of Preferences adds to the view of human rights as an indivisible reality, by directly linking our concepts and policies on trade, development and human rights."
"The reform of the GSP effectively incorporates the idea that the best commercial preferences should be conditional upon respect for certain standards in terms of social protection, human rights, good governance and environmentally-sustainable development into our view of trade as an instrument for development and of development as a collective human right."
"Unifying all these criteria within a GSP+ category, as well as simplifying the system and making it more generous, as the Commissioner has said, moves in the right direction in terms of the coherence of Community policies affecting developing countries and corrects the fragmentation which has traditionally been dealt with within development policy."
"As spokesperson for the Socialist Group in the Human Rights Sub-Committee, I must congratulate the Commission on this aspect of its proposal, although other points of it can clearly be improved, particularly those which provide for rigid mechanisms for the preferences established for the less developed countries."
"We shall closely follow the reform, its application and its effectiveness in terms of good development and, above all, in terms of human rights."
". Mr President, thank you."
"As you have requested it, I will indeed keep it brief. First of all, I should like to thank the various Members for their observations."
"It was very useful for me as President of the Council to hear your observations and we will certainly take them on board in our further discussions on this topic right up until Christmas."
"Thereafter, we will, of course, be handing the torch to our successors in Luxembourg."
"I have already addressed most of the questions in my first speech and the other questions are directed at the Commission, but I would like to assure you that the Presidency will be making every effort to take the discussion on the resolution as far as it can in the coming months, and in doing so, to involve all parties as effectively as possible, including the European Parliament."
"I would also like to note that the Netherlands can very much identify with some of your questions, particularly those about the rules of origin, about product cover and preferential margins."
"Finally, I should like to warmly thank Commissioner Pascal Lamy for a fruitful cooperation over the past couple of years."
"We have made a lot of progress in the WTO and in the European Union because of your personal commitment, your analytical capabilities and your endurance."
"You have run a marathon in the past years and while doing so you have left some footprints that we will be able to follow in the years to come."
"So, Pascal, thank you, ."
"Mr President, this is not the very last time that I will appear before you because I will have the chance to see you again in plenary in October. Had this actually been the last time, I would have seen – in the combination of circumstances that sees Mr Moscovici in the chair – a sign, the like of which I receive from time to time."
"Unusually for me, I will not be able to respond in detail to each of you individually, because I can only speak for a few minutes."
"I shall restrict myself to addressing the essential aspects, keeping it brief and to the point."
"Mrs Martens asked me if the ‘everything but arms’ scheme is to be changed."
"No, it will not be changed, and there is no graduation in the ‘everything but arms’ scheme."
"She asked, as other speakers did, about the rates of use by the beneficiary countries of the Generalised System of Preferences."
"She is right."
"Let us simply be clear that, among the reasons why certain countries do not, in fact, have access to our market, even though they have the right to such access, are all of those factors that do not fall under the category of tariffs, such as those relating to sanitary and phytosanitary norms and the problems of standards, quality and certification."
"There will always, therefore, be a difference between theoretical and practical access, due to non-tariff-related issues, for which, unfortunately, we are unable to set up a specific scheme for developing countries."
"We are not about to set up a scheme for tolerance of antibiotics in prawns for the whole world, only later to set up a specific scheme that favours prawns from the developing world."
"Unfortunately, we cannot proceed in such a manner."
"Mrs Castex suggests that I involve the social partners in cases where benefit from these preferences is linked to compliance with social clauses."
"We are already doing this, Mrs Castex, and we shall continue to do so. To give you an example, the inquiry that we are currently undertaking into respect for union rights in Belarus, which may lead the EU to remove the benefit of those preferences from that country, was triggered by a complaint from the European Trade Union Confederation."
"This is also, in fact, the basis for my reply to Mr Markov."
"I was asked if the number of beneficiaries would be reviewed."
"The number of beneficiaries will, of course, be reviewed, and this review will be based on one criterion – that of market share."
"I said earlier, and I repeat, that the number of beneficiaries will scarcely be affected by this system."
"Let me state clearly that when we speak of graduation, we do not refer to one country and one product as being graduated, but to a country-product pair – country ‘x’, product ‘y’."
"Mrs Lucas asked me again about the timetable."
"I feel that I have explained our constraints, in particular those arising from the India dispute."
"As regards rules of origin, which she emphasised, as did others, namely Mrs Van Lancker and Mrs Kinnock, let me simply say this: supposing we removed China, a major exporter of clothing and textiles, from the scheme and we authorised Sri Lanka, which exports clothing, to procure its textiles in China; if I have understood correctly, this is what Mrs Lucas would like us to do."
"If this were to happen, we would be handing back to China through the back door, if I may put it that way, the advantage in the clothing and textiles sector that we would be taking away through the front door."
"We must not, therefore, put ourselves into that kind of contradictory situation."
"If, however, Sri Lanka wishes to procure its textiles in the surrounding region, we are probably – I must check with my colleagues – open to this."
"I have almost finished on this point."
"Mr Louis does not like the World Trade Organisation; that is his prerogative."
"What is more worrying is that he considers the EU’s trade policy as characterised by unbridled free trade."
"This is obviously an exaggeration."
"Furthermore, I did not hear that from the mouths of other Members of this House during this debate."
"I should like to pinpoint the one sole point in his speech on which he agrees with the Commission – which is not bad going, incidentally – namely that the GSP must be preserved. I would, in fact, go slightly further and say that it must be improved."
"Mr Sturdy agrees on the link with technical assistance."
"Mrs Kinnock and Mrs Van Lancker want more details on the thresholds and on the lists of the conventions and the sanctions."
"Those details will be available on 20 October, when the Commission will make a decision on my proposal."
"Mrs Kinnock would like me to shed more light on the relationship between the economic partnership agreements and these unilateral schemes."
"They are two distinct systems; the function of the economic partnership agreements is to encourage regional integration within the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, whereas, for the moment, the GSP does not have that objective, other than through the rules of origin."
"I have finished on that point, Mr President."
"I am delighted that, once again, Parliament has had the opportunity to hold a debate on trade policy one week before the Commission itself has debated the issue. This proves that, from the point of view of transparency, we have made some progress."
"Thank you, Mr Lamy."
"At the close of this debate, I have received six draft resolutions.(1)"
"The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the Commission statement on the European Union’s strategy to combat the use of drugs in sport."
"I should like to ask the Commission and the Members of this House to keep strictly to their allotted time, out of courtesy to Mrs Leyla Zana, who will address this House at 11 a.m."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, on the occasion of one of your first plenary sessions, you opted to put the issue of the fight against drug use on the agenda, which clearly reflects the priority that Parliament attaches to combating this scourge that is damaging the image of sport and the health of sportsmen and sportswomen."
"Drug use is not, at the moment, only a matter of fair competition, it is also a problem of public health."
"The Commission shares the determination that you have shown in this field."
"In fact, as you know, I have made strenuous efforts for the past five years to bring drug use onto the Community’s agenda and to take the most effective action possible within our competences."
"On the day that I leave this portfolio, to which I have devoted a great deal of energy, I should like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to present you with a breakdown of the progress that we have made together and to set out some guidelines for the future."
"The breakdown is as follows: I feel that, in five years, we have done as much as we possibly could within the existing legal framework, and bearing in mind the reluctance on the part of several Member States and sections of the sporting world to consider Community level to be an essential level in the fight against drug use."
"As you are aware, sport is not yet a Community competence."
"To put it another way, the Commission could only intervene in strict compliance with its competences, and in this field, the Commission can only intervene, in any event, with the aim of complementing and strengthening action taken by sports organisations and by Member States."
"In recent years, we have been obliged to behave like teachers in explaining what our powers and our limits are in this field."
"Indeed, on the one hand, we have been asked why the Commission did not take more initiatives, and on the other, we have been told that we were launching initiatives to harmonise procedures for checking lists of doping products; in other words that we were appropriating powers that we do not have."
"The reality is that we have done a great deal within our field of competence: information, prevention, training, awareness-raising and supporting projects such as the athlete’s passport, multimedia information tools and scientific studies."
"We have promoted dialogue aimed at cooperation."
"What does that mean in specific terms?"
"The beginning of my tenure coincided with a period in which drug use was making front page news, with the events of the 1998 Tour de France."
"We were able to see that national responses were no longer adequate and that cooperation – even coordination – between Member States was crucial."
"At the end of 1999, I asked the European Group on Ethics, whose President at that time was Mrs Lenoir, to give us its opinion."
"This was the first time that this body had spoken on the subject of drug use, and the opinion that it gave proved extremely useful in the ensuing years and will continue to do so in the future."
"It has been the springboard for everything that we have done."
"In December 1999, a Community support plan to combat drug use was adopted by the Commission."
"This plan was received favourably by Parliament."
"Mrs Zabel was the rapporteur at the time."
"We were calling, in particular, for the concern over drug use to be incorporated into all Community policies."
"Within the framework of that plan and with Parliament’s help, an annual budget of EUR 5 million was earmarked for projects to combat drug use – studies, research, conferences and actions."
"We were thus able to support projects that promoted both information and research in the field."
"I should like to mention, for example, our study on the use of drugs in gyms, together with projects involving young people and a list of the laws and regulations in the Member States."
"Three studies were carried out by external consultants: on the socio-economic factors of drug use, protecting the young and the European communication strategy."
"Let us speak now about WADA, the World Anti-Doping Agency."
"I made a substantial personal investment to ensure that an agency came into being, and I fought particularly hard to advocate principles for the purposes of effective action, so that the new agency corresponded to the wishes of those wanting to see zero tolerance applied to drug use."
"I stressed the need for the agency to be independent and transparent."
"WADA was taking shape along the lines of what we wanted and was set up in 1999."
"Owing to a discrepancy between WADA’s budgetary rules and procedures and Community law, it was not possible to provide Community funding, and I do not see that this can change in the future."
"The draft Constitutional Treaty, which does make reference to sport, will not bring any change in this regard."
"It must be pointed out that WADA is doing an honourable job."
"I would like to see it become an international institution established under public law. This would, to my mind, make it more effective and give it more credibility than the current body, which is governed by private law, a factor that poses problems."
"After all, the fight against drug use is, by definition, an international phenomenon."
"This is the main reason why we arranged the Marrakesh Conference in January 2002, which gave us the opportunity to look into the problem of drug use with our colleagues from the Mediterranean area."
"I should also like to mention the European Year of Education through Sport, during which we set up an information and warning system for our young people; in other words, an entire prevention system."
"Prevention is the key word, because we are not here to be repressive, which is why the Commission must place the emphasis on the aspect of prevention."
"It must address the phenomena that help to create an environment that is conducive to the phenomenon of drug use – the educational background of sports coaches, the role of the medical field and the pressure for success coming from sponsors."
"As you can see, very important work has been done over the past five years. It has been joint work, within the framework of which I have always been able to count on Parliament’s total support."
"In the future, this responsibility will fall to the new Commissioner, Mr Figel, and I know he is aware of the importance of this issue."
"Mr President, I should like to make two points, if I may."
"Firstly, the Constitutional Treaty represents a source of hope in this field because it states that young people’s physical and moral integrity, particularly that of young sportsmen and sportswomen, must be protected."
"We must therefore step up support for the Member States and the federations, which will still be primarily responsible. Additionally, we can support Member States’ activities in prevention, information and awareness-raising."
"I should also like to mention a very important aspect for all future action, namely the ruling handed down by the Court in the Meca-Medina case on 30 September, which had the merit of clarifying the place of the fight against drug use in the Community’s legal environment and which ultimately confirmed the Commission’s position - one such as I have been advocating for five years - and this is to be welcomed."
"The ruling stated that the fight against drug use did not pursue any economic goal."
"In the Court’s view, the International Olympic Committee’s anti-doping regulation does not, therefore, fall within Community competition law. The purpose of this regulation is to preserve the spirit of sport and the health of athletes."
"To put it another way, it is a sports regulation, which leaves the main responsibility for regulating the matter to the sports federations."
"Mr President, I am very pleased with both the conclusion itself and with the way in which the ruling was expressed."
"I have effectively been trying to demonstrate, for five years, that the Commission is not solely interested in sport as an economic phenomenon, but that sport is, above all, a social activity with educational and ethical aspects."
"I also know that my successor will follow this path, because it is important that Parliament support Mr Figel on this matter, as it has always supported me."
"We have a responsibility to our society, and, with sport being such an important element in this society, we thus have a responsibility in the field of sport."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Reding, we have noticed recently that fair play, which is the basic principle of sport and of the Olympic Games, has turned into 'unfair play'."
"Polite rivalry and sporting ideals have now been sullied by athletes' intense efforts to win and distinguish themselves."
"Within the framework of this huge effort and of massive competition, science is contributing by finding new solutions which promise great performances."
"Today, however, I should like to comment on the case of women and young people."
"The use of anabolic agents by female athletes, especially young female athletes, damages their femininity, while abuse harbours serious risks to their health, frequently resulting in their being deprived of motherhood."
"Within a broader framework, therefore, the disastrous consequences of anabolic agents on young people endeavouring to mimic their idols are becoming more acute and society clearly needs our protection."
"We therefore find ourselves up against a new reality, the much-publicised doping."
"These substances are available on the market in abundance in numerous forms, either via the Internet or via the television or by mail order and, even more, in gymnasia and at sports grounds, as reported in the media."
"However, what we are basically ignoring is the fact that doping is a practice not only among top athletes, but also, essentially, among a lot of young people, in that substances such as these have penetrated the young generation, filling aspiring champions with hope."
"I would remind you that the turnover from sales of anabolic agents exceeds EUR two billion a year in Europe and about EUR six billion a year worldwide."
"Even though WADA updates its list of banned anabolic agents almost daily, the social problem is becoming more acute and it is the young people watching their models humiliated who are the victims."
"We therefore need immediate solutions and action at global and, more importantly, at social level in order to identify the problem and promote the necessary legislative arrangements."
"The intervention of the European Union in this huge social problem, which damages both the image of sport and public health, is urgently required."
"Do we need to mourn even more victims before we wake up and accept our responsibilities?"
"Just the other day, one of the best baseball players in the United States died of a heart attack due to excessive use of anabolic agents."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the problem of doping is contrary to the ideals of sport, as you quite rightly said."
"The spread of this problem, not only in professional sport, but also in amateur, individual sport, is such that we need to give this major issue priority attention, so that we can coordinate the Member States in combating it."
"I know that, as recorded in the Commission's 2002 survey, 6% of people who exercise in gymnasia and fitness centres use pharmaceutical substances which enhance their performance."
"In fact, the number is higher and these substances are not approved by pharmaceutical organisations."
"In other words, some 3 700 000 European citizens use these substances."
"Unfortunately, even despite our efforts, they continue to be used."
"This battle needs to be fought on four levels."
"First, by highlighting the use of anabolic agents as a public health problem, as you quite rightly said."
"Secondly, by creating a legal framework – and I am delighted that you corrected the point that WADA should be an organisation under public law – which will allow the European Commission to participate efficiently in its work, in accordance with everything we had the opportunity to discuss together."
"I know that this organisation is indirectly financed to the tune of EUR two million for various initiatives, at a time when the European Commission, as you accepted, does not participate directly in it."
"Thirdly, by taking action so that sport is promoted through education and is not cut off from it."
"Fourthly, by correctly labelling the relevant concoctions which are widely available on the market, so that they clearly state that they are anabolic substances."
"The European Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education, which I have the honour of chairing, decided at my initiative to organise a massive public hearing in November entitled 'Doping – An Obstacle to the Sporting Ideal'."
"This will give us an opportunity to examine matters and perhaps contribute with initiatives which we need to take jointly ..."
"– Mr President, Commissioner Reding, sports organisations do not have sufficient resources to deal with the drugs problem alone, and so there is a need for cooperation with governments as well as the European Union, with the competence it will have when the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe has been ratified."
"The role of governments and the European Union and the action they take will be especially important in allowing the effective prevention of the illegal manufacture, importation, exportation and spread of drug use."
"Legislative cooperation to prevent the spread of drug use and collaboration between the authorities are the means by which the European Union can effectively address the drugs problem in sport and prevent it and any other drug-related abuse at the same time."
"Governments should also adequately ensure through their own legislation that drug dealers face the consequences of their actions to a sufficient degree."
"There should be no genuinely harmonised legislative action to criminalise drug use in sport, nor should any be planned, as this is not something that can really be compared to the issue of narcotics, although the two do share similar features."
"The World Anti-Doping Agency, WADA, coordinates and promotes the fight against drugs worldwide."
"The European Union should, for its part, actively support the work of WADA."
"The International Olympic Movement has been quite actively involved in the administration of WADA, but the role of governments has been less assertive."
"The combined action and energy of the Member States of the European Union would make it possible to balance the involvement of governments in WASA, thus enabling the agency to operate more effectively and efficiently."
"A global government agreement against drug use in sport is being drafted under the auspices of Unesco."
"The European Union should actively monitor the drafting of the agreement and coordinate the views of the Member States."
"With its new competence in the area of sport, the European Union should take an active role in implementing, promoting and supporting the obligations under this forthcoming agreement."
"Matters relating to drug use in sport often make up quite a conspicuous number of sports news stories in the media."
"Nevertheless, we need to keep a sense of proportion."
"As in other areas of society, there are and always will be those in the world of sport who do not obey rules designed to apply to everyone."
"We in the European Union, however, must do all we can to try to promote a clean image of sports and physical exercise."
"Sport is beneficial, and promotes human health and welfare."
"Mr President, it strikes me that we have finally emerged from ignorance, hypocrisy and demonisation in the area of drug use in sport."
"It is perfectly clear, Mrs Reding, that you have done an excellent job of finally establishing a genuine fight against drug use, at European level and at world level."
"The main problem is, indeed, that of our athletes’ health, particularly the health of professional or high-level athletes, and at that level, we would of course need more time to see how, from zero tolerance, we could also achieve a genuine public health policy that enabled our athletes in high-level competition to be up to the level required."
"What needs to be done is, therefore, a matter of medicalisation and of seeing how, with the doctors at our disposal, particularly independent doctors, and with regular independent checks, we can effectively achieve a genuine public health policy."
"– Commissioner, I am sorry, but I think that both the European Parliament and the Commission need to make more of an effort to combat doping."
"Numerous efforts have, of course, been made, but I do not think that they suffice."
"In 1999, the Commission announced that it would promote a proposal for a recommendation to the Council in accordance with Article 152 and, in the first half of 2002, that it would publish a proposal on doping based on Article 152."
"Two and a half years have passed since then and we have seen neither the one proposal nor the other."
"That is a black mark on the European Commission's copybook."
"I am sorry because, on 14 September, in reply to a question in the European Parliament, you told us that there was no legal basis for us to do more."
"Yet, in May 2000, you said that there was a legal basis and it was public health."
"The Commission should therefore draft a directive on the basis of public health and the European Parliament should give it its urgent attention."
"Mr President, the fact that the recent Olympic Games in Athens saw two gold medals taken away on the grounds of drug use as well as the disqualification of several athletes demonstrates the persistence of an abuse that involves amateur athletes and great professionals alike."
"This ever-increasing phenomenon is in fact not being fought with the severity it deserves and this is also probably why more and more athletes start using drugs, in some cases in the foolish belief that they are practically harmless or at least not very dangerous."
"Drug use is also assuming really worrying dimensions as an economic phenomenon: it is in fact behind an enormous volume of business which evidently benefits large criminal organisations among others."
"Our question to the Commission is whether Community support measures in the battle against drug use in sport, which financed 32 pilot projects from 2000 to 2002, can truly show a positive result in terms of effective action, or whether instead the entire Community programme should be entirely rethought. Let us bear in mind first that it is actually today that the tenth conference of Sports Ministers is meeting within the ambit of the Council of Europe, with the aim of encouraging honesty and transparency in sport, and second the great educational values associated with the development of sporting activities, as evidenced in this very year of 2004, which has been the Year of Education Through Sport."
"We therefore ask the Commission whether it should not actually commit itself more thoroughly to the battle against drug use and whether, after having financed research projects on the phenomenon, it should not now go on to finance information and persuasion campaigns, prevention campaigns in brief, which would be truly more incisive."
"Mr President, as we are condemning the use of stimulants in sport, I would agree with all of the previous speakers that it is a question involving amateur sportsmen and women as well as professionals."
"We are talking about the use of substances that are very often not just drugs but are also medicines that are used to treat a variety of conditions."
"On the other hand, what kind of Community have we got when there is toleration and even encouragement of a whole host of measures enabling the sale of soft drugs in a number of states?"
"To whom, then, are we allowing the use of drugs and from whom are we forbidding them?"
"Should we allow people other than sportsmen to use them?"
"Should teachers or doctors use drugs or substances that act as stimulants?"
"Should children use them?"
"The sitting is suspended for the formal sitting."
"(1)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, today is a special day for our Parliament."
"We are all delighted that we can finally hear the voice of Leyla Zana."
"President Klaus Hänsch, in his speech to this House when you were awarded the Sakharov Prize, was waiting impatiently for the day when you could speak to us in person."
"On that day, your husband, Mehdi Zana, received the prize on your behalf and today I would like to welcome him as well, a free man, after years in jail – and we are talking about no less than 16 years in jail – and years of suffering over recent decades."
"Mrs Leyla Zana, before you take the floor, I would like to remind the House why this Parliament awarded you the Sakharov Prize, the freedom of conscience prize, and I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome Mrs Roth and Mrs Lalumière, who are with us today and who, as leaders of their respective groups, were amongst those who proposed that you receive this prize, almost ten years ago."
"Four years earlier, during the worst period of conflict in the South East of Turkey, you were the first Kurdish woman to be elected to the Turkish Grand National Assembly."
"When you took your seat in Parliament you promised – in Kurdish – to fight to ensure that Kurds and Turks could live together within a democratic framework."
"And it was because of that and your subsequent speeches and writings that you were sentenced to 15 years in prison by the National Security Court in Ankara together with your three colleagues, Turkish Members of Parliament Dicle, Sadak and Dogan."
"You were fully aware of the impact of your words on the occasion of your oath-taking and of the language you spoke them in. You have paid dearly for them, in terms of years and of health."
"But despite that, you remained firm in your democratic fight for the rights of your people, rejecting the offer of a pardon you were made for health reasons."
"You refused to remain silent, even when that meant prolonging your sentence."
"And you had to carry this burden alone."
"But many people in the international community supported you."
"This Parliament – the European Parliament – condemned the accusations against you and your conviction, as a violation of democratic principles."
"This Parliament called for your release in many resolutions."
"You can take great satisfaction, however, from the fact that your suffering has not been in vain and that your personal fight has made a significant contribution to the changes that have taken place in Turkey since you were elected as a Member of Parliament."
"For example, it is no longer illegal to speak Kurdish, radio broadcasts and education in Kurdish are beginning to be allowed, there is no longer martial law and a state of emergency in the South East, following the unilateral truce by the PKK, and the long armed conflict which has lasted 15 years has practically come to an end."
"There is undoubtedly a long way to go – and you have explained this to us over recent days – and many improvements still to be made in the practical situation in terms of respect for the freedoms and rights of the Turkish people."
"But, when the Turkish Court of Appeal finally decided to release you on 9 June of this year – we are not talking, ladies and gentlemen, about events that happened a long time ago, but on 9 June of this year Mrs Leyla Zana was still in prison – you justified our faith in you by calling on your compatriots to fight for peace and recognition in the South East and demanding that the Kongra-Gel, the successor to the PKK, maintain the ceasefire."
"Mrs Zana, over and over again you have demonstrated the truth of what you said when you were tried again: ‘I am first and foremost a woman, then a mother, and finally a politician."
"In my capacity as a woman, a mother and a politician, I swear that I will fight for brotherhood between the Turkish and Kurdish people’"
"Please allow me, Mrs Zana, to use your own words and welcome you in your own language, in Kurdish:"
"Mrs Zana, it is a great honour to have you in our Parliament."
". Mr President, by speaking in Turkish and Kurdish, you have made a highly significant gesture and, before starting my speech, I would like to thank you in Catalan."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, I spoke in Kurdish for the first time in 1991 from the parliamentary chamber during my oath-taking ceremony in the Turkish National Assembly."
"When I spoke the words, ‘I take this oath for the brotherhood of the Kurdish and Turkish people’, I wanted to draw attention to the fact that peoples, languages and cultures can co-exist in a brotherly fashion."
"The years I spent behind cold bars, surrounded by deaf and mute walls, will remain in our consciousness as suffering that went unacknowledged at the time."
"In any event, the fight for freedom, justice and equality could not have been fought without suffering."
"Those years I spent in prison have not left me with a broken heart, nor wanting to blame anybody, nor feeling anger."
"I had to live through those years for my love of democracy, and I did."
"I have begun my speech today in our brother language, Turkish, and I would like to end in my mother tongue, Kurdish."
"My aim is once again to emphasise the brotherhood between peoples, languages and cultures."
"I greet you all in this spirit and in friendship."
"I would like to express my gratitude and my warmest wishes to Parliament for having considered me worthy of the Sakharov Prize."
"I would also like to thank you for the unfailing solidarity you have shown me and my friends throughout my years in prison."
"In fact, you are not awarding this prize just to me, but to the Kurdish people, to the Turkish people, who are our brothers; you have in fact awarded it to Turkey and to the defenders of peace, equality, freedom and fraternity."
"You have awarded it to the children who have lost their parents in the wars, to the women who have lost their children, to people who are oppressed, whatever their colour, language, religion or race."
"In short, you have awarded this prize to a bright future and to hope."
"You have given democratic public opinion a voice and have encouraged it to speak."
"The fact that the values represented by Sakharov are sacred and inviolable values has increased my moral and humanitarian responsibilities, and I am speaking to you now fully aware of this fact."
"It breaks my heart to see that our children are being lost, in whatever part of the world it may be happening, but first and foremost in my own country of course."
"It is a pain that sears through me."
"I beg you to hear my voice and to regard it as the voice of the mothers whose hearts are full of pain, as the voice of the children, of the young people, of the women, of the thousands, of the tens of thousands and millions of people, of human beings."
"Wars have caused great suffering, they have inflicted deep wounds; there has been much suffering, nature has suffered, the flowers, the birds and the butterflies have wept."
"The wars in Iraq, in Palestine, in Halabja, in the Balkans, in Beirut, in Chechnya, in Ireland, in Spain and all kinds of other wars that do not come to mind at the moment, have taught us many things and continue to do so."
"Bitter experience has taught us that violence leads to more violence, without providing a solution."
"We have also seen how policies based upon repression, denial, extermination and deceit, have led to more injustice, poverty and suffering."
"We must, therefore, reject violence and war, whatever the cause of it or the justification for it may be."
"We should be in a position to reject it."
"Violence must be consigned to the past."
"The language and method for resolving conflict today is dialogue, compromise and peace."
"It is not ‘Kill and be killed’, but ‘Live and let live’."
"As Members of the European Parliament, you are sitting here together today in peace despite divisions and wars that have lasted for centuries and generations."
"Is the unity you have created while preserving your national characteristics not one of the most striking symbols of peaceful coexistence?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a person seeking justice, the first appeal I would like to make here today is addressed to myself: I give you my word that I will meet the expectations of my country and of democratic public opinion, even if it costs me my life."
"I make this commitment without expecting anything in return."
"I address my second appeal to my country, Turkey."
"The Turkish Government must include the democratic resolution of the Kurdish problem on its agenda by giving it an appropriate name."
"All living beings on earth have a name: flowers, trees, birds."
"They all have their names."
"Only the Kurds have no name."
"There is no reason not to define this problem and not to give it an appropriate name."
"There is no reason to fear dialogue and peace."
"The Kurds want a peaceful solution within Turkish sovereign territory."
"These are the building blocks and raw materials of the Republic of Turkey."
"They respect all the values symbolising the Republic of Turkey, but the government appears to be inflexible, and unwilling to appreciate the sincere initiative of the Kurds, which is based on openness to dialogue."
"If a peaceful solution is not on the agenda, whatever political party may be in power, that dialogue is doomed to disappear."
"Significant steps have certainly been taken towards democracy, but the implementation of these steps appears to have been purely cosmetic. The Copenhagen criteria must be implemented in practice, and not just in words."
"The most urgent need is to remove the basis for armed conflict and violence."
"A legal system that would bring about disarmament will be an important initial step towards peace."
"Yet there is another urgent need, which is that political prisoners, the intelligentsia, writers and politicians must be included in democratic life."
"We would also like to see democratic areas opened up with no barriers to freedom of thought or association."
"Social and economic measures aimed at eradicating differences between regions are of vital importance."
"Obstacles to the use of our mother tongue in the media must be eliminated and it should be possible to learn this language in primary schools."
"A new democratic constitution that is in line with universal law must be drawn up and, within that constitution, as the Turkish President, Mr Sezer, has said, the Kurds must be recognised as majority elements and they must be protected."
"Nobody should be in any doubt that the Kurds will support any measures taken for the sake of democratisation."
"My third appeal is addressed to the world, and first and foremost to Europe."
"Peace in Turkey will mean peace in the Middle East, peace in Europe and peace in the world."
"Today, peace is in your hands, in our hands."
"We will achieve it by extending our hands to each other and in order to do so we must begin by knowing what is right."
"If you know what is right, you also know what is wrong, but if you do not know what is wrong, you will never achieve what is right."
"The right thing to do is to begin by giving the problem a name, and then to acknowledge it and define it."
"An entity that does not have a name and has not been defined has no identity, and as such that entity is considered non-existent."
"It is time for the world to recognise the political, social and cultural rights of the Kurds, who make up a population of more than 40 million human beings."
"The Kurds have openly expressed their will to achieve their full recognition and integrate themselves into today’s world."
"What we expect from the world is that our will should be respected and that this should not to be used as a negotiating tool, or as a bargaining chip in international relations."
"If this problem is not dealt with from the point of view of conscience and humanitarian spirit, regional and world peace will continue to face a potential threat."
"Nations have been left alone because they have built walls rather than bridges."
"Europe has experienced that suffering over the years and humanity has demolished those walls, one after the other."
"Europe and the world should be able to demolish the invisible walls that have been built between them and the Kurds, and furthermore act as a bridge in order to find a solution to this problem."
"We must bear in mind that a Turkey that is a Member of the European Union, which has resolved the Kurdish problem, will allow western civilisation to meet the great cultural wealth of Mesopotamia."
"Not until that happens will western civilisation become a contemporary democratic civilisation."
"My fourth appeal is addressed to democratic public opinion and advocates of peace."
"It is not enough to be an advocate of peace and to be peaceful oneself that alone will not bring peace."
"Unless men wage war against war itself, there will be no way to put an end to wars."
"Wherever there are wars, therefore, we must be warriors for peace and we must organise ourselves."
"I address my final appeal to the Kurds, to those who have fought for democracy in all the geographical regions they live in; they must first of all live in peace amongst each other."
"They must promote democracy, authorise freedoms and demonstrate cohesion."
"There will be no solidarity without mutual respect for values, no cohesion without solidarity, no strength without cohesion and no peace without strength."
"They must be aware that any attempt to fashion their own variety of Kurd amongst the Kurds will lead to a ‘feast of wolves’."
"The only way to prevent that is through internal unity and cohesion, peace amongst ourselves, and our own solidarity and our own policies."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, why can the Turks, the Kurds, the Germans, the French, the Laz, the Circassians, the Spanish, the Georgians, the Assyrians, the Americans, the Czechs, the Arabs, the Yazidi, the Bretons, the Catalans, the Persians, the Chechens, the Aborigines, the American Indians, the Alawites, the Africans, the Palestinians, the Jews, the Catholics, the Protestants, the Muslims, the Christians, the whites, the blacks and all the peoples of the world not live together in peace and harmony?"
"We all gaze at the same stars and we are all fellow travellers on the same planet and live under the same sky."
"As Victor Hugo said, because ‘peace is the happiness that absorbs everything’, we must forget everything relating to war, pain, revenge and hate."
"We must absorb all of it. Otherwise, we will not be able to travel together and be happy."
"I dedicate this speech to brotherhood and happiness amongst the Turkish and Kurdish people."
"My best wishes to all of you in love and friendship."
"Mrs Leyla Zana, in your speech you talked of Turkey as your country and called for recognition of the identity of the Kurdish people within Turkish sovereign territory."
"So, Mrs Zana, just as earlier I welcomed you in your language, Kurdish, please allow me now to also thank you in your other language, Turkish:"
"Which means, ‘thank you very much for your speech’."
"Mrs Zana has spoken to us, and spoken very well, about identity, about the process of overcoming antagonistic differences, the antagonistic identities which have been mutually destroying each other throughout history."
"This is a good example of creating a common identity, which is more complex than our own individual native identities, since it encompasses a richer reality."
"Leyla Zana offers an example of precisely this search for a multiple identity which is compatible with everybody’s own individual identity."
"So once again Mrs Zana, ’."
"We will now continue with the debate on doping in sport."
"We still have a number of speakers on the list to get through before we can proceed to the vote, so I would ask for self-discipline."
"Mr President, this should prove a popular moment in this House and I am grateful for the massive turnout for the continuation of the debate on drugs in sport."
"From the health promotion point of view, we want to see the encouragement of sporting activity and sporting excellence."
"We also want to see prevention of the use of drugs that damage health."
"Sporting excellence can only flourish in an environment of fitness, skill, training and fair competition."
"It must be based on the natural abilities of the individual athlete or team, and never on performance enhanced by pharmaceutical or technical aids."
"That is cheating and must be rooted out through a policy of accurate and random testing."
"Such tests must distinguish between genuine medication and performance-enhancing drugs."
"In fact it is worse than cheating, because it puts the health of the athletes at risk."
"What athlete would knowingly cause damage to his heart or liver, his kidneys or reproductive organs?"
"Who would willingly stunt his growth or make himself prone to violent or aggressive behaviour?"
"Who would put at risk his memory or his mind?"
"All these things can result from taking oral or injected steroids, without mentioning the risks entailed by sharing needles."
"Too many athletes and coaches either do not understand this or knowingly take the risk."
"These drugs distort and damage sport, the health of individual competitors and the example set to young people, who look up to sporting heroes as role models."
"That is why we must educate and prevent, why we must test and deter and why we must do both these things together."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, doping in sport has become a worrying phenomenon, which the European Union is obliged to confront because, as the Commission has said, national responses are not sufficient."
"It is important that we combat these practices, since they violate sporting ethics by preventing fair competition between athletes in all sports and in all countries."
"The practice of doping undoubtedly gives society a negative image of the values which should govern sport."
"As a member of Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education, I see sport as an instrument for educating people and I sincerely believe in the values that should be communicated through sport."
"European children and young people must return to the idea that sport is a healthy, character-building and sociable activity, in which the important thing is to participate."
"It is clear that doping in amateur sport is a reflection of something very different, which has nothing to do with education or sociability."
"I would, therefore, call on the Commission to intensify its research into doping substances, detection methods and the impact of using doping substances on health, with a view to reducing cases of doping and protecting our sportspeople from the danger it poses to their moral and physical well-being."
"Mr President, doping is the cancer of modern sports."
"It invades, spreads and destroys the healthy spirit of competition and fair play amongst our athletes."
"Despite the brave efforts made by the World Anti-Doping Agency, its incidence appears to be growing faster and faster, especially amongst professional sportsmen."
"As the number and sensitivity of drug-screening tests increases, athletes discover new, undetectable drugs or combinations of drugs, or other ways of avoiding being caught."
"Faced with this malignant state of affairs we must seek to discover the root cause of the problem."
"We do not have to look very far or think very hard to find it."
"It is the same root cause that so often turns individuals into criminals."
"The same one that often leads people to kill each other and, sometimes, even causes whole nations to fight one another."
"It is called money."
"As sport becomes more and more competitive, there are ever more material gains to be made by winning."
"Competition is often not about winning an event or a game, but about winning the sometimes unbelievably lucrative contracts that come with that. The crucial question is whether we can convince our athletes to dissociate sport from money."
"In my view the answer is unfortunately ‘no’, because athletes are only human and greed seems to be an inherent human weakness."
"In conclusion, I disagree with the Commissioner that this is a public health problem."
"In my view it is mainly a socio-economic problem."
"Sadly, I consider that the only way to keep drugs away from sportsmen is to decommercialise sport."
"While the chance of that remains remote, the prospect of truly drug-free sport remains bleak."
"– Mr President, the real reason behind the huge problem of doping is the commercialisation of sport, the admission that there can be professional athletes and that there is therefore such a thing as professional sport."
"Within the capitalist method of production, professional sport is a special case, because it accepts athletes at such young ages that they are prohibited from participating in the rest of production, educationally at least."
"Thus, children become objects of dual exploitation."
"When a sports team is a business and its objective is therefore to increase its profits, victory at any cost, in other words, maximising its profits becomes for the young athlete what the market is demanding."
"Victory is so instrumental to commercial success that any means are admissible."
"The mere existence of professional sport poisons and undermines every moral aspect of amateur sport."
"Doping appears in sports and it also appears where there is a huge temptation for other young people."
"Sport is a public social commodity and it does not fit in with the profit rationale."
"Every form of professional sport needs to be abolished, the umbilical cord between sport and business and sponsors needs to be cut, mass amateur sport needs to be consolidated ..."
"– In view of the fact that the European Union Constitution mentions sports, I believe that, as far as we can, we must take responsibility for sport."
"European citizens enjoy the sport’s positive effects on education, health and social cohesion."
"Unfortunately there are also worrying signs in sport against which we must take a strong stance."
"These are rudeness, acts of vandalism by spectators and – yes – the use of drugs."
"Drug use kills off clean sport and honest competition and the use of banned substances largely endangers the health of the competitors."
"If the sporting world tolerates the use of drugs it will ultimately lose the public’s trust and will destroy the confidence placed in clean sport."
"Unfortunately, I was able to experience this myself with my own country during the Athens Games."
"Today the fight against drug use requires international collaboration."
"A successful action must be harmonised on three fronts: education, prevention as well as monitoring the sanctions."
"I think that the European Union – if indeed it wants to help this fight – can do its utmost on the first two fronts, that is, it must assume a role in education, information and could also facilitate the monitoring which is a costly operation; a modern lab costs nowadays more than US Dollars 1 million."
"Within the European Union only a total of 12 countries could afford this."
"There is an anti-doping charter, we do not have to invent the concept of doping nor details of the banned substances and methods, we cannot do very much here."
"I suggest we examine the possibilities of initiating a successful international effort in – and I repeat – above all else, material and technical support for education and monitoring."
"– Mr President, the Commission replied to Mr Staes' written question last January, relating to the taking of measures against doping, that it had no plans to harmonise this particular sector of sport."
"Doping, however, has become a scourge the world over."
"Anyone watching the Olympic Games in Athens understood that in the best possible way."
"Major records and distinctions are no longer the objective of the athletes alone, but also of a global industry which has grown up around sport."
"The financial interests of the huge multinationals, the companies which sponsor professional sport, are only served when the performance of the athletes is outstanding."
"As a result, a social model is developing, whereby doping is also spreading to amateur athletes, especially young athletes."
"It is unacceptable for gymnasia, for example, to supply doping substances which are directly harmful to health."
"That is why we maintain that efforts must continue to wipe out the organisations which supply banned substances to athletes, so that we too do not end up like the USA, where laboratories are 'set up' to produce false champions."
"This, ladies and gentlemen, is the direction in which we need to move."
"Mr President, on 29 November the Committee on Culture and Education will hold a hearing of experts on this matter, after which Parliament will want to bring forward specific proposals."
"I would like to mention a number of complex areas."
"One is the development of illicit drugs, which are becoming increasingly difficult to detect."
"Another is that the increasing professionalism of sport and the huge financial rewards on offer mean that the temptation to enhance performance through illicit drugs has increased."
"Lastly, even when sportsmen are found to have cheated, the real winners are denied recognition for their victory because of delays attributable to the testing system."
"I have two questions: should random testing not be considerably increased in order to increase the certainty of detection and, similarly, what technical improvements are required to remove all doubt?"
"It is often claimed that when sportsmen have failed tests it has been due to their taking legal medication."
"Once we have specific answers to these questions, we will come back with proposals."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the topic that the Commission has again raised is an extremely important one, something that has been stressed several times over."
"One point that I believe has to be given closer attention is that of the labelling of the drugs content of medicines, or of those medicines included in the list of doping substances."
"This would certainly meet halfway the athletes, their trainers and their representatives and be helpful to them in their activities, quite simply because there would be more transparency about the issue."
"Such an initiative would cost practically nothing, whilst also being a significant help."
"Apart from that, I share the view of many Members that controls must simply be tightened up and made more universal, thereby enabling misuse to be better identified."
"Mr President, as someone who has had plenty of experience of amateur and professional sport and who has participated in several world championships and Olympic Games, I understand clearly the danger of illegal drugs in sport."
"Besides being an athlete myself, I have children who have reached or are approaching the level of elite athletes."
"I have never used performance-enhancing drugs and I do not want my children to become the victims of cheats."
"People who use illegal drugs in sport are nothing but cheats."
"They are destroying the true meaning of athletic competition and do nothing but set a bad example, in particular to our young people."
"Science has shown illegal drugs to damage the physical and mental capacity of human beings."
"We know illegal drugs kill, yet the temptation is always there and it is growing."
"The reason is the unprecedented boom in the popularity of sport over the last few decades and, obviously, the rich rewards that accompany it. Sport is an excellent tool for shaping the character of young people and is very good for our general health."
"It is in everyone’s interest to maintain the positive influence of sport."
"I call on Parliament, the Commission and the European Union institutions to work with national and international sports federations, national governments, the IOC and professional associations to combat the dangers of illegal drugs."
"Together we can keep the cheats out and keep sport clean."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I entirely agree with Parliament."
"The only way to combat doping is through zero tolerance."
"In order to save sport, to save sportspeople, to save the values of our European society, we must join forces."
"Combating doping, Mr President, is a question of will, a will which is enshrined in action agreed between the Member States, Sport Federations and the European Union."
"Together, with Parliament, we have already come a long way in terms of effectiveness and I believe that the Athens games were a fine example of this, since, during those games, more cases of doping were detected than during all the previous games put together."
"This is a sign that testing is starting to work."
"It is only the beginning, however, and we must continue this action while we await more powers and more possibilities as a result of the new treaty."
"We have a duty to protect our young people, to protect professional and amateur sportspeople and to protect public health, and in this regard, I would like to emphasise that all the honourable Members who have talked about laboratories, labelling, testing and prevention are absolutely right."
"Now, Mr President, my successor, Mr Figel, will await this initiative from Parliament, this hearing, which will be welcome because, after all, we have a joint responsibility towards sport, towards our citizens, our values, and only by working together can we put that responsibility into practice."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed(1)."
"Mr President, I wish to raise a point of order in accordance with Rule 166 of the Rules of Procedure, with regard to Rule 24(3), which regulates the competences of the Conference of Presidents."
"Yesterday, a Minister from the Italian Government offended this House by saying that it was dominated by gays."
"I am from a country that is currently considering legislation to put an end to discrimination against homosexuals – as in Belgium and the Netherlands."
"This issue is currently subject to subsidiarity, but I would like the Conference of Presidents and the President to ask the Italian Government to apologise, because what is at stake here, ladies and gentlemen, is first and foremost whether the person heading the Commission is Mr Barroso or Mr Berlusconi."
"Secondly, I would like to say to our Italian colleagues that we are prepared to accept an Italian Commissioner with the personal and intellectual rigour of Leonardo da Vinci or Michelangelo."
"Mr President, I should like to speak on an issue that is no less important, and that affects millions of computer owners throughout the European Union, as well as hundreds of thousands of European small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"The issue is that of patents on computer software."
"Thirteen months ago, the European Parliament stood up for European citizens and European companies when it refused to pass legislation that was a copy of the American legislation."
"The Council and the Commission, however, sided with the large companies, and not with the citizens of European countries."
"This issue will soon appear on the agenda for a sitting of Parliament."
"What joint action do we intend to take, Mr President, in order to prove that this House will not be held hostage to the large computer companies, but will act as the voice of a Europe of small- and medium sized enterprises and of a Europe of citizens? This issue may well be no less important for our voters than the major political debates."
"The credibility of the European Parliament’s authority is also at stake here."
"We will now proceed to the vote.(1)"
". If I have understood you correctly, Mr President, I believe that your reading does not entirely correspond to the true division of the text, but perhaps that is a communication problem."
"The first part reads like this: ‘pointing out that experience of refugee camps cannot be envisaged outside the European Union without a clear risk of violating fundamental rights’."
"That is the text of Amendment No 1."
"Then, with regard to the second part, inserted in the text is the fact that experience of refugee camps in the Union’s own territory has already demonstrated serious deficiencies."
"By proposing a separate vote, my idea is to have a single message, which is to focus on concerns about camps located outside the Union’s territory."
"For this reason, I would advocate a yes to the first part and a no to the second."
"(2)"
"My oral amendment to paragraph 1a is as follows: ‘Requests the Georgian Government to define its commitment, which appears to be a precondition for achieving a peaceful solution of conflicts and national unification based on consent, towards the autonomy of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.’"
"(3)"
"We have voted against this report."
"We believe that the common agricultural policy (CAP) must be abolished."
"Enlargement of the EU shows that it is quite unfair to continue to operate the CAP in the same way as it has so far been operated."
"It is, then, unfair to guide new Member States into a doomed system and get them used to the system’s rules and subsidies."
"We are in favour, however, of financial support for the EU’s future Member States, but this must be channelled to neglected regions and directed at education, infrastructure and legal institutions."
".– The aim of the proposed amendment to Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999 is to approve the pre-accession measures for agriculture and rural development in the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe which did not join in May 2004, Romania and Bulgaria."
"The objective of these measures is to bring the rural economies of the applicant countries into line with the CAP, so that they can integrate in the immediate future."
"The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece disagree with the enlargement of the ΕU because it will be a burden on the people in these countries, just as it is a burden and has repercussions on the standard of living and the rights of the Greek people."
"However, they also disagree with the CAP, because its basic objective is to shrink the rural economies of the applicant countries by imposing low quotas and by wiping out small and medium-sized farm holdings, in order to concentrate the land in a few mega-farms."
"That is why we also disagree with pre-accession programmes designed to bring the rural economy of the applicant countries into line with the CAP."
". I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999 on Community support for pre-accession measures for agriculture and rural development in the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe in the pre-accession period."
"The proposed amendments are intended to harmonise certain provisions applicable in new Member States to include a new eligible measure enabling the rural communities of Bulgaria and Romania to prepare and implement local rural development strategies, to bring aid rates into line with those granted to countries acceding to the Union in 2004 and, lastly, to clarify the ceilings on aid rates."
"The proposals for change before us, which are based on extensive experience, fulfil, in my opinion, the objective of greater efficiency in monitoring Community support, which is of major importance within the framework of preparations for the accession of future Member States."
". Experience of successive rounds of enlargement of the European Communities has shown that rural communities are particularly vulnerable to change and integration in the most dynamic and competitive economic areas."
"We must therefore prepare and implement rural development strategies to address this particular phenomenon."
"Consequently – and this phenomenon can still be seen in my own country to this day – I voted in favour of the proposal for a Council regulation on Community support for pre-accession measures for agriculture and rural development in the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"Against this backdrop, and in view of Bulgaria and Romania’s future accession, I feel that the Union has done the right thing by harmonising the measures to be put in place in these countries with those of the countries acceding to the Union on 1 May of this year."
"We Moderates think it is wrong to use public funds to subsidise advertisements for agricultural products, both within the EU and in the rest of the world."
"Via the Commission, the EU now advertises agricultural products such as tulip bulbs and olive oil at a cost of between EUR 60 and 70 million per year."
"Products that are competitive manage perfectly well without these public funds, while products for which there is no demand should not be propped up in this way, using taxpayers’ money."
"We are abstaining in today’s vote, since the choice is between two alternatives that both involve continued subsidy for advertising agricultural products."
". With this proposal before us, the Commission’s aim is to please Parliament and the Council, which had been demanding an evaluation report on the implementation of Regulations (EC) Nos 2702/1999 and 2826/2000 on measures to provide information on, and to promote, agricultural products in third countries and in the internal market."
"The Commission has proposed a series of amendments to the regulations, however, and this raises some concerns for us."
"These information and promotion measures, which will complement national and private actions, are of the utmost importance, not least for countries such as Portugal, which makes high-quality agricultural products such as cheeses, spirits, fruits and olives."
"These measures are all the more necessary at a time when the agricultural sector is being subjected to increasing liberalisation around the world, whilst the Community budget in the sector has been reduced in the last two years from EUR 72 million to EUR 60 million."
"Added to this is the low implementation rate, which in 2003 was less than 44%."
"The causes are simple: low Community cofinancing (no more than 50%), the complex nature and administrative costs of managing these programmes and the shorter list of products covered."
"Factors such as these particularly affect countries such as Portugal."
"Whilst the proposed amendments offer a degree of flexibility, they do not provide an effective response to the problems of implementation, nor do they consolidate the existing appropriations."
"We have voted against this report in the vote."
"We believe that the common agricultural policy (CAP) should be abolished and that agricultural products should be sold on the free market without the EU investing financial resources in communication campaigns and sales promotion measures for these products."
"It is particularly serious that the EU is to fund sales promotion measures in third countries. This constitutes disloyal competition in respect of non-EU countries’ agricultural producers."
". I voted in favour of Report A6-0008/2004 because I feel that the EU’s actions should be aimed at promoting European products ever more effectively, whilst respecting their diversity as regards production conditions and methods of processing, conserving and use."
"The European Union has been carrying out and cofinancing activities to promote agricultural products by means of a coherent policy that is divided into two regulations: one relating to promotion in third countries and the other to promotion in the internal market."
"Community policy must represent added value in relation to national and private initiatives, and must consolidate or strengthen the activities of Member States and private companies aimed at promoting exports."
"The need for an active policy to promote exports is acknowledged by our main trading partners, which have adopted effective policies to this end, with adequate financial support, so as to be in a position to maintain or increase their share of the world market."
"It is essential that the EU play a visible and effective role in promoting exports."
". The unanimous vote in the Committee on Agriculture demonstrates the consensus in this House as regards the issue of providing information on and promoting agricultural products in third countries and in the internal market."
"In light of the tendency towards trade globalisation, the unlawful appropriation of designations of origin belonging to high-quality European products and the unfair competition due to cheap labour, this internal and external commitment to promoting agricultural products is particularly pertinent."
"I feel that this situation of unusual competitiveness clearly justifies maintaining Community intervention, within a framework of promoting the ‘visibility of the intrinsic characteristics and the common qualities of European products, whilst respecting their diversity as regards production conditions and methods of processing, conserving and use’."
"I therefore voted in favour."
"Mr President, I abstained from the vote, as I believe that the process of ratifying the Constitutional Treaty, which I sincerely hope will succeed, is clearly a sovereign event in the Member States."
"It is, indeed, the most sovereign event for the Member States, given that on occasions such as these, decisions are taken that affect their own sovereignty."
"Parliament must therefore resist the temptation to show any intention to interfere in the way the Member States – given that they are, and must be, democracies – implement this process."
"Accordingly, I do not believe that we should suggest that the Council set out coordinated approaches for scheduling national ratification processes or that it encourage Parliament to take control and to mount campaigns on the referendums that are to take place."
"It should certainly not sound warnings of any kind, as suggested in one of the proposed amendments."
"As regards the issue of the communication strategy, I feel that the Constitution should be presented to EU citizens in the clearest and most easily comprehensible way possible, as mentioned in Recital C of the adopted resolution."
"The EU will therefore fund initiatives that genuinely provide objective, factual, fair and independent information."
"The people, the national parliaments and the people’s representatives in those parliaments will then decide via the ballot box."
"Thank you very much, Mr President, for the attention of the Members of this House."
"Mr President, the fact that a number of Member States will be organising a referendum about the European Constitution can only be applauded."
"As is always the case with referendums, it is important that the electorate be informed in a correct and balanced manner."
"In this resolution, the Commission and Council are asked to ‘draft an adapted campaign and communications strategy’, but without applying any conditions as to balance."
"Referendums in the past, though, often illustrated that this is problematic."
"Public opinion often only gets to see one side of the coin."
"The information deficit is not conducive to the referendum being well and properly run."
"What is lacking in this resolution, then, is a recommendation that the media in general and the public broadcasting corporations in particular should, in a balanced manner, let the no-camp, as well as the yes-camp, have a say."
"I thank you."
"Mr President, I speak on behalf of the European Parliamentary Labour Party, which shares many of the aspirations contained in this resolution."
"However, responsibility for ratification of the Treaty lies with the Member States, in accordance with national law."
"We do not feel we should be attempting to second-guess the national ratification procedures, and more specifically the date for the referendums, and therefore chose to abstain."
"The undersigned voted in favour in the final vote on this resolution."
"We did this in spite of the fact that we lost parts of the vote concerning paragraphs we should have liked to have deleted from the resolution."
"One of these was paragraph 3, indicating the period in which referendums might take place."
"We do not believe that the European Parliament should produce proposals on this issue."
"Another is paragraph 6, in which the Council and the Commission are called upon to draw up an appropriate campaign and communication strategy."
"We believe that a communication strategy is required, but do not believe that the Council and the Commission should go in for conducting campaigns."
"The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted against Mr Leinen’s motion for a resolution (B6-0067/2004)."
"We think it should be up to the Member States themselves to set the dates for holding national referendums."
"Over and above this, we do not think it is the Council’s task to develop best practice in terms of parliamentary scrutiny and referendum campaigning. Instead, this is a national concern."
". When questions of such importance to the future of the people and of the Member States are being debated, it is wrong to attempt to impose coordination of the ratification processes with a common schedule and strategy and, worse still, to establish guidelines for disseminating the content with the aim of influencing public opinion in favour of adopting the draft Constitutional Treaty, which most of us wish to see."
"What we ought to do, in fact, is respect both the national processes for ratifying the draft Treaty establishing a European Constitution and the right of the various political forces to analyse the far-reaching and serious political and constitutional consequences for the Member States and their citizens."
"It is up to the citizens of the Member States or their representatives in the national parliaments to accept or reject this draft Treaty."
"It is therefore unacceptable to increase funding for a publicity campaign aimed at adopting the so-called European Constitution."
"What is required is pluralistic debate in which the political forces can take part on a level playing field."
".I vote against a European Parliament resolution on the procedures of ratification of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe and a communication strategy for the said Treaty No B6-0067_BAR_2004."
"Ratification process is the excusive responsibility of Member States."
"European Union institutions by interfering in this process severely violate the subsidiary principle."
"We voted against the Leinen report, because we reject the draft EU Constitution."
"A constitution would lead to increased EU centralisation and help transform the EU into a form of state with global ambitions."
"The EU Constitution is of crucial significance for Europe’s future and for the European peoples’ self-determination."
"It should therefore be decided on in referendums in each EU country, with the ‘yes’ and ‘no’ sides being given equal resources and the opportunity to take part in the debate on equal conditions."
".– The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will vote against the resolution on the ratification procedures of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe and the communication strategy because its basic aim is to mislead the people of the Member States and to pervert the history of Europe."
"We disagree with the proposed Constitution or any Constitution of big business and war, in that its aim is the power of the European monopolies, to the detriment of the social and political rights of the working and grass-roots classes."
"Furthermore, the effort to wipe the anti-Fascist victory from people's memories and to abolish its anniversary on 9 May is revelatory."
"Let the people forget struggles, let the barbarity and brutality of fascism be played down by wasting the peoples' money at a time when wages, pensions and unemployment benefits are being reduced, social spending is being cut back and the right to permanent, stable employment is becoming a thing of the past."
"We cannot fail to observe that the resolution makes no mention whatsoever of the need for objective information or even the facility for choice on the part of the people; on the contrary, it emphasises support for the historic importance of the agreement."
"We shall call on the people to say a resounding no to the European Constitution of the militarisation and repression of Europe, of the dictatorship of big business."
"We consider it a positive sign that more and more countries are setting up committees to overturn it."
". The draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe should be made known not only to legal experts, but also to all European citizens, regardless of their position on the matter."
"It is clear that the best way to involve the general public in the process will be to hold referendums that will foster campaigns explaining the issues in a fair and balanced way."
"I should like to point out, however, that there will be no European dimension to this process if we choose to disregard the peculiar national characteristics of each Member State."
"I also strongly believe that we must all show confidence in democracy and in the sovereign will of the people, and must dispel any damaging atmosphere of alarmism and bullying; the absurd propaganda of a ‘’ in the event of any setback distorts the debate, brings us into conflict on the crucial issue and does grave damage to any serious discussion on European integration."
"Given the very low turnout in the European elections, the only real tragedy would be if the general public were once again alienated or if the campaigns run by the European institutions were to spread and exacerbate the democratic deficit in Europe, which we all condemn, rather than alleviate it."
"The rejection of Amendments Nos 3 and 13, which were only calling for freedom and equality in the debate, lead one to fear the worst."
"I therefore voted against the resolution."
"Mr President, we are profoundly concerned at the excessive haste with which hundreds of people from outside the Community have in recent days been deported from Italy to Libya, in particular at the lack of transparency in the procedures used."
"We fear that the conduct of the Italian Government could gravely compromise the fundamental right to seek asylum and the principle of non-, which prohibits the forced return of persons to a territory in which there is a risk that they will suffer grave violations of their civil rights."
"Italy has the option of seeking assistance from Europe and the international community and, even more so, it has the duty to admit refugees seeking asylum within its territory without any form of discrimination."
"Amnesty International has also sought more information on the current procedures and on their compliance with national and international laws."
"According to these laws, an asylum seeker has the right to legal assistance, to an interpreter and to make contact with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and non-governmental organisations, all of which the Italian Government has in fact prevented, in violation of the principles and values of the European Community."
"The funerals are taking place in Dronero, in Piedmont, of Jessica and Sabrina Rinaldo, who died in Egypt at the hands of terrorists: two fresh-faced young women, two veritable angels, two daisies torn from the green pastures of our Piedmont, from the hearts of their parents, honest working people like themselves, mown down by the barbarity of an Islamic terrorism that has respect for no one, least of all for two innocent, defenceless young women."
"I humbly request that the President of the European Parliament arrange for a message of solidarity to be sent to the relatives of these young victims."
"The Italian delegation of the Union for a Europe of the Nations Group has voted against Amendment No 4 on voting rights for immigrants to the Bourlanges report on the future of the area of freedom, security and justice because, while it is possible to consider the idea of granting immigrants the right to vote in local elections, the times are not yet ripe for contemplating the right to vote in European elections."
"We must point out, moreover, that recognition of the right to vote in local elections must provide for a detailed regulatory framework through an appropriate proposal that would clearly specify the procedures, times and the specific legal context."
"The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of the Bourlanges report (A6-0010/2004) on the future of the area of freedom, security and justice."
"We are nonetheless aware that the proposal concerns an area covered by Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community and does not therefore apply to Denmark, cf. the protocol on Denmark's position."
". Just days from the European Council of 5 November, an important struggle has taken place in Parliament in defence of freedom, justice and human rights, particularly those of immigrants."
"Our group has sought to improve the Bourlanges report, both by re-establishing a balance between security requirements and the need to respect and promote human rights, and by refusing to resort to ‘European charters’ and to mass expulsions of immigrants."
"Whilst it is true that some of our suggestions were adopted in the vote, most were rejected."
"The report therefore continues to fall short of what is required and takes positions in important areas with which we do not agree."
"I should therefore like to stress the importance of adopting the following amendments:"
"- acknowledges that immigrants must not be considered a temporary workforce, but are in fact essential to our society’s future;"
"- underlines the importance of the decisions and the framework decision on protecting the rights of migrant workers and their family members adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 18 December 1990;"
"- acknowledges the bad experience of refugee camps even within the territory of Member States of the European Union."
"Regrettably, many others were not adopted."
"I was therefore unable to vote in favour of the report."
"We have voted against this report since the subsidiarity that should characterise the construction of the European Union is not part of the thinking behind it."
"For example, it proposes a European aid office for the victims of terrorism (paragraph 1b-5)."
"A nucleus of operational provisions with regard to judicial and police cooperation is to be created at European level (paragraph 1c-2)."
"A joint data protection authority is to be set up at European level (paragraph 1c-8)."
"Eurojust is to be strengthened with a view to creating a European Public Prosecutor’s Office (paragraph 2e-2). A uniform immigration and asylum policy is also to be created within the EU in a number of areas."
"We should like to see increased cooperation between the Member States on these issues with a view to developing a humane asylum policy, in accordance with the Geneva Convention, for the whole of Europe."
"We nonetheless reject the development of a federal judicial system with ever growing institutions, at which the above proposals are clearly aimed."
".– During the five years in which the area of freedom, security and justice (AFSJ) adopted in the Tampere plan of action has been in operation, reactionary laws have been promoted and military and police mechanisms, uncontrolled information services, personal files and prosecutions have increased."
"The European anti-terrorism law, the European arrest warrant, the Schengen agreement, anti-refugee directives and so on are all the result of the 'area' which the Commission communication not only rewards but it also welcomes the fact that many of these have been incorporated into the draft Constitution."
"The future directions defined by the Commission for Tampere ΙΙ speed up the general attack on the personal and political rights and freedoms of the people. They reinforce the opaque, centralising services and the security and information systems of the EU."
"They turn justice into a mechanism for legalising repression. They create an EU-controlled fortress to keep out immigrants."
"The report and recommendation by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs accepts the Commission guidelines and contributes to the democratic legalisation of the harsh new antidemocratic charge of Tampere ΙΙ."
"It further calls for the complete abolition of the principle of unanimity, thereby strengthening the opaque mechanisms of the Euro-unifying beyond any national control."
"The working class and the people of Europe must obstruct and step up their fight against the so-called AFSJ, because it opposes their rights and serves the 'justice' of big business and the multinationals."
"That is why we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report."
"."
"I abstained from voting on this report because I feel that, whilst its main focus is on problems that are of the utmost importance to the future of the European Union and of all of the Member States, I have serious reservations about some of its points."
"At a time when Europe – and each of its 25 Member States – is just as likely as any other part of the world to be a victim of terrorism, it is important that in placing emphasis on the area of freedom, security and justice we do not separate the requirement to treat immigrants humanely from the overriding need to ensure that the Union’s borders are secure."
"The more secure Europe is, the more humane it will be, although one must not confuse security, which is a good thing, with securitarianism, which is a bad thing."
"Lastly, I understand that this report acknowledges the work done by Mr Vitorino, who has made an excellent contribution to the concept of a free and secure Europe."
". This report follows up the resolution in the last annual debate on the area of freedom, security and justice (AFSJ), for which I was rapporteur."
"I shall begin by welcoming the fact that, following my suggestion adopted at the time, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has begun to implement a process of dialogue and cooperation with the national parliaments."
"I should also like to point out that the adoption of the previous resolution coincided with the appalling terrorist attacks in Madrid, which reminds us that terrorism is the greatest current threat to fundamental rights, a fact that must neither be forgotten nor downplayed, and the fight against terrorism must be at the very forefront of political decision-makers’ concerns."
"I should also like to reiterate the need for a ‘Tampere II’; a fresh meeting of the European Council dedicated to building the AFSJ needs to be held, in order to set a new timetable in this area and to draw up a realistic programme for this five-year cycle, which will be the result of reflection, political sincerity and strategic wisdom."
"It is far more important that we see a well-balanced and consistently reprogrammed AFSJ than any excessively proactive attitudes, which end up creating unnecessary tension, fomenting unrealistic expectations and distracting us from our central aims."
"Given certain reservations I have as regards the proposed text, I was toying between voting in favour and abstaining, but the fact that the second part of Section 1(b), citation 8 and Amendments Nos 1 to 16 were adopted led me to vote against."
"Our position is that the European Union should not conduct foreign policy."
"Discussions concerning, for example, a peaceful solution in Georgia must take place within the framework of the Member States’ work within the United Nations."
". I voted in favour of this joint motion for a resolution, because it is clear that, in view of the European neighbourhood policy, we must pay close attention to what is happening in the regions close to the European Union’s current borders, not to mention the human rights, democracy and territorial integrity issues at stake."
"This must not, however, deflect us from once again advocating the doctrine that under no circumstances must we cross the line separating legitimate – often necessary – international political pressure from undesirable meddling in the internal affairs of other countries."
"In this case, the resolution before us neither exceeds Parliament’s competences nor runs counter to that doctrine, but instead shows justifiable concern for the rights of the civilian population and outlines the steps that must be taken to defend a democratic and free regime."
". Georgia has made progress towards establishing and protecting democratic institutions and the primacy of the rule of law."
"The Georgian authorities have expressed a wish to follow the European model and hope, one day, to accede to the European Union."
"These efforts have, however, suffered worrying setbacks in the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, due to the restrictions to individual suffrage and massive population expulsions carried out by the authorities in the area, which have led to an upsurge in violence that I have no choice but to condemn."
"I feel that, in view of its geographical and strategic importance, the Russian Federation has particular responsibilities in the region."
"Its political support and the presence of its military units stationed in areas of conflict and the surrounding areas are crucial to stability; and it is equally important that genuine respect be shown for the territorial integrity of the bordering countries."
"Given the tense situation in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, I welcome the proposal to convene an international conference on the conflict and to set up a peace-keeping force that will genuinely help Georgian society to recover its stability."
"I voted in favour."
"Mr President, I welcome both the Commission's intention to reform the generalised system of preferences and the resolution that we have just adopted."
"It is very important that the system be simplified and made more accessible for developing countries, particularly the least developed countries."
"In addition, it is very important that we maintain within the system the special incentive arrangements for the protection of labour rights – which are hardly used at the moment – and the special rights for the environment – which are also under–used."
"Any reform must encourage the further and greater use of those rights."
"There is also a special arrangement under the current GSP called 'GSP–plus'."
"This is for countries tackling drug abuse and drug trafficking."
"Again, it is important that this be protected in any reform of the GSP."
"To conclude, if these areas are safeguarded, it is encouraging that the Commission has decided to modernise the GSP."
". As stated in the resolution tabled by our group, it is alarming that the new eligibility system recommended by the Commission for the generalised system of preferences (GSP) is based exclusively on market share criteria, and disregards development and poverty indicators."
"A system of continuous evaluation must be developed that involves consultation with the interested parties, including the trade unions, so that it is possible to react quickly when development objectives are being undermined, to combat poverty and, most importantly, to combat the pillaging of the least-developed countries by various multinationals."
"Accordingly, we welcome the criticisms directed at the Commission, in terms not only of the substance but also of the way in which the new system was drawn up, and we stress the need to support and work with the least-developed countries."
". Although I voted in favour, I consider that the new GSP should contain:"
"• ."
"In particular it is important to link the reference to the fight against drugs with the new GSP+ regime."
"There would indeed be a risk that the current beneficiaries of the ‘drugs regime’ would see the efforts made in the fight to establish alternative crops frustrated in the event that they could no longer enjoy the benefits of the GSP."
"• On the basis of this reference it will then be possible to seek differentiated treatment for textiles within the context of discussions on the new regulations."
"• as the basic criterion for applying graduation."
"The sections are in fact referred to only by way of example in the current wording."
"• ."
"Transparent and effective rules of origin are important in order to prevent fraudulent exploitation of the system especially through triangular trading operations."
"Not least, moreover, we should like the incoming Commission finally to examine the application of special clauses for workers and to commit itself to eliminating the scourge of child labour, even by resorting to economic sanctions."
". I voted in favour of the Joint Motion for a Resolution on the Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee, ‘Developing countries, international trade and sustainable development: the function of the Community’s generalised system of preferences (GSP) for the ten-year period from 2006 to 2015’, because I feel that all necessary efforts to simplify and improve Community actions in developing countries must be properly supported and funded by Parliament."
"I feel it is crucial that we meet the global objective of simplifying the graduation mechanism, yet I am concerned that the Commission’s proposal disregards certain development and poverty indicators, which may lead to discrimination against big yet poor exporters."
"I regret that the Commission did not follow up Parliament’s recommendation that the current functioning and impact of the current GSP should be subject to a thorough assessment."
"I should like to conclude by saying that further clarification is required as regards the consequences of changes to the GSP, so that Parliament is in a position to carry out a better-informed and more definitive assessment."
". The European Union’s support for development and external aid must, quite apart from direct aid within the framework of development policies, entail adopting a more mature strategy, in line with the framework of globalisation."
"I quote the Doha Declaration: ‘International trade can’ – and, I would add, must – ‘play a major role in the promotion of economic development and the alleviation of poverty’."
"The Community’s trade policy must therefore be consistent with the aims of its policy on developing countries, of which the overriding aim must be to eradicate poverty and to promote sustainable development."
"Emphasis should also be placed on areas such as respecting the environment, improving social conditions, fighting corruption and promoting good governance."
"I believe that the proposed new system will be more transparent and objective, something that we must constantly monitor and assess."
"I voted in favour for all of these reasons and in light of all of my previous speeches that have highlighted the aspect of Europe’s solidarity with developing countries, and its historical ties and responsibilities in this field."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(1)"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 14 October 2004."
"Before moving on to our agenda, I would like to make a few comments in relation to the fact that yesterday was United Nations Day, and the last winner of the Sakharov Prize – Kofi Annan – made a speech in which he stressed that we can and must do more to achieve the objectives of peace, human rights and development which were the basis for the creation of the United Nations 59 years ago."
"Since yesterday was the day on which we celebrated the birth of that institution, I believe it would be appropriate for Parliament, on coming together once again, to highlight the need for a United Nations that works and which leads the world in the direction it deserves."
"I would like to communicate this message to our institution because we all share the responsibility for promoting the multilateralism created at the end of the Second World War."
"As the European Parliament pointed out last January, the European Union and its Member States provide more than half of the contributions to the United Nations system and to peace-keeping missions."
"Our participation in terms of development aid exceeds 60%."
"We are, therefore, entitled to a significant role in the future of the United Nations, and in its work and its objectives."
"I would, therefore, like to take this opportunity today to call on the Member States to avoid public quarrels."
"The future of the Security Council is an extremely important issue in terms of us all coming together to improve the work of the United Nations."
"I therefore believe it appropriate, as I have said, to emphasise the significance of the date."
"The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, in accordance with Article 122 of the old Rules of Procedure, and Article 145 of the new Rules of Procedure, I have the honour of making a personal statement."
"I was immensely surprised to learn, Mr President, that, firstly, you did me a great disservice during the press conference attended by Mrs Leyla Zana; secondly, you wrote a that attacked me personally on 14 October, and thirdly, you referred to a condemnation on the part of the Bureau on 13 October, which in fact appears in point 15 of the Bureau’s summary of decisions and which calls on you to condemn my allegedly, I quote, ‘revisionist statements’."
"As it happens, Mr President, I did not make any such revisionist statement in the way in which I believe you understand that term."
", which was on strike on the day of my conference but was represented there by a journalist, completely rectified the impression given by a truncated, distorted and vindictive report."
"The Lyons weekly , whose editor, Mr Florent Dessus, a distinguished Lyons journalist, former chairman of the , a constant political opponent and once again my rival in the last elections, but who was, himself, in attendance at the conference, redressed the injustice in the following terms: ‘all of these reactions, all of this furore would have been perfectly understandable if Mr Gollnisch had actually denied the existence of the gas chambers, which was not the case."
"If he had actually said the words that are being ascribed to him, we would have been the first to condemn them, but it so happens that we cannot make him say the opposite of what he said’, and he published my press conference in full."
"I can understand, Mr President, that certain individuals have reproduced, magnified or distorted a false, truncated and vindictive report."
"I admit, however – with respect to you as a person and in your role – that I cannot understand how you, as President of this House – an informed politician and guardian of the freedom of debates and of the rights of the Members of this House – and the Bureau of this House, which never stops offering advice to the entire world on human rights, were able to condemn me without hearing, or even seeking to hear, me, and without even notifying me of your condemnation, and this following a hasty denunciation by two or three of my political opponents."
"In so doing, Mr President, I feel that you have breached the adversarial principle, the declaration of human rights and the general principles of European law."
"May I remind you, in this regard, that, even in Stalinist trails, they at least made the pretence of having the accused appear in person."
"Consequently, Mr President, I should like to ask you, if I may, for an interview during this part-session, so that we can work out together, if you are willing to do so, how I am to receive the moral redress that I am looking for and to which I am entitled."
"Thank you very much, Mr Gollnisch. You will be aware that we are about to approve the Minutes of the sitting."
"The Minutes say what they say and what they say reflects what has been said."
"The Presidency – and the whole of Parliament, I am sure – will be very pleased to learn that you really did not say what you are accused of saying."
"We will all be delighted if you really did not say – and better still, that as well as not saying, you did not think either – the things that caused Parliament’s Bureau to react and in relation to which I acted as spokesman."
"The Minutes approved reflect what the President has said. Today’s Minutes will record what you have said, Mr Gollnisch, and the fact that you have told Parliament that you did not say the things you are accused of will be recorded in the Minutes."
"It that is the case, believe me, nobody will be more delighted than me – and I am sure that the whole Parliament will be delighted that no Member of this Parliament has said the things it is claimed you have said."
"The Minutes of the previous sitting are approved."
"The next item is speeches on matters of political importance."
". ) Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the discrimination to which the employees of the new Member States working in the European Union institutions are subjected."
"The employees of the new Member States are discriminated against in many areas."
"The first area is the amendment of the Staff Regulation, the legislation on public servants."
"The second includes the fact that new categories have been created, and the lower categories are applied to the delegates of the new Member States."
"The third area of discrimination is that all the secretarial staff from the new Member States have been employed in the lowest category."
"The fourth area of discrimination is that the employees of the old Member States were suddenly elevated to a higher category before May 2004."
"There is discrimination also in the area of benefits as well as in the area of examinations in people’s mother tongue."
"Mr President, please look into the issue of discrimination because those concerned want to turn to the European Court of Justice."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, in the last Parliament MEPs voted overwhelmingly in support of the EU appointing an Aids ambassador/envoy."
"The EU continues to do much to combat the rise of Aids and to provide information on preventive health programmes and support for access to anti-viral treatment for all."
"However, EU programmes need tighter coordination to ensure that EU Aids initiatives are producing optimal results."
"I believe the appointment of an EU Aids ambassador would enhance the international effort to combat the spread of this tragic disease."
"The total number of Aids sufferers worldwide has now reached 40 million and continues to rise."
"It makes sense to have a coordinated EU policy on combating Aids, under the responsibility of a single Aids ambassador/envoy, and I urge Parliament and the Commission to move forward with this proposal and add impetus to the effort to put Aids on the top of the EU development agenda."
"Mr President, I should like to call upon the European Commission to act on an issue which has given rise to concern among the citizens of Poland and of the other new EU Member States for the past few months, namely the suspension of food exports to Russia."
"Poland and the nine other new Member States were informed of the change in the rules on exports to Russia at the end of April of this year. Russia’s decision was therefore directly linked to our accession to the European Union."
"There is no rhyme or reason to the checks carried out by Russian inspectors."
"Producers from the old Member States are aware of this."
"The European Commission must open negotiations with Moscow on this issue, and every effort should be made jointly to specify the criteria for checks so that they become easier to understand."
"If the European Commission fails to provide assistance or adopts a neutral position on this issue, it will amount to discrimination against the new Member States in the EU’s internal relations."
"I would therefore like to call upon the European Commission to maintain solidarity within the EU in internal relations, and to provide assistance to the new Member States on this issue."
"Mr President, in a year and a half’s time, on 18 July 2006, it will be seventy years since the fascist led by General Franco, which was the prelude to the Second World War and the beginning of a savage civil war and almost four decades of dictatorship."
"Millions of Spaniards directly or indirectly suffered from its tragic effects."
"Hundreds of thousands were murdered, imprisoned or interned in more than two hundred concentration camps throughout Spain, the last of which did not close until 1962."
"Mass terror, generalised hunger and systematic torture formed the triangle which Paul Preston calls the Spanish genocide."
"The bodies of the disappeared are still being unearthed to this day, and the body of one of them, the poet Federico García Lorca, is still being sought."
"This Parliament has quite rightly spoken out against the horrors of extremism and Nazism."
"On that date, the European Union, which was born of peace, democracy and opposition to dictatorship, will have the opportunity to speak out against that beginning of one of Europe’s tragedies, with a great slogan, ‘Never again!"
"Never again!’."
"Mr President, I should like to receive a response on the conflict between the state-owned enterprise Polska Żegluga Morska (Polish Steamship Company) and the Polish Treasury Minister taken in the context of the rules in force throughout the European Union."
"The Ministry of the Treasury has attempted to dismiss the director of the state-owned enterprise Polska Żegluga Morska, contrary to the independent decisions of the enterprise’s self-governing bodies, and has also announced that all state-owned enterprises in Poland are to be transformed into State Treasury companies."
"In addition, the state-owned enterprise’s director and self-governing bodies were refused the right to appeal to an independent court to have the Ministry’s decisions verified."
"Do the Ministry’s actions not constitute a violation of the principle of non-discrimination against forms of economic activity, in this case discrimination against state-owned enterprises in relation to other possible forms of economic activity?"
"Furthermore, was the Ministry’s refusal to acknowledge the right of the director and the state-owned enterprise’s self-governing bodies to appeal to a court not a violation of Article 6(2) of the Treaty on European Union and of the 1950 European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms?"
"I thank you."
"Mr President, a heated dispute recently broke out between the European Commission and the German Government over the ‘golden share’, or the opportunity for the state to retain control over strategically important companies."
"The Polish Government supported the German Government in this matter, which is an important one, if only because a number of other Member States, such as France, have abandoned none of their influence on national and international economies."
"On the one hand, it is entirely possible to understand the logic of those who strongly advocate a free market, viewing such advocacy as an attempt to implement the Lisbon strategy and an opportunity to close the gap with America in time."
"Yet on the other hand, it is obvious that a number of governments and nations wish to protect national economic interests, even though they support European integration."
"Mr President, I propose that a debate should be held in Parliament on this matter."
"This crucial issue must cease to serve merely as the ball in a game of ping-pong between the Commission and individual countries."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, France is a beautiful country and Strasbourg is a wonderful city, with splendid people, interesting architecture and fine monuments."
"We are all delighted to have the opportunity to spend four days here each month."
"I believe, however, that our personal feelings should take second place to the interests of the citizens of Europe, who elected us to this House."
"None of the obstacles mentioned can justify Parliament’s seat remaining in Strasbourg when all of its business is conducted in Brussels."
"In fact, there are no substantial or rational reasons to do so."
"Plenary sittings in Strasbourg are simply an extravagance, a luxury that costs millions of euro a year to organise."
"There can be no doubt that this money could be put to a more sensible use, for example by providing more funding to the European Union’s poorest regions."
"It is time to put an end to this nonsense. Parliament’s seat in Strasbourg must be done away with."
"– Mr President, a meeting of the PPE-DE Group in the Committee of the Regions was held in Athens on 15 October at the initiative of the Mayor of Athens, Mrs Bakogiannis, on the subject of 'Cities' Safety and Security Policies'."
"The Greek Prime Minister, Mr Karamanlis, referred in his welcoming speech, among other things, to the need to further promote the civil protection of the European Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is the primary responsibility of us, the members of the European Parliament, the institution with democratic credentials , to impart material content to the Community action plan which expires in December 2004, because the institutional to date is insignificant."
"My call to the honourable Members of this House is that we invigorate, that we promote the civil protection within the European Union."
"Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Mr Buttiglione, who has recently become the target of a chauvinistic attack by the Left of this House and by all Left-wing extremists."
"Mr Buttiglione, there are still people who share your sensible views."
"I would ask you not to lose faith and to be truthful, as the truth cannot be suppressed, particularly in the European Parliament, which by all accounts wishes to be the leading institution in the building of a structure of truth, honesty, reliability and human rights."
"I would therefore ask whether condemning someone for honestly and publicly expressing beliefs that do not harm anyone does not constitute a violation of human rights."
"Mr Buttiglione, a great many, and indeed I am sure the majority, of the Members of this House stand shoulder to shoulder with you."
"Our hearts and souls tell us you will be an outstanding Commissioner."
"Mr President, during Commission Question Time at the last part-session 34 questions were tabled by MEPs but only eight received answers, which is a new record."
"This is because the Commissioners took on average nearly ten minutes for each answer."
"Would you please ask the incoming Commission – assuming that there is one – to voluntarily submit to the sensible rules of this House, whereby speaking time is measured and limited?"
"This may permit Members to ask more questions and, I hope, receive more answers."
"I shall do so."
"Rest assured that there will be a new Commission."
"Sooner or later there will be a new Commission and your concern will be duly passed on."
"– In 1957 Albert Camus wrote that the downtrodden and shackled Hungary has done more for freedom and justice in the past twenty years than any other nation in the world."
"I would like to draw the President’s and my colleagues’ attention to the fact that, nowadays, all of Hungary remembers the October Revolution of 1956 when a tiny nation battled against the oppression of the mighty Soviet Union."
"It was with their blood that the unknown but, since then, recognised heroes painted the two words, ‘freedom’ and ‘justice’ onto the skies of Europe."
"There were heroes and there were traitors."
"During the Communist dictatorship and under state socialism, the nation paid a heavy price for this desire for freedom."
"Several thousand Hungarians were executed or sentenced to death, several hundred thousand disappeared in the Soviet Union and some tens of thousands were banished to labour camps and jails."
"Some further tens of thousands were resettled outside the borders of Hungary, and several millions were deprived of their wealth."
"Even with the hindsight of 48 years, we are proud of the fact that we, Hungarians, were the first to defy the Soviet dictatorship and protest against the Communist tyranny and occupation."
"The fact that we can be here with you as a free and independent member of the European Union family is largely due to the self-sacrifice of many thousands of heroes of the Hungarian Revolution who gave their lives for freedom."
"Mr President, I wanted to protest at discrimination against Catholics."
"Pursuant to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the exercise of the rights and freedoms set out in this Convention should be guaranteed without discrimination of any kind."
"It is for this reason that I should like to protest strongly both at Mr Barroso’s attitude towards Catholics and at the European Commission’s funding of the exhibition held in a tent on the Place Schuman in Brussels."
"Taken in conjunction, these are a clear manifestation of discrimination against Catholics, being not only an attack on their feelings, but above all a corrupting influence on young people in their promotion of human beings without values desiring nothing but provocation and financial success."
"Is the juxtaposition of images of the Pope deep in prayer with those of copulating men supposed to be a symbol of Europe’s diversity?"
"Is it not rather a sign of dehumanisation and degradation, and a threat to civilisation?"
"Do the European Commission and those aspiring to the highest posts within this institution wish to build a better future on the ruins of all that is sacred, thus depriving Europeans of goodness and beauty?"
"Should sexual contacts not be ..."
"Mr President, it was two years ago that, on the night of 26 and 27 October, the ferry sank off the coast of Senegal."
"Officially, this tragedy claimed the lives of 1863 people, the most of whose bodies, to this day, lie unidentified at the bottom of the sea."
"Surviving relatives, including the relatives of the Dutch victims Roel and Lisette Arendshorst, have made repeated appeals to both the Senegalese President Wade and European politicians to take action in order to recover the victims of ."
"In principle, President Wade responded favourably to this here in this House a year ago."
"On various occasions in this House, we have also asked the Commission to take action."
"I would therefore make a fresh appeal to the Commission, the Council and President Wade of Senegal."
"The relatives of the victims are entitled to take leave of their loved ones in a dignified manner."
"They are asking for a final resting place where they can grieve, and alongside this, they are also enquiring about the possibility of identifying the victims."
"Mr President, I am directly appealing to your respect for the values mentioned in the European Constitution."
"Respect for human dignity requires support from the European Union ..."
"The Romani population is the largest minority in the EU."
"The Roma face serious human rights discrimination: segregation in schools and in the labour market."
"Sadly, in some parts of the European Union very serious human rights abuses against the Roma have been reported in recent years."
"The Roma have increasingly come to be a focus of attention of European policy- and law-makers following reports of social exclusion and serious human rights abuses throughout Europe."
"It is time to continue in the steps of the few who already recognise, here in the European Parliament, the crisis of the Romani population."
"Today, we need to combat discrimination by reaching cross-party agreements for the sake of a better Europe."
"Therefore, I am extremely determined to stand up for Roma rights issues and to address social inclusion and human rights to ensure the fundamental rights and freedom of our people."
"Mr President, there is an issue I should like to bring to the attention of the House."
"Nearly six months have passed since the enlargement of the European Union to include ten new Member States."
"Since then, the new Member States and the old Member States are supposed to constitute a single common structure."
"Integration is supposed to be apparent in many key areas, yet we are experiencing marked delays in the full integration of the new Member States."
"This is why I believe that serious thought should be given to revising transitional periods, so that obstacles are not placed in the way of the development of the new Member States, and so that their full integration with the other Member States can be accelerated."
"This applies primarily to transitional periods relating to the free movement of persons and the free movement of services."
"These two areas are crucial for genuine European integration and for developing the entrepreneurship necessary for the development of national economies."
"We must not stand idly by as service providers from the new Member States are faced with worse conditions and greater difficulties on the European market than those from the old Member States."
"With regard to the free movement of persons, it is also apparent that the countries that opened their labour markets after 1 May, such as Great Britain and Sweden, are not experiencing ..."
"The problem of asylum seekers and illegal immigration in Europe is urgent, serious and worrying."
"Few countries can tackle the great and complex difficulties of this critical situation on their own, especially a small country like Malta that is carrying a burden that is not proportionate to its size and population."
"Therefore I believe that one of the solutions is that the burden should be shared."
"This is a matter that transcends frontiers and therefore it should have an international solution, possibly through a common effort by the United Nations and the European Union."
"We cannot remain idle and postpone this issue."
"Do you not think, Mr. President, that the time has come for this Parliament to discuss and debate this tragic reality in a holistic, effective and just manner for the benefit of both the asylum seekers and the countries involved?"
"Mr President, it was just announced that tomorrow we will vote urgently on financial aid for Serbia and Montenegro."
"However, a week ago there was an extraordinary book launch in Belgrade."
"It was by Radovan Karadzic, formerly President of the Bosnian Serbs."
"Mr Karadzic is wanted on two counts of genocide at the UN War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague and, together with Ratko Mladic, he is held responsible for the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, where 7 000 Muslim men and boys were systematically murdered, and the siege of Sarajevo, which caused 12 000 deaths and terrible suffering."
"Mr Karadzic's book is called ."
"Mr Karadzic was not present at the launch."
"However, the fact that he has been able to publish a book and escape the Nato and Bosnian Serb police, who are supposed to be looking for him, is itself a miraculous chronicle of the night."
"It does not inspire confidence that these forces are doing enough to harass him and his network of loyal supporters so that he can be brought to justice."
"I hope Parliament can send a message that Nato and the Bosnian Serb police need to try a little harder."
"Mr President, very recently, two MEPs from the Netherlands, my own country, were refused entry to Cuba."
"They were deported from that country when they were travelling to talk to human rights activists, so-called dissidents."
"This is characteristic of what is happening in Cuba, because it fits in with a systematic pattern."
"Dissidents, including trade union leaders who, a few years ago, were able to talk to us, are now often sentenced to long prison sentences."
"Things are going from bad to worse, and contact with politicians such as ourselves is also affected."
"I can tell you from my own experience that, before this happened, the door to the embassy simply remained closed on more than one occasion and we did not even manage to get a meeting."
"I am saying this because some people here are urging in favour of a with Fidel Castro."
"My response to that would be that it is serious incidents of this kind that should lead us to persist in the common policy as it stands at present."
"I have received 22 requests."
"We are clearly not going to be able to satisfy all of them, otherwise we would far exceed the half an hour set aside for these purposes."
"I am going to allow two more people to speak in the order in which we have received the requests visually and I would apologise to the other 20 honourable Members."
"Mr President, I should like to remind you that, this weekend, presidential and legislative elections took place in Tunisia."
"When election results go as expected, they do not make big news."
"Nevertheless, like other Members of this House, I believe I have some information of a constitutional nature. We remember the constitutional coup that enabled President Ben Ali to stand for a fourth time, yet we also know that the Constitution contains a number of severe constraints that prevent and restrain his capacity to stand."
"We also have consistent information on the conditions under which these elections were held, not least from the point of view of media access, which was characterised by a total absence of pluralism."
"One candidate, the only one in the presidential elections to have enjoyed a modicum of independence – a great deal of independence if one compares him with Mr Ben Ali – was not allowed to publish and distribute his official election manifesto."
"We also know that the Tunisian Human Rights League, a body that Parliament trusts and is happy to deal with, was prevented from properly monitoring these elections."
"Mr President, I have great respect for Spain, which is one of my favourite places in Europe."
"However, I am concerned to learn from the Health Protection Agency that out of 6000 salmonella cases in the United Kingdom, the majority can be traced back to eggs from Spain."
"I am not sure whether experience in the egg industry features on your lengthy CV, but I wonder whether I could urge, through you, that cooperation take place between the Spanish authorities and the Commission to try and resolve the situation, so as to avoid people calling for a ban on the import of Spanish eggs."
"I would also like to ask you, President, when the practice for this period of one–minute statements changed from a 'catch–the–eye' system to one where Members have to put down their names in advance."
"In the past, the President could use his or her discretion: for example, you, Mr President, could have chosen to limit the number of right-wing Catholics that you wished to allow to speak, thus giving a better balance."
"When did the system change from catch–the–eye to putting down names?"
"Mr President, thank you. I have a personal question for you."
"On Saturday, 16 October, I sent you an urgent message in connection with the arrest of Leyla Zana’s husband when they returned home from the celebration during the plenary meeting in Brussels."
"I asked you to contact the Turkish authorities immediately to inquire about this arrest, which I, along with many other Members of this House, saw as an outright provocation, it being clear to everyone that this arrest is linked to Leyla Zana’s appearance in the European Parliament."
"So far, I have not received a response to this."
"You will be aware that, last Friday, legal proceedings were commenced against Leyla Zana, this being the third time she has faced them."
"I would therefore ask the European Parliament, as in the past, to pay the necessary attention to this and if possible, to send a delegation to monitor proceedings, because in my view, this is very important in the context of the continuing discussion about accession negotiations with Turkey."
"Mr President, I should like to express my concern about the defence of EU working languages."
"I understand that the Dutch Presidency has just tabled a proposal at the Conference of Community and European Affairs Committees (COSAC) aimed at restricting the number of working languages at COSAC meetings to just six."
"I am aware that in this House, too, there have been times when, for reasons of cost-cutting, some Members have had difficulty in using their languages as working languages."
"In the proposal tabled by the Dutch Presidency, only six working languages are safeguarded – those of the six biggest countries."
"Of course, Portuguese is the language of a country that is not one of the biggest and is therefore in jeopardy."
"The question before us, Mr President, ..."
"Mr President, in 1993, the European Parliament adopted a resolution commemorating the victims of National Socialism."
"Last year, ten years after that event, an exhibition was also mounted on the subject in this House."
"The German public, too, are outraged by the remarks attributed to Mr Gollnisch; perhaps we should call upon him and the not to claim that he did not say these things, but rather to make a statement in which he would clearly dissociate himself from historical nihilism, making explicit his condemnation of fascism, his acceptance that the Holocaust happened, and that the historical research available on the subject is factual."
"I do believe that opposition to fascism, to anti-Semitism and to racism has always been one of this House’s values, and one that we should continue to uphold in the future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, 25 October, is the day we in the Basque Country are celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Guernica Statute."
"Twenty-five years ago today we Basques went to the ballot box in that Spanish Autonomous Community in order to endorse and approve this Statute by a majority as a legal and political framework stemming from the Spanish Constitution, and it has given us Basques the greatest degree of self-government there has ever been in that region."
"I can assure you that the Guernica Statute is the best framework for creating trust, well-being, development and freedom in the Basque Country."
"And, unlike those people who want to jeopardise these 25 years of democratic success, we believe that the Statute must be the basis for continuing to create democratic co-existence for the next generation of Basques."
"It is, therefore, more necessary today than ever to proclaim the validity of the Guernica Statute and to this end I would call on the Presidency of the European Parliament to send our congratulations to the Presidency of the Basque Parliament on the occasion of this anniversary."
"Mr President, on Friday, the International Council for Exploration of the Sea published its annual fish stock assessment figures, advice which showed that North Sea haddock stocks exceed even last year's record highs."
"Yet the headline story fed to the media, in advance of that advice, referred only to cod stocks and the lack of improvement therein in the North Sea."
"This has echoes of last year's situation when, after the publication of scientific advice, there followed threats to close the entire North Sea to all fishing."
"Ultimately, at the December Council last year, the Commission tabled a quota recovery plan which quickly proved to be unworkable."
"It did nothing to safeguard cod and it prevented Scots fishermen from catching their allowed haddock quota."
"If – and I say if – we have a new fisheries Commissioner by the end of this week, I call upon him fully to involve the new North Sea Regional Advisory Council in the setting of quotas in advance of this December's Council, so that a sensible and workable plan on quota setting procedure can take place."
"That concludes the speeches on matters of political importance."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0014/2004) by Mr Lipietz, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the 2003 Annual Report of the European Central Bank (2004/2144(INI))."
"Mr President, Mr President of the European Central Bank (ECB), ladies and gentlemen, I should like to salute the high quality and, on certain points, the innovative nature of the ECB’s report for 2003, presented under Mr Trichet’s guidance."
"A period such as 2003 can be analysed from two perspectives: what exactly happened in 2003 and what was decided in 2003."
"These are two distinct notions, because, according to econometrics, monetary decisions have a delayed reaction on actual developments of something in the region of 12 to 18 months."
"What we are therefore discussing here today is, in some respects, the policy of 2002 and its orientations in 2003."
"Firstly, 2003 saw strong price stability: a little over 2% at the beginning of the year and actually a little less at the end of the year, despite oil price rises."
"Unfortunately, 2003 also saw a major slowdown in the EU in relation to its major competitors – the United States, Japan and China, among others."
"It is therefore with this information in mind that we must analyse the orientations given in 2003 by the ECB, which were both practical and doctrinal."
"Let us begin with the practical orientations: throughout 2002, in contrast with the policy pursued by our neighbours, the Bank of England itself or the US federal reserve, which cut their interest rates sharply, the ECB retained the same interest rate virtually until December."
"From December 2002 and throughout, let us say, the first half of 2003, there was a very sharp interest rate reduction in Europe, and we have begun to see the positive effects of this in 2004."
"This interest rate reduction was illustrated by what we call the ‘8 May Announcement’, which was dissected and explained most interestingly in the ECB’s 2003 report, and we thoroughly endorse this orientation and the way in which it was justified in the 2003 report."
"Firstly, we are told that, in order to offset the risk of deflation, it is important to have inflation that is below, but close to 2%, so that actual interest rates might be taken to a negative level."
"Secondly, we are told that the M3 money supply is important in the long term, yet not in setting monetary policy. I feel that both of these theories are perfectly justified."
"Our report welcomes this major orientation, and we shall table the amendments again to welcome it even more clearly."
"For the future, the 2003 report contains a further point that is extremely important, which is a clear statement by the ECB, as a public authority, that it is accountable to the general public and that this accountability entails dialogue with Parliament."
"I feel that by putting itself forward as something of an executive body, in view of the fact that its relationship with the general public involves interacting with Parliament, this ECB report represents a major step forward."
"I feel that the next step is to develop this dialogue further, and in our report we make proposals to this end."
"Thirdly, in our proposals for the future, we are naturally thinking about the new countries’ accession."
"We consider that these countries should be treated equally and with the same criteria for meeting the convergence criteria as those that have been thus far applied to all countries."
"This is not an issue of two weights and measures; the same rules apply to 2005, 2006 and 2007 as applied in 1997."
"Lastly, we must start to consider the new generation of bank notes."
"We feel that we must keep the one and two cent coins and many of us feel that we should introduce a 1-euro note."
"It is essential, in our view, that bank notes and coins should bring the general public closer to its currency."
"It is time to put living people on our notes, as every country in the world does."
"Mr President, Mr Lipietz, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to highlight, on behalf of both the European Central Bank and my colleagues in the Governing Council, the extent to which we share your desire to maintain the fruitful relations that our institutions have developed in recent years, as referred to by the rapporteur just now."
"I am delighted to pursue this dialogue, from the ECB’s side, in this spirit of frankness and cooperation."
"I have the honour, as has just been mentioned, of presenting to you today the 2003 annual report, which is one of the main instruments available to the ECB to present monetary policy, and the activities that fall within its competence, to Europe’s citizens and to you, the representatives of Europe’s citizens."
"The ECB attaches the highest importance to regular dialogue with the European public and with its elected representatives."
"Mr President, the ECB's monetary policy operated in a rather uncertain and challenging environment in 2003."
"In the first half of the year, real GDP growth stagnated amid considerable uncertainty related to geopolitical tensions and turbulence in oil prices and financial markets."
"Following the easing of economic and geopolitical uncertainties, prospects for economic activity gradually brightened after the summer of 2003."
"Nevertheless, overall GDP in the euro area increased by only 0.5% in 2003."
"Annual HICP inflation slowed down slightly in 2003 to 2.1% on average from 2.3% on average in both 2001 and 2002."
"The persistence of inflation above 2% was mainly caused by increases in a number of volatile components of the HICP, in particular oil prices, and, in the second half of 2003, food prices."
"Rises in indirect taxes and administrative prices also added to inflation in 2003."
"From a medium-term perspective, however, we expect price developments to remain in line with price stability after the progressive elimination of the influence of those volatile components of the HICP."
"This expectation resulting from our economic analysis was in line with our monetary analysis."
"Much of the strength of monetary growth in early 2003 was due to the high level of economic and financial market uncertainty prevailing at that time, which prompted portfolio shifts into safer, short-term liquid assets included in M3."
"In view of the moderation of medium-term inflationary pressures in the first half of 2003, as was said by Mr Lipietz, the ECB's key interest rates were reduced by 25 basis points in March 2003 and by 50 basis points in June of the same year."
"Thus, in June 2003, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations reached 2%."
"Since then, this interest rate has remained unchanged at this historically very low level, whilst the preservation of inflationary expectations in line with our definition of price stability has contributed very significantly to the low level of medium and long-term nominal and real interest rates."
"The resulting yield curve has delivered a financial environment very significantly supportive to economic recovery."
"The economic recovery, which started in the second half of 2003, has continued this year."
"In terms of year-on-year growth rates, we reached 2% in the second quarter of this year."
"By and large, output growth in the last 12 months was close to present estimates of potential growth in the euro area."
"We expect a continuation of this growth trend in the coming quarters."
"On the external side, the world economy is currently recording its strongest growth for 30 years."
"Some moderation is expected next year, but euro area exports should, nevertheless, continue to benefit from favourable global demand conditions in 2005."
"On the domestic side, investment should normally benefit from the positive global environment, the very favourable financing conditions in the euro area and the improvements in corporate efficiency."
"There is scope in the euro area as a whole for a strengthening of private consumption, but naturally some uncertainty as to outlook exists."
"One of the risks stems from developments in oil markets."
"If oil prices were to remain high, or even to increase further, they could dampen the strength of the recovery, both inside and outside the euro area, despite the fact that the oil intensity of the euro area is significantly lower than in the 1970s."
"We also need to keep in mind that part of the oil price increase is due to strong global demand, which was not the case in the first and second oil shocks, but it remains true that the oil price increase constitutes an adverse supply shock for the euro area economy as a whole."
"For the oil price shock to be absorbed smoothly, the policy mistakes of the past must not be repeated and, in particular, 'second-round' effects must be avoided."
"As regards consumer prices, oil-market developments have had a direct impact on the euro area HICP."
"Following an annual rate of 1.7% in the first quarter of 2004, inflation reached 2.3% in the second quarter and 2.2% in the third quarter."
"Inflation rates over the past year have also been driven up by exceptionally strong rises in indirect taxes and administered prices all over the euro area."
"Nevertheless, looking ahead, the available information does not indicate -– in our eyes – that stronger underlying inflationary pressures are building up domestically as yet."
"Wage developments have remained moderate since the last quarter of 2003, and this trend should continue."
"Provided that there are no further significant shocks to prices, annual inflation rates should drop below 2% in the course of 2005."
"However, I should stress that, over recent quarters, we have seen several upward risks to the outlook for price stability emerge, and these call for ongoing vigilance."
"This again relates to oil price developments and possible second-round effects stemming from wage- and price-setting behaviour."
"Other concerns relate to long-term inflation expectations and also monetary trends."
"Indeed, the downward trend in annual entry growth since mid-2003 appears to have halted over the summer of this year and the shorter-term dynamics of entry have strengthened."
"This reflects in part the fact that the historically low level of interest rates in the euro area continues to support monetary expansion."
"The low level of interest rates is also fuelling the growth of credit to the private sector, and we have witnessed continued strong growth in loans for house purchase."
"Given the strength of M3 growth over the past few years, there is presently substantially more liquidity in the euro area than is needed to finance non-inflationary growth."
"I now turn to other aspects we are looking at."
"A good and credible monetary policy is certainly a necessary condition for sustainable growth and job creation, but not a sufficient condition by itself."
"Other conditions must be met, in particular sound fiscal policies and appropriate structural reforms."
"In this respect, in the area of fiscal policy, last year proved disappointing."
"The average fiscal deficit in the euro area increased from 2.4% to 2.7%."
"Moreover, the fiscal situation remained of great concern in countries that had already recorded significant imbalances in 2002."
"The aggregate euro area fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio is not expected to improve in 2004 and the average debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to deteriorate further."
"This is certainly a source of concern."
"Last year fiscal policies in the EMU faced a number of serious challenges."
"On 25 November 2003 the EU Council decided not to act on the basis of the Commission's recommendation and agreed to hold the excessive deficit procedure for the countries concerned in abeyance."
"On the very same day, the Governing Council of the ECB supported the view of the Commission."
"The Stability and Growth Pact is the cornerstone of EMU."
"It is key to providing an economic to a single currency area which has no federal government and to ensuring macro-economic stability on a sustainable basis."
"The Governing Council of the ECB is of the opinion that substantial improvements in the Pact's implementation are needed, particularly as regards the preventive arm of the Pact."
"At the same time, it is not in favour of making changes to the text of the Treaty or of the regulations which form the basis of the Pact, and we insist on the importance of preserving the full integrity of the nominal anchor of 3% in the corrective arm of the Pact."
"I would also stress – as has Ecofin – the vital importance of a reliable and timely reporting of government finance statistics, which would not be subject, in any respect, to political interference and electoral cycles."
"On that particular point we are in full agreement with Ecofin."
"On a more positive note, both 2003 and 2004 have seen some progress towards structural reforms in several euro area countries."
"While implementing these reforms has not always been easy, I am confident that we will be able to see their positive effects in the years ahead."
"I have said clearly that the ECB is backing governments, parliaments and social partners that have embarked on those necessary reforms in the euro area."
"We cannot be complacent."
"In many areas further reforms are needed."
"The continuing reform process is key to enhancing the euro area's production potential and ensuring future growth and employment opportunities."
"The year 2003 was also marked by the final preparations for the enlargement of the European Union by 10 new Member States, with effect from 1 May 2004."
"As far as the ECB is concerned, the integration of the central banks of the 10 new Member States proceeded smoothly."
"Important challenges remain for these countries on the road to adopting the euro."
"Last week, the ECB, like the Commission, published the first Convergence Report dealing with these countries, together with Sweden."
"The report identifies several priority areas in which individual countries will be required to make further efforts before they can adopt the euro."
"The picture that emerged varied significantly from country to country, but many share similar challenges with regard to price stability, fiscal sustainability, exchange rate stability and interest rate convergence."
"In addition, institutional convergence has not yet been achieved in all countries, in particular in the area of central bank independence."
"I cannot over-emphasise the latter's importance for the successful conduct of monetary policy."
"The ECB very much appreciated the favourable comments contained in the European Parliament's draft resolution on the ECB's monetary policy strategy in 2003."
"We have always strived to demonstrate a strong commitment to achieving our primary objective of price stability."
"Inflation has remained subdued, despite a sequence of adverse disturbances."
"I do not want to dwell further on that, but I will stress the challenge of solidly anchoring medium and long-term inflation expectations – of key importance for delivering price stability and for consolidating an exceptionally favourable yield curve, because, on a medium to long-term basis, these inflationary expectations are incorporated in the market rates."
"I have noted that on the most important issues the views expressed in the draft resolution are very similar to those held by the ECB. Nevertheless, there are a number of issues where we have slight differences of views."
"In particular, the draft resolution asks for the publication of the minutes of the Governing Council meetings, whilst it seems to accept implicitly that individual votes of Members would not be made public."
"We would very much appreciate it if Parliament could accept the argument that the publication of the votes of individual members of the Governing Council could trigger national public debates on whether national central bank governors have taken due account of national interests, whereas the Treaty calls for all of us to focus on the euro area as a whole."
"Such public discussions would have adverse consequences for the credibility and the effectiveness of the ECB's monetary policy."
"As regards the minutes, I stress that the ECB presents and explains its monetary policy decisions by means of comprehensive public statements at its press conferences which take place immediately after Governing Council meetings."
"By adopting this procedure during 1999, the ECB contributed to improving the global state-of-the-art in central bank transparency and became the first central bank to release a comprehensive diagnosis explaining monetary policy decisions immediately after they are taken."
"The information conveyed by the ECB this way is, in essence, similar to what other central banks publish in summary minutes, as it reflects properly the overall discussion in the Governing Council."
"The ECB is the only major central bank which makes possible immediate interaction with the media."
"These features make the ECB, in our view, one of the most transparent central banks in the world."
"Mr President, I should like to mention in passing, if I may, the joint work done by the European Central Bank System and the Committee of European Securities Regulators as regards developing joint rules and standards in the field of clearing and settlement, which is also mentioned in the draft resolution."
"These standards represent a highly significant contribution towards a securities infrastructure that is safe and integrated."
"We are placing the highest importance on this aim, given that the current fragmentation of this infrastructure has led to transaction costs that are too high and this is, furthermore, a source of financial instability."
"Nevertheless, I must say at this point that whilst the standards that we agreed with the Committee of European Securities Regulators were decided in total compliance with the current legislation and regulations in force, we do not wish, under any circumstances, to prejudge any decisions that may be taken in future. Consequently, if a new directive on clearing and settlement were adopted following the appropriate procedure, we would, of course, look again at our joint rules and standards, so as to ensure that they remained in line with the provisions of the directive if, once again, such a decision were taken."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Central Bank’s annual report for 2003 is in a new format, one that is clearer and easier to understand, with more details and greater transparency, including on the critical aspects of current policy."
"The report thus makes the ECB’s policies more accessible to the readers, that is, the public, so we see the ECB as having done a good job of work with the whole thing."
"Mr Lipietz’s original report contains some criticisms of the ECB, and with these we do not agree."
"Let me begin with interest rate policy, one general criticism of which we regard as misplaced."
"We know that interest rate policy is a balancing act, but, as whole, 2003 saw the ECB continuing to do a good job of keeping things on an even keel; the economy is growing, the euro is stable, and interest rates are low in real terms."
"There is a second criticism that we do not endorse, in that we take the view that the ECB’s responsibilities are clearly and well set out, these being, primarily, price stability and moderate rates of inflation."
"When those are in place, the important conditions for economic growth and employment are created, and, although that is of course not enough, we should not make the ECB responsible for full employment or economic growth; to do so would be to lay far too great a burden on it."
"These matters are for the national governments to deal with."
"Mr Trichet pointed out that this is where Budget policy is important, and the national governments have failed to discharge their responsibilities in this respect."
"We cannot correct that by overburdening the ECB."
"We also share the view, expressed by Mr Trichet, that the votes of individual members of the Governing Council should not be published."
"To do so would politicise the ECB, and would do Europe’s present economic development no good."
"When we have made a success of putting the Lisbon agenda into practice, then the position will be a different one, and we will be able to discuss the subject again."
"While we are in favour of the ECB doing as the Federal Reserve does and publishing a Grey Book every year, we also would like to see the publication, at the due time, of summary minutes without individual votes; the matter should then be left there."
"To sum up, we should allow the ECB the freedom to act in the manner laid down in the Maastricht Treaty on European Union."
"The Lipietz report was successfully rewritten by the adoption, in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, of the amendments tabled on these points, and so we still wonder why the rapporteur has not dissociated himself from it."
"We regard the report, as it stands, as balanced and good, and in this form we endorse it."
"We do not believe that it needs to be amended."
"– A debate such as the one we are having today is very important as it affects millions of people throughout the whole continent."
"At times, I find it amusing that, in this House, we seem to make the mistake of thinking that the entire debate is exclusively for us economists or bankers."
"At times, we end up talking in such a complicated way that I honestly believe that there are people in this House, let alone those who voted for us and to whom we are responsible, who do not even know what we are talking about."
"As I said, the matters that we are discussing today and that are the subject of the Central Bank report affect the daily life of millions of people."
"Mr President, I come from a very small village, with a total of 800 inhabitants, in the smallest Member State of the European Union, namely Malta."
"Nevertheless, what we are debating with such pompous words sometimes affects the lives of families as much as it affects multinationals, which have very powerful lobbyists here and in Brussels."
"These normal families, or ordinary people as they are referred to in English, pay taxes and abide by the law."
"It is to them that we owe our first allegiance in all the decisions we take."
"I believe that, in the future, the main task of new Member States of the European Union must be to put their economies on strong foundations."
"They must do this whilst being careful not to rip the social fabric which in many countries, including mine, has taken many years to weave."
"It is in these terms that the issue of when to adopt the euro must be considered."
"In my opinion, it would be a mistake if any country, simply to satisfy its desire to introduce the single currency as soon as possible, were to introduce superficial but harsh measures affecting its middle and lower classes, measures that might perhaps result in satisfying the convergence criteria, whatever these might be, but at the expense of sacrificing the social achievements of recent years."
"Things should not be done in a hurry, but planned wisely."
"Our first priority should be our need to be more competitive both as individual countries and as a continent."
"The new Member States of the European Union and the European Union as a whole have a great deal to learn from the experience of those Member States that have already adopted the single currency."
"This was a positive experience for many countries."
"Nevertheless, there were complaints about unwarranted price increases implemented as soon as the system changed over to the euro."
"These complaints, especially from those who, in our society, can least afford price increases, were justified in many cases."
"Last year, this Parliament asked the Central Bank to investigate those incorrect workings of the system that resulted in price increases."
"I believe that, to be consistent, we must request another such investigation, and I believe this is why, as the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, we are presenting an amendment to this effect."
"I urge my fellow MEPs from the other groups again to vote in favour of an investigation, thereby enabling us to be consistent."
"Finally, this is a very difficult time, but it is not a time for losing heart."
"It is a time when we need leadership and vision."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by warmly congratulating Mr Trichet on the way in which he has done a good job of continuing the work of his predecessor Mr Wim Duisenberg."
"Mr Trichet, your performance in office to date has helped to ensure, and indeed further enhance, the European Central Bank’s credibility and independence."
"Through the annual report for 2003 and the monetary dialogue involving you and the members of your Executive Board, the ECB has fully discharged its duty of accountability to the European Parliament."
"What makes the report convincing is its format, its clarity and the wealth of useful information it contains."
"We are glad to see that the ECB’s annual report stresses the maintenance of price stability as the Bank’s primary objective and principal task."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the European Parliament not only accepts this as a core task for the ECB, but, moreover, emphasises that it has priority."
"This is where we are as one with the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"We are also aware that the ECB is independent."
"The European Central Bank needs no lectures on what its interest rate policy should have been like in the past or what it must be like in the future."
"The euro zone’s economic weakness is attributable neither to any lack of confidence in the euro nor simply to a lack of demand that might have been avoided by aggressive cutting of interest rates."
"The determining factor is, instead, a general lack of confidence on the part of the public and the business community in their own countries’ economic policies, and the sluggishness of reforms, particularly in the large euro zone countries."
"In saying this, I am thinking of the necessary reforms to the tax system, to the labour market, to the social security systems and to the health sector, which have, for far too long, been put off or tackled merely half-heartedly."
"To these things, Mr Trichet, you have already referred in your speech."
"Being the only institution in the European Union to be directly elected and democratically legitimate, this year again the European Parliament will not fail to play its part as the champion of transparency."
"While I know that you, Mr Trichet, take a different line on this, it is with this in mind that we propose that the ECB should publish comprehensive minutes of the meetings of its Governing Council, including the voting results in full, albeit without attribution of individual votes."
"We also think it would make sense to produce a yearbook on economic development similar to the ‘Beige Book’ of the Federal Reserve in the USA, something that the Group of the European People’s Party has also called for."
"This would enable the public to have first-hand and readily-accessible information on the economic positions of their own country and of all the countries in the euro zone."
"Such a volume would make for greater transparency and could also build up the public’s identification with the European Union."
"By way of conclusion, let me call upon the European Central Bank, as a matter of urgency, to continue to watch, with a critical and attentive eye, over adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact and, together with Eurostat, to compel the countries of the euro zone to produce reliable figures."
"What has happened with Greece must not be allowed to happen again."
"We look forward to your feedback, Mr Trichet, and to continued close cooperation with you in the future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are economic theories that are astoundingly impervious to reality."
"One of them is the presupposition that a central bank that endeavours to keep prices stable must, , also be making the best possible contribution to full employment and growth."
"That prices in the euro zone have been stable for years is not a matter of contention; if we disregard the effect of rising oil prices and indirect taxation, inflation in the euro zone currently stands at just above 1%, which is verging on deflation."
"Has this brought us less unemployment and more growth?"
"The crisis is, of course, attributable not only to misguided monetary policy."
"It is due, above all, to a policy, described as one of reform, which is in thrall to profit, wrecks workers’ rights, encourages wage dumping, and privatises social security benefits, thereby helping to strangle mass purchasing power and to increase poverty in Europe."
"Monetary policy does, however, bear its share of responsibility as a result of cuts in interest rates that have been too late and not enough."
"It is cynical to describe the European Central Bank as having pursued the goal of full employment when millions of women and men have lost their jobs in recent years – not a few of them because the high cost of borrowing has bled small businesses dry."
"The fact is that a central bank also has the task of sounding the alarm when ever-increasing concentration of ownership gives the private banking sector more power over the market and when cuts in key interest rates serve primarily to increase the finance houses’ profit margins, instead of being felt by smaller enterprises and consumers."
"In this respect, too, the ECB has failed."
"Those who mendaciously depict the history of the single European currency as a success story are merely showing once again which vested interests colour their view of political events in Europe: monetary union has no equal as a model of success in the eyes of the European financial elite, whose attention is fixed on conglomerates’ gilt-edged balance sheets and increasing profits."
"To the ECB, those who look at the world from this angle ..."
"Mr President, by setting up a currency union with a common currency, twelve of the EU Member States have taken considerable risks with employment."
"The EU countries are characterised by limited ability to adjust to various structural changes and are therefore afflicted by permanently high unemployment figures."
"The risks involved in the euro are already clearly seen, above all in Germany which has been subjected to an unduly restrictive monetary policy in recent years, with hundreds of thousands of German workers forced needlessly into unemployment."
"These problems will increase when industrial activity shifts to Eastern Europe and Asia, badly affecting each of the eurozone countries to varying degrees during the next five years."
"Unfortunately, the policy of the European Central Bank has exacerbated these unemployment problems in quite a few Member States."
"In common with most modern central banks, the European Central Bank operates mainly with an inflation target."
"This is completely in accordance with economic theory, but too low a target has been chosen."
"The central banks in Great Britain, Sweden, New Zealand and the United States have higher inflation targets."
"Modern research indicates that the inflation target should be set at an average of 2.5% or perhaps 3% over an economic cycle so as not to drive people unnecessarily into unemployment."
"The ECB and its top people should therefore increase their inflation target to an average of at least 2.5%."
"They deserve to be sharply criticised for their inability to adjust their policy to the way in which the European mixed economy operates."
"Mr President, let me promptly ask Mr Trichet a question to which he does not have to give me an answer, although I would be interested to know how he feels about it."
"How, Mr Trichet, did you feel this morning when you read in the the damning assessment of the Lisbon strategy by Mr Prodi, who is still President of the Commission and may perhaps continue to be such for a little longer?"
"Did the question present itself to you, too, as to what we in Europe have done wrong?"
"Might it not have something to do with the lamentable fact that we in Europe, represented by spokesmen, some of whom we have already been able to hear here today, have got ourselves stuck in an ideological fight to the death about what the European Central Bank’s primary purpose is meant to be, rather than taking a more pragmatic approach?"
"I would just ask my conservative friend Mr Lauk to re-read to himself the speech he has just delivered, this time with reference to American conditions; it would then, probably, become clear – even to him – that price stability and economic growth are always something of which a central bank must not lose sight if its actions are to be effective."
"The same is of course true of the other crucial question about inflation that you, the new President, must ask yourself."
"It was apparent from your speech that there are certain areas in which we appear already to be moving back from deflation towards inflation."
"What the Greek Government has pulled off, with the more or less active collaboration, or in any case, negligence, of Eurostat, could perhaps become a problem in other countries."
"So I really do ask you, in the interests of all those in the euro zone who believe in the euro – and, being an Austrian, I include myself – to be much more critical, and much more vigilant, than your predecessor."
"If I may mention a third area that I am keen to bring to your attention, I think we have, both in your own field and in the collection of data, really serious problems with transparency."
"I share the view that more transparency would be a good thing."
"The President allocated me two minutes and thirty seconds, and I would like to make full use of them."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with thanks – for the constructive cooperation and increased dialogue, for the building up of trust, which has been consistent and has met with success, and for your defence of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Mr Hans-Peter Martin has as yet been on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for only a short time, and this is the probable reason why he has not yet realised that there is a link between stable prices, low inflation, growth and employment."
"I would also like to congratulate you on having helped to give a fixed place in the Constitution to price stability as a European goal and not just something for which the European Central Bank aims, and on the success of your policy of making the ECB more independent and a stronger and communicative player."
"We do, of course, also have a few things for which to ask; one of them has to do with independence, that being that you should resist all the attempts by Finance ministers – and, it obviously has to be said, by the Hungarian Government – to extend their political influence over the ECB’s monetary policy and their personal influence over the national issuing banks."
"I would also ask you to make yourself, to a greater extent, the prime communicator of the significance of monetary policy in terms of a strong euro, of low rates of inflation, of stable prices, of growth and employment and of the benefits to the economy."
"We do know that the euro is worth more than the public think it is."
"We urge you to champion the abolition of one- and two-cent coins and the introduction of one- and two-euro notes, and to ensure that transparency is not at odds with independence."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, leaving aside the uncertainty caused by movements in the price of oil, the European Central Bank (ECB) has succeeded rather well in its quest for price stability."
"Is the euro zone economy, for all that, in good health?"
"Obviously not."
"Results are mediocre, growth is weak, domestic demand is running out of steam and unemployment is severe, whilst inequality and poverty are on the rise."
"Hamstrung by the ECB’s independence – which is absurd, yet is enshrined and is soon to be set in stone in the constitution – rendered impotent by the absence of economic governance, weakened by a Stability and Growth Pact that is both rigid and stupid, the EU has subordinated itself to the ECB’s decisions and is paying for price stability in Europe with weak growth and high unemployment."
"The out-going Commission proposed a reform to the Stability and Growth Pact that was based on common sense, and yet the ECB – through the voice of its Chairman – completely devoted to its monetarist dogma, was worried that the reform might go beyond the merely cosmetic, in particular by introducing the golden rule that support would be available for the investment needed to meet the Lisbon objectives or by laying the groundwork for a counter-cyclical budgetary policy capable of restarting the machine during periods of slowdown."
"I am personally convinced that the dogmatic leadership of the ECB is the natural consequence of a deadly choice for the EU and its citizens, which consists of removing all forms of economic governance from any political control."
"I would add that the upshot of this choice is that the most damaging strategies are encouraged."
"This report, despite its author’s opinion, is thus symptomatic of this phenomenon. In demanding structural reforms, it stigmatises social systems and pension schemes."
"It also calls for an increase in the working hours of European workers."
"At this stage, therefore, this report fails to convince us, not least because it has been contaminated by the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"Accordingly, we shall submit several amendments in the course of this debate, and if those amendments are not adopted we will vote against."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Trichet on the presentation of his first annual report on behalf of the European Central Bank."
"I have read this report with more than the average level of interest."
"As rapporteur on the annual report for 2002, I was, above all, interested to see how the aspirations expressed by Parliament in a resolution of July 2003 had been taken on board."
"This brief and pithy resolution contained not only political but also practical wishes."
"In the first paragraph of last year’s resolution about the annual report 2003, Parliament asked the ECB to set up a working party to investigate the need for introducing the EUR 1 note."
"Personally, I cannot see the need for such a note, but I would like the Bank to investigate this in view of confidence in the currency."
"On page 101 of your annual report, you indicate that the Executive Council will revisit this issue in the autumn of 2004."
"My first question to you, Mr Trichet, is why you did not, in accordance with Parliament’s resolution, set up a working party."
"Also, now that the autumn of 2004 is upon us, I would very much like to hear from you what position the Executive Council has adopted with regard to the EUR 1 note."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to start my speech with thanks to you, Mr Trichet, and thereby emphasise that, for us in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, your institution now stands for a stable euro – not only for low inflation, but also for adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact."
"That has, in particular, become apparent in the events of recent months, in which the euro’s problem has been with the Finance ministers, and in which some of us in the European Parliament have seen with great sorrow the Commission’s failure to take a stand in the way, and with the clarity, that you have done today in this House with regard to how the Stability Pact is to be handled."
"It is in fact you who guarantee the Stability Pact in the euro zone!"
"Here, I am referring in particular to the example of Greece, where we need Europe to exert tighter control, something that I hear said, alas, all too infrequently, even today."
"I could, for example, imagine a future reversal of the burden of proof, so that the Commission and Eurostat would have to critically examine whether the figures are plausible, and, if they were not, new ones could be called for."
"Otherwise they would not be regarded as having been reported."
"That would be a first step, and we expect to have to debate and decide, within the life of this Parliament, whether more currencies are to be added."
"Let me put this question, not only to Eurostat and the Commission, but also to the ECB: do you work on the basis that the figures presented to you are correct?"
"I find it intolerable that it has to date been impossible to give an answer as to whether or not the figures as submitted are accurate."
"Let me just briefly turn to what you had to say about the CESR."
"What is wrong with this process is that the authorities at nation state level are already presenting us with ,and that it is becoming ever more difficult for the legal system to circumvent this and arrive at redefinitions."
"We ask you to see to it that these regulators do not lack a legal basis on which to act."
"Mr President, Mr Trichet, Mr Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome you all warmly to this debate, which demonstrates the democratic element of the European Central Bank’s independence represented by parliamentary control and responsibility."
"I entirely agree with the aspects of Mr Lipietz’s report providing a favourable assessment of the European Central Bank’s reaction during 2003: low interest rates, clarification of the concept of stability and enlargement of the eurozone."
"The concern stems from the slow economic activity during 2003, particularly in the eurozone, and the continuing risks to growth."
"The Union has been designed to bring about both stability and growth; either one of them alone is not enough."
"Commissioner Almunia’s initiative is, therefore, very appropriate, and is going to require support."
"Hence, given the undeniable role of monetary policy in terms of promoting investment and productivity on the inside and competitiveness on the outside, the report’s resolution must place more emphasis on a close association between the European Central Bank and investment and growth policy."
"Nevertheless, the need for structural reforms must not become distorted through erroneous signals; the link between weak economic activity and low working time must therefore be excluded from the resolution."
"It is not compatible with the criteria of flexibility rather than rigidity, or the productivity criteria."
"The essential thing is to create more value per unit of time rather than more units of time."
"In short, a downward model will have a dissolving effect, and we need integrated, intelligent and ambitious economic governance in the economic, social and environmental fields."
"Mr President, in this final intervention I would like to emphasise three points."
"Firstly, it has been pointed out that the history of the Economic and Monetary Union has been one of success and that this is due to the work of the Bank."
"I agree with this statement by the rapporteur and I would urge the Governor of the Bank of Spain to continue focusing on price stability as the main objective and not to listen to the sirens’ songs from the left trying to lure him towards other objectives."
"Secondly, I would like to ask the President to tell the Commissioner, who is beside him, that his proposal to make the pact more flexible, the creation of an pact, represents a real time-bomb for prices, neutralising the efforts of the Central Bank, for interest rates and, therefore, for investment and employment, for pensions in the future and for the Lisbon reforms."
"Because if the pact is broken or made more flexible, we will need tomorrow's taxes to pay for today's obligations."
"Why are we not growing?"
"Not because the governments have been disciplined in observing the pact, but because they have done quite the opposite and, furthermore, because they have not fulfilled the obligations we set for them in the Lisbon Pact and which appear in the broad economic guidelines."
"I would urge the two of you, the President of the Central Bank and the Commissioner, just as we achieved an integrated financial market through a financial services action plan, to produce a financial action plan establishing the reforms and objectives we must achieve, the barriers which are hindering growth and which hence need to be eliminated, the actions we must take and the timetable we must respect."
"Mr President, do not take any notice of the governments when they urge you to look the other way when fiscal decisions are not complied with."
"Rather than that, I would suggest that, like Ulysses, when you hear those sirens’ songs, you tie yourself to the mast and continue on the course which brings us so much success, and convince the Commissioner that that is the course to follow."
"Because we have run over the time allotted for this debate I am unable to give the floor to Mr Trichet to answer some of the very interesting questions that have been asked."
"I would ask you, Mr Trichet, to reply in writing to those Members who have asked questions, with a copy to the President of Parliament."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Lipietz for his work as rapporteur for this report and all the honourable Members of Parliament who have spoken and who have been involved in debating and discussing it before today’s plenary session for the contributions they have made to it, and I would naturally also like to congratulate the President of the European Central Bank, Mr Trichet, on the excellent quality of the report we are debating today."
"There has been much agreement during the debate, and this is reflected in the report and has been expressed by the majority of Members who have spoken."
"Firstly, the success of Economic and Monetary Union; 2003 was the fifth year of Economic and Monetary Union, and over these five years price stability has improved significantly; interest rates have fallen and the economy’s financing conditions are much more stable and satisfactory than they would have been if we had not decided to take the extraordinarily important step of creating an Economic and Monetary Union and creating a single currency with a system enshrining the independent status of the European Central Bank."
"I also agree with those who have stated that macroeconomic stability, healthy macroeconomic policies, price stability and low interest rates are a necessary condition, but do not by themselves explain the state of growth in the European Union, particularly in 2003, referred to in the report we are debating today, but also during 2004."
"Macroeconomic stability, healthy macroeconomic policies, the independence of the European Central Bank, are necessary conditions, but they are not sufficient."
"And we will of course have the opportunity to debate it from next week."
"The revitalisation of the Lisbon strategy; new impetus for structural reforms, in accordance with the objectives and guidelines agreed in March 2000, are essential to achieving sustained and stable growth in a European Union which must not only grow, but which, furthermore, must do so in stable conditions, promoting social cohesion and the sustainability of our growth and of our model of growth."
"I am also pleased and this has been demonstrated in the report and in some of your speeches – with the dialogue amongst the institutions, the debate we are holding today being a good example of that."
"Independence is not incompatible with dialogue."
"And respect for the roles of each of the Institutions, which form part of the Economic and Monetary Union, helps to make this dialogue fruitful and ensures that it takes place under the best possible conditions, today being an example of that."
"I would like to make some specific comments, Mr President."
"Firstly, the Stability and Growth Pact remains fully in force and there are certain phrases in the report’s explanatory statement which could give the impression that the serious political conflict in the Council in November 2003 had mortally wounded that Pact."
"But as we discussed here last month, the Pact is in force; the European Constitution has just ratified the broad stability objectives in terms of deficit and debt, the framework for economic governance is still the one decided upon at the beginning of Economic and Monetary Union."
"What we need to do is improve its application, as Mr Trichet has said and, in any event, discuss whether on the basis of our experience and application of the Stability and Growth Pact over recent years, there are possibilities for improving its implementation, not in order to change the objectives of stability and growth, but in order to turn it into reality in a more effective and consistent manner than we have managed so far."
"Secondly, I would like to make a comment, , as Mr Trichet would say, on the one and two cent coins."
"The notes fall within the competence of the European Central Bank, and Mr Trichet will say what he needs to say on behalf of the Bank."
"Euro coins and their denominations fall within the competence of the Council – which established what those coins are in a Regulation – and of the Commission – which must ensure regulations are complied with."
"And regardless of the decisions taken, or to be taken in the future, in certain Member States of the eurozone, the one and two cent coins remain legal tender and that is laid down in the regulations and it is the Commission’s duty to ensure that remains the case in the future."
"Finally, a comment on the economic situation mentioned by Mr Trichet."
"Tomorrow, following the meeting of the College of Commissioners here in Strasbourg, I will have the opportunity to communicate the Commission's autumn economic forecasts to Parliament and to the public via the media, taking account of something we are going to debate shortly, which is the clearly not positive, in fact negative, impact of the rise in oil prices we have been experiencing over recent months."
"Mr President, I shall not talk for longer than a minute, and, as you requested, I shall reply in writing to the extremely pertinent questions which have been raised."
"I simply wished to confirm that the nature of the dialogue between Parliament and the European Central Bank is such that we have recently decided to publish our quarterly forecasts."
"This was one of Parliament’s suggestions, and we are therefore taking a very important step in a direction referred to by several speakers."
"The issue of amendments to the Hungarian law was also raised, and I must say that our ongoing analysis has revealed at least one aspect of the proposals pending before the Hungarian Parliament which we do not believe is acceptable, and which may well need to be the subject of a debate in the near future."
"This is why I think that it was important for me to be able to reply to you straight away."
"The dismissal of two vice-presidents of the Monetary Policy Council, the body which sets interest rates, does not appear to us to be at all in keeping with the independence guaranteed under the Treaty of Maastricht."
"This was all that I wished to say, Mr President, and I have abided by your request."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be tomorrow at 12.30."
"Mr President, the last speaker but one, who spoke on previous points of order, was celebrating the fact that it was the 25th anniversary of the approval of the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country, and on the occasion of this anniversary, he has proposed that this Parliament congratulate the Basque Parliament on this day, 25 October, 25 years after the approval of that Statute."
"I would like to point out that he forgot to mention that, following a quarter of a century with this Statute in place, 37 transfers remain outstanding and we are talking about an Organic Law of the Spanish State which has not been fully complied with."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Basque Parliament on what happened 25 years ago, regardless of the course that Statute has taken, which I believe has been highly satisfactory."
"But Mr Ortuondo’s speech strikes me as somewhat grotesque, since what he suggests would be like not congratulating the French on the French Revolution because some of the subsequent laws have not been complied with."
"I would like to focus on one of the points in the Lipietz report – the possible abolition of the 1 and 2 cent coins."
"This issue has raised concerns in most of the Member States."
"Irish consumer organisations are concerned about the possible inflationary implications of following other Member States in reducing the usage of these small coins or indeed withdrawing them."
"Listening to discussions in the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, it is not clear if these concerns are grounded or not."
"The debate has centred on statements of personal preference proposing/opposing the argument, using the Netherlands and Finland as case examples."
"But facts from impact assessment analysis, consumer surveys and so on remain hard to find."
"The Central Bank of Ireland, as in other Member States, is aware that the cost of minting and distributing both coins is substantially greater than their face value."
"This does alleviate concerns."
"Mr Trichet, can you give us the facts on the inflationary effects or otherwise of abolishing the 1 and 2 cent coins?"
"Finally, is the ECB in favour of abolishing these coins as a positive move for the future?"
"The next item is the Commission statement on restructuring of the automobile sector. I shall give the floor straight away to Mr Rehn, to speak on behalf of the Commission."
". Mr President, we have all seen the latest news about the large-scale job cuts that were announced a few days ago by a major automobile manufacturer."
"The Commission fully understands the worries and sympathises with the workers in Rüsselsheim, Bochum, Trollhättan and elsewhere."
"We are following these developments very closely using the Community competences that are available to us to facilitate better industrial conditions for the car industry in Europe."
"The sector's difficulties stem partly from the general economic downturn over the past few years."
"The low GDP growth rate in the EU has had its repercussions on the car industry too."
"Thus we have seen a decline in sales of motor vehicles and a decline in employment in the automotive industry."
"Therefore, improving general consumer confidence and economic dynamism is also crucial for the demand and sales of cars."
"Competitiveness, economic reform and new industrial policy are now high on the political agenda of the Commission and will receive even more focus in the new Commission."
"We shall also soon learn how Mr Kok proposes to revise the Lisbon strategy to put more weight on higher growth and better job creation."
"In order to be able to better assess the competitiveness of the car industry the Commission has launched a study that we will publish in a few weeks time in the context of our annual competitiveness report."
"The study shows that the automotive industry contributes 6% to our manufacturing employment and 7% to manufacturing output in the Union, making it a major driver in the European economy."
"Its added value and employment have, however, declined between 2000 and 2002."
"A similar development in employment took place in the US and Japan."
"Our analysis of Europe's strengths reveals that, due to the large home market, the European motor vehicle industry is well positioned to exploit economies of scale."
"Moreover, due to the sophisticated demand, EU manufacturers get advance feedback from their customers, which helps them improve product quality."
"Furthermore there is a high innovation capacity and research and development spending amongst the European automotive industry is at least as high as, or higher than, that in the US and Japan."
"In terms of weaknesses, EU productivity is still lower than that in the US and Japan."
"Furthermore there is slow growth in the European home market, which means that as other markets continue to grow the demand advantages from the large European market may diminish over time."
"Compared to the current level of productivity in the Union, the level of labour costs presents a serious challenge for the car industry in some Member States."
"Labour costs per hour in the European Union are still somewhat below those in the United States but significantly higher than those in Japan and especially Korea."
"We can best compete if we can offer better quality, better technology and better services that come with a car."
"This underlines the importance of innovation."
"As has been shown by some manufacturers, an agreement can also be reached with the workforce, aimed at reducing costs."
"For this to happen there has to be a common understanding between management and the workforce as to what objectives are to be achieved."
"Such agreements make sense if they can be used to save employment, to keep manufacturing locations and to make the car industry more competitive."
"With regard to threats, our studies see a danger that major innovations are not stimulated by European regulations."
"Future regulation must therefore take into account the long-term competitiveness of the car industry and the need for manufacturers to be able to sell their products and similar products in Europe and on the whole world market."
"This must be addressed by policies of better regulation, which is a major challenge for both of us, the Commission as well as for Parliament."
"The Commission is currently considering setting up a high-level group to analyse major challenges affecting the automobile sector and to identify ways and means to improve the industrial framework conditions in the sector."
"This high-level group should also focus on the cumulative impact of legislation on the sector's competitiveness."
"It is up to the new Commission to take a position on the setting up of such a group."
"Commissioner Verheugen, or rather Vice-President-designate Verheugen, said at his hearing in front of you in the European Parliament that he is considering setting up such a group."
"I will certainly support him if he chooses to do so."
"In conclusion, the Commission is doing its utmost to offer the best possible industrial and innovative framework conditions for the car industry, for the European automotive industry."
"We need to further develop dialogue in the sector with the main stakeholders involved."
"Moreover, we must revise the Lisbon strategy of growth and employment to revitalise economic dynamism and to strengthen consumer demand on our continent."
"Growth and employment must indeed be put centre stage in all Union activities."
"Has Europe failed as an industrial location?"
"In order to save EUR 500 million, the American General Motors group is seeking to cut up to 12 000 jobs in the EU."
"Our motor industry is a key industry; two million people work in it, with ten million in firms supplying it."
"If it is now being manoeuvred into a crisis, the only thing I want to point out is that in Germany, since 1990, a hundred thousand new jobs have been created in this sector – or has Germany failed as an industrial location?"
"At Opel, in Rüsselsheim, 4 500 jobs are to be cut back."
"The people affected live in my electoral district, and I have met them."
"Fear is in the air."
"After all, they have worked for years already, helping to reduce the costs of the Olympia model."
"Now that negotiations are in progress about shorter working times and wage renunciations, about doing away with night shifts and reductions in staffing levels, the consequences for the firm’s management have to be discussed."
"At Adam Opel AG, there have been six chairmen of the board in five years, trends have been missed, and ranges that are insufficiently innovative or attractive have failed to attract customers, quality has been sacrificed for the sake of short-term cost reduction, thus gambling with the firm’s good reputation, and these things amount to serious errors on the part of the management."
"Now that the attempt is being made to use the restructuring of the motor industry as a pretext for making co-determination an empty concept, that is what I call provocation."
"Workers’ participation has, particularly when times are hard, resulted in consensus, has secured industrial peace and has always been to the benefit of both sides."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats can only hope that the management and the workers’ representatives can get together and hammer out an agreement on their future in Europe."
"In my experience, workers are always willing to accept austerity measures if these keep their jobs safe in the long term."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Social Democrat Members of the European Parliament support the demand made by the workforce of General Motors’ European subsidiaries that no factories should be closed down and that no redundancies should be permitted."
"What, then, lies behind this crisis?"
"It has been brought about by years, if not decades, of high-level mismanagement in the group."
"There was no strategy capable of dealing with Europe, and perhaps the greatest error of all was that there was no strategy for the European internal market, no strategy for European consumers, and no strategy for making use of the knowledge, expertise and skills of the relevant companies’ workers."
"What this very clearly shows is that a change of direction is needed here."
"It has been said, and rightly, that industrial policy must be put back on the agenda for the European institutions."
"A good way of doing this, we think, would be for us now to discuss how to combine General Motors’s subsidiaries in a European Company, but we also urge that the Commission should get more involved, and that we should enter into a dialogue on industrial policy with each sector, one that will facilitate the promotion of innovation in the various industries that are important to Europe."
"We are only just beginning to get to grips with the future of European industrial policy."
"When this House debates the European works councils, we will be reminding you of how important it is that workforces be allowed to speak and that they be involved."
"I have no sympathy whatever with the Liberals and Conservatives who have prevented a joint resolution from emerging from this debate."
"You, ladies and gentlemen, have some lessons to learn!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, both for myself and on behalf of my group, I wish to express our solidarity with Opel’s workers throughout Europe, but I particularly want to support the workers in Bochum who went on strike."
"We believe this to be an appropriate response to the management’s contemptuous attitude, for how else, other than as enormous and profound contempt can one describe it when a company plans mass redundancies, but those at the top do not think it necessary to communicate these plans to the workforce at their highly productive sites, who, instead, have to read of their fate in the newspapers?"
"My colleagues have already said what needs to be said about the management’s mistakes; let us talk about the work that has to be done in this field in the future, including by the Commission."
"If the Commission is elected – which, as things stand today, I do not think it will be – Mr Verheugen, as early as next week, will have to take on the task as part of the Lisbon strategy."
"I do not know if we are actually prepared, politically speaking, for what lies ahead of us."
"I share Mr Bullmann’s misgivings."
"I believe that we are a long way from having forward-looking concepts for the motor – or mobility – industry, where a lot of opportunities for innovation have been missed in recent decades."
"Mr Rehn spoke about research and development policy."
"I very much hope that the new energy crisis really will move European research policy towards enabling us, to have, at some point in the foreseeable future, 1-litre cars, that is to say, the cars of the future, built in German and European factories."
"There are lead markets to be opened up, and we have quite a few possibilities there, but only if we abandon the false outlook we have had to date, of ever-bigger, ever-faster cars at ever-higher prices."
"Being from Lower Saxony myself, I would like to address one particular problem affecting the motor industry there, and in Germany and Europe as well."
"In recent years, the Commission, represented by Commissioner Bolkestein, has repeatedly attacked the VW Act, under which Volkswagen operates."
"It so happens that the Volkswagen Group is a living example of an innovative business culture."
"What the future of co-determination will be like, we see – thanks to the VW Act, at VW, with its jobshares, its wage renunciation, its 5 000 times 5 000."
"These are ideas from which other businesses could well learn, but this ongoing attack on the VW Act, which, in our view, does not constitute an infringement of internal market rules, is also an attack on this exemplary business culture."
"Mr President, I believe I am the only car worker in this Parliament."
"My previous job was in a car factory, so this debate is that much more relevant to myself."
"What we now see is huge pressure for change in the European car industry."
"Factory is pitted against factory and worker against worker."
"It is the metal workers who have to pay the price through having to do less satisfying work at high speed."
"I think that a lot of what is happening is unacceptable."
"It cannot just be a simple matter of making thousands of workers redundant."
"We must demand that companies accept their social responsibility."
"They have a social obligation towards those who work in the factories."
"They should enter into dialogue with authorities and trade unions in order to find solutions, such as shorter working hours, other than laying off the work force."
"What we also see is that the regulations are inadequate."
"Stronger union rights are required, together with intensified cooperation between unions within one and the same company."
"I think it good that the Commissioner mentioned demand in his introduction."
"It is true that demand is too low."
"The question that must also be asked, however is: demand for what?"
"With the high oil price and major environmental problems, it is quite clear that what we need most today is cars that are propelled by something other than petrol, for example ethyl alcohol."
"In this area, we can see how the European car industry in actual fact lags far behind competitors in countries such as the United States and Brazil, which are much further ahead with the work on developing more environmentally friendly vehicles."
"This is one of the sins committed by managements in the European car industry."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the automobile industry is an industry which, more than any other, is dependent upon policies laid down at European level."
"I should like to draw your attention to two key facts, before making two proposals."
"Firstly, the automobile industry is experiencing near-deflationary conditions, as well as being exposed to a competition which is subject to almost no restrictions."
"Secondly, it is one of the mainstays of European industry, generating two million jobs directly and over eight million jobs indirectly, as well as accounting for 24% of research and development."
"It provides a firm guarantee for Europe’s place in the global economy, and yet this industry is under threat."
"Rapid and decisive action must be taken, and my proposals are as follows."
"In the light of the Commission statement, it should be stressed that, since enlargement, only three of the 25 Member States can truly be said to be major forces in the automobile industry, namely France, Germany and Italy."
"It is therefore imperative that the other Member States and the Commission understand the significance of this industrial sector for all of Europe."
"In particular, the European Union should not impose any additional regulatory constraints which are not in strict proportion to actual environmental and safety needs."
"Our prime concern should be to maintain the competitiveness of the European automobile industry."
"By cooperating closely with this industry, we must now move away from the drive to reduce polluting emissions, a task which we are close to achieving, towards a new priority of reducing CO2 emissions."
"The Commission drafts on designs and models are another cause for concern with regard to the future and competitiveness of our automobile industry."
"The reason why the automobile industry is one of the leading industrial sectors in terms of resources allocated to research and development is because it is possible to obtain legal protection for the results of this research."
"Those within the Commission who support an unbridled liberalism should therefore be made to see sense, and our industry must be able to pursue its efforts to modernise and to improve competitiveness without others gaining from the fruits of its labours, in so doing jeopardising jobs in European industry."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I do not intend to repeat what many of the other Members of this House, including Mr Mann, have already said about the automotive industry being one of the most important in Western Europe and the need for it to stay that way."
"It accounts for the direct employment of 1.2 million people but, as the Commissioner stated, is under enormous pressure, not only pressure from growing competition in Asia but also from increasing competition in the ten new Member States."
"The events in Bochum are not an isolated phenomenon;"
"Opel’s sister company in Antwerp is also being hit hard, and, before this, Flanders had been affected by other serious streamlining measures."
"You will be familiar with what happened with the Ford factory in Genk and the closure of Renault in Vilvoorde."
"It follows that the Commission must, as a matter of urgency, come up with a perspective for the automotive industry."
"I am delighted with your reference to the establishment of a high-level group."
"That is, of course, fantastic news."
"The only question is: when for?"
"As time is of the essence, what is the timeframe in this respect?"
"Commissioner, I think we must table very tangible and very ambitious objectives."
"Let me give you an example: by 2015, the European car should be a 100% clean car, one that is 100% safe for the passengers and entails 0% risk also for the soft road users and which, on top of everything else, should negotiate the traffic seemingly automatically."
"Commissioner, there is no harm in a little wishful thinking now and again."
"That is the only way if we want to avoid a kind of competitive situation where the regions of the old Europe, if I can put it this way, are at daggers drawn with the regions of the new."
"Commissioner, I should like to conclude by saying that we should not forget that the automotive industry is still an industry that excites many young people."
"An enthusiastic innovation plan from the Commission will be able to persuade pupils and students to opt once again for technological subjects, with prospects in a high-tech industry, an industry with a bright future, something which I have no doubt we are all in favour of."
"Mr President, we Social Democrats advocate a single strategy for all GM’s sites in Europe."
"In our concern for social responsibility, we always risk being pushed into a corner, and sometimes we allow that to happen, but there are points here that have to do with the economy in the traditional sense of the word."
"Despite that, there are a number of mistakes on the part of the management to be added to the list, to which it had been alerted by the workers’ representatives on various occasions, one such mistake being the fact that, unlike Volkswagen and the Japanese, Opel does not sell its cars outside Europe, in the USA, for example."
"I am not talking here about the top-of-the-range European models that are sold there."
"A further mistake was that materials were bought in cheaply, with the resultant expense of remedial work at weekends."
"New work patterns were introduced abruptly, and the group became over-centralised."
"It is necessary to draw attention to these points, particularly now – and I very much agree with Mr Mann on this – that representatives of industry associations and the ideologues retained by them are hard at work dismantling the types of co-determination that we in Europe introduced as part of our social model, and pronouncing them unsuited to the modern world."
"That being so, I agree with much of what you, Mr Mann, had to say, but why did your group, with its majority in this House, refuse to table a resolution?"
"Perhaps they did not want the substance of what you said to be adopted in this House this week."
"That is a point that must be addressed head-on, for much of what you have said we Social Democrats can agree with."
"It is only embarrassing that your party colleague in Bochum should raise the question of whether the crisis might have been resolved if the regional or local promoters of trade and industry had been able to do something different."
"Those are narrow-minded answers – what we need now is something different!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is nothing new about this: the managers of businesses operating on a global scale always react to crises by laying off workers, but, instead of that, where management has made mistakes, it is those responsible who must be called to account!"
"If the crisis is a result of over-production and problems in accessing the market, it makes no economic sense whatever to give in to demands for wage cuts."
"It is a good thing that the workforce are refusing to be no more than chess pieces for the global players who no longer take it as read that businesses have any responsibilities to society."
"General Motors should remember Henry Ford’s dictum that ‘cars don’t buy cars’, whereby he justified doubling his workers’ wages in order to stimulate demand."
"That is why we need a demand-led economic policy and, at the same time, a different structural policy."
"The European Union has a number of instruments at its disposal, such as the Directives on collective redundancies and on European Works Councils, which are very important, but are, unfortunately, designed as corrective measures, shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted."
"What we need is preventive measures that do not leave everything to the market, all the more so if we want to take the Gothenburg agenda seriously and make development sustainable."
"For that reason we welcome the Commission’s idea of setting up a working party."
"This must, however, also involve a debate on the diversification of production and of services, if regions are not to become dependent on one sector."
"More attention also needs to be given to research and innovation in the field of new products."
"Mr President, let me start by responding to Mr Kuhne."
"We did not want a resolution about this issue, the reason being that, in a resolution, we would be forced to write: ‘We want all Europeans to trade in their cars straight away and make sure that they buy new Opels and Volkswagens’."
"Our economy is not a planned one; it cannot arrange this sort of thing."
"What is happening, quite simply, is that consumer demand is stagnating in our society."
"There is no confidence in the economy, not in Europe and certainly not in Germany."
"That is why fewer cars are being bought, which, in turn, impacts on production."
"Production units are in any case trying to reduce production costs."
"They are computerising, they are relocating plant, and so on. What the cutbacks at Volkswagen and Opel actually illustrate is the need to opt for another route."
"What is that other route?"
"I share your view that we should ask workers to be more flexible in order to ensure that something can be done about working conditions too, but those workers cannot solve the problem on their own."
"Although we have to restore confidence in the economy, the workers in the companies concerned should also receive back-up, not only from governments, but also from social partners, in order to address the problems jointly."
"I am not referring to the labour costs alone, because we have just learned from the Commissioner that labour costs in the EU are still below those in the United States."
"It is mainly the indirect labour costs that are proving pernicious in Europe."
"It follows that we must – and I think that this is also one of the issues – try to reduce the indirect labour costs, and the Lisbon process can play some part in this."
"In my view, along with the high-level group, which I appreciate greatly, we will then need visible results from the studies that are due shortly."
"Credit where credit is due, Commissioner – and I say that also on behalf of our group."
"Mr President, the restructuring in the car industry has been going on for a long time."
"In my own country, Sweden, where the car industry plays an incredibly large role, our big car companies have been bought up by multinational concerns."
"That is the case in Trollhättan, where GM now owns the Saab factory."
"For Trollhättan, this is of huge significance."
"Six thousand people are employed by this industry and a further 6 000 people are dependent on it in a town with a population of approximately 50 000."
"Allow me to state that it is not the workers, but the company, that has, in this case, for a long time been making miscalculations."
"Allow me also to say that I am not an opponent of restructurings."
"My party has always been open to restructurings, but it is important how they are carried out."
"Firstly, they must be carried out with a sense of social responsibility."
"It is not only society that must accept social responsibility, but the companies too."
"The workers must be involved."
"It must not just be a case of informing them of decisions that have been taken."
"They must be actively involved in the restructuring process."
"Workers must not, as happens right now, be played off against each other in different countries by being told that they have to accept poorer social conditions if we are to engage in production."
"We shall not take part in that kind of game."
"A number of people in our country say that we do not need more cooperation at European level, but the opposite is the case."
"We need more cooperation, partly between the union organisations, where there is constructive cooperation between IG Metall and the Swedish Metal Workers’ Union, and partly between politicians and trade unions."
"We also need political cooperation at European level."
"A high-level group that draws up guidelines for industrial policy is a good idea, but we also need the other dimension, namely a review of the European Works Councils Directive and the Collective Redundancies Directive."
"We need to strengthen those directives, so that we strengthen the position of workers when restructuring is carried out."
"Mr President, it is interesting to observe that the Social Democratic representatives from Sweden and Germany, where the car industry has problems, are now leaving it to the EU to find solutions to what are basically problems with their national economies’ competitiveness."
"You should not ask what the EU can do for national industrial policy but what your own national governments can do for Europe’s competitiveness."
"What you are asking sounds the alarm about whether European industry is at all able to hold its own in relation to global competition."
"It is not the case that we now need a European automobile policy."
"We have experience from the seventies when national policies on shipyards were conducted in a long list of different European countries."
"It put a stop to development and led not to jobs being saved, but to capital being wasted."
"What is now needed is a policy that allows European companies to develop their competitiveness."
"It is absurd if we are to have a competition policy within the European Union that makes it difficult for European companies to compete globally in a market in which competition is global."
"When we are concerned with an industry that needs to be competitive globally, the conditions that make it competitive cannot be assessed on the basis of national sub-markets."
"We must now ensure that we conduct a policy that strengthens competitiveness."
"Not one of the proposals presented in this debate in the House would lead to more cars being sold or produced in Europe."
"Instead, they would give rise to false expectations and distract attention from what needs to be done, namely accept changes and restructuring."
"Above all, a Lisbon process is needed that makes European companies competitive and that can give Europe more companies."
"That is what Europe needs, not a European automobile industry policy."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by expressing our firm commitment and solidarity to the workers of General Motors and subsidiary companies who today fear for their jobs, the future of their families and the future of their regions."
"We in the European Parliament must tell them once again today that – as has already been said – we reject forced redundancies and any closures of production plants."
"We also want to demand once again – as has been said here repeatedly – that workers’ rights to information, consultation and participation be strengthened, both at national and at European and multinational level."
"I am aware that the workers of GM are trying to participate in the European committee and trying to anticipate crisis problems, anticipating possible scenarios and in this case it is the management which has done the abandoning and which has made mistakes."
"That is why we are once again demanding that companies’ corporate and social responsibilities be increased, that the Commission not just take the decision to analyse the sector, but also to take measures to ensure that responsibilities towards workers and the territories they work in are met, and we are also demanding more incisive measures in relation to the transparency of decision-making, which we believe has failed in this case."
"Furthermore, in the case of GM, these workers – and I am well aware of this, since this has been the case in the Figueruelas plant, in my region of Aragón – have just signed an agreement in which they have demonstrated a great capacity for negotiation, dialogue, foresight and adaptation to the demands for flexibility, specifically with a view to anticipating cycles, but despite that, the management – not the management in Aragón, but the European management – has once again abandoned them."
"We therefore call on the Commission, as well as the study group, to apply the required social and economic measures which this Parliament has proposed on many occasions."
"Mr President, as a number of colleagues have said, this is nothing new."
"The car industry is probably one of the most competitive manufacturing industries of any that we deal with."
"There are over ten major manufacturers producing cars in Europe and spending billions on research and development."
"It is a competitive market."
"There will inevitably be changes."
"I want to remind colleagues that three years ago one of GM's major plants in the United Kingdom was closed."
"I will read a headline from today's which I picked up on the plane on my way here this morning: 'Car output near record levels'."
"It is likely that in the United Kingdom this year we will produce a record number of cars."
"That record was last broken in 1972."
"The message to the many people who are facing uncertainty in Rüsselsheim, Bochum and Trollhättan – and I have been to some of those plants – is that there is life after restructuring."
"That is why the United Kingdom car industry is doing relatively well."
"I am not complacent about it, but it is a fact."
"We should be reflecting on why General Motors tells us that it needs to save EUR 500 million a year in costs to make itself competitive."
"I am sure it can justify those figures."
"We need to work together."
"That is the message that needs to go out."
"It is impossible to achieve record levels of car output in the United Kingdom with, in many plants, quality and productivity levels that are the best in Europe, without working between managers and the workforce and with dealers and customers."
"As mentioned in Mr Rehn's statement this afternoon, we must encourage the Commission to look at the competitive conditions."
"We do not want an industrial plan for the car industry."
"We do not want the Commission or politicians telling car companies what to do."
"We are in a competitive market."
"But that EUR 500 million will go into the cleaner, safer cars that Europe's consumers want."
"That is the change that is needed."
"Mr President, the errors of management have been sufficiently described, and, rather than enlarge upon them, I want to talk about what we – the Commission, the Council, and also this Parliament – can do."
"We have to get away from making some laws on the environment – albeit very comprehensive ones – followed by laws on the protection and safety of pedestrians and others, and then laws on mobility, while neglecting, as we did in the past, to put together a truly cohesive and uniform strategy for this sector."
"That is what is urgently needed if we are not to be helpless spectators while jobs in European industry are wiped out."
"I believe that we can gain some optimism from what Mr Rehn and Mr Verheugen said in the hearings."
"One cannot but welcome the setting up of a high level group of this sort, but ‘high level’ means not just this or that chairman of this or that company’s board, but also the workers’ representatives; it must involve not just the Commission, but also the European Parliament."
"I think we can find examples of this in shipbuilding too."
"There is just one more thing I would like to say, and that is that what the outgoing Commission, as regards jobs in the motor industry, has covered itself with is not just glory."
"I would cite not only the Volkswagen legislation, but also the Design Directive, as examples of how urgently amendments are needed."
"Mr President, I firstly want to correct Mr Sjöstedt, who said that he is the only car worker here now in this House."
"That is really not the case."
"The member of my cabinet, Mrs Asenius, is a former worker on the assembly line at a car factory in Gothenburg, and I myself worked in the summers and on Saturdays as a spare parts salesman, all of which gives us, I hope, some kind of practical experience of car industry issues."
"I would like to thank honourable Members for their support and sympathy for the workers and for their overall support for the Commission's position."
"I have taken due note of the views expressed and will report them to the present Commission and to the new one."
"Although I cannot comment on specific sectors and their management, it is true that we cannot blame the macroeconomic environment alone."
"Management decisions have also played a role in the current situation in the European car industry."
"Our conclusion, which I think is a very common view in this House and in the Commission, is that we need a new approach to industrial policy."
"This does not mean picking the winners as we did in the 1970s, which often meant, in fact, sustaining the losers, but a dual policy based on a horizontal view of competitiveness, education, innovation, technology, regional policy and so on, combined with a sound sectoral analysis covering various sectors, so that we know what combination of policies is best for each sector."
"I therefore appreciate your support for the consideration of the high-level group, which would, in my view, work in the same way as in the textile sector."
"I take due note of your sense of urgency and will report this to the Vice-President designate, Günter Verheugen."
"I am sure he will take that into account if our appointments are confirmed on Wednesday."
"Mr Belet asked me to dream."
"Yes, I dream about cleaner and safer cars."
"I dream and expect that the European car industry, as well as the public sector, will devote more funds to research and innovation."
"I should like to see the social partners and all stakeholders focus strongly on the competitiveness of this key sector in the European economy."
"This is a very worthy focus for the high-level group, and I trust we will have good cooperation with the European Parliament on these issues."
"The debate is closed."
"We are appalled by the restructuring just announced by GM Europe aimed at cutting 12 000 jobs in the short term in all of its European factories and at reducing structural costs by around USD 600 million per year."
"A few months ago, the General Motors Group, of North America, was said to be planning drastically to reduce its workforce and to make cuts in Opel, Vauxhall and Saab’s European factories."
"As stated in the motion that was recently approved by the workers at Opel Azambuja, in Portugal, GM’s consolidation measures cannot be allowed to continue to damage the workforce. It is the workers who have met the conditions of what is known as the 2001 ‘Olympia Agreement’, while the Board of GM Europe has been carrying out its obligations in a piecemeal and incompetent fashion, by doing business in a confrontational and contemptuous manner."
"GM Europe’s economic success cannot depend solely on importing American brands and American strategies."
"It is essential that production be maintained in various countries in Europe."
"We therefore wish to show our solidarity with and support for the GM Europe factory workers in their fight against redundancies, against the closure of factories and against the violation of collective working agreements. Their rights must be defended."
"The next item is the Commission statement on the consequences of the rise in oil prices on the European economy, agriculture and fisheries."
"I shall give the floor straight away to Mr Almunia."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the price of oil has risen considerably this year, reaching historic highs – in dollars – in nominal terms."
"Its impact on the economy is largely due to the marked rise of recent months, since, if we take account of the evolution of the euro-dollar exchange rate and inflation, the current level of real prices, in euros, is comparable to that of 2000."
"The expectation in the very short term is that the price of a barrel of oil will remain high, due to the greater than expected rise in demand, particularly the demand from the large Asian countries and, in particular, China, and due to a lack of additional capacity to increase supply in the short term and to global and regional political uncertainties, particularly the conflict in Iraq of course."
"The upwards tendency has furthermore been exacerbated by certain speculative movements, attracted by the price volatility resulting from the uncertainty factors I have just mentioned."
"This increase is clearly having a negative impact on growth during 2004 and on the growth forecast for next year."
"The oil price in dollars is now 60% higher than was forecast six months ago, when the Commission published its spring economic forecasts."
"Tomorrow, the Commission will publish its autumn economic forecasts, which include an estimate of the oil price, which of course is greater than the estimate six months ago."
"According to the ECOFIN Directorate-General’s econometric simulations model, if the price of a barrel of oil stays at 50 dollars – and today I believe a barrel of Brent stands at over 51 dollars – the effect would be an accumulated growth loss over three years of almost one point of gross domestic product, if the price of a barrel remains at 50 dollars throughout that period."
"In fact, the economic forecasts the Commission will present tomorrow have been based on the assumption of a higher oil price than in the spring, although it is also the case that, with regard to the estimates of the macroeconomic model, our forecasts for the evolution of the oil price for 2005 and 2006 are slightly more optimistic."
"We are not, therefore, expecting this level of 50 dollars to be maintained, but rather we expect it to decrease gradually."
"Even so, despite this negative impact, the European economies are in a position to endure this price increase, thanks, in particular, to two factors."
"On the one hand, the real price of oil – as I have said – is considerably lower than previous highs."
"Not only is it no higher than that of 2000, but it is also very much lower than the high reached in real terms in 1981 and is also noticeably lower than that reached in 1973, more than 30 years ago."
"Furthermore, the European economies, over the intervening 30 years, have considerably increased their energy efficiency, reducing their dependence on oil when compared to the eighties, which makes us less vulnerable to increases in energy prices."
"In addition to this, the significant changes to the nature of salaries in the European economies, which are now less linked to the evolution of prices, must lessen the secondary effects of the increase in energy prices or inflation, which the President of the European Central Bank has mentioned this afternoon."
"Unlike in previous crises, so far at least, inflation is not expected to increase, despite the increases in oil prices."
"Having said this, we must recognise, Mr President, that certain sectors are being particularly affected as a result of their characteristics and specific circumstances, and I am referring, of course, as does the title of this debate, to agriculture and fisheries."
"The Commission is perfectly aware of the specific difficulties that arise in these sectors as a result of increased fuel prices."
"In both cases, producers in the agricultural and fisheries sectors have little capacity to pass on increases in their costs through their prices."
"There is therefore no doubt about the need for specific action and the Commission, in response to last week’s request from the Eurogroup, has agreed to present the Eurogroup and Ecofin with a report next month on the measures States may take in accordance with the rules of the Treaty, without thereby violating the legislation in force in the field of state aid and respecting the principle which we believe to be essential in the Economic and Monetary Union, which is that individual initiatives by Member States must be coordinated in order to prevent distortions of competition."
"As well as asking the Commission for this report, the Finance Ministers once again emphasised the need not to adopt unilateral measures and for any possibility of measures affecting competition to be dealt with firstly by means of a prior consultation and coordination mechanism."
"Before ending my first speech, I would like, if you will allow me, to stress two elements relating to the European economy in a more general sense."
"Firstly, I should stress that the appropriate polices for ensuring the stability of the energy supply are being adequately applied and coordinated at international, Community and national levels and, naturally, we must make it very clear that there is absolutely no reason to fear problems with energy supply in the industrialised countries, since the current level of strategic oil reserves, both in the United States and in the European Union or in other OECD countries, will allow us to deal with problems with the supply of crude over a long period of time, should they arise."
"It is important to remember this, since the perceived risk of a possible scarcity of crude oil in the future is contributing to high oil prices, and I do not believe this fear to be justified given the way the market operates and the level of strategic reserves."
"Finally, and looking to the future, it is important that we continue with the reforms initiated in the past within the European Union with a view to improving our energy efficiency, because in that way we will improve the capacity of our economies to deal with external economic disturbances, such as this rise in oil prices, and, at the same time, by adopting these energy efficiency measures, we will increase the long-term growth potential of the Union's economies."
"Mr President, I would like firstly to express my regret at the fact that today this House has missed an opportunity to provide the citizens with a package of real solutions to the crisis the price of oil is causing in certain sectors, as our Committee on Fisheries had initially proposed."
"In particular – and the Commissioner has mentioned this – the consequences for the fisheries sector are extremely serious, and neither the Community institutions nor certain Member States, including my own, I regret to say, are taking any measures."
"Our Parliament has decided not take any action either, preferring a mere Commission statement to committing ourselves to a resolution, as proposed by our political group."
"This statement today is of little or no use to fisheries, because we already know Commissioner Fischler’s opinion, which is that we should pass the rises on to the consumer."
"The problem is that the Commissioner – and I am delighted that you have said quite the opposite today, Commissioner – did not know that this solution was impossible for the fisheries sector, since it is governed by a system of Dutch auction."
"The situation is very different, Mr President."
"The oil price crises of 1993, 1994, 2002 and 2004 show that this is not a problem specific to the current situation, but a cyclical problem, and we must work on the basis that cycles will become shorter and shorter, since we are talking about an exhaustible energy source."
"We are, therefore, dealing with a structural deficiency which must be dealt with through structural measures."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is therefore calling for the implementation of a Community instrument which can be mobilised almost automatically during these periods of crisis."
"Furthermore, however, we need urgent measures for supporting the sector until that instrument becomes part of Community legislation; and we propose that these measures include the granting of low-interest or zero-interest loans and setting a maximum price, compensation in line with the real price by means of financial measures and temporary reductions in social and fiscal burdens."
"– Mr President, apart from the obvious concern in every economy, the high price of oil and the present dependence of the world economy on it have started to financially suffocate both households and businesses."
"The present price rise appears not to be simply a short term or speculative rise; on the contrary, it also reflects structural changes which may well result in multiple reviews of the global economy."
"The growth of the Tiger economy and a series of geopolitical factors are among the factors which have caused the present oil-triggered disorder in the economy."
"Consequently, it is not at all impossible that oil prices will stabilise at much higher levels than those which we considered normal in the past."
"For the European Union, the Commission itself has stated that a 25% increase in the price of oil this year will reduce the rate of growth by 0.17%."
"As a result of these negative developments, there is an urgent need for the Commission and the Council to proceed with immediate action and medium term interventions."
"In a period of economic recession, of inflationary pressure and of pressure to re-examine the financial policy of the Stability and Growth Pact and the effectiveness of the support mechanisms for the Lisbon agreement, we cannot confine ourselves, Commissioner, to declarations and statements that, basically, everything is fine."
"The European Parliament would like to re-examine ways and means – there is a detailed analysis of the repercussions of the already enhanced oil prices on economic growth in the individual sectors, such as transport, agriculture, trade and employment."
"First, we should stress that nearly all the budgets of the Member States have been prepared on the basis of an oil price of USD 29."
"Secondly, we should stress the need to configure a stable and effective European framework for dealing with upward trends and sudden fluctuations in oil prices."
"Thirdly, we should stress the need to develop and activate a plan for dealing with the crisis and creating an efficient framework for preventing any crises which may affect the new stability pact."
"Fourthly, we should stress the need to avoid speculative market trends."
"Fifthly, we should stress the need to support vulnerable social groups, as this will mitigate the reduction in their income and prevent their social and economic marginalisation."
"Finally, we need to stress the need for financial support for farm holdings and businesses, which are already bearing the burden of the increase in production costs, which they truly cannot pass on to the consumer."
"I should like in closing to stress that any delay in taking immediate initiatives will contribute to the emergence, as we have seen in the Council, of isolated national measures, and I should like to stress here that different national economic and political approaches must not be allowed to affect the degree of application of unified Community policies."
"Mr President, Commissioner, during the past few months constant increases in the price of a barrel of oil have deepened the crisis affecting the European fisheries sector."
"These increases have a direct impact on wages for crews, as well as on companies’ profit and loss accounts. As you said, these companies can barely, if at all, pass the increase on to the selling price of fish, given the specific nature of this market."
"The previous crisis which occurred ten years ago had an avalanche effect, weakening management and financial structures in the sector and thus seriously jeopardising the economies of affected regions."
"The situation we are facing today is comparable in the economic and social distress it is causing. The governments of the Member States are endeavouring, or will endeavour, to confront this situation by taking measures which comply with Community regulations, as you said."
"These measures, however, can do nothing but maintain the current state of affairs, and they cannot claim to provide an effective and lasting solution to the economic problems caused by high fuel prices."
"The Community approach, which is focused almost exclusively on, and I quote, ‘the sustainable management of fisheries resources to preserve the interests of future generations’, is no longer credible as it stands, as there is a risk that it will result in a situation where the European Union is no longer able to exploit these resources due to a lack of workers experienced in the field."
"Under these conditions, how can we work towards the real goal of our common fisheries policy, which, as I see it, is for it to act in tandem with the common agricultural policy to maintain our continent’s capacity to produce sufficient food?"
"Mr Almunia, my question is that which I prepared with my fellow members of the Committee on Fisheries; will the Commission undertake to act on behalf of the most seriously affected areas?"
"For example, does it intend to put forward proposals to allow measures to be taken under the existing Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance, or under the future European Fisheries Fund, or under any other mechanism, to improve the economic situation and to thus preserve the future of regions which have no real alternative?"
"Mr President, many communities, many families in Scotland are highly dependent upon the fishing industry, an industry which has had massive economic and social pain inflicted upon it as a direct result of political decisions made in Brussels under the common fisheries policy."
"The rocketing cost of fuel could be the final straw for many businesses – and a fishing boat in Scotland very often is a business, a family-run business – which have been forced by the CFP to operate this year for only 15 days each month."
"Some EU governments apparently recognise the exceptional economic pressure which rising fuel prices puts upon the fisheries sector."
"Recently France, supported by at least four other Member States, saw it as a long-term Community mechanism for granting public aid to the sector."
"This initiative was opposed – unsurprisingly – by the UK, citing the need to respect state aid and competition rules."
"I think the real reason for the UK failing to support that proposal was, as usual, that it did not wish for any precedent which might require it to aid its fishing industry – which it never does."
"Mr Fischler, regrettably, was also unsympathetic, apparently saying that fisheries, unlike the agriculture sector, could easily respond to the fuel price increases by increasing fish prices."
"That is all very well, but what about the consumer, and what about the fact that fish products are relatively healthy and are recommended by dieticians to consumers?"
"The agriculture sector in Scotland is also suffering greatly from high fuel costs, not just through the direct use of fuel on farms, but also owing to the excessive cost of sending their produce to distant markets, an economic pressure which the UK Treasury has also added to in the form of unjustly high levels of taxation."
"But it is people and communities and not just businesses that suffer."
"The , the newspaper of the Orkney Islands, reports a 67% rise in the price of fuel leading to an overspend by Orkney Ferries."
"Sometimes in the Orkney Isles, the Shetland Isles and the Western Isles it is normal and indeed essential for people to take two ferries to get to work or to shop."
"This is not just affecting businesses, it is impacting on a whole community."
"– Commissioner, despite the gravity of the situation, all we have heard from you is a mixture of reassuring generalities, wish lists and neo-liberal doctrine."
"Competition must be saved at all costs."
"However, the rise in oil prices places a burden on low incomes and increases the tax revenue of the Member States."
"There are Member States saying we should refund part of our enhanced revenue to low incomes."
"In France in particular, there is talk of tax refunds."
"In Greece, a reduction in the tax collected by the state has been proposed in order to relieve the pressure on low incomes."
"Farmers and fishermen are not satisfied with studies, they want specific measures."
"I should therefore like you to tell us in your reply why the majority rejects the proposals emerging from France or from Greece and when a decision will be taken on specific measures for farmers and fishermen."
"– Mr President, why such panic from Sweden to Greece and from Portugal to Poland?"
"Why has the Commission been caught unprepared?"
"Why have you allowed things to develop in such a bad way for European households, industry and fisheries? Did the Commission not see how much the map had changed over recent years?"
"Did it not see the intervention of the United States?"
"It is controlling Iraq's oil through the invasion."
"It is controlling Saudi Arabia's oil by controlling the royal family. It is controlling Libya's oil by holding Gaddafi hostage."
"It is controlling Venezuela's oil by trying to destabilise Chavez. It is controlling Russia's oil through its customer relations with Putin."
"It is controlling oil and playing games with oil to the detriment of the European Union and to the detriment of China."
"A China desperately in need of oil (one in twelve barrels produced go there) and a Europe which, with its overpriced currency and with oil at USD 55, has particularly unaffordable and expensive goods which no longer even get near the shelves."
"You will see huge problems soon."
"Chryslers will flood Europe; there will be fewer Renaults, fewer Mercedes, fewer Fiats."
"The result will be more American cars and everyone knows what that means for the economy."
"We need to get out of this trap they have set for us as quickly as possible."
"We need to be able to adjust the currency and, above all, we need to be able to take the oil which is ours, oil in Romania and oil in the Aegean which Turkey has blocked."
"If you want cheap oil, it is up to you to pull Turkey into line and to have cheap oil in Europe so that the European people are able to make ends meet."
"Mr President, the facts are as follows: since the beginning of the year, the price of a barrel of oil has increased by 65%, going over the magic figure of USD 50."
"According to the predictions of certain analysts and economists, in the next few months the price may rise to USD 70 or 80 per barrel."
"The results of such an increase include a massive rise in costs in all areas, in particular in transport, agriculture and the areas to which reference has already been made today."
"A further slow-down in economic growth has ensued too."
"This can be estimated using the following simple formula: if the price of a barrel increases by USD 5, economic growth will fall by 0.3%."
"The increase has also resulted in a strengthening of the dollar against the euro and the other currencies of the European Union, as well as in disequilibria in the balance of payments of the major importing countries and, finally, in the European Union becoming less competitive and moving further away from the goals of the Lisbon strategy."
"Polish farmers were delighted to receive their first payments from the Union."
"Unfortunately, they are already aware that these payments will mainly be used not to develop farms, but to cover the cost of increases in fuel and fertiliser prices."
"The world did not anticipate these price rises, and the European Union did not anticipate them either when it planned its long-term policy consisting of programmes for the replacement of natural fuels by alternative and renewable fuels."
"Rapid measures should be taken to amend and accelerate the 2000 programme in the same way that America has done in the case of biofuels, with the country now using 10% biofuels in petrol and producing 70 million tonnes of them every year."
"A further example is that of the German economy and the production of electricity."
"Particular encouragement should be given to the production of biofuels, an increase in which would be the simplest and quickest way to limit imports."
"That would improve the European Union’s balance of payments both by increasing the number of jobs in rural areas, by accelerating the development of the much-feted multifunctional agriculture and also by raising profitability in agriculture, making it independent of the suffocating support system of subsidies."
"Now is the time for us to make a rapid change of policy to one that makes us independent of price rises, oil imports and excessive greenhouse gas emissions, and now is the time for us to choose the path of environmental protection."
"Mr President, the rise in fuel prices affects many sectors of the European economy, and in particular transport-related sectors."
"Yet it is clear that the primary production sectors, such as agriculture and fisheries, are facing the most acute problems."
"This illustrates the unsatisfactory nature of our debate, in which we have bitten off more than we can chew. We should therefore focus on these two subjects."
"It is the fisheries sector which faces the most serious difficulties, and there are one or two extremely simple reasons for this."
"Within a little over one year, fishermen have seen the price of diesel oil double, with approximately one litre of fuel needed to catch one kilo of fish."
"This is why, together with the other Members of this House, I was quite literally shocked and appalled at the statements made by the Commissioner for Fisheries, in which he said that one need only pass the rise in the price of fuel on to the price of fish in order to solve the problems."
"This is of course impossible, and it is an example of the very kind of flawed reasoning which will dissuade consumers from buying fish, the very food we wish to promote."
"In my opinion, one of the lessons learnt from the crisis of 1993-1994, which caused a widespread breakdown of structures, was that extremely rapid action will be needed."
"The proposals we have just heard, in particular those put forward by Mrs Fraga and by the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, Mr Morillon, include placing a ceiling on the cost of diesel oil, reducing financial, social and tax costs and, most importantly, providing monetary advances which correspond to the needs of fishermen experiencing very serious problems, of whom there are already a large number."
"This is why we look to the Commission to adopt a position which is both easily understood and which is designed to prevent the breakdown of structures in areas which are heavily dependent on fishing."
"In other words, there is a need for both measures taken at European level during crisis periods and national measures adapted to local situations."
"Mr President, what I have noted today in this House, in particular, is the absence of the Commissioner responsible for the two sectors – agriculture and fisheries – who should be taking the initiative to propose measures to alleviate the negative impact of the rise in oil prices on two sectors which are unquestionably his responsibility."
"These are two strategic sectors in terms of maintaining jobs and of the Union’s food supply."
"As Commissioner Almunia has acknowledged, both sectors have difficulties passing the rise on through their prices, something which Mr Fischler appears not yet to have understood."
"I believe that it is our duty – and the Commission's duty – to act diligently in crisis situations."
"In this respect, I would like to say to Commissioner Almunia that we do not want to return to the scenario of 2000, when the Commission decided to declare the State aid received by those professionals illegal and demand that it be returned."
"Such a situation would damage the credibility of the institutions, not just the Community institutions, but national institutions as well."
"In this regard, I agree with the Commissioner on the need to adopt a mechanism capable of responding to the situation at Community level, since it is endangering two of our most sensitive production sectors."
"I do not think it is asking too much to wait for a month if that allows us to create an appropriate Community framework capable of establishing the scope and duration of any measures adopted by either the European Union or the different Member States, this being the only way, we believe, to prevent any problems of distortions of competition which could arise if each Member State adopts them individually."
"Mr President, the price of agricultural fuel has risen by 40% since the beginning of this year."
"If we consider a case I know well – that of Spain – this rise has led to very great losses for producers and no national compensation measures have been put in place to alleviate them in good time."
"The Spanish farmers are very concerned about the Spanish Government’s failure to act in this respect."
"Last week a draft was presented in this House calling for a parliamentary resolution in favour of long-term measures aimed at reducing the farmers’ dependence on diesel."
"The draft – the only one I have seen in relation to agriculture – was not accepted, which I believe can be interpreted as a lack of solidarity on the part of this House towards the farmers, one of the two sectors – together with the fisheries sector – which are least protected against price rises because in neither case can producers pass this increase on through their prices."
"In order to resolve this problem, I propose five measures: firstly, the Member States should take measures in a coordinated fashion in order to prevent distortions of competition between neighbouring countries; secondly, the European Commission should be as benevolent as possible when authorising national aid; thirdly, the European Union, once and for all, should give mature consideration to the resources available to deal with the crises which have been arising for years – let us remember 1993-1994, 2000 and that all these years in which oil prices have risen have been devastating for producers; fourthly, in relation to the issue which was aborted in the Conference of Presidents last week, I proposed calling on the European Union to bring forward the report it has to produce on aid for fuel production with a view to revising the Community legislation as soon as possible, in order to reduce the dependence of farmers and the European Union on oil; and fifthly, as a final measure, I also propose that this Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture produce a report with a view to seeking viable long-term solutions."
"I would like to comment on the subject from the viewpoint of the countries with poor energy sources."
"The increase in the price of oil has resulted in general price rises in our country too."
"As a consequence, economic growth has slowed down, the budget situation has become uncertain and agricultural competitiveness has deteriorated because, unfortunately, the agriculture of countries with poor energy sources consumes a lot of energy, and employment and social achievements thus become jeopardised."
"Living costs increase and poverty deepens."
"It is a sad picture."
"The unreasonably high oil price endangers global economic growth, and I can only emphasise what Commissioner Almunia said, that the main reason for price increases, namely international speculation, must be dealt with."
"A combined European effort is needed not only for this, but also for turning the dream of a welcoming Europe into a reality, despite the problems."
"In a collective effort, the institutions of the European Union must therefore help prevent crises brought about by price increases."
"They need to increase the proportion of renewable energy so that they become more independent of the oil market."
"Furthermore, they must help create an observation system that analyses the oil price movements and determines the strategic level of oil reserves."
"All this is planned for the future by László Kovács, Commissioner-designate, whose expertise has been called into question by some people in this House."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the continual rise in oil prices is again bringing home to us our economic dependency on third states."
"We must never forget that crude oil has been, and still is, the cause of many economic conflicts, not to mention the detrimental effects that its extraction, processing and use have on the environment."
"Nor must we ever forget that we are dealing here with a finite resource."
"It is high time for Europe to free itself from economic dependence on oil imports."
"High oil prices have an adverse effect on agriculture and mean substantial losses of income for our farmers."
"The targeted use of renewable energies is now more necessary than ever before; not only does the use of renewable raw materials significantly help to protect the environment, but it also offers new alternative sources of income for our farmers."
"Above all else, though, it is the right way to become self-sufficient in energy, so we have to push for the voluntary Europe-wide admixture of biofuels, which is a half-hearted solution, to be made mandatory."
"In this Directive, the interests of the oil industry have prevailed to a large extent, while the goals of the Kyoto Protocol, more secure income for our rural areas and an opportunity to create more jobs, including in the outermost regions, have lost out."
"Commissioner, our responsibilities to future generations demand of us that we press for the more efficient promotion and mandatory admixture of renewable energies right across Europe."
"If now is not the time to do this, then when is?"
"So, equipped with new and smart energies, let us go on the march into the future!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the price of oil is still lower now than it was at the beginning of the eighties, but that has not taught us to conserve."
"Fuel prices seem to follow fluctuations in the exchange rate of the US dollar, at present the currency of a country at war."
"Why do we not quote these prices in euros, as Mr Karlsson proposed in his report?"
"Unfortunately, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats overturned the report on emergency supplies in this House a little under a year ago."
"Perhaps the present energy problems in the United States and Europe have woken us up."
"The unstable situation in Africa, the Middle East and Russia has resulted in problems in the supply of oil."
"Not only ourselves, but the United States, Japan, China and India all compete for Russian oil."
"We must ensure that we have a steady fuel supply."
"Member States should prepare for long periods of high prices by introducing interim fiscal solutions, stockpiling supplies, which we need, exploiting new sources of energy, and reduced and more efficient consumption."
"When Mr Karlsson’s report was overturned, Parliament called on the Commission to draft a new proposal on the matter."
"When does the Commission intend to put this proposal forward?"
"It is obviously necessary for us to reduce our dependence on oil and develop new energy sources."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rise in oil prices is having an undeniable impact on the European economy, agriculture and fisheries."
"It would be hard to think of a more topical issue."
"Today, for example, we have heard about farmers making it difficult to store and refine oil in France, where they are demanding, in a typically French way, complete exemption from tax on fuel used in agriculture."
"Also in the news too the critical stage which the industrial dispute in the Norwegian oil industry has reached, and that has put up the price of crude oil in the Nordic countries."
"Examined in historical context, the current price of oil per barrel, which is more than USD 55, easily exceeds the 40 dollar level, which it was thought would significantly slow down global economic growth."
"If current price levels are maintained, forecasts for the global economy may well have to be adjusted downwards."
"If the situation continues for a long time, it will also become a problem for us."
"For now, however, we should keep our composure."
"The long-term rise in oil prices is not just the result of recent events, but of strong economic growth in China and the countries of South-East Asia, which in itself is a positive thing."
"Low stocks in the United States and political instability in the Middle East have also had an impact."
"Furthermore, when we consider the American presidential elections and many other political factors, such areas of speculation have now contributed to price pressures, although they are not directly linked to any real oil shortage."
"The only means by which we can have an effect on the price of oil or any other form of energy in the long term is to ensure that European energy policy is sufficiently diverse in scope."
"Specifically, we need to support a diverse energy mix that includes all the main forms of energy, especially nuclear power."
"Dependence on oil is also a very difficult issue from the point of view of relations with Russia, as Mr Paasilinna, for example, has just said."
"Russia sells energy wherever it can obtain the best price for it, and China and India, as major consumers, have the advantage over Europe here."
"We should not, therefore, rely on imported energy."
"Instead, we must ensure that we produce a greater proportion of our energy in Europe ourselves, at a reasonable cost, and in a way that is environmentally sustainable."
"Mr President, I would like to make a few comments in response to the speeches made during the debate and point out that I entirely agree with many of the arguments and opinions expressed."
"Firstly, with regard to the assessment of what is happening and of what is going to happen in relation to the evolution of oil prices and its impact on the European economy in general."
"I believe we must insist once again on the need to be realistic when assessing this impact, and in the case of this crisis, of this rise in the oil price, which is very significant in terms of dollars, the impact on European economies is much less significant than in previous crises."
"We must not, therefore, exaggerate the general impact on the economy, despite the particularly noticeable and socially painful consequences for certain specific sectors."
"Secondly, I believe we must be prudent when assessing the possible evolution of the oil price, by making judgments on what that evolution may be."
"It is true that some economists are talking about 60 and 70 dollars, but it is also true that the futures markets are operating on the basis of a reduction of the current level of 50 dollars per barrel and that the market operators are, therefore, not anticipating further rises in the petrol price, but rather a tendency over the next two years for the market situation to moderate, given that, as some of you have said, the proportion of the rise in the oil price over recent months does not correspond either to the objective situation of supply and demand in the market nor to the other geopolitical factors influencing the situation, but to speculative operations which cannot be maintained permanently over time."
"We therefore need to be prudent and realistic when assessing a situation which, in any event, is not a positive one and which, as I said at the beginning, and as many of you have repeated, has a negative impact on growth and on the evolution of prices."
"Thirdly, I entirely agree with those of you who have insisted on the need to continue moving ahead in relation to our energy efficiency and on policies to reduce our dependence on oil as an energy source."
"I believe that the European Union has made significant advances in this respect over the last 20 or 25 years and that we must continue to make progress in this direction and intensify where necessary – and I believe it is clearly necessary in relation to certain aspects – common actions at European level in relation to energy policy."
"By way of example, while I said earlier that, if the price of a barrel of oil remains at 50 dollars over the next two years, until the end of 2006, this would have an impact on the European Union’s economy of a reduction in growth of around one point, the impact on the United States’ economy would be much greater, because their level of dependence on oil as a primary energy source is much greater than that of the European Union countries."
"And of course, given that the impact of oil prices is negative, but is not spread equally across the different sectors of our society or the different production sectors, as many of you have pointed out, it is clear that we need to redistribute our efforts in order to deal with the situation of the sectors suffering most from the rise."
"And the majority of you who have referred to this unequal distribution of efforts have referred, quite rightly, to the fisheries sector, firstly, and also to agriculture."
"According to which rules and within which framework should we deal with this distribution of efforts or this particularly intense compensation in the sectors most suffering as a result of the rise in oil prices?"
"I would like to repeat three criteria."
"Firstly, attention must obviously be paid to the principle of coordination – it benefits nobody to take unilateral measures at national level on issues which should be decided at European level, whether by the Ecofin Council or by the Agriculture Council."
"On the 18th, the Agriculture Council began to analyse this issue and in the first debate the positions of the different Member States were not unanimous."
"It is, therefore, true that the Commission must draw up initiatives and the new Commission – which I hope is confirmed next Wednesday – as the honourable Members are aware, will not just have a new Commissioner for Agriculture, but also a Commissioner specifically dedicated to fisheries, Mr Borg, and a new Commissioner for Energy, as the honourable Member said."
"In addition to the Commission's initiatives, however, a consensus must be created at Council level both in terms of coordination, which is the responsibility of the Ecofin Council when it comes to measures of a fiscal nature, and in terms of any measures which may be adopted at the level of the production sectors, which were discussed during the first debate on the 18th."
"There was no full agreement amongst the Member States."
"Finally, we are all aware that we are going to have to continue discussing this issue over the coming months, but I will repeat what I said at the beginning. We must do so in the knowledge that, structurally, the oil market is never going to be what it was ten, twenty or twenty-five years ago, amongst other things because there are new energy consuming countries with extraordinary economic potential and with a very high level of growth, but the direction taken by European energy policy is the right one and we must not change that direction but rather enhance it."
"The debate is closed."
"The price of a barrel of oil has exceeded the psychological barrier of USD 50."
"Although this figure is fluctuating, the tendency is upwards."
"This rise is the result of a complex series of factors, including the invasion of Iraq, political and social instability in some of the big exporting countries, natural disasters, increased demand in countries with large populations and strong economic growth, and also speculation."
"The International Monetary Fund says that a USD 8 per barrel rise will cause a 0.5% fall in economic growth. Consequently, whilst the downturn is not as severe as that of the seventies and eighties, the risks to the world economy and to its much-trumpeted upturn are enormous."
"The first sectors to be affected by these oil price rises have been transport, fisheries and agricultural. These sectors, particularly the last two, are already severely depressed."
"Accordingly, Community restrictions on direct public aid to the sectors affected should be lifted, and measures should be taken and practical support provided at EU level in order to minimise the socio-economic impact of oil price rises."
"The key issue, however, is much broader and more structural, and is due to the fact that the world’s economy has never resolved the problem of its dependence on a resource that is finite and subject to speculation."
"– The increase in international and national oil prices is the result of the all-out attack by big business in its quest for greater profit and it directly affects the income of grass-roots families."
"The consequences of this increase will be felt in particular by poor households during the winter, unless there are direct measures to provide them with financial support to cope with heating bills."
"The spiralling increase in the price of 'black gold' is leading to a new, general wave of increases in the prices of widely consumed goods, on top of the constant price rises which have significantly eroded workers' incomes."
"At the same time, the profits of the multinationals operating in the sector are multiplying at a rapid rate, the concentration and centralisation of capital is intensifying, to the detriment in particular of small and medium-sized enterprises and capital restructurings are being reinforced."
"The increase in the consumption of energy in developing countries and the wars and escalations which the monopolies themselves cause are a pretext for increasing prices."
"The real reason lies in the exploitation of productive resources for the benefit of the plutocracy and in the strengthening of it within a climate of generalised privatisation."
"The only response to high prices is to be found in the fight of the workers against this barbarity and for radical change and for energy and other strategically important sectors to become the assets of the people and satisfy the contemporary needs of the workers."
"(1)"
"Mr President, it is rather strange that we are being asked to approve this urgent procedure."
"After all, just a few days ago the Commission made appropriate and indeed important amendments to the proposal on the Agency."
"To make things simpler, the same can be said of the Council’s second request for urgent procedure concerning support for the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community, because in both cases the Council and the Commission have only just tabled significant new proposals."
"The committee will deal with these matters this evening, but in both cases and on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I should like to recommend that at this stage the request for urgent procedure be rejected."
"Mr President, as you know this vote will decide on the request for two urgent procedures concerning macro-financial assistance, one to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and the other to Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"The two referrals are proposals for decisions aiming merely to extend the current expiration date of the financial packages, which are due to expire on 9 November 2004."
"Yesterday the Committee on International Trade – the committee responsible for both referrals – held an extraordinary meeting to decide on the request for urgent procedure."
"I would like to inform you, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, that it decided by a wide majority to accept the request for urgent procedure in both cases."
"It also adopted the report on these two referrals through simplified procedures."
"We believe that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Bosnia should not pay for problems in the handling of internal EU procedures."
"However, before proceeding to the vote, I would call on the Commission not to abuse the urgency procedure, but use it only as a last resort and to always inform Parliament as soon as possible through the appropriate channels."
"I regret to note that Parliament was not properly informed about the possibility of an urgent procedure in this case."
"The handling of the case dossier, and the communication with Parliament, took place late and did not follow the appropriate channels."
"I hope this will not be repeated."
"That being said, and on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, I wish to advise my colleagues to accept the requests for urgent procedure so that Parliament can adopt the committee's opinion on Thursday and so that the Council decision can be amended to allow the foreseen allocation of financial aid to Bosnia and Yugoslavia."
"– Mr President, we are very much in favour of this and support the request for urgent procedure."
"I simply wished for form’s sake to point out that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia no longer exists."
"It is Serbia and Montenegro – a small point, but one that is regarded as very important, particularly in that part of the world."
"That concludes the votes on requests for urgent procedure."
"As Mr Barroso, President-elect of the European Commission, has not yet arrived, we shall suspend the sitting for a moment."
"The next item is the statement by Mr Barroso, President-elect of the European Commission."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, here we are at a decisive stage of this important democratic process, the establishment of the new European Commission."
"In June, a consensus of the Heads of State or Government nominated me as President of the Commission."
"On 22 July, Parliament gave me its confidence with a large majority."
"I thank you for the honour that you bestowed on me."
"I then put together my team, with the Council’s agreement and based on the nominations by the Member States."
"I also decided how responsibilities would be shared out among the Commissioners-designate and the main features of the new Commission’s internal organisation."
"Throughout this period I kept in constant contact with Parliament and I had the opportunity to meet all of the Members of the Council, except those Heads of Government of countries in which elections were held recently."
"I appear before you today, ladies and gentlemen, to request approval for the future college."
"This Commission is a team with a number of positive features: it contains more women than in any previous Commission; it contains representatives of the main political streams in Europe, Christian democrats and people’s parties, socialists and social-democrats, liberals and democrats; it contains people with extensive political experience, at both European and national level."
"All of the Members of the future Commission are committed to defending and promoting our Union’s interests, and are aware of their joint responsibility towards Parliament."
"In its internal operation, the Commission will be guided by complete compliance with the principle of collective accountability."
"As I said to you in July, and in accordance with your wishes, there are definitely no first-class or second-class Commissioners in this college."
"It is also true that, broadly speaking, the Commission that I now propose to you has been received very favourably by the general public in Europe."
"All the men and women in this Commission have attended hearings in the parliamentary committees."
"This procedure, which has no parallel in the Member States, is an example of democracy in action at the heart of the European institutions."
"Your hearings have revealed a broad consensus between Parliament and the future Commission."
"In the vast majority of cases, Parliament's verdict has been positive."
"In a few cases Parliament has identified weaknesses and asked for a response from me."
"At the Conference of Presidents last week, I gave my reactions to the letters from the parliamentary committees."
"Today I wish to clarify my position on the most important points, without going into details of the undertakings I have already given, and provide you with the additional steps I am ready to take."
"In a specific case of a potential conflict of interest, I gave the strongest possible guarantees that the Commission's work in the field of competition policy will not be affected."
"These guarantees are based on rules and procedures that are a matter of public record."
"The Commission will always carry out its responsibilities in the area of competition impartially, independently, transparently and with assiduity and expertise."
"Some doubts have been expressed about the mastery of the details of certain complex and technical portfolios, such as energy."
"I can assure you that I have absolute confidence in the political skills of the Commissioners-designate and their ability to absorb and defend their brief, however technical."
"In the case of the criticism levelled against one Commissioner-designate, relating to her former political career, I would remind you that this concerns allegations which can be dealt with under existing national control procedures, including judicial investigation."
"At this point, no accusations have been made against this Commissioner-designate and she therefore retains my confidence."
"I expect all Members of the Commission to meet the highest ethical standards and to comply fully with the Code of Conduct."
"Let me say once again that I intend to use all the powers that the Treaty confers on me to ensure that this is indeed the case."
"I will not hesitate to demand the resignation of any Member of the Commission who is manifestly not up to the job or who fails in the duties imposed upon him or her by the Treaty."
"This also holds for cases brought up by Parliament, which I will actively consider before taking a final decision."
"All the Members of the Commission have undertaken to tender their resignation if I ask for it."
"Obviously this also applies to any possibility of a reshuffle during the mandate of the next Commission."
"Once the Commission is approved by this Parliament, I will have the power to make the adjustments I may deem necessary."
"The verdict on Mr Buttiglione's performance at one of the hearings he attended was positive, and at another hearing it was negative."
"Following this hearing, I asked him for a clear explanation of his position."
"He replied in writing, expressing his regret and reaffirming his commitment to the principle of non-discrimination."
"I, for my part, would never accept anyone in my Commission who defends positions that are not compatible with the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"I am sure that Mr Buttiglione will fully comply with the Treaty and the Charter and I can confirm that the rest of the Commissioners-designate share my view."
"However, one good thing will have come out of this unfortunate incident: it has highlighted the importance we attach to decisive political action by the European Union in the fight against all forms of discrimination."
"For this I must thank Parliament."
"This debate enables us to move from words to substance, and about substance no doubts are allowed."
"This Commission will give civil rights and anti-discrimination policy top priority."
"I have already told the Conference of Presidents – and I confirm this today to you – that I intend to create a group of Commissioners responsible for fundamental rights, anti-discrimination and equal opportunities."
"This group, which I will chair, will monitor all Commission action and measure initiatives in these areas."
"It will also act as the political driving force."
"This group will not be a talking shop."
"It will ensure that the action by the Commission in promoting fundamental rights and fighting against all forms of discrimination is cohesive."
"It is my intention to set an ambitious agenda for this group."
"I will be ready to discuss it with you and to ask for your suggestions."
"Already I can announce that I will make use of the results of a public consultation aimed at facilitating the creation of a European fundamental rights agency, which will take as its starting point the current Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia in Vienna."
"I will await Parliament's contribution before presenting a legislative proposal on this matter."
"I also intend to initiate work with a view to a framework directive on the basis of Article 13 of the European Community Treaty, which will replace the directives adopted in 2000 and extend them to all forms of discrimination."
"Currently, these directives have a limited scope."
"With the framework directive, Community action will cover all areas of discrimination, including discrimination on the grounds of gender or sexual orientation."
"With this initiative, I am simply confirming even more clearly what has, from the very beginning, been one of the features of this Commission: that its very composition, with eight women in the college, affirms its determination to combat discrimination."
"Lastly, I intend to launch a programme and an action plan to combat discrimination with particular reference to all forms of anti-Semitism, racism and xenophobia."
"In this connection the future Commission will commit itself to relaunching negotiations on a framework decision on racism and xenophobia, which has been blocked in the Council for far too long."
"All these initiatives, and others that might be considered by the group of Commissioners or suggested by you, will be prepared under my authority."
"I am prepared to present them to you in person when the time comes – not just in plenary but, if necessary, in the relevant committee."
"Let me make it very clear that I will personally assume full control of our action in the fight against discrimination and the promotion of fundamental rights."
"So, as you see, I have listened carefully to Parliament's opinion."
"I have taken into consideration your major concerns and objections and have provided substantive replies."
"Some of you would have liked a more radical response and a reorganisation of the team, but is that a real option at this stage?"
"All the information I have, after careful consideration and extensive consultation, makes me think that changing the portfolios at this stage of the procedure would cause more political and interinstitutional problems than it would solve."
"We should bear in mind that this process involves not only the President-designate and Parliament but also the Council, as a third and very relevant partner."
"My team may not be considered perfect by all of you, but is there any team in any of our national governments that we can consider perfect?"
"However, it is recognised by many to be, on the whole, a very strong and balanced team."
"I am convinced that we can do our job in the service of Europe and its citizens, under the political monitoring of this Parliament."
"It was a great honour for me to receive your support and confidence in July by a very large majority."
"I ask you now to support the solution I am proposing, as it is you who best serve the interests of the European Union at this point."
"You will be able to judge the President and all the Members of the Commission later in the light of their actions and not just their words."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in July, I announced to you my intention to build a partnership for Europe – a partnership for prosperity, solidarity and security."
"In order to achieve this, the new Commission must tackle some major issues, both at internal and international level."
"It must meet the expectations of European citizens."
"Fundamental institutional changes await us in the years to come, when the Constitution enters into force – as the Commission hopes it will – after it has been ratified by all of the Member States."
"We must prepare for those changes."
"We must also explain, clearly and objectively, to people the many advantages of the Constitution over the current Treaties."
"This Constitution will significantly enhance both the democracy and the effectiveness of the European Union."
"It will provide the EU with the appropriate instruments to address the actual needs and expectations of Europeans more effectively."
"The main task of achieving ratification at national level naturally falls to the Member States, in accordance with the procedures laid down in their internal legal orders."
"The future Commission, however, is more than ready to work with the Council and with Parliament to set up a common communication strategy."
"The EU must place growth at the heart of its activities. Europe needs more growth, more jobs, more entrepreneurial spirit, more innovation and more research."
"It must achieve reforms that foster economic dynamism."
"It must invest in education and training, knowledge and technological development, so as to be a genuinely knowledge-based economy that is up to speed with the increasingly tough demands of international competitiveness."
"Those reforms and that spirit of constructive change must form part of a sustainable development strategy that takes up the challenge posed by climate change and that appropriately addresses the issues of energy, transport and protection of the environment."
"To this end, we must redouble our efforts at both internal and international level, in our quest for a coordinated strategy within a multilateral framework."
"The Russian Federation’s ratification of the Kyoto Protocol is a tangible success of the multilateral strategy for the environment, which bodes well for the future."
"A more dynamic and more competitive Europe must go hand in hand with maintaining the European social model, and I would add that a more dynamic and more competitive Europe is the only one in which we will be capable of completely safeguarding this model."
"We must also bear in mind that, in some of our countries, we are still a long way from a genuinely fair level of social protection."
"Competitiveness, cohesion and solidarity must progress in tandem."
"It is clear that cohesion policy and actions aimed at creating a more competitive and more dynamic European economy are intrinsically linked and complement one another."
"The new Member States in particular expect us all to make an effort in terms of cohesion and solidarity."
"I am convinced that solidarity is a core value and abandoning it would endanger the character of our societies."
"Solidarity – between generations, between members and groups of our societies, between Member States and regions – is not an abstract value."
"It is a wise choice, which fosters social cohesion and which requires both political commitment and the appropriate financial resources."
"Our European Union is not only an economic area; it is also a fully-fledged area of freedom, security and justice."
"The Commission attaches the highest importance to implementing common policies in the areas of asylum and immigration – fair and balanced policies that are intended to promote economic and social integration for third-country nationals, policies that respect every individual’s cultural identity and the core values of European society."
"In this area, cooperation with third countries is crucial."
"I must state that I am opposed to setting up ‘camps’ outside the EU."
"The Commission will cooperate more extensively with third countries in order to help them deal with migratory flows."
"Partnership with third countries is only possible if based on a joint undertaking and in compliance with international law."
"Let me be clear on this point: the future Commission will work with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees to build international cooperation in this field."
"It will urge those third countries that are our partners to sign up to and comply with the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees."
"This new Commission will also continue to work towards strengthening the security of us all, whilst respecting their civil liberties, to meet the tough challenges posed by the threat of terrorism."
"The EU must play its full role on the international stage."
"It has important responsibilities and must be a strong and credible partner."
"It must continue to foster peace and stability and to strengthen the multilateral dimension in a wide range of areas."
"We must strengthen relations with third countries and with regional organisations."
"Cooperation with the United States must be based on a relationship of equals and on deep mutual understanding."
"The election of a new US President, at the same time as the new Commission takes up its duties, gives us the opportunity to restore the transatlantic axis, regardless of the election result."
"I firmly believe that the United States is ready to contribute towards setting up a more balanced relationship with Europe."
"Whilst we want the United States to take a more multilateral approach, we must also, on our side, carry out our activities with greater unity and effectiveness."
"We shall continue the process of enlarging the EU to include the candidate countries."
"Our neighbourhood policy is also something that we see as a priority, a powerful tool in the EU’s external relations that will enable us to build stronger partnerships."
"I believe that our continent stands a much greater chance of lasting peace with an enhanced stability policy in Eastern Europe, the Balkans and the Mediterranean countries."
"I feel that development policy is essential for greater cooperation with the parts of the world that need our support and our assistance."
"Ladies and gentlemen, next January, I shall appear before you in this House to present the EU’s strategic priorities."
"This will not solely concern the Commission’s legislative and work programme for 2005."
"My intention is to give the strategic programme a broader outlook."
"In the spirit of the Constitution, I shall present to you the priorities for the next five years."
"My aim is to reach an agreement on long-term programming with Parliament and the Council, and in so doing, I shall be addressing one of the main concerns expressed by Parliament."
"In July I told you of my wish to establish positive cooperation between Parliament and the Commission."
"I strongly believe that the Commission’s strength and credibility lie in Parliament’s support and in active cooperation between our two institutions."
"I have studied carefully Mr Borrell’s proposals on relations between our two institutions."
"I await your resolution with interest and I am ready to respond most openly during tomorrow’s debate."
"Let me say straight away that I am in favour of transparency and cooperation between our two institutions."
"I hope that, as soon as the new Commission takes up its duties, negotiations will get underway between our two institutions aimed at introducing the necessary changes to the framework agreement."
"Europe needs fruitful cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, the two institutions that are always at the forefront of the European project."
"Ladies and gentlemen, an event of historic importance is almost upon us – the Constitutional Treaty is set to be signed in a few days, on 29 October."
"This is not a simple matter of revising the existing Treaties; it is the culmination of a long process involving Parliament, the Member States, the Commission, the national parliaments and civil society, aimed at making the EU more democratic, more transparent and more efficient."
"As the representatives of the peoples of our enlarged Europe, you are aware of the magnitude of the European citizens’ expectations."
"You are aware of the apathy and the scepticism that are affecting European democracy."
"You are aware, as I am, of populist threats coming from people who wish to weaken Europe and who always seek to call into question the credibility of our institutions."
"We must not give them any fresh arguments to use against us."
"This is a momentous time for our countries and for the EU."
"I have shared with you the principles that have guided the composition of my Commission and I have shared with you my intention to work closely with you throughout the next five years, so as to promote prosperity, solidarity and security."
"We have no time to lose; the time has come to take action and to work together for the benefit of the citizens."
"Let us devote our energies to promoting growth, jobs, harmonisation and the Lisbon strategy, to strengthening a dynamic knowledge-based economy and to promoting greater cohesion in our enlarged Europe."
"This Commission is worthy of your confidence and deserves your support."
"I appeal to your sense of responsibility."
"I appeal particularly to your European commitment to express your confidence in this college."
"We can build a stronger Europe on the foundations of this relationship of mutual respect and confidence."
"The representatives of the political groups and the other scheduled speakers are now going to speak."
"I must inform you all that this debate must end by noon because that is when Her Majesty the Queen of the Netherlands will come into the Chamber. The Chairman will therefore have to strictly monitor adherence to speaking times."
"I am warning you of this so that the speakers can bear it in mind and so that the Chairman does not have to resort to turning off microphones."
"Mr President, Mr President-elect of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, on 22 July, and by a large majority, Parliament expressed its confidence in the President-elect of the European Commission."
"Today you are here with the team that has been proposed to you by the national governments."
"Mr President-elect of the Commission, you have expressed your willingness to cooperate very closely with the European Parliament, and, while we welcome this, we will also take you at your word in the future."
"We also very much welcome the further commitments you have entered into today."
"We welcome your desire to be the President of a strong Commission, and several times you have mentioned the responsibility that you, as President, will have for determining overall policy."
"That too is in our interests, for we need a Commission with a strong President, such as the European Union has enjoyed in the past."
"Our group has tabled a motion for a resolution."
"It is regrettable that the groups could not agree on a joint motion, but ours will be the yardstick for monitoring the Commission."
"We expect the new Commission to agree its political and strategic programme in close cooperation with Parliament and we expect the Commission to be in regular attendance in Parliament and its committees, not only today – and it is impressive that they are all here – but also throughout the five years of its term of office."
"Do not forget your responsibility to Parliament once you are confirmed in post tomorrow."
"We expect the Commission to take the principles of subsidiarity very seriously."
"We want a strong Europe, but we also have the identity of our nations, the identity of our regions and the identity – let us not forget – of our towns and villages."
"What are our values?"
"The cornerstones of our free society are respect for the dignity of each individual, tolerance, pluralism and the rule of law."
"Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion."
"The strength of our European cultural identity lies in the fact that we accept cultural difference and tolerate it."
"It is my firm conviction that, if we stop doing so, then Europe will fail, and that means that no one in the European Union, no one in Europe, no one in the world should be discriminated against, including for their religious beliefs."
"We want a Commission that is made up of a diverse range of people and not just one with people from all of the countries in the European Union, as the Treaty stipulates."
"We want people from different cultural backgrounds, with a range of different religious beliefs or non-religious beliefs and convictions."
"If we accept this – and it seems to me that this is what the Commission team represents – Europe has a good future ahead of it."
"Everyone here should be aware that if this college does not win the vote of confidence tomorrow it will not mean that one, two, three or four Members will be replaced: no, the status of every member of the team that is here today will then be open to question."
"This is not about one person, it is not about two or three people; it is about the whole college and we should be aware of that."
"On Friday, we will have the signing of the European Constitution."
"We all know how difficult it is going to be to win approval for this in those nations that are holding referendums."
"And please bear in mind that if we were to get a result tomorrow – I do not think that we will, but if we did – that suggested to the European Union that we do not accept our cultural pluralism, it would make it even more difficult to have the constitution adopted in the 25 countries of the European Union."
"All of this must be borne in mind."
"Let me be quite frank, ladies and gentlemen, and say that I find it very moving to see public figures from 25 European countries sitting in front of us now."
"When I was elected to the European Parliament in 1979, I could only dream that one day we might have Members of the Commission from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Malta and Cyprus."
"These public figures are here today in our midst."
"It is our responsibility tomorrow to express our confidence in this Commission so as to secure Europe’s future."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, an impressive picture presents itself to my right."
"The Council of the European Union feels that Queen Beatrix is representation enough today."
"We should take note of that."
"Because Mr Poettering is of course right that this is an important day."
"Here we have a Commission President who is fighting for confidence in his Commission."
"Parliament is here, as is the entire Commission."
"Perhaps the Council will arrive later on."
"Mr Barroso, you have made remarks that we have all heard before."
"Today you added a few initiatives, but you still have not addressed a significant part of what my group has been trying to get over to you for days."
"The point is that we expect you to draw the obvious conclusions from a six-week process that has taken place here in this Parliament."
"For six weeks we have listened to the nominee Commissioners and have drawn conclusions in five different committees – controversial conclusions in the case of one particular Commissioner, who did not win a majority in one committee, and four further sets of conclusions in which serious comments were made, serious comments which led to proposals and suggestions being put to you."
"And the answer that we are being given yet again today, Mr Barroso, is this: I will not change anything; the portfolios will not be reassigned."
"That is a significant hurdle."
"That is a hurdle."
"I can only appeal to you once more to think again."
"This morning, once again, I should like to tell you about the impression I get; it is that you are confusing the vote of confidence on your Commission with one in a national parliament."
"The European Parliament does not form opposing majorities."
"The European Parliament is – you are right there, Mr Poettering – heterogeneous."
"It consists of diverse currents of opinion."
"Even within our groups – as you of course know from bitter experience – there are very heterogeneous currents of opinion, and anyone who wants to win a large majority in this House has to show consideration for these different currents and try, as far as possible, to accommodate them all."
"For weeks, your approach has been: I have a Commission, I have handed out the portfolios, and I am not prepared to make any changes!"
"If that is the case then even cosmetic changes in the form of announcements of initiatives are not going to help."
"If that is the case then it will be very difficult for us to express confidence in your Commission."
"This is also about the issue of confidence."
"We know that we are voting on the Commission as a whole, not on individual Commissioners, however controversial they may be."
"This being the case, the question becomes one of basic confidence."
"At the end of the day, after weighing up all of the facts and all of the observations that have been made about individual candidates, do we have a fundamental confidence in this Commission as a whole, as a collective body, or do we not?"
"That is the salient question here."
"Since we cannot pick out individual points but have to decide whether we have this fundamental confidence in the collective body, that is precisely what our group will be considering this evening."
"Do we have this fundamental confidence, or do we not?"
"I have to say that I found nothing in your speech this morning to increase my confidence."
"I should like to take up one point that you mentioned."
"You referred to the US elections."
"My group does indeed hope that John Kerry will be elected President."
"We hope that he will be President because he is someone who says that the war in Iraq was a mistake."
"We want the USA to be led by a President who says, yes, that was a mistake, and a leader who admits to his mistakes is what we want for Europe too."
"One final comment: a democratic vote is a normal democratic act."
"If this Parliament voices its confidence in your Commission, then you will have won."
"That decision will have to be respected!"
"But if you do not have the confidence of this House tomorrow, it will not herald an institutional crisis, it will be a normal process, a normal right exercised by a freely elected Parliament in respect of an executive."
". Mr President, three months ago, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats urged the President–designate of the Commission to respect the prerogatives of this Parliament."
"My Group and this House have offered a sober and considered rejection of his nominee for Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs."
"Mr Barroso, we recognise that you could work only with what you were given."
"We recognise that your independence is not total."
"We have, on the whole, offered our support for the other members of your Commission."
"But our judgement stands, and it will be respected."
"This Group supported you as President of the Commission; we voted for you; we still support you."
"But we value the prerogatives of this House too highly to see them taken lightly."
"I welcome the package of measures that you have put before this House today."
"I believe you come here in a genuine search for rapprochement."
"Some of the measures you propose are bold and all of them are important."
"I believe that you are committed personally to the promotion of fundamental rights and that this spirit will infuse the Commission you will lead."
"Liberals and Democrats will consider your proposals carefully."
"But I am bound to say that they come late in the day and they contain little about Mr Buttiglione's future, a future which may be intimately bound to the future of the Commission-designate."
"This House is not asking to be placated or patronised."
"We are asking that the other branches of our European government recognise what our Treaties recognise and what the European Constitution recognises: that power in Europe rests in some measure with this Chamber and its elected Members."
"The approval process is not a rubber stamp and this Parliament should not be treated as one."
"It has been said often in the last week that it will be Liberals and Democrats who decide the fate of this Commission."
"But Liberals and Democrats did not nominate the Commissioners rejected by Parliament's committees."
"It was not Liberals and Democrats who would not or could not find the compromise that might have put Mr Buttiglione beyond the reach of controversy."
"Whatever happens tomorrow, the fate of this Commission has more than one architect."
"Moreover, I know that I am not the only one in this Chamber who feels that there is an invisible elephant in the room."
"The elephant is Justus Lipsius."
"The elephant is in the heads of the governments who gave you a weaker Commission than you deserve, and then refused to come to your aid when our House called their bluff."
"How many of Europe's governments would have done what Mr Berlusconi probably did and told you to take their man, , even if it left you with a Commission containing a Commissioner whose political feet of clay would probably disqualify him from inclusion in most of the European Union's national governments?"
"My Group feels that Member States owe Europe their best and their brightest."
"How many governments have shown their willingness to accept the democratic and legal right of our Parliament to judge the men and women who were proposed?"
"The silence you hear is the sound of Europe's governments leaving you and your new Commission swinging in the wind."
"As the defenders of the Community method, the strength of our House is ultimately the strength of yours."
"Because if the Council can mock the prerogative of this Parliament, then be absolutely sure that it thinks the same of the independence of your Commission."
"The Council prefers this Parliament to be weak."
"Too many in the Council find it convenient for the Commission to be weak."
"My Group wants this Parliament to be strong, because we cannot conceive of a strong European Union without it."
"And we want your Commission to be strong because the European Union needs an independent executive of the highest calibre."
"We have demanded a new framework agreement with your Commission: draft it and sign it, so that we will not be brought to this impasse again."
"This House faces a heavy choice."
"If Liberals and Democrats vote against the Commission-designate, we will not do so lightly."
"But we cannot, and we will not, diminish the status of this House, the standing of the Civil Liberties Committee or the stature of the post of the European Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs in the interest of an easy life."
"You might say – if I can use Mr Buttiglione's own words – that we will not change our principles against our conscience for political convenience."
"In view of the repeated references to the Council, I must inform Parliament that the Presidency has sent a letter to the President-in-Office of the Council inviting him and the other members to attend this sitting."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Barroso, I shall speak in French so that there is no translator between us and that you understand completely what our group wishes to say to you."
"Mr Barroso, you are a rather strange orchestra conductor."
"After auditioning some of your musicians, we found a pianist on the oboe and violinists playing the drums and, following these auditions, we told you that the music did not sound right."
"At which point you told us, ‘no problem – if a Commissioner here or there has a conflict of interests, he will be a part-time Commissioner and I, Barroso, will take care of things."
"If a Commissioner is not very familiar with the agriculture dossiers, that is no problem, she will go on a course to catch up and she will take a written exam."
"If a Commissioner for the environment is not too familiar with his dossiers, that is no problem, Mr Barroso is here."
"If a Commissioner for energy does not know the technical aspects of the dossiers, that is no problem, there are night classes and he can go and catch up."
"If a Commissioner for taxation is not too familiar with his dossiers, that is no problem, Mr Barroso is here’."
"Mr Barroso, that is your first mistake."
"We are not looking for a European superstar."
"We want a Commission which is able to work."
"I am sorry but your Commission – as you propose it – will not be able to work."
"Mr Barroso, it is on television that we look for superstars; in this House we look for something else."
"First mistake."
"Second mistake, Mr Barroso – you have been on a tour of capital cities."
"You asked Heads of Government to telephone Members of this House."
"Mr Barroso, did Mr Schroeder, Mr Blair and Mr So-and-so take part in the hearings?"
"Were they here when the hearings took place?"
"No, they were not."
"This is why, Mr Barroso, you must respect the institutions."
"The Council nominated you."
"You were elected with a healthy majority."
"My group did not vote for you, but we recognise this election."
"Then there were the hearings."
"Please stop asking the offices of Heads of Government to disturb us."
"In any event, the more they telephone, the fewer votes you will get."
"Try to tread carefully."
"Listen a little to the British Members of this House who are starting to become fed up with telephone calls from Downing Street."
"Your third mistake, Mr Barroso – at this point I come back to what Mr Poettering said to us on the subject of cultural difference: ‘there is no need for uniformity in this House’."
"Yes, Mr Poettering, nobody here criticises anyone whatsoever for their religious beliefs, their philosophical beliefs or their ideological beliefs."
"Nevertheless, any religious or ideological fundamentalism is poison for democracy."
"If a man campaigns against divorce, he is perfectly entitled to be against divorce and to wage a political campaign."
"If a man campaigns against a woman’s right to have an abortion, he is perfectly entitled to be against abortion and to wage a political campaign."
"If a man campaigns for the withdrawal of discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation from the fundamental Charter and from the Constitutional Treaty, as Mr Buttiglione did by signing Amendment 444 of the Convention, he is perfectly entitled to do so, politically speaking."
"We are perfectly entitled, however, to say that he is the least suitable person to defend the principle of non-discrimination in the European Union."
"This is a political decision, not an ideological one."
"Accordingly, let me state this once again: you cannot say in this House that democracy will be rejected by the general public if it is working; you cannot say that if there is a ‘no’ vote here the general public will reject the Treaty."
"The opposite is true – if Parliament shows its democratic colours, the general public will vote for that democracy and for that Constitutional Treaty."
"We are defending democracy and we have had enough of the authoritarianism of orchestra conductors."
"Mr President, Mr President-designate of the Commission, is it reasonable to bring down a Commission because two or three Commissioners are not entirely satisfactory?"
"This presentation of the situation by the President-designate constitutes, as far as my group is concerned, a deeply flawed assessment of the crisis affecting the EU."
"The recent mounting criticism of the Barroso team is nothing short of a clap of thunder in a calm sky."
"Let me remind you that a not inconsiderable section of this House had, as long ago as July, expressed its mistrust of the rather too liberal choices that characterise Mr Barroso."
"It cannot be a surprise to anyone that the college of Commissioners presented to us only serves to exacerbate all of these reservations."
"By putting in the highly sensitive competition post an ardent devotee of market economics, as one analyst put it, an industrial lobbyist who represents and fosters dubious relations between public responsibilities and private interests, to the point of having been severely and unanimously reprimanded by his national parliament; by naming in the post of international trade a champion of free trade, who has no compunction about announcing that he puts his faith in competition to improve the performance of public services; by giving the internal market portfolio to a fundamentalist of liberalism, that of the environment to a conservative, for whom ecology appears to be the least of his concerns, and that of agriculture to a champion of the agricultural business, and so on and so forth, the President-designate has no doubt succeeded in convincing a number of doubters that he nurtured a particular idea of Europe that they certainly did not share."
"Against the backdrop of this fundamental challenge to Mr Barroso’s economic, social and environmental choices, the Buttiglione bomb has gone off."
"Mr Barroso told us that he set great store by communication."
"He has got what he wanted."
"One single Commissioner has brought fame to the whole of his Commission, albeit at a considerable price."
"The image of his team, whatever may have been the quality of some of its members, is forever tarnished with unworthy and anachronistic words that were not punished as they should have been."
"If a candidate country displayed such fundamentalist beliefs on the place of women in society, and such discriminatory beliefs on homosexuality, it would be rejected."
"At the very least, we should have done likewise with a European Commissioner."
"Let me add that other statements made by Mr Buttiglione are also worthy of our attention, even if, or rather, all the more so, because the Council and the Commission have among their ranks a number of sympathisers with these dangerous ideas."
"One such idea is to set up camps for migrants and asylum seekers in North Africa, on the subject of which Mr Buttiglione felt the need to clarify that they would not be, and I quote, ‘concentration camps at all, but humanitarian centres’."
"Thank you for clearing that up."
"A further example is the bellicose view of the fight against terrorism that Mr Buttiglione has trotted out: our society is afraid, we are at war, we will win."
"It is these elements that should influence our decision tomorrow."
"Never, in the 25 years that I have seen colleges of Commissioners come and go, have I seen such an unloved Commission before it has even taken up its duties."
"In fact, I firmly believe that, following the failure of the Santer Commission, then the stormy journey taken by the one that succeeded it, following the succession of increasingly bitter disputes between governments and the Commission, between governments themselves, between the Commission and Parliament, following numerous worrying signs of ‘eurofatigue’ among the general public – to use an expression often heard in the new Member States – not least after the elections, which were notable for a record low turnout, and given the fact that the draft Constitution might not be ratified in a few days’ time, I firmly believe that the Barroso syndrome, which will tomorrow lead to an historic defeat or to a Pyrrhic victory, constitutes a new and powerful indicator of the deep crisis of a Europe without vision and without a unifying plan."
"Clearly a root-and-branch review is needed to put some sense back into what could and should be one of the high adventures of our times."
"Accordingly, my group, in a unanimous decision on the part of its 17 members, will tomorrow vote against the appointment of the Barroso Commission."
". Mr President, this row over Mr Buttiglione sums up the biggest problem of the European Union."
"Across our continent there are many different cultures, different languages, different religions and different ways of living."
"This attempt politically to force them all to become one will, in my opinion, never work."
"In UKIP, we take no side on Mr Buttiglione's comments whatsoever."
"Our reasons for opposing this Commission are different."
"We oppose it because it an undemocratic institution."
"Even if tomorrow this House kicks it out, what we will get is a new set of political appointees, and it will still continue to look like a rest home for failed domestic politicians."
"It makes law, it produces law, in over 3 000 committees whose constitution nobody ever knows and has not been declared."
"The Commission is the government of the European Union and it has the sole right to initiate law – something which the constitutional treaty does nothing to amend."
"The Commission is the motor of integration."
"The Commission is the guardian of treaties that are already unacceptable."
"The Commission is the enemy of the nation-state."
"That is what it is all about."
"We will be voting 'no' tomorrow."
"Perhaps the rather delicious irony is that, for the first time ever in this House, the UK Independence Party will be with the majority."
"Mr President, following Mr Farage's comments, I note that this is the first time ever that UKIP will vote with the Communists!"
"Here in Parliament over the last six weeks, we had a series of hearings where we put the Commissioners-designate through their paces."
"As a result, as every speaker so far has said, certain committees raised questions on the suitability, or otherwise, of individuals."
"In fairness, Mr Barroso has responded: he has made changes and has moved some way towards meeting some of those concerns."
"However, Mr Barroso rightly has not rolled over and died in front of the onslaught that has taken place, over the last week in particular."
"We need mutual respect between all the institutions of the European Union, and an understanding that power does not rest within one institution alone and that we are interdependent on each other."
"From some of the speeches this morning and our discussions over the last week that if you have experience in business or politics, if you have strongly held beliefs, if you have a strong ideology, if you have a strong opinion, then, according to some, you are not suitable to be a Commissioner of the European Union."
"And yet what Europe is trying to find at the moment – in order to ensure that the rich tapestry of today's re-united Europe is properly represented within all the institutions – is people who have opinions, people who have visions, people who can best represent the countries that nominate them."
"Again, what seems to be forgotten in this whole discussion and debate is that in July this House gave its endorsement and its confidence to Mr Barroso."
"That was not done in isolation: President Barroso already had confidence placed in him by the governments of the 25 Member States who put his name forward for that position."
"Each of the national governments had nominated the people they considered to be the best for the position of Commissioner in the European Union."
"It is incumbent on us to play our role within the democratic make-up of the institutions of the European Union, but it is also our responsibility to ensure that we do not allow it to degenerate into domestic political discussions and false accusations with regard to ideology or 'who said what to whom'."
"Let us become the voices of a new world."
"Let us represent the peace, the tolerance and the acceptance that the European Union should truly represent."
"Let us understand and fully bring into being the Europe of diversity in this reunited form."
"Let us give credit where credit is due: Mr Barroso has moved, he has brought forward new initiatives and new policies."
"Let us ensure that we can show the same tolerance that we expect of others."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall not be supporting Mr Barroso, as I mentioned before during my first speech in this House, because he represents anti-European powers and anti-European interests, and he is the sole representative of a contradiction, full of conflicts of interest, and of a Commission that I consider anti-European in its very essence."
"Let us not forget that, amongst other things, Mr Barroso has openly supported US intervention in Iraq."
"I therefore hold him jointly responsible for the stand that certain European countries have taken alongside the United States, a stand that has caused serious harm and damage to the whole of our continent."
"To defend our Europe and our interests as Europeans, the Commission and its President should be adopting a very different stand."
"I call on my fellow Members not to vote for the Barroso Commission."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, you have heard the reservations expressed by previous speakers as regards certain hearings, for reasons of competence, for subjective reasons, or indeed because what was said in some of those hearings was blatantly distorted."
"Against this backdrop, you managed to give a political answer, safeguarding both the Commission’s character, which is that it has a President in sole charge – a specific political figure – and that of the college."
"You also managed, therefore, to take advantage of the political reality of the Commission to endeavour to answer at least some of the pertinent criticisms made in this House."
"You did the right thing. You did the right thing by refusing to commit the cardinal sin of buckling at the outset of a Commission that, for the good of Europe, must be a strong Commission with strong leadership."
"It is clear that this is not the time for a false crisis."
"At a time when we must consolidate the enlargement, the Lisbon Strategy, the Turkey issue, the issue of the Financial Perspectives and so many others, the last thing we need is a false crisis."
"You have done everything to prevent such a crisis."
"You have done the right thing."
"If you keep up this determination and continue to show respect for Parliament, you will continue to enjoy our support."
"– Thank you, Mr President."
"You have said yourself, Mr Barroso – and it has already been stated today – that you want to be the President of a strong Commission."
"There are actually a whole series of Commissioners who have shown themselves to be very strong, including in the hearings, for example those sitting in your immediate vicinity today."
"And there are many Commissioners who, as you said, have the potential to be very good Commissioners once they have acquired the necessary technical knowledge."
"Even though many of them hold views on politics and social policy that are not akin to our own, we are convinced that they will make suitable Commissioners, and so we have approved them."
"There are a number of cases, however – and you have had to defend them today, which is already unfortunate at the start of a new Commission – that are going to cause problems in the Commission in the years to come."
"Of course there is one Commissioner in particular whom we do not consider fit to head the department that he has been allocated."
"It is true, as has already been said many times, that Mr Buttiglione has every right to hold these views, which we do not share."
"But if he holds these views, and if he also, and repeatedly, acts in accordance with them, then he is not fit to hold the portfolio that you have allocated to him."
"This must be made absolutely clear."
"Mr Barroso, the problem is no longer just Mr Buttiglione."
"By acting or not acting in the way you have, you yourself have made the Buttiglione case into a Barroso case."
"This is regrettable and it will certainly have a significant bearing on our decision this evening."
"Although you have just made a series of proposals, Mr Barroso, you are still not taking Parliament seriously, as much of what you are selling here is already in the pipeline."
"You act as though you were responding with something new."
"But you are not responding, you are simply taking up what already exists."
"You are selling old wine in new skins."
"We cannot accept this."
"We will give it very careful consideration, but I do not believe that we will be able to accept Parliament’s being approached in this way because it is not a true reflection of reality."
"What is more, Mr Barroso, your proposal to create a kind of sub-Commission within the Commission is already being mocked by Mr Buttiglione."
"He is making fun of it and is slandering a fellow nominee Commissioner, Mr Špidla."
"Is this any way to treat your proposals for the Commission itself?"
"You did not comment on this."
"I would be glad if you were to do so."
"What do you think of a member of your Commission slandering another member of the Commission, making false claims about them and mocking your proposals?"
"That is precisely why we cannot derive much comfort from what you have proposed today, President Barroso."
"I regret to say that I wish things could have been different."
"You have not convinced us."
"You have not even made a serious attempt to convince us."
"– Mr Barroso, I voted for you in July because I believe that you have the potential to be a good President of the Commission."
"I also voted for you because you made three pledges, namely that there would be more women in this Commission – you have delivered on this; that there would not be any super-Commissioners – you have delivered on this too; and that you would remove Commissioners from their departments, take away their portfolios or discharge them entirely if they did not have the confidence of Parliament."
"These pledges will once again determine how we vote tomorrow."
"I would therefore ask you, Mr Barroso, to take this very seriously."
"I am pleased that you wish to steer a very definite liberal economic course with your Commission."
"I am also pleased that you are making human rights a matter for decision at the highest level, but Parliament is the assembly that represents the people of Europe."
"Take the vote seriously; discharge Commissioners who do not have the confidence of Parliament!"
"That is right for Europe and right for democracy."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso referred to our Committee hearing process as an example of democracy in action, but that process, without the accompanying power to approve or reject individuals, makes our hearings more of a charade."
"After the hearings, I heard spokespeople for certain political groups express deep disappointment at the performance of certain individuals but go on to say that because he or she was a member of their political family, they would support them anyway."
"Mr Barroso acknowledged certain specific weaknesses – conflicts of interest – and claimed to have attempted to deal with that."
"I think conflicts of interest are as much about perception as actuality."
"Surely, it is not too much to expect each individual to have done enough homework to be able to demonstrate that they have mastered their brief."
"Citizens' expectations and our sense of responsibility were referred to."
"My sense of responsibility demands that I vote against the Commission tomorrow."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since you first stood before this House, our reasons for voting against you have increased."
"We have already told you what these reasons are: they are called war, which you have supported, and policies, of which you are a prime representative."
"It is no coincidence that today we are adding another reason: democracy."
"You cannot say that you want to cooperate with Parliament and start by not respecting its vote."
"You cannot say that people are experiencing a crisis in democracy and set that kind of example."
"Our vote against you and your Commission is therefore a vote in favour of peace, social Europe, democracy and also a new maturity for this Parliament of ours."
"If you and your Commission are defeated, Parliament and democracy will be the winners, and the people will have more confidence in Europe."
"Mr President, this House has heard some home truths."
"Commissioner-designate Buttiglione has reminded us all of the meaning of marriage and the family, and of the role these institutions play in society, a role sanctified by time and by the experience of generations."
"We fully support everything Mr Buttiglione has said on these issues."
"His critics assume the moral high ground, and this is wrong. It is actually Mr Buttiglione who holds this moral high ground."
"Unfortunately, however, we will not be able to give him our support in terms of votes, as we are to vote on the Commission as a whole, and this Commission contains 25 Commissioners."
"Our support for one of these Commissioners must not be allowed to outweigh our opposition to the remaining 24."
"The way in which the Commission is appointed is exceptionally undemocratic."
"As a general rule, those nominated by governments as potential Commissioners have no chance of gaining support from voters in their own countries, and have met with public disapproval precisely as a result of their activities to date."
"This was certainly how the Polish Commissioner-designate, Mrs Hübner, was chosen, and our opinion of her is a negative one."
"I am sure the same is true of the Commissioners-designate from the other post-Communist countries."
"In view of the outgoing Commission’s attitude to Poland, and the unfair conditions upon which we were admitted into the EU, which differed greatly from those granted to the German Democratic Republic, there is every reason for us to have the gravest reservations about the European Commission as an institution."
"We cannot support it."
"I apologise to Mr Buttiglione."
"Our vote against this Commission is not directed at him personally."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate sparked off in this House by the extreme Left is a debate Europe could well do without."
"What Europe and the Barroso Commission do need to do here and now is get down to work to solve the problems faced by millions of citizens of our continent in both the new and old Member States."
"This ideological debate, initiated without any sense of shame by the extreme Left in this House, is an extremely dangerous precedent."
"If the Barroso Commission is actually rejected it will be a sign that Catholics are prohibited from practising their faith in Europe."
"This is something we cannot agree to."
"Mr President, you deserve our support and you will have it."
"Madam President, in July this House endorsed Mr Barroso’s candidature as President of the Commission."
"Three months have passed since that time, and neither Mr Barroso nor this House have changed in any way."
"Mr Barroso does not select the Commissioners-designate."
"That is the job of the Member States’ governments."
"Yet although the governments sometimes put forward controversial candidates, it is unfortunately not the governments, but Mr Barroso himself who has to swallow the bitter pill today."
"I should like to make it clear, however, that we do not object to the vast majority of the members of Mr Barroso’s team."
"I believe Mr Barroso will honour the promise he made today before this House, namely that he will change the make-up of his Commission during his term of office, if the situation so requires."
"To use a metaphor, Mr Barroso’s blank cheque of confidence should be renewed, but we must also pay close attention to what he does with this cheque."
"Mr Barroso, I wish you luck."
"Madam President, Mr Barroso, this is no ordinary moment in the history of the European institutions; we are in the process of drawing up a Constitution for Europe."
"A Constitution is more than just another Treaty and the stage leading up to the adoption of a Constitution is not just another stage."
"How must politicians behave at a time when we are drawing up a Constitution?"
"We must be in a position to partially put aside our ideological differences and our party differences."
"What are we going to ask of the European citizens when we ask them to support the European Constitution?"
"That they put aside their ideological differences in order to vote for a constitution for everybody."
"We are going to ask supporters of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, socialists, liberals and conservatives to vote together for the Constitution."
"And how can we ask them to make this effort and to behave in this way if we are emphasising our ideological differences and our parties’ strategies differ more than ever?"
"Parliament must be the exemplary institution during this formative period."
"Parliament is the only institution elected by universal suffrage by all the citizens, and the social environment our societies require demands that we start by creating a political environment which is based on the greatest possible degree of cohesion and unity."
"We therefore want to act in a manner which is consistent with this political environment which the adoption of the European Constitution is going to require, by supporting Mr Barroso unequivocally."
"Some people believe that a defeat for Mr Barroso will be a victory for the European Parliament."
"I must tell them that they are wrong: it will be a success for those who do not believe in the European Union."
"Madam President, for the first time in the history of the European Union, the appointment of the new Commission has attracted a great deal of attention throughout the European media."
"This is partly due to the very particular way in which Mr Buttiglione has commented on the interpretation of fundamental civil rights in Europe and the wounding remarks he has made about large groups of people."
"My group is not alone in finding these remarks unacceptable and totally inappropriate for a future Commissioner who has the specific task of defending the fundamental rights of every European citizen."
"The way in which the next President, Mr Barroso, has so far defended Mr Buttiglione leads us to believe that the opinions held in large parts of this Parliament are of no great concern to him."
"As you stated this morning, a reshuffle is out of the question."
"What threw into relief the problems surrounding Mr Buttiglione was the open and direct manner in which the European Parliament heard the new Commissioners."
"Bearing in mind the urgent need for clarity, and without any preconceived ideas, the Members of this House have tested the new Commissioners on their vision of the future and the functioning of the European Union."
"It is certainly true of my group that the work that has been carried out painstakingly over the past four weeks forms the basis for the ultimate judgment we will be passing about this Commission tomorrow."
"This is not just about the provocative statements Mr Buttiglione has made."
"It has become evident to us that a number of other candidate Commissioners do not always display sufficient knowledge and dedication for the roles they may be playing over the next five years."
"Thanks to the in-depth and serious manner in which Parliament has acquitted itself of its task in the hearings, the failings of a number of candidates have become apparent."
"I refer to the almost total lack of commitment to Europe on the part of the new Latvian Commissioner, Mrs Udre, and also to the various conflicts of interest that will make it virtually, if not totally, impossible for the Dutch candidate Commissioner, Mrs Kroes, to fulfil her role on a number of important issues."
"The outstanding issues surrounding a few Commissioners and the weak performance of some others are not the only problem."
"At least equally important is the fact that, during the hearings, only a few of the future Commissioners appeared to have a clear vision of the role of the European Union."
"As a result, they were hardly capable, if not incapable, of setting clear priorities for the Commission’s coming term of office, or of setting a good example for Europe’s global role."
"The Social Democrats want the European Union to play a strong role in the world and apply effective multilateralism in order to reinforce peace and democracy."
"Europe should offer a clear and coherent alternative to counteract the unilateral approach of the United States."
"It is disappointing that during the hearings, few innovating ideas emerged from the Commission on this score."
"The open and direct way in which the European Parliament has welcomed the future members of the Commission has given rise to great expectations."
"Over the past four weeks, we have shown the European public that we want a new Commission with competent and honourable governors who also have clear ideas about Europe’s future course."
"Tomorrow, the European public are expecting from us a clear verdict about the Commission presented by Mr Barroso."
"Although a number of the candidate Commissioners clearly meet the high requirements prescribed by us, our general verdict about the Commission cannot be positive at the moment, not even after this morning."
"Madam President, quite apart from Parliament’s political existence, what is at stake here is the whole question of the balance between the European institutions."
"Do we want the future of Europe to be decided tomorrow behind closed government doors or do we believe, more than ever, in the need to build a democratic Europe?"
"Madam President, you have chosen to disregard Parliament’s opinions and votes, in order, I believe, not to upset the Council."
"You had the historic opportunity to gain your independence and thereby to help increase the Commission’s authority and that of our Community method."
"You chose to do the opposite. This is something that we must not and cannot accept because, quite apart from our own Parliament’s powers, what is at stake here is the very question of Europe’s democratic future."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, many members of the proposed Commission have my heartfelt support."
"Unfortunately, however, the only option left to me is to vote against it."
"The task of the Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs is to oversee the implementation of civil rights under the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the applicant countries as well."
"To the conservatives, those of you who argue against accession negotiations with Turkey on the basis of human rights concerns, I say this: how can you support a man for this job who declares entire groups of people to be sinful and bad?"
"What sort of signal does this send to Turkey and the other applicant countries?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance was also concerned about the replies given to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety by Mr Dimas, Commissioner-designate for the Environment."
"Mr Dimas did say he felt that environmental protection promoted economic development, which delighted us."
"He did not, however, present any sort of action plan or anything concrete on how environmental protection should be developed, and this worried us."
"I hope that Mr Dimas’s work will prove our fears to be unfounded."
"– Mr Barroso, your idea of a Europe with limited sovereignty, subordinate to the United States, is something we have already discussed over the past few days while examining your programme."
"This morning, however, we have come across a further quality of yours: arrogance."
"For you, Parliament does not count or, rather, it counts for very little."
"That was apparent when you arrived late and did not even apologise, unlike Mr Prodi, who arrived late but did apologise."
"Yours is a mediocre Commission on account of its hyperliberalism, on account of all the privatisation, and for the fact that it does not condemn the war."
"It contains some mediocre Commissioners and, in Mr Buttiglione, a terrible, medieval Commissioner who damages Italy’s image and stands for a return to the past, to the most reactionary Middle Ages, riven with racial, sexual and gender discrimination."
"For these reasons we shall be voting against your Commission."
"Madam President, both Dutch Members of the Independence and Democracy Group are very disgruntled about the fuss that has been created following statements by the candidate Commissioner Mr Buttiglione, and that is putting it mildly."
"This is a case of discrimination on the basis of religious conviction, and that is something of which the European Parliament should not be guilty."
"What is described as tolerance means tolerating only what progressive Europe wants to hear."
"Mr Buttiglione has never called for the rights of women and homosexuals to be jeopardised."
"He has merely given his personal opinion in response to a specific question."
"That is constitutionally acceptable."
"However, a conscious attempt has been made to find a stick to beat a dog. It appears that a minister from the Berlusconi Cabinet is unacceptable from the very start."
"By rousing popular feeling in this manner, the European Parliament wants, indirectly, to have an impact on individual Commissioners."
"As Dutch Members of the Independence and Democracy Group, we see the present proposal for the composition of the new European Commission as a reason to vote in favour of it."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is incredible that this morning’s debate has not focused on the new Commission’s commitments and the current emergencies, which arouse such strong feelings among the citizens whom we represent."
"We have not talked about immigration policies, the fight against terrorism, the reform of the Structural Funds or the reform of the Stability Pact."
"The stage of our little European theatre has been taken over by a thoroughly ideological and calculated attack on the Commission-designate and in particular on the Commissioner-designate Mr Buttiglione, who is guilty of having personal opinions and religious beliefs."
"The apologies which the Commissioner-designate did in fact offer were not enough; even the changes which the President-designate did in fact make were not enough: people want to settle a score at all costs."
"That is unacceptable."
"Voting down the Commission tomorrow – let us not pretend otherwise – would lead to an institutional crisis that we really do not need right now."
"Just two days away from the signing of the Constitutional Treaty in Rome, which ought to be a solemn, historic moment, we really cannot allow ourselves a pathetic act of weakness that would be totally out of keeping with the expectations of Europe’s citizens and of the world as a whole."
"What would be quite clear to them yet again would be the total lack of any political or institutional substance in the Community institutions."
"Madam President, President Barroso, in Europe there are 50 million poor people, small farmers are under threat, necessary investment is not being undertaken due to the austerity pact, and in the meantime what are we talking about?"
"Mr Buttiglione!"
"It is true that this philosopher has behaved in a rather dubious fashion."
"He has quoted Kant, Hegel and Carl Schmitt, but, tellingly, he has not quoted Socrates, who, himself, had a somewhat modern sexuality."
"Clearly, this is a case of discrimination."
"When President Borrell, however, contemptuously suggested that Mr Buttiglione should take care of agriculture, what was he trying to say?"
"That because pigs were rarely homosexual, they would not be a source of embarrassment to Mr Buttiglione?"
"When it comes to agriculture, incidentally, I shall not speak about Mrs Fischer, her interests in a sugar multinational, nor her family pig farms businesses that relocated to Russia."
"The composition of your Commission is perhaps more balanced than it might appear."
"The competition Commissioner, for example, is from a background of unbridled capitalism."
"She will have her victims but Mr Buttiglione will pray for her."
"You are therefore inventing the compassionate capitalism Commission."
"There are contradictions, it is true, but we know from Chairman Mao that a distinction must be made between antagonistic and non-antagonistic contradictions, and you are a Maoist!"
"This is also why Cohn-Bendit says: turn the spotlight on the Barroso Commission!"
"Ultimately, however, we know that we end up with Deng Xiaoping, so it matters little whether Barroso is white like pale capitalism, or black like Mr Buttiglione. What matters is that he catches mice."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, we will be voting on a team, the individual players of which we have been able to put to the test."
"That is something quite unheard of in other parliaments."
"The selection, however, was done elsewhere."
"The coach has put his team together in consultation with the management, in the full knowledge that each member of that management was allowed to designate one player."
"We do not find all the players equally agreeable; we would have liked to see some more women and, above all, some more players with a jersey in our colour."
"We, too, though, are bound by rules, and it is not up to us alone."
"Some players have weaknesses, but all of them have enough experience on the field, have promised fair play and have accepted the authority of the coach and all of them realise that it will be an important match."
"For those who may not be positioned correctly, additional man cover has been provided, and the coach can change people around at any time and, if necessary, send them off the pitch."
"With that coach we have already agreed to play, and we are indeed counting on him to turn this team of twenty-four into a cohesive team and to ensure that it will end up in a higher division than last season."
"That is what the supporters want too; above all, they also want the match to begin at last."
"A certain degree of drama, but not too much, is always a bonus."
"What counts is what is on the scoreboard and the points that are awarded during the match."
"I believe that this team can take office."
"I have confidence in them, and taking office is, of course, not the same as being given a blank cheque."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I should like to point out that in our Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs we attempted to evaluate Mr Buttiglione’s personal suitability for managing the portfolio of fundamental rights, of legal cooperation and of asylum and immigration."
"In each of those fields, Mr Buttiglione proved problematic."
"During his hearing before the Civil Liberties Committee, Mr Buttiglione showed that he was completely out of step with what we are constructing in our committee."
"This was the case not only as regards fundamental rights, but also the right to asylum, the European arrest warrant and judicial assistance in criminal matters."
"The Civil Liberties Committee could scarcely decide in favour of awarding this portfolio to Mr Buttiglione."
"Mr Barroso, as guardian of the Treaties you must defend Parliament’s rights."
"We therefore call on you to take our opinions on board."
"We feel that it would be unthinkable for you to force this through."
"The adjustments that you have suggested are unacceptable, not to say humiliating, for the Commissioners concerned."
"Parliament carries out its duties, all of its duties."
"We are the representatives of the people and this is not an institutional crisis at all."
"This is democracy in action."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in July this group placed its confidence in you on the strength of the promise you made to us of a cooperative relationship, like the one your predecessor Mr Prodi had with us."
"You were chosen by the Council, and your Commissioners by the national governments."
"Our job is to examine your Commissioners and give them a vote of confidence."
"We have done our job carefully and expressed criticisms about five Commissioners."
"Today you ask us to trust you; my reply to you is that you, rather, should trust Parliament and its judgments."
"Personal assurances, or promises of a reshuffle after the vote, are not enough."
"Political selections are made first, not afterwards."
"We have not changed our minds about the aim of building a strong relationship between the Commission and those who democratically represent the people of Europe."
"Show that you too have not changed your mind by making new selections today, not tomorrow."
"Otherwise, on behalf of the Italian delegation in the ALDE Group, I say that we will vote against this Commission."
"– Madam President, Mr Barroso, I should like to rebut one assertion very strongly: our rejection of Mr Buttiglione has nothing to do with any desire on our part for a return to the days when people with certain views were banned from becoming civil servants; neither does it have anything to do with any desire to undermine citizens’ freedoms."
"The subjective freedom of religion is something that we would always defend as a constitutional right, but Mr Buttiglione has cast himself in the role of , an in the new Commission."
"He is acting on behalf of Mr Berlusconi to attack an enlightened Europe and, faced with such an attack, Mr Barroso, this Parliament has to defend itself."
"However, it is not just Mr Buttiglione whom we need to debate today."
"Let us take, for example, the Commissioners-designate Mr Kovács and Mr Dimas."
"As a Member of the Greens, and I do not want us to ignore what we have learned, 20 years since the first report of the Club of Rome and ten years, more than ten years, since the first conference on climate change in Rio, about the ecological ..."
"Madam President, for me, there are two reasons for voting against this proposed Commission."
"The political composition is a clear step to the right for the EU."
"Free-market liberals and right of centre politicians dominate most key areas."
"It is therefore obvious that, as a socialist, I should vote against it."
"It is also obvious that quite a few of those appointed are quite unsuitable for their tasks."
"During questioning in the committee, Mr Dimas, as a nominated Commissioner, showed that he lacked both the necessary knowledge of environmental policy and a vision of its future."
"There are similar problems in the energy area."
"The nominated Agricultural Commissioner is a landed property owner, and the candidate for competition issues has very strong links with large-scale industry."
"The person who is to protect the rights of women, homosexuals and refugees is opposed to equality, is homophobic and wishes to restrict the right of asylum."
"One wonders if it can get much worse."
"– Madam President, Mr Berlusconi’s government has committed a grave sin, as Professor Buttiglione would say, by not confirming Mr Monti, a man trusted by the major powers."
"Mr Buttiglione has thus been attacked, as chance would have it, by the very politicians who in the last parliamentary term voted in a member of the Bilderberg Club as European Ombudsman and may be preparing to do so again."
"In practice, however, the fact remains for us that this Commission seems to be entrenching the European superstate project, as sketched out by the new Constitution, which to us is unacceptable for the very same reasons that are put forward to support it: the rights to freedom and the rights of the regions, peoples and nations, which this project wants to overwhelm."
"We see it every day in the measures that are adopted: peoples and regions have their voices and even their languages, their minority languages, stifled."
"This is not the European project of which the founding fathers dreamt, this is not our story, and we therefore express our disapproval of this project."
"Madam President, in the run-up to this debate we have seen left-wing and Liberal hysteria reach a crescendo."
"When put to the test, those who talk the most about human rights and freedom of speech have hypocritically displayed themselves as utterly intolerant in their virulent attacks on Commissioner-designate Buttiglione."
"I regret that the President of this Parliament diminished his office by joining the left-wing herd in what, however it is dressed up, amounts to a denial of the Commission-designate's right of freedom of thought and speech."
"It is a sad commentary on moral probity in this House that one who dares to hold to moral rectitude is so relentlessly vilified."
"However, for me the defining issue is something else."
"It is that I will not endorse by my vote government by unelected placemen."
"I for one will not lend the veneer …"
". – According to the proposals in the Constitutional Treaty accepted by the 25 governments, the Commission’s future president will be able to choose, in the case of each country, from three government-designated candidates."
"Nevertheless, this year not a single government has bothered, or rather was brave enough, to nominate several candidates."
"The elected president of the Commission had no opportunity to choose."
"He could select only from the few options put forward by Member States."
"Governments made their nominations in many ways: some sent to the Commission those they wanted to get rid of."
"However, there were wise governments, and fortunately, those that proposed their most talented politicians were in the majority, thus helping along the collective European issue."
"In the opinion of our group, those who have done particularly well were: Benita Ferrero-Waldner, Dalia Grybauskaite, Charlie McCreevy and those who gave a particularly weak performance were Ingrida Udre, László Kovács or Neelie Kroes."
"It takes someone on the ball to forge a unified team from this motley crew: a European government that is able to halt the Commission’s loss of prestige that has been going on for years."
"President José Manuel Barroso has proved already as Prime Minister that he is strong and a true leader."
"I am sure that he will be capable of getting together a good Commission."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will judge the work of the currently forming Commission according to what extent it will be able to create more unity, more cohesion and more competitiveness in the Union: to bring it closer to the citizens, to improve citizens’ standard of living and security, to help the joining up of the new Member States and to promote minority rights."
"He who seeks to indulge in short-term political personal interest threatens the stability of the Union’s institutions and plunges the big plan of the newly united Europe into crisis."
"If we were to look at our personal considerations, we would not support more candidates either."
"However, we are looking at the issues of a common Europe."
"The stake is high and I hope that the European Parliament will not fail."
"In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we have heard four candidate Commissioners, two men and two women."
"Although we have great respect for your attempt to get more women in the Commission, unfortunately, we do have some issues around the two ladies in this Commission and are still waiting for responses and reactions to those issues on a number of scores."
"With regard to Mrs Kroes, we in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs asked you to publish the legal advice on the basis of which she has drawn up the code of conduct by means of which she intends to avoid conflicts of interest."
"She herself, during the hearings, agreed to it being published."
"Can you tell us why that has not yet been done?"
"A second question concerned clarification from you as to how you view the issues that she explains away in connection with her past dealings."
"Are you handling these matters yourself?"
"Will you be setting up a working party for that purpose?"
"How can you guarantee to us that no other conflicts of interest are involved and that those issues will be properly dealt with?"
"I would now like to turn to the other candidate, Mrs Udre."
"During the hearing, she indicated repeatedly that she cannot be blamed for the suspicion levelled at her party in connection with receiving anonymous donations."
"This is very difficult for us to judge."
"We have asked you to launch an inquiry, or have one launched, into the facts and to provide us with information about this and also with your assessment."
"That question, too, is still on the table, and we would like to see it resolved."
"Mr President, first I would like to thank the Commissioners who willingly underwent the hearings process; it was a gruelling experience for all concerned."
"The process is far from perfect; there are certainly improvements that can be made, but the legitimacy of the process is accepted, not only by the Commission and the Parliament, but also by the Council."
"There are serious political consequences, and we are now preparing to draw our conclusions."
"I have to say to President-designate Barroso that if we vote the Commission down, we will not be creating a constitutional crisis."
"The institutions are acting within their Treaty powers."
"We will be creating a political drama, but Parliament is breathing democracy into the constitutional settlement that we are to sign up to with so much pride in Rome on Friday."
"If the first Barroso team is rejected, we look forward to seeing the second Barroso team as soon as is practicable."
"Madam President, I was worried and I remain worried. Of course you are not to blame for the envoys sent by the Pope, Mr Chirac, Mr Blair and Mr Schroeder, to name but a few."
"You are responsible, however, for awarding portfolios to your Commissioners."
"Some Commissioners-designate have scandalised Europe with their words."
"Others have convinced us of nothing else but the fact that they were the wrong people for the wrong job at the wrong time."
"Such was the case with Mr Dimas in environment, who refused to see the sword of Damocles above our heads."
"Climate change and the effects of wastefulness on our planet mean that we must find other ways of thinking than purely productivity-based economics and other ways of governing than pure liberalism."
"Sustainable ecological development is crucial, whether we like it or not."
"Inequality is on the rise, nature is being exploited, society is taking backward steps, health care is being ravaged, all the warning signs are on red alert and what your college proposes is to continue along the same inflammatory path."
"Given that our European dream is in danger of turning into a liberal nightmare, that our actions today are a crucial influence on tomorrow and that the citizens of Europe are demanding a more ambitious Europe, my answer is no, I cannot place my confidence in this team."
"Madam President, ever larger groups of EU citizens view with disquiet the way in which the self-determination of the Member States is continually undermined."
"In spite of all the talk about subsidiarity, political power is progressively being transferred to the institutions of the European Union."
"Yet Mr Barroso points with pride to the fact that the Commissioners he is proposing are undisguised federalists from the right and from the socialists and liberals."
"They will campaign vigorously in favour of the draft Constitution, he promises."
"For those of us who have been given democratic mandates in democratic elections to campaign against the centralisation and bureaucratisation of the European project and for those of us who have been given democratic mandates to reject the draft Constitution, this Commission is therefore unacceptable."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Barroso, on behalf of the New Italian Socialist Party, which I represent in this Chamber together with Mr De Michelis, I confirm that your Commission has our vote."
"It is a Commission born, alas, amid countless arguments concerned more with national issues and hidden agendas than with problems of Community-wide scope and importance."
"We have confidence in you, Mr Barroso, and we look forward to policies that are equal to the new challenges Europe will have to face."
"I am the youngest Member of this Parliament and, as a representative of my age group, I feel I am pinning on you the hopes and expectations of a new generation of Europeans. This generation has an appeal to make: now that we have created a monetary and financial Europe, let us make every effort to create a Europe of Europeans, a continent that at last has a single voice and a single heart but one that respects all its individualities, which form a common heritage and wealth that must be nurtured in every possible way."
"Mr Barroso, we will back you, but we ask you to honour through your actions the trust we place in you and to make us always proud to be European citizens."
"Mr President of the Commission, if I could make one wish today, it would be to say to you: let us get down to work!"
"I freely admit that I have been shocked by the views expressed by some people in your team during the hearings, and I wonder about the ability of certain others to fulfil their portfolios."
"This is most regrettable, given that your Commission is intrinsically a good one."
"More than 85% of your college was favourably received."
"Some Commissioners-designate are competent and know their portfolios well."
"Must the functioning of the European Union suffer as a consequence?"
"Mr Barroso, you have unfortunately fallen into the media trap of short sentences."
"You must take on board today the recommendations made by Parliament following the hearings."
"Your proposal to create a fundamental rights agency surprises me a little and does not reassure me greatly."
"The truth is that we create agencies when we do not exactly know how to address a problem."
"You therefore have a great responsibility and we expect you to make sure that this Commission is strong and that it respects Parliament, that it explains the Constitution, that it implements the Lisbon Strategy, that it pursues reforms leading to greater competitiveness, social cohesion and happiness for our citizens and that it addresses the Turkey issue objectively."
"The ‘yes’ vote that we will give you is not one of blind trust, but one of common sense."
"If your team responds to these challenges, it will have our trust. Please be aware, however, that, as in any relationship, trust is subject to constant review."
"I wish you good luck."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, your Commission is of a liberal persuasion, and I deplore that."
"But leaving aside that political persuasion, you are committing an institutional error by ignoring the true nature of the European Union’s institutional triangle, just as your predecessors did."
"Mr Santer fell because this Parliament had been too complicit, too indulgent for too long with regard to its natural ally, the Commission."
"Your direct predecessor, Mr Romano Prodi, arrived terrorised by this Parliament and wanted to ignore it for more than a year, until the day when he found himself powerless in the face of the European Council and was obliged once again to rely on the true power of this European Parliament."
"Today, you want to set up a special dialogue with the Council, but the Council is not there to support you at a time when you are involved in this difficult dialogue with our institution."
"So you are saying to us: ‘it is too late to change Commissioners or remodel portfolios’."
"If, however, it is too late, then what real power does this European Parliament have?"
"I hope we will demonstrate it tomorrow."
"Finally, you are making a fundamental mistake, because one of the essential powers of your Commission is the one it will exercise in the field of competition."
"From this point of view, your candidate is weak and will weaken your Commission’s power as a whole."
"An example of this is the idea that because a person has been a company director they will be a good Commissioner."
"Well, Mr President of the Commission, I can tell you that all our experience, at national level and at European level, suggests quite the opposite."
"The post of Commissioner is a political post for which we need people capable of carrying out their duties with complete independence and with an acute sense of the European dimension and interest, and not any individual interest."
"Madam President, the question is, in fact, whether or not a Commissioner can set aside his personal convictions when he is at work."
"As we are dealing with an area of policy that is very sensitive, namely civil rights, asylum policy, and immigration policy – an area of policy that will become more and more European in years to come, and so you need somebody on board who is the driving force behind that policy."
"Mr President of the Commission, or rather Mr President-designate of the Commission, you are implying, by the measures you have announced, that you do not have the right man for the job on your team."
"I still have my doubts."
"There are many reasons why I would like to vote in favour of your team, but there is one important reason why I hesitate to do so."
"I would therefore ask you to give me, before tomorrow lunchtime, arguments that will dispel my doubts."
"Madam President, the French Sovereignists will vote against the Barroso Commission and we have plenty of reasons for doing so."
"Firstly, there is the fact that this Commission is an administrative college which has absolutely no need to be invested and which need answer to nobody other than the political body of the Council."
"Furthermore, this team seems particularly mediocre, starting with yourself, Mr Barroso, who owe your election to your great skill in playing the waiting game."
"Furthermore, the composition of your Commission reflects a true deference to the United States, since the more countries have followed the United States, particularly in relation to the Iraq crisis, the better represented they are."
"In addition to this we have the choice of certain surprising characters: a Commissioner with very close links to multinational interests who is responsible for competition; an Ayatollah of the WTO and free trade who is responsible for commercial relations."
"Finally, if there were to be one single reason, it would be this, the most simple reason: in our opinion, Europe would be much better if there were no Commission at all."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate at least shows that the European Parliament is becoming more political and has more political power than is apparent from the Treaties."
"This is a further sign that, in terms of the way Europe works in practice, Parliament is often ahead of constitutional developments and it takes time for the Treaties to catch up."
"That is why, Mr Barroso, the CDU-CSU Group – and I mean all of its 49 Members – want you to take office and want you to work closely with the European Parliament, more closely than is laid down in the Constitution."
"Now the Socialists want to prevent you from taking office."
"They are clearly prepared to trigger a full-blown European crisis, even though the Chairman of the Socialist Group has taken the precaution of explaining that it would not be a crisis but a normal parliamentary act."
"The only problem is that it is so ‘normal’ that it has never happened before in Europe."
"And why?"
"There is only one reason for this that will stick in the mind of the general public and that is the fact that a candidate for the post of Commissioner dared to express his religious convictions."
"And, because this is what it is actually all about, I should like, once more, to make our position clear."
"We are in fact under an obligation to respect the principle of non-discrimination."
"The state has no right to poke its nose into such matters."
"Nobody should be discriminated against on the basis of their sexual orientation or their gender, either."
"That is what is stated in the Charter and in the Constitution."
"I thought this statement would have been greeted with applause; in any case, I can see heads nodding in agreement, and so I can tell you that what I just said was a quote."
"I quoted word for word what Mr Buttiglione said in the hearing."
"And that is what you are arguing about."
"It is laughable, ladies and gentlemen!"
"– Madam President, we will not, tomorrow, be able to vote in favour of the new Commission as it currently stands; there are too many question marks for that."
"There is one against the President, who unashamedly wishes to do as he pleases with this freely elected Parliament."
"There is another against Mr Buttiglione, who has drawn public attention and disqualified himself from the post of Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs by making unspeakably discriminatory remarks, and there are many more."
"I should like to single out Mrs Udre, the Latvian candidate."
"She is quoted as saying that the European Union as a whole is superfluous."
"At the hearing she praised improvements, but that is not enough."
"This Commissioner of all people, who is to be responsible for customs duties and tax, is not so very particular about money."
"The financing of her party is shrouded in mystery."
"There is compelling evidence of dubious relations with the Russian oil industry, which transports a large proportion of its oil to the West via Latvia, greasing many palms on the way."
"What the public expects of us is that we approve members of the Commission only if they are beyond reproach."
"In this case it is personal integrity that is lacking, and, along with the other question marks, this is a further reason to reject the whole Commission."
"– Mr Barroso, in July my colleague Mr Pannella and I declared our confidence in you but also suggested that you should add an agenda for democracy to your proposed agenda for peace and development."
"Perhaps we had the gift of premonition, because today we are in fact discussing whether our Union is a parliamentary democracy or not, whether Parliament’s prerogatives are being upheld by the President of the Commission, who is the guardian of the Treaties."
"To us, this certainly does not seem to be the case."
"It is not the Buttiglione affair that is at stake today but the Barroso affair, and that means the relationship between Commission, Parliament and Council."
"It is purely and simply the democracy of our European Union that is under discussion today."
"It is not an institutional crisis at all, but rather a mere political crisis which, I believe, may even have highly positive consequences."
"Mr Barroso, this Parliament and this parliamentary democracy are the essence of our European Union."
"– Madam President, Mr President-designate, this debate is taking place on the eve of the signing of the first European Constitution, on the eve of a historic event for our Union of 500 million people."
"Tomorrow’s Europe must take a leading role in international politics, in a fair, mutually supportive and balanced relationship with the United States, as you said yourself in your speech."
"That, Mr Barroso, is why we ask you to commit yourself to obtaining a seat for the European Union on the UN Security Council."
"We ask you to continue to make the Union play its part for peace in the Mediterranean, its face turned towards the south, towards the African continent."
"That is where future emergencies will lie; that is where we must seek solutions to problems; that is where we must act to address the urgent immigration question."
"The Europe that we need to develop within a framework of a balance of powers – between Council, Commission and Parliament – must also, however, be the homeland of rights, respect for people’s individuality, non-discrimination, subsidiarity, transparency and equal opportunities – in short, the homeland of freedom."
"The Barroso Commission is perfectly capable of steering Europe towards these goals and of protecting the interests, rights and freedoms of the people."
"I agree with your choices, Mr Barroso, just as I also agree with the Italian Government’s choice in appointing Mr Buttiglione as a member of this Commission."
"He is a European politician who is pro-Europe and who, as the Italian Minister for Community Policies, has demonstrated that he upholds the interests of the Union."
"I must remind this Chamber that the majority of the Members who listened to Mr Buttiglione in committee came out in favour of him as a candidate Commissioner – a Commissioner who must now and in the future be judged by what he does and not by his religious beliefs."
"Judging him and the entire Commission on the basis of this one factor would be an anti-European decision, and doing so on the eve of the signing of the Constitution would be not only a grave political mistake but also a serious blow to the European institutions."
"Mr President-designate, under my leadership the Italian delegation in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, places its trust in you and your Commission."
"We are sure that it will be a factor for change in the institutional framework."
"Good luck, Mr Barroso."
"– Madam President, this is the first time such a political crisis has come about following the hearing of the Commissioners, especially in the Commission as a whole."
"This is an institutional confrontation between the three Community institutions, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"The crisis in question, of course, was started by the Council itself but I think that you, Mr Barroso, with your stand today and with what has been promised, will perpetuate this crisis, without having understood that, if the Commission continues on this course, you will end up becoming a punch bag between the European Parliament and the Council."
"I should also like to say that this crisis is not present only in Buttiglione's policies and communications; it is also present in the poor performance of numerous Commissioners, such as those in charge of competition, agriculture and taxation, who were unable to convince the members of their committees of their perspectives and political commitments."
"Madam President, the President-designate of the Commission called on Parliament to be responsible on this issue."
"I agree with him."
"But that does not necessarily go in your favour, Mr Barroso."
"We are not judging or voting here on the religious beliefs of anyone."
"We are judging your Commission's commitment to fighting for the basic values of the European Union and your Commissioners' ability to implement policies based on principles that they do not believe in and do not support."
"We are judging whether this Parliament has a decisive voice in Europe's political future, or whether we want it to be reduced to an advisory board within the Council."
"Finally, we are judging your own respect for Parliament and your independence from individual governments."
"It is time to be serious, that is true."
"It is time to show citizens our commitment to democracy and our commitment to them, and thereby to strengthen Europe."
"Whatever happens, this will not be an institutional crisis; it will be a development of democracy."
"Mr President of the Commission, on behalf of the Polish delegation in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I should like to pay tribute to the way in which you are performing your duties."
"We are paying close attention to your initial actions, and in our opinion these actions are convincing and demonstrate the will of the strong leader we need."
"We believe that under your Presidency the European Commission should place particular emphasis on three points."
"These are completing enlargement, standing by the principles of solidarity and cohesion, and developing the EU’s eastern dimension."
"The first challenge will be to involve the new Member States in all aspects of EU policy."
"Enlargement of the institutions has now taken place, but a great deal more work and time is needed for the new Member States to achieve full rights and equal treatment."
"Only then will it be possible to regard enlargement as being complete in the real sense of the word, and not merely in the institutional sense."
"The second task is to close the economic gap and to ensure social and economic cohesion within the EU, in the name of the principle of solidarity."
"Your most immediate challenge will be to convince the Council of the need to ensure the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective does provide for a correlation between the EU’s increasing number of tasks and competences and the funds necessary to implement them."
"‘You cannot have more Europe for less money’, as you said before this House in July, and we expect you to remain true to these words."
"The current enlargement is very cheap, but attempts should not be made to make it even cheaper, thus depriving the EU’s poorest countries of the chance to overcome the development gap, a chance that was given to other countries."
"Your Commission’s goal should be to implement the Prodi Commission’s proposal for a budget based on 1.24% of gross domestic product."
"We also expect you to keep the promises you made to the House in this regard."
"The third issue is that of the EU’s eastern dimension and its new neighbourhood policy."
"We need a policy that is generous but not permissive, and one that is demanding and effective."
"We hope you will have confidence in us, and we intend to vote in favour of your Commission, including Mr Buttiglione."
"I thank you."
"– Mr President of the Commission, you said that the Commissioner-designate Mr Buttiglione had been successful in one hearing and had failed in another."
"I fear that this is a further example of your not listening carefully to Parliament, because the letter from the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs also definitely contained critical remarks."
"Personally, I very much regret the fact that Mr Buttiglione would not, or could not, take the opportunity of a second hearing in the Legal Affairs Committee, but he did clearly emphasise to that committee that his religious views were not in fact simply private views but principles that he wanted to guide his political actions."
"He would want to assess proposals that ran counter to his personal convictions and proposals from other Commissioners on the basis of his private ideas."
"Personally I am in no doubt that this goes beyond any definition of what private views are."
"I should also like to say that I am still waiting for an apology for the attacks on the Commissioner-designate Mr Špidla."
"Madam President, Mr Barroso, you were appointed as Commission President after many meetings, negotiations and compromises behind the closed doors of the Council."
"That is not an ideal way to proceed."
"The questioning of the remainder of the Commission is a way of democratising the whole of this process."
"The procedure is fully open and is followed with great interest by the media and the general public."
"It forces each Commissioner to reflect upon his or her visions and ideas."
"Many members of governments would not have survived such scrutiny."
"Now, one of your Commissioners has been rejected for the first time."
"It is someone who would be in an extremely sensitive post, with responsibility for controversial issues concerned with discrimination, civil rights, refugees, police cooperation and the fight against terrorism."
"There are many of us who do not have confidence in the person who would be responsible for these issues, which would be at the centre of European debate."
"Unlike the Eurosceptics in this House, we believe in a strong Commission."
"We want constructive cooperation with the Commission, but we cannot support a Commission with Mr Buttiglione still in this post."
"Replace him, and we shall support you."
"In my opinion, Mr Barroso is a capable politician, a politician who can find new solutions and a politician who will shake up EU structures which have become rusty around the edges, particularly in economic terms."
"I therefore believe that he must be given a chance, and that his authority should not be undermined at the very outset."
"We should also not allow this House to become an arena for domestic political battles, and instead we should seek a constructive and positive solution, and not allow ourselves to be manoeuvred into a crisis."
"Mr Barroso will therefore have the support of the Czech delegation in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"I should further like to note that Mr Barroso spoke before this House as a guardian of the Treaties and as a guardian of the spirit of the European Treaties, and this is something which I welcome."
"I should also like to point out that the Treaties state clearly that any amendments to them must be agreed unanimously, and that this also, above all, applies to the European Constitution."
"It would require only a single state not to ratify this Constitution for it to be nullified."
"It is therefore unacceptable that various politicians should make statements to the effect that it is immaterial whether one, two or three states do not ratify the Constitution, and that its validity will anyway be unaffected, or even that any state which fails to ratify the Constitution will have to leave the European Union."
"I hope that the Commission will support clearly the position set out in the existing Treaties, that it will state its opposition to flexible interpretations of the Treaties and to statements such as those mentioned above, that it will signal clearly its preparedness for an alternative scenario in which the European Constitution does not enter into force, and that it will be willing to help find a solution to such a future scenario, not that I would wish to anticipate it."
"I therefore hope that the Commission will act as a catalyst for constructive debate on the European Constitution, and that it will play a positive role in this debate."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, investing means having confidence."
"When we do not have confidence, we do not invest."
"So what are our reasons?"
"I cannot condone your presence in the Azores."
"Since then we have found out that the war in Iraq was based on a lie and, to use an expression which has been used a lot, do not forget the Ten Commandments."
"To lie is a sin: with a grain of repentance on this issue, you could have earned a tiny bit of neutrality from quarters other than those which are supporting you today."
"Secondly, the team: everything possible has been said about the team, or almost."
"You could have won a grain of confidence if you had changed part of it."
"You announce an agency, but you keep the money."
"That is of no use to anybody."
"Clemenceau, in France, used to say: ‘When I want to bury a problem, I create a commission’."
"I have the impression that we can already express our condolences."
"And then there is your orientation."
"You could have sent a small signal to the left of this House by saying: more public services in order to counterbalance competition;"
"Even with the Commission you propose, you could have made a few gestures."
"You have not done so, and you will therefore not have neutrality."
"Madam President, we are not persecuting Mr Buttiglione, but trying to save European citizens from being led on justice issues by someone so eminently unsuitable."
"It is not only that he is prepared to implement his reactionary prejudices against women and gay people in public policy – and what signal is he sending to his eight female colleagues? – he also has a very poor record on asylum and immigration, security and the rule of law."
"You gave us a list of initiatives the Commission would take, but they are already in progress, or should be priorities in any case."
"Mr Barroso, you say that it is impossible to change the portfolio at this stage."
"You are thereby showing complete contempt for this Parliament, since it is precisely what it has asked for."
"You need to stand up to the Council."
"I backed you in July because I thought you would be independent."
"I understand that Mr Blair is personally phoning around British Labour MEPs to try and twist their arms so that they do not vote against."
"He would be better using taxpayers' money on his phone bill telling his mate, Mr Berlusconi, to switch his candidate."
"– Madam President, one of the basic conclusions which can be drawn from the recent hearings of the Commissioners-designate is that the role of our Parliament has been confirmed because, in previous similar proceedings, the Commissioners-designate were not subjected either to such substantial or to such extended and penetrating hearings."
"However, what is of decisive importance is the Commission's clear and honest intention to cooperate with the European Parliament."
"In this way, the two institutions will acquire a stronger role and a stronger place in the mind of the citizens."
"Let us not beat about the bush."
"The basic criticism was with Mr Buttiglione."
"Of course, Mr Buttiglione used certain expressions which were unfortunate, but his letter of explanation and the President's personal guarantees have convinced me that Mr Buttiglione will not mix his religious or philosophical views with the exercise of policy."
"I personally believe that the new Commission will consist of people who are able to meet the challenges of the next five years, which is why we MEPs of the Greek New Democracy Party will vote in favour of it."
"Of course, our vote for the Commission will not give it ; on the contrary, we shall monitor their work closely, in order to safeguard a successful response to the challenges it has to face."
"Mr President of the Commission, in June we Spanish Socialists offered you an opportunity."
"I must tell you that you have not taken it."
"Furthermore, since we are talking about the Constitution, we should remember that the PPE asked that its approval be brought forward and that the results of the elections be taken into account."
"The PPE coalition received 36%, the Socialists, 27%."
"Precisely for that reason we gave you that opportunity."
"But there is another golden rule in the Constitution, and that is that Europe, Parliament and the Commission, operate in terms of the budget and codecision by absolute majority."
"And that must be the rule, and it cannot be resolved simply by means of telephone calls to the members of the Council."
"Today, three months after being voted in, you are proposing a team to us and in three months time you will propose a programme."
"This will have to be dealt with in the future, but, in any event, you have said something important today: you promise to remodel your Commission if we vote for you."
"The problem is that, right now, we do not trust you after what happened in July."
"With a view to the application of the Constitution and also for the sake of democracy, we are offering you the opportunity to take account of this Parliament’s constructive comments following a ‘no’ vote from this House."
"Madam President, we Swedish Moderates are adopting a position on the Commission as a whole."
"We do not want to help bring about a situation in which voting in this House is on the basis of the private opinions or moral views of individual Commissioners."
"We do not like the views of a number of the individual Commissioners."
"It surprises me a little that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has not presented any criticism at all of the nominated Commissioner who has still been unwilling to repudiate the Prague invasion of 1968 and who knew nothing about his own political area."
"We dislike some of the views expressed by individual Commissioners, but we assess the Commission as a whole, and largely in the light of the fact that we also think it only right that the individual countries should be able to nominate their Commissioners if European cooperation is to work."
"Our task would be a hopeless one as far as European cooperation is concerned if religious views and private moral opinions were to be presented at European level for judgment in this Parliament."
"Our task would also be a hopeless one if Parliament were to reject the candidates presented by the various countries’ governments."
"We shall therefore support the Commission with President Barroso at its head, partly in view of the fact that there is now a long list of important tasks before us."
"There is the new Constitutional Treaty."
"We have to ensure the success of the enlargement that has now taken place and to negotiate successfully with new candidate countries, especially Turkey."
"The Lisbon process too has to succeed."
"We do not intend to conduct a discussion that leads to Europe’s failing to make this process succeed."
"We give Mr Barroso our support."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Barroso, I am a journalist who has been prevented from continuing to do his job."
"In Italy, the Prime Minister controls money, politics and television."
"I believe, however, that it is up to the Italians to put an end to this aberration, to turn the page and to put their country back on track for the future."
"The Buttiglione affair, in contrast, is mostly up to you. First, because it did not arise out of prejudice or religious conflict but out of the Commissioner-designate’s own words and actions, which have revealed him to be totally unsuitable."
"He would also have appeared unsuitable to Jesus Christ and not just to homosexuals and women, since Jesus taught that only he who was without sin could cast the first stone."
"You are trapped by a diktat from the Italian Government which prevents you from finding a reasonable and dignified political solution."
"The shadow of a great many conflicts of interests hangs over your Commission."
"The conflict of interests of a government, however, is not just a shadow but rather a boulder, which is why I do not think that voting against you would be damaging to the Union."
"You could have avoided the situation but you did not, and so you end up by ripping up your promises of autonomy and independence from the national governments in this same Chamber where you made them, before this same Parliament that you had vowed to respect."
"Madam President, I will be supporting the new Commission tomorrow at the vote in the European Parliament, but my heart is heavy."
"The success of the European project rests on tolerance of diversity and difference and, if necessary, agreeing to disagree."
"Issues of personal morality are not matters to be legislated for by the Commission, nor for us here; they are for our national governments and private individuals to decide."
"While I have registered serious concerns about what I viewed as the reported lack of tolerance expressed by my former colleague Mr Buttiglione – a PPE-DE colleague for the last five years – in his statements on certain issues such as Baltic minorities, homosexuality and sinning, single mothers and fathers, I agree to support his candidature on balance."
"I accept his right to his strongly-held orthodox Catholic views."
"As a Catholic, I do not happen to share some of his very strong fundamental views on that matter, but we can agree to differ."
"That is what the whole principle of the European project is about."
"I have strong reservations in relation to up to five of the Commissioners, but based on his curriculum vitae and experience, Mr Buttiglione has the ability and aptitude for the job of Commissioner."
"Could it be, Mr Barroso, that he is the right man in the wrong job?"
"He has said that he will not change his principles or conscience for political convenience, and I would not expect him to do that, but it is going to be impossible for him in his particular portfolio, given the challenges that will be before him."
"There are so many issues before us."
"You have our support, Mr Barroso."
"Generally, you have a very good line–up."
"I would much rather be talking about problems of conflict of interest in relation to the Commissioner-designate for Competition, or ineptitude in relation to the Commissioner-designate for Energy."
"Madam President, I voted in favour of your appointment in July."
"I therefore regret the difficulty that we are experiencing in appointing the Commission that you are now proposing to us."
"You think that your strength comes from these strong-arm tactics with Parliament."
"You are mistaken."
"The problem is not only tomorrow’s vote."
"The problem is in ascertaining the political basis that will guide your term in office for the next five years."
"You think that you only need the Council’s support."
"You are mistaken."
"Look at how they have left you to your fate today."
"Your strength, and that of the Commission, comes from the confidence placed in you by both the Council and Parliament."
"Without Parliament’s solid support your Commission will always be a weak Commission."
"In the next twenty-four hours, do what you have to do to win Parliament’s solid support."
"If you do not make the most of this opportunity, do not play the victim or dramatise the rejection of the Commission."
"Please take such a rejection not as a personal defeat but as a clear mandate to obtain from the Council a Commission that is worthy of Parliament’s support."
"The decision right now is yours, and yours only."
"You must decide if you want Parliament’s support, or if you want to remain a hostage of national government proposals and, in particular, of those of the Berlusconi government."
"Please make the right choice, and we will be fine."
"Thank you."
"– Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, two things have become clear to me in this debate."
"Firstly, there is surely no doubt about the abilities of the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso."
"Secondly, in some cases we have got so carried away that we are no longer listening and are no longer capable of reading texts in full."
"We must therefore recognise that Mr Buttiglione stated that he is in favour of non-discrimination and in favour of compliance with the Charter, and that he draws a distinction between a moral code and a legal code to which I believe we could all subscribe."
"I have further observed in this debate that the lack of technical knowledge that has been noted here in the case of a few Commissioners appears, in many cases, to be completely irrelevant, provided – perhaps – that they are of the right political hue."
"In any case this issue has been pushed right into the background in today’s debate."
"This brings me to the conclusion that there are a number of Members for whom this decision is a decision about values: political correctness instead of an attachment to values that stem from a religious conviction."
"This is, I believe, a statement that it is not proper for us, as a Parliament, to make."
"It is our job to judge the knowledge that these people have of their subject and not their personal religious beliefs."
"I believe that this is an important and decisive point that we should keep to the forefront of our minds."
"That is why I believe that we need to have a bit more tolerance and liberality, rather than being slaves to the same, fashionable opinion."
"This is the point that we should keep in mind."
"And in the light of the fact that the Barroso Commission is actually giving ground to Parliament and doing good work on foreign policy, the Constitution, enlargement – which needs revitalising – the rights of the European Parliament and the Lisbon Process, I would make this appeal to my fellow Members: do not bring it down because of a difference of opinion over someone’s values."
"Madam President, when we elected you in July as the Commission’s future president, we Socialists asked you some hard questions."
"Nowadays, there are fewer questions, there are more disillusioned, embittered statements and these statements are based on experience."
"There is nothing wrong with what you say, or with what you said today."
"For you know exactly what needs to be said in this House and with imposing self-assurance you listed the encyclopaedia of European values and fundamental rights."
"There is, nevertheless, a problem with your decisions, the harmony between words and deeds."
"When allocating the portfolios you wanted to please Europe’s most conservative elements."
"So far you have not shown very much of the promised flexibility and tolerance and there is no guarantee that your deputy Commissioner-designate will not turn against the results achieved so far in Europe."
"We prepared for the birth of the first Commission of the 25 like a celebration."
"You have one day left to replace the tension and distress with the joy of celebration."
"We too have a conscience, not only Mr Buttiglione."
"The responsibility is yours."
"Madam President, I have been in this Parliament for some time and the honourable Members who know me are perfectly aware that I am not in favour of a complacent and docile Parliament which bows down to the Commission and the Council, but rather a Parliament which fulfils its responsibilities, which invests the Commission, rather than attacking it, which controls it democratically, which rejects, debates, ratifies and rectifies."
"In order to exercise its competences responsibly, however, this Parliament must be demanding rather than complacent, it cannot resort to haughtiness nor act with the arrogance of a mandarin."
"This means that if the Commission does not satisfy every one of our demands, we cannot simply refuse to invest it and send it out into the street."
"The Barroso Commission must be judged exclusively on its capacities and its competence, not on the personal, ethical or moral convictions of its members, because if we had followed that criterion, Madam President, we probably would not have been able to vote in favour of the President of the European Parliament."
"That is what is so great about our kind of tolerance, Madam President."
"I would like to say to the few members of the Liberal Group who are still here that they taught us a lesson in sensitivity and responsibility in July when they voted in favour of the President of the Commission, despite having been left outside the pact which led to the election of a Socialist President for this House."
"There are capable people in Mr Barroso’s Commission, former Members of this Parliament, who must be judged – I would insist – not on the basis of their personal opinions, but on their capacities and competence."
"I would therefore appeal to the members of the Liberal Group to consider their vote seriously, to reflect carefully and to consider the virtues of voting for this Commission."
"This is the best way to achieve the positive complicity which the President of the Commission has spoken about and which has led to the progress made by the European Union."
"– Madam President, the vote for the European Commission is of particular institutional and political importance."
"Unfortunately, the hearings have given rise to serious misgivings as regards the general political direction which the Commission will pursue in that, apart from a few shining exceptions, a strong neo-liberal perception prevailed, without any corresponding convincing social commitments."
"Our misgivings also arose as a result of the hearings on the questions of competition, taxation and agriculture, which require additional clarification and specific political commitments."
"However, what was decisive in shaping our position was the hearing on the questions of security, justice and civil liberties."
"The statements made by Mr Buttiglione touched at the very heart of our values for the European society we wish to build, a society we want to be mutually supportive, tolerant and non-discriminatory."
"Mr Barroso, our position is clear."
"Unless there is a material change in Mr Buttiglione's portfolio, we shall be obliged to vote against your Commission."
"You referred to the danger of institutional crisis."
"However, the exercise of the jurisdiction of the European Parliament, a jurisdiction provided for by the Treaty itself, cannot under any circumstances cause a crisis."
"On the contrary, it is an expression of democratic institutional function."
"The ball, Mr Barroso, is now in your court."
"You still have the opportunity, you have the jurisdiction to find an institutional and political solution to the situation which has arisen."
"Madam President, in common with you I have the honour and responsibility of taking part for the first time in the decision-making process regarding the European Commission of the enlarged European Union."
"I would like the European Parliament to perform this task with both dignity and credibility."
"I was happy to vote for the future President of the Commission, not because he is from the beautiful country of Portugal, but because he presented a vision worthy of support."
"Today he has reinforced that vision with a number of programme elements, with a clear desire for close collaboration with the European Parliament and also with the desire to lead the Commission in the spirit of the European Constitutional Agreement."
"I am not interested in discussing today the outcome of the American elections or the fate of Berlusconi, nor should we be going right back to Adam and Eve."
"We should be concerned with the future of the European Union and the strength of its Commission."
"It is not our role to make judgements about the personal views of the candidates but to decide on the competence of the proposed Commission."
"We have more than enough challenges ahead of us for us to be playing little games."
"I am not happy about much of what I have read about the hearings, either on the left or on the right."
"However, even if I did agree with the criticism, I cannot put the whole Commission at risk for the sake of one single majority vote in one of the committees for one of the candidates."
"If we adopt the practice of making judgements according to some ideological yardstick fuelled by one or two sentences, or quotes taken entirely out of context, we will have difficulty finding a candidate who would survive, as everyone has, at some time in their life, said something that could easily be the subject of long political debates."
"I will, of course, support a Commission which will operate in a collegial manner, based on the assurance of its President, and I wish it every success."
"Mr President of the Commission, in its capacity as guardian of the Treaties, one of the tasks of your Commission will be to continue the process of EU enlargement."
"This process involves an assessment of whether a candidate country respects human rights and whether it is transparent and free from corruption."
"I have serious doubts as to whether your Commission will be able to carry out this task well."
"I therefore feel bound to ask whether a Commissioner who has clearly shown that he does not understand, or does not wish to understand, the European system of human rights of which we are so proud, can be entrusted with carrying out an assessment of the extent to which human rights are respected in Romania, Bulgaria, and maybe even in Turkey."
"I have a second question to put to you too, Mr Barroso."
"The formation of your Commission is also a lesson in European democracy, and a lesson that citizens throughout the European Union are observing closely."
"What kind of a message are you currently sending out to citizens?"
"Why, that the opinion of the European Parliament need not be taken into account."
"Is this a positive message?"
"Does it bring the European Union closer to its citizens?"
"Is it the right kind of message to send out two days before the European Constitution is signed?"
"Mr Barroso, please listen to what the European Parliament has to say, rather than fighting against it."
"– Thank you."
"Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention for a moment before I give the floor to Mr Barroso."
"The formal sitting with the Queen of the Netherlands at 12 noon means that we will not be able to finish our debate, despite our efforts to be strict about time."
"The last three speakers will therefore take the floor after the formal sitting with the Queen of the Netherlands and after that we will begin the votes."
"I would crave your indulgence for this."
"Mr Barroso has the floor."
"Madam President, I do not have time in ten minutes to respond to all the questions, but I will try to respond to the fundamental issues."
"First of all, with regard to the doubts expressed about certain Commissioners, I went into detail at the meeting with the Conference of Presidents."
"In particular, in relation to the issue of independence in the competition portfolio, we will make public all the opinions of the legal services, which show that we can guarantee the independence of the Commissioner and the Commission on issues of competition."
"With regard to the accusations about the previous priority activities of one of the members of the Commission, despite what certain Members have requested, I cannot hold enquiries into the pasts of all the Commissioners-designate."
"It is not possible."
"I must take an objective view."
"You are well aware that, in political life, many of us are subject to unfounded accusations."
"I cannot accept a culture of intolerance, a culture of suspicion, simply because there are rumours or simply because there are attacks in our respective countries."
"Nevertheless, in the event that there is evidence of unacceptable practices, you may rest assured that I would have the means to act."
"I now come to the fundamental issue on which I very much wish to express my feelings: the institutional question."
"Ladies and gentlemen, before becoming Prime Minister, I was leader of the opposition."
"I am also a parliamentarian, I have a great respect for all genuinely democratic parliaments and a great respect for your Parliament."
"The debate has shown, however, that, on more difficult issues, particularly on the issue of the portfolio of Mr Buttiglione, there was a division."
"It is true, it exists: some of you are asking me to replace Mr Buttiglione and others are asking me not to replace him."
"There has been no common position at your Conference of Presidents, quite the opposite."
"You have sent me letters from all the committees."
"On the subject of Mr Buttiglione, I have received two letters: one said that he deserved your support and the other, but for one vote, said that he did not deserve it."
"In these circumstances, I must find a balance."
"As far as we are concerned, you have the right to represent all the peoples of Europe, I know this and I respect it."
"I have the greatest respect for you."
"The European Union requires a difficult balance, however."
"The governments also have the right to represent the nation states and I myself, or the Commission once invested, must think of the general European interest."
"I can tell you, in all honesty, that it was precisely by considering the general European interest, not the interest of any particular State or of any particular electorate, that I came to the conclusion that the best solution was, I believe, the one I have proposed to you."
"I have not given way entirely to those who wanted a shake-up, it is true, but I have gone a long way towards dealing with your concerns and I have given significant guarantees with regard to the substance, fundamental rights, civil liberties and non-discrimination."
"I believe I have been very clear and I can tell you that my Commission, if you place your trust in it, will be the most advanced Commission in terms of freedoms, civil rights and non-discrimination, as demonstrated by the composition of my Commission."
"To be very frank, ladies and gentlemen, I expected certain criticisms, particularly from those of you who were opposed to my investiture from the outset."
"I expected ideological criticisms, but the only criticism of my Commission I did not expect was the accusation of a lack of commitment to human rights and non-discrimination."
"Our attachment to those values can be seen in the very composition of the Commission."
"I must therefore ask for your trust, because I have sought a balance."
"It is necessary to seek a balance, not just the balance between the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission, but also a balance within this Parliament."
"Are the honourable Members who are critical of my choice sure that if I were to grant your request, the other side of the House would support the Commission?"
"After all the consultations I have held, particularly with the leaders of the political groups represented here, I am convinced that any other approach could lead to a crisis."
"That crisis could be resolved, I am sure: in a democracy, all crises can be resolved."
"I would, however, ask you, ladies and gentlemen, whether it is normal for those amongst you who are most committed to Europe to be able to vote now alongside extremists who do not want Europe, members of the extreme right who are against Europe, people who are completely opposed to the advancement of our European project..."
"Do you not find it strange that populists, those who wage a constant battle against the credibility of our institutions, can vote against this Commission alongside committed Europeans, as most Members of this House are, I am sure?"
"So, ladies and gentlemen, I am committed to respecting the principles of institutional balance."
"I have made a great effort to deal with your legitimate concerns, but I must tell you, quite responsibly, that European culture is also a culture of tolerance and compromise."
"It is not a question of demanding everything you want from the other party."
"I do not want a show-down with Parliament, because I am well aware that you represent the peoples of Europe, but what I can tell you is that we must move forward and meet each other halfway in terms of our concerns."
"That is what we must do."
"Some people were against the Commission from the outset and now they have found an opportunity to gain more support."
"I would, however, say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that if this Commission does not receive the necessary support, I honestly believe it would be difficult to talk of victory for the one side or defeat for the other."
"It would be a bad moment for the whole of Europe."
"I do not believe we would be able to commit ourselves truly to what we need to do in terms of the harmonisation of the Lisbon strategy, the debate on the financial perspectives, the cohesion of our Union, making a great success of this enlargement, putting ourselves on an equal footing with the United States or holding a debate with Russia at the summit planned for November."
"I believe that would be bad for Europe."
"I have therefore fulfilled my responsibility and I believe that everybody should now fulfil theirs."
"I can tell you in all honesty, however, that you can count on me to work with you, in a spirit of compromise."
"I appeal to you to show the same spirit of compromise for the good of Europe."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, we will now suspend our debate for the formal sitting with the Queen of the Netherlands, after which the debate will resume with three further speakers."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Your Majesty, it is a great honour for the European Parliament to welcome you to this sitting of our Parliament."
"Your presence amongst us, Your Majesty, represents a significant milestone in relations between the European Parliament, the European Union and the Netherlands."
"Over recent months we have witnessed the work your country has done during its Presidency-in-Office of the Council, which will last until the end of the year."
"The skill of the Dutch Presidency has shown us that the size of a country bears no relation to the quantity or the quality of the work it can do."
"You have done an immense amount of tireless work, taking a pragmatic view and always working in favour of the European Union and the values on which it is based."
"Your Majesty, our institution is well aware of your personal work and your commitment to the least-favoured social classes."
"Your dedication to those who have little or nothing has always amazed us, and the love and profound respect your country feels for you and your family is testimony to the great work you do."
"Your Majesty, it is a great honour for me to offer you the floor of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, honourable Members, if we had to name one thing with which we identify most of all, it would probably be our mother tongue."
"It follows that all Member States value the fact that their language is recognised in the Union."
"Based on that achievement, I shall speak to you in Dutch today."
"At the same time, I am convinced that cooperation in Europe will increasingly demand that we make concessions in this area."
"If we do not want to turn the Union into a Tower of Babel …"
"we will need to make an effort to understand each other the best we can."
"In a multilingual Europe, it is therefore of great importance for young people, in particular, to be encouraged to speak one or more foreign languages in order to be able to talk directly to their fellow Europeans."
"It is precisely in a unifying Europe that good communication – the direct contact between people – forms the best basis for mutual understanding."
"In 1950, the Founding Fathers took the first initiative to set up the European Communities, which were the precursors of our Union."
"This idea appealed to the older generation, mainly, as a means of banishing war from our continent."
"To the younger generation, this was, above all, an inspiring ambition and a challenge."
"When I was 23, I was asked to deliver a speech on this very topic in front of an international group of young people who felt connected with this European ideal."
"They subsequently urged me not to remain stuck in the rhetoric, but to encourage young people in other countries to think together about Europe’s future."
"We set out on this task with much enthusiasm."
"Europe then offered us a whole new perspective."
"We saw the opportunity of communicating with our contemporaries, establishing contacts and developing initiatives together across the borders."
"What had started with such prosaic concrete building blocks like coal and steel, grew into a movement which would raze Europe’s dividing walls to the ground, would keep the peace and would inject renewed resilience and energy into our continent, certainly not, as Robert Schuman stated, as a – a leap into the unknown – but as a leap into a joint future which, this time round, was clearly defined and anchored in treaties."
"We, the young people in those days, were delighted to take part in this and thus help shape our own future."
"I made that speech at a , a European students’ congress, in Toulouse."
"When I re-read those words now, I recognise the enthusiasm in whose grip we were then."
"We admired the vision and courage of the Founding Fathers of the European Communities, but thought that the older generation was too much stuck in fine words and took too little action in order to actually establish European unity."
"During the final meeting at the congress, I stated ‘We should conclude that instead of common ambitions, it is only problems that are uniting Europe at the moment'."
"Fortunately, 43 years down the line, those words are no longer true."
"European unity has taken shape in a convincing manner and has become part of our life."
"There is little trace, though, of the enthusiasm of those days."
"Many are now critical and, above all, concerned about the obstacles that are yet to be negotiated."
"Sometimes, delivering on promises appears more difficult than at first thought, and unanimity about the course to be followed does not always last."
"Fortunately, we can establish that the looming problems are often the direct result of swift progress that has been made with European unification."
"Indeed, those in doubt overlook the many achievements that our countries have now made."
"The original idea – Europe’s unification – has taken off enormously, to an extent that would probably astound the great Founding Fathers back in the years following the catastrophic Second World War, despite their vision and ambitions."
"The Union has banned wars from its territory, has subordinated power to law, and has brought the participating countries unrivalled prosperity."
"Despite times of tardiness and misfortune, the unique European experiment has led to impressive results."
"The Union now unifies 25 European nations."
"As the first Head of State to address your House since the accession of the new Member States, I should like to express a heartfelt word of welcome to their representatives in this Parliament."
"Anyone who takes the European ideal to heart has looked forward to that moment."
"After all, your countries traditionally belong to Europe."
"Many have thrown off the yoke of years of oppression, which kept our continent divided in two camps."
"We have the deepest respect for the conviction and decisiveness with which they have done this."
"We also admire the untold efforts all countries have made to take the many and often far-reaching measures that were necessary to join the Union within a short space of time."
"Their joining has made the European family a , an extended family, as it is termed so enchantingly in French."
"We expect a great deal from this enlargement."
"The major contribution of the new Member States could well be that they introduce in the Union the same fervour which they demonstrated when they liberated themselves from Soviet rule and when they made the impressive efforts in preparation for membership."
"The Union as a whole will almost certainly find power and a source of inspiration in this fervour and enthusiasm with which you begin this new chapter, in many cases with the help of the younger generation."
"Anyone who joins a new family will always face problems of adjustment, certainly if the family is outside their own country."
"We in our family have some experience of this!"
"In most cases, the greatest adjustment is required from the newcomer, even though it would be fairer if this task were spread over both parties."
"This also applies to the enlargement of our Community."
"The new members will need to make an effort to fit into what already exists in the Union, but the older members will equally need to show willingness to adapt."
"That is not only the fraternal attitude one may expect in these circles, it is also the quickest way of securing good cooperation."
"The EU’s fundamental principle is that it is based on a Community of Law."
"The countries forming part of this, including those which were among Europe’s most powerful countries, have, in the interest of their common future, placed themselves under the authority of the law."
"This is a unique step in the history of Europe."
"This also entails respecting the rights of each individual citizen."
"This anchoring of the Union in the law is strikingly symbolised by its highest officials taking the oath in front of the entire European Court of Justice."
"Our 25 countries are united – but ‘in diversity’."
"They value their own identities, their own languages and their own cultural heritage."
"That is the great distinguishing power of Europe, and it is in the interest of all of us to guard and preserve this carefully."
"The constant confrontation with other cultures makes us more aware of both our own culture and our common heritage."
"As a result, we are also in a stronger position to face the spirit of materialism and mass culture which is undeniably spreading across the world in increasingly threatening forms."
"To be able to function effectively, the Union needs to have clear-cut powers in a number of areas."
"In other areas, where success is less dependent on the bundling of powers, it may prove useful, by way of counterweight, to leave more room for governments, local authorities and the citizens themselves to find their own solutions either at national level or at regional level."
"A good balance struck between central and delegated government can avoid the Union conjuring up the image of an all-encompassing bureaucracy that alienates people."
"If responsibilities are clear and are placed and carried where they best serve the Community, the citizens will have a better grasp of, and more respect for, the common interest."
"Europe is not so much about meeting a final objective as it is about the process of getting there."
"To some, the progress of this process is too slow, while to others, it is too fast."
"Success often attracts counter forces."
"These should not discourage us but rather encourage us to persevere."
"Sometimes, it is about waiting for the right moment."
"Rome was not built in one day."
"The same is true of the edifice that was founded on the Treaty of Rome."
"Our Union gains in strength if it opens itself up to countries that share our legal norms and commit to meeting the criteria."
"This awareness can be an encouragement to conduct the consultation with those wishing to join the Union in an open, fair and unbiased manner."
"If nations exert themselves to making the transition to the democratic form of government as effectively as possible, they deserve extra appreciation and support."
"In three days’ time, the Constitutional Treaty will be signed in Rome."
"The preamble contains the solemn declaration that Europe wishes to continue to apply itself to establishing peace, justice and solidarity in the world."
"That is a far-reaching ambition and is an indication that this organised Europe feels affiliated with the ideal of an equally organised world."
"We respect and support the United Nations as a global structure propagating those self-same principles."
"Peace is the primary condition if any progress and development are to be achieved."
"Peace is vulnerable and requires intensive care."
"The EU countries that have managed to keep the peace within their boundaries are now supporting peace operations in other parts of the world and are sending their troops to those regions for that purpose."
"With the Constitutional Treaty, our countries are giving a clear signal that they are taking responsibility in respect of the rest of the world and will continue unabatedly in their efforts to fight poverty, inequality and injustice."
"Ladies and gentlemen, honourable Members, there is on our continent a historical mental affinity, a feeling of togetherness which makes us Europeans."
"In the Treaties we have forged, we have each time described more clearly the civilisation we would like to live in."
"Our European institutions, including your Parliament, are the pillars of that civilisation."
"As you acquit yourselves of the challenging task to represent 450 million Europeans, I warmly wish you the inspiration that Europe requires of all of us today."
"Thank you very much for your words, Your Majesty."
"We now continue with the debate on the statement by Mr Barroso, President–elect of the Commission, presenting the College of Commissioners and their programme."
"Mr President, we all know that the Commission is made up of a President and 24 Commissioners, from different political backgrounds and with different personal beliefs, yet it has the legitimacy of having been proposed by democratically-elected governments."
"It therefore comes as no surprise that each of us appraises each of these Commissioners differently."
"That appraisal cannot, however, be based on their personal convictions or religious beliefs."
"If this were one day the case, this House would no longer be a Parliament but a court of opinion with a morbid taste for censure."
"Our appraisal must be based on the Commissioners’ skills, and at this point one should remember that in the hearings an 80% majority was in favour."
"At this time, what we must do is decide how Parliament will behave towards a Commission led by a strong President with a clear mission to ensure that the European project and the balance between the Member States will be safeguarded."
"We have seen in this debate that President Barroso was attentive to what the Members of this House were saying, and acted accordingly."
"He has made commitments to this House, not least in the area of non-discrimination, and has received a letter from each of the Commissioners, and this makes him worthy of Parliament’s confidence."
"What remains to be seen is whether Parliament is attentive to President Barroso’s message and also acts accordingly."
"It is understandable to vote against a Commission if one is not 100% in agreement with it."
"It is not understandable to vote against a Commission of 25 people if one disagrees with the religious beliefs of one of its members; that is intolerant."
"Mr Buttiglione was sincere when he expressed his beliefs, and I believe that he was sincere when he said that he would not mix his personal beliefs with his duties."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must judge the Commission and its Commissioners by their acts. Consequently, to put a Commission in an untenable position before it has taken up its duties, due to the religious beliefs of one of its members, is tantamount to prejudice."
"We will be carrying out our duties responsibly, however, if we assess it during the course of its mandate."
"Lastly, Mr President of the Commission, I do not know how tomorrow’s vote will go, but, coming from Portugal, I can tell you that you can count on our vote, and I hope that the Commission is not rejected because of 12 votes from the Portuguese left of this House."
"Mr President, Commission President Barroso, half of Europe’s citizens are women: women who have been told that, in marriage, they are to be provided for and subordinated and that single mothers are worse mothers."
"Those are not the EU’s values, and they are unacceptable."
"The same values and rights also apply to the EU’s homosexuals."
"According to the UN and the EU, human rights are also women’s rights. In the same way, the Lisbon strategy affirms women’s right to employment and to equal wages for work of equal value."
"These are facts and not just words, as you said in your introduction."
"The EU and the Commission must respect women for the sake of the EU and in the interests of an equal Europe with gender equality."
"You have not listened today, either, to ourselves as elected representatives of the people."
"More is the pity, Mr Barroso."
"– Mr President, Mr Barroso has presented the Commission as a single whole, a collegiate body, which is quite right, and he ties his political approach to that."
"The President of the Commission has accepted the governments’ nominations, but he has put his trust in his Commissioners because he, and he alone, is the guarantor of the programme: if Mr Barroso is the conductor of the orchestra, as Mr Cohn-Bendit says, it is he who must tune the instruments and tell us whether the musicians know how to play."
"Cultural arguments external to this Parliament and cultural intolerances that are foreign to this Parliament’s democracy must not be brought into this Chamber."
"A moralistic Europe, secularly fundamentalist in a way that Catholic culture never succeeded in being, is not part of the dream of Alcide De Gasperi or Robert Schuman, our forefathers, because it is an intolerant Europe."
"Tomorrow’s vote will be a vote for the truth, ladies and gentlemen."
"Those who have no regard for the people, those who have no political or social tolerance, those who have no regard for the institutions, will vote ‘No’."
"Those who believe in a liberal, tolerant, even-handed, persuasive and institutional Europe, in which the relationship between Parliament and government is one of democratic control and not control by bureaucrats or the unions, will vote for Mr Barroso in order to strengthen the balance among the twenty-five countries."
"In an interview released in Italy a few days ago, Jacques Delors said that the Commission is a collegiate body and does not provide for individual personalities."
"We, who always refer to what Mr Delors says, can on this occasion play our parliamentary role correctly by approving both the Commission as a whole and the commitment that its President has made before this House today."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote on the approval of the Commission will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Mr President, with your permission, I would like to raise a point of order."
"In his opening statement in the debate earlier on, Martin Schulz, Chairman of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, was being very condescending towards Her Royal Highness, Queen ...."
"– Mrs Kauppi, this is not a procedural matter."
"– We shall now proceed to the vote."
"It is clear that the amendments voted for or rejected have completely reversed the meaning of my report, since our Parliament believes it is not desirable for living beings to appear on the future notes of the European Union, that our difficulties are caused by excessively short working times in Europe and that, contrary to Article 2 of the Treaty, the Central Bank need not concern itself with sustainable growth."
"I would therefore urge that you vote ‘no’ to this report and if it is, unfortunately, adopted, which would send an immense signal about the future of Europe, I wish my name to be removed from the text."
"– That concludes the vote."
"We shall now proceed to the explanations of vote."
". I voted in favour of Mr Gargani’s report (A6-0012/2004) on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on pollution caused by certain dangerous substances discharged into the aquatic environment of the Community."
"I feel that the work begun by the Commission to simplify and clarify Community legislation is essential."
"I believe that this work is also highly valuable because it preserves in full the content of the codified acts; all it does is bring them together."
"It is crucial that Community legislation be made more accessible and easier for ordinary citizens to understand, as this will offer them new opportunities and the chance to enjoy the specific rights accorded to them."
". I share the Commission’s concern that, in order to make the EU more accessible to the general public, great emphasis should be placed on simplifying Community legislation."
"I believe that, in this way, ordinary citizens can be better informed as regards their duties and the rights they are accorded."
"The dispersed nature of Community provisions, and the fact that many of them have been repeatedly amended down the years, makes it extremely difficult to identify the rules in force, a task that requires considerable analysis and can virtually only be done by people with legal training."
"Consequently, and in order to ensure clarity and transparency in Community legislation, I believe that it is essential that Community legislation be codified, as provided for by the Commission in 1987 and by the Edinburgh European Council of 1992."
"Accordingly, I endorse the aim of the proposal before us, which is intended to set about codifying Council Directive 76/464/EEC of 4 May 1976 on pollution caused by certain dangerous substances discharged into the aquatic environment of the Community, replacing the previous dispersed legislative acts."
". I voted in favour of Mr Gargani’s report (A6-0011/2004) on the proposal for a Council directive introducing minimum Community measures for the control of certain diseases affecting bivalve molluscs (Codified version)."
"I feel that the work begun by the Commission to simplify and clarify Community legislation is essential."
"I feel that this work is also highly valuable because it preserves in full the content of the codified acts; all it does is bring them together."
"The aim of the proposal before us is to codify Council Directive 95/70/EC of 22 December 1995, establishing minimum Community measures for controlling diseases affecting bivalve molluscs."
"The new directive will replace all of the legislation incorporated therein."
"It is crucial that Community legislation be made more accessible and easier for ordinary citizens to understand, as this will offer them new opportunities and the chance to enjoy the specific rights accorded to them."
". I wish to reiterate the opinion expressed by the Commission that simplifying Community legislation will result in an EU that is more accessible to its citizens, who will in turn become better informed as regards their duties and rights."
"The dispersed nature of Community provisions, and the fact that many of them have been repeatedly amended down the years, makes it extremely difficult to identify the rules in force, a task that requires considerable analysis, and can virtually only be done by people with legal training."
"Consequently, and in order to ensure clarity and transparency in Community legislation, I believe that it is essential that Community legislation be codified, as provided for by the Commission in 1987 and by the Edinburgh European Council of 1992."
"Accordingly, as I did with proposal for a Directive 76/464/EEC, I endorse the aim of the proposal before us, which is intended to set about codifying Council Directive 95/70/EC of 22 December 1995, establishing minimum Community measures for controlling certain diseases affecting bivalve molluscs, replacing the currently isolated legislative acts incorporated therein."
"We are voting in favour of the cooperation agreements with Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Armenia in accordance with this report."
"The agreements should not be aimed at strengthening the EU’s foreign policy and the EU’s efforts to become a global player."
"The agreements should mainly emphasise economic development and respect for human rights."
". I voted in favour of Mr Brok’s report (A6-0023/2004) Partnership and Cooperation Agreements – on the proposals for Council and Commission Decisions on the conclusion of the Protocols to the Partnership and Cooperation Agreements between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, on the other part, to take account of the accession of the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia and the Slovak Republic to the European Union."
"These Partnership and Cooperation Agreements (PCAs) are ‘mixed’ agreements that entered in force before the last EU enlargement. The aforementioned agreements therefore require the addition of a protocol enabling the accession of ten new Member States to them."
"The Council has authorised the Commission to begin negotiations with these countries, on behalf of the Community and its Member States, with the aim of concluding protocols for the Partnership and Cooperation Agreements."
". The purpose of this report is to resolve a problem that arose due to the absence of a response from the Council to the creation of a new Regulation in the area of aid to uprooted people in Latin America and Asia."
"Given that the current Regulation expires at the end of the year, it must be extended, as it provides assistance to some of the most vulnerable groups in the world – those forced to flee their homes due to armed conflict."
"The aim of the assistance is to foster the voluntary return or integration of these groups into their host communities, either in their places of origin or to reconcile the parties to a conflict and to help uprooted people."
"Although we voted in favour of the report, which aims to limit its implementation until the end of 2006, requiring a new global process and a Commission report on implementing the regulation, there are questions that must be brought to the fore:"
"- the little importance the Council attaches to the issues of aid and cooperation;"
"- the contradiction in the positions taken by the Commission, which, on the one hand, proposes to extend the Regulation indefinitely, yet, on the other hand, only provides funding for it until 2006;"
"- the Council and the Commission’s contradictions as regards aid for cooperation and development, the funding for which is often reduced by being transferred to support for reconstructing countries ..."
"We believe that the European Union’s policy in the area of development needs to be reviewed."
"We are well disposed to humanitarian aid and to support for people in situations that make them vulnerable."
"We are nonetheless of the view that individual EU Member States should decide about the forms to be taken by their different commitments in terms of aid."
"The United Nations is the international organisation through which the Member States have the opportunity to coordinate their aid efforts."
"We are opposed to extending the EU’s competence to ever more areas and do not believe that aid is an issue for the EU."
"We have therefore chosen to vote against the proposed report."
". I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Morgantini (A6-0018/2004) on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 2130/2001 on operations to aid uprooted people in Asian and Latin American developing countries."
"I feel that the work being done by the European Community to help uprooted people of Asian and Latin American developing countries is crucial."
"Regulation (EC) No 2130/2001, of 29 October 2001, provides assistance to some of the most vulnerable groups in the world – those forced to flee their homes due to armed conflict."
"This Regulation expires on 31 December 2004, and states that extending it depends on the possibilities for ‘integrating this Regulation within a single framework Regulation for Asia and Latin America’."
"This inconvenience may be averted by reducing the period of validity to two years – 2005 and 2006."
"I feel that this amendment is essential for the Community’s work with these communities to continue."
". I welcome the support of the Committee on Development for the Commission’s proposal aimed at extending the application of the existing Regulation on uprooted people – comprising refugees, displaced persons forced to take refuge outside their place of origin and former refugees or displaced persons – and ‘demobilised former soldiers’."
"This instrument, which falls within the EU’s broadest policy on development assistance and aid, is extremely important and is so often the only hope, and the last hope, for thousands of people in particularly precarious situations."
"I also welcome the trend in recent years towards gradually increasing appropriations."
"Experience has shown the significant help provided by this type of action in preventing conflict, in reconciling the parties to a conflict, or in helping uprooted people or demobilised former soldiers to recover their personal effects and their property rights, and often represents their last hope of a fresh start."
"– We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have just voted in favour of the report as a whole."
"We would like to stress, however, that we voted against publishing the outcome of individual votes in the ECB."
"Despite this one vote against, we nevertheless approved the overall report."
"We are, however, against the publication of individual votes."
"The choice of the Swedish people is that their country should not enter the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union and introduce the euro."
"In spite of this, we ought to have views on the work of the ECB when it comes to actions that also affect the countries outside the eurozone."
"The June List believes, however, that we should not adopt positions on the more specific proposals affecting the work of the ECB or the way it is set up, and we therefore choose not to adopt positions on the amendments before us."
"We cannot however support paragraph 14, according to which Parliament wants to see increased propaganda for the euro."
"Nor do we wish to support paragraph 15, according to which Parliament wishes all the old, and also the new, Member States to adopt the euro."
"Sweden wishes to reserve the right to stay outside the eurozone."
"We wish to emphasise that it is especially important for new countries strictly to comply with the requirement that the public debt’s share of GDP should not exceed 60%."
"This requirement should not be applied as loosely as on previous occasions."
"That is important in terms of the whole EU’s financial stability."
"I am voting against the report on the activities of the ECB."
"The report endorses the ECB's monetary policy, despite the fact that it is partly responsible for the lack of growth in Europe and for a situation unfavourable to employment."
"In fact, the ECB has rejected any strategy likely to favour a euro-dollar parity more favourable to exports and industry, in particular with a view to preventing too significant a fall in the dollar."
"In a similar way, the ECB appears to have refused to tackle parities with currencies such as that of China."
"These parities hinder our exports and favour relocations (in many cases, this has more to do with the competitiveness of companies than do labour costs)."
"Its attitude makes it clear that the ECB does not have full employment as an objective."
"I regret that the draft Constitution does not in any way change the situation and allows complete independence to continue without balancing the objectives of price stability and employment."
"In conclusion, nothing about the situation in the eurozone can justify this blank cheque for the ECB."
"Inflation has picked up – and whatever some people may have said, the introduction of the euro has unfortunately led to a rise in prices - exchange rates remain high and growth is weak."
"I have just voted in favour of the report on the ECB, from which Mr Lipietz has removed his name."
"I was opposed to all of the amendments that would have led to its being watered down."
"The ECB has done a very good job: it has maintained price stability and always safeguarded its independence."
"In so doing it has won the confidence of the public and thus overcome much opposition to the euro."
"We have reason to thank the former President, Wim Duisenberg: Jean-Claude Trichet is continuing where he left off."
"As the independence of the ECB’s Executive Board must be preserved, I think it would be wrong to publish the results of roll-call votes."
"There is sufficient transparency because the public and Parliament are informed directly of its decisions on monetary policy."
"The quarterly ‘monetary dialogue’ with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and our visits to Frankfurt deserve to be given wider public exposure."
"The ECB’s commitment to the Stability and Growth Pact is exemplary."
"It rightly points out that any patches of weak growth in the eurozone have not been caused by the Pact, which brings sustainable, inflation-free growth because of its insistence on sound budget management."
"The ‘intelligent new interpretation’ being advocated by the EU Commission is an unintelligent manipulation of the principles of the Pact and gives tax evaders an improper alibi."
". – The creation of the euro was identified in the mind of the workers with a wave of rises in the prices of basic consumer goods, with a harsh austerity policy and with rising unemployment and poverty for workers and benefits for employers."
"The European Central Bank pioneered the pressure to squeeze wages, to reduce social spending and to change the insurance system for the benefit of private capital."
"The European Central Bank's exclusive focus on the objective of price stability not only failed as regards basic consumer goods, it also contributed towards the emergence of worse working and living conditions for workers, more difficult access for small and medium-sized enterprises to the money market and the redistribution of wealth for the benefit of big business."
"The single currency policy has proven to serve the united interests of big business and to exacerbate the significant differences which exist between national and local economies, putting the burden on the shoulders of the working and grass-roots classes."
"We are and we always have been opposed to EMU because we support the workers' interests."
"Today, the 'vision' of the euro has turned into the nightmare of the grass-roots family, which is why we are voting against the annual report of the European Central Bank, which has helped to increase unemployment and the social problems which blight the lives of grass-roots families."
". I voted in favour of the report before us, because I believe, as the report says, that after five years, Economic and Monetary Union can thus far be considered an enormous success, thanks largely to the work of the European Central Bank and its predecessor, the European Monetary Institute."
"It should be acknowledged that this is due to the diligence of Member States – particularly Member States such as Portugal – that have made sterling efforts to comply with the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Nevertheless, also in accordance with the report, I recognise that the fragility of the European economy is not the result of its monetary policy, but is essentially due to the absence of structural reforms aimed at greater international and global competitiveness."
". The report before us, strengthened in the final version that was rejected by the rapporteur, portrays Economic and Monetary Union as a ‘success story’ and offers unconditional support to the monetary orthodoxy pursued by the European Central Bank."
"This is not a story that tells the truth as we understand it, and so we have rejected it."
"People talk about the success of macroeconomic stability, yet there is proof that recent years have been characterised by slow economic growth and rising unemployment, and by the transfer of the workers’ productivity gains to the employers; there are still high levels of unemployment, poverty, social exclusion and salary inequality in the EU; restrictive monetary and fiscal policy have had a negative effect on economic growth and on employment, instead of helping economic recovery and combating unemployment."
"The EU is a long way from being a homogenous economic area, given that considerable discrepancies still exist between Member States as regards the level of economic and regional development, of inflation and unemployment."
"These discrepancies have been exacerbated by the single monetary policy and the cost of economic adjustments has been passed on to salaries and jobs, to the workers and the people."
"Let us also not forget the inflationary effects of the euro on essential items and on bank rates and commissions that are not subject to suitable scrutiny."
". I endorse various comments made by the rapporteur in his appraisal of the activities of the European Central Bank (ECB)."
"I agree that the ECB has been a factor in institutional and economic stability and that it has met the majority of its objectives."
"It seems, however, increasingly peaceful – particularly given the increasing importance accorded to this body – that its mandate also encompasses ‘specific support for the Lisbon objectives’."
"Accordingly, it is important that we pursue more actively monetary and currency policies that promote the objectives of full employment based on competitiveness, of support for investment, and of combating the effects on the market of extremely high oil prices."
"Lastly, I should like to highlight the fair criticism made by the rapporteur regarding the fact that many banks still charge a commission on transfers and exchanges of cheques between countries in the Eurozone. Indeed, ‘as long as this is the case there will never be a ‘single currency’."
"I regret that the rapporteur distanced himself from the adopted resolution during the final vote – and I find it strange that he left it until then to do so – because the adopted text does not differ a great deal from what had come from the committee concerned."
"Mr President, in my opinion, the way in which Martin Schulz, Chairman of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, set out to criticise the Dutch Presidency for not being present at the debate earlier on was most inappropriate."
"The fact that he directed his remarks at Her Royal Highness, Queen Beatrix, was most inappropriate on a day when we were having a ceremonial debate in the presence of Queen Beatrix."
"It is not appropriate for him to attempt, for political reasons, to attack the Dutch ..."
"– Mrs Kauppi, excuse me for interrupting you, but what you are saying is not procedural."
"We will now move on to the next item, which is a joint debate on two reports on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the draft general budget for 2005."
"Firstly, the report (A6-0021/2004) by Mr Garriga Polledo on the draft general budget for 2005 (Section III);"
"and the report (A6-0020/2004) by Mrs Elisabet Jensen on the draft general budget for 2005 (Sections I, II, IV, V, VI, VII and VIII)."
"There is a long list of speakers for the debate on these items, and I should like to ask the rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, to take the floor."
". Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the September part-session we said that the draft budget presented to us by the Council took an accounting approach rather than a political approach."
"On Thursday we will vote here in Parliament on a clearly political reading of the budget."
"It is political in that it reflects the political priorities on the basis of which the parliamentary groups and Members stood for the European elections on 13 June."
"And we must remember that it was Parliament – the honourable Members – who stood for those elections, not the Council."
"All the honourable Members have thereby made commitments to the electorate which include defending and promoting measures which I hope are reflected in the draft budget I am presenting for your approval."
"It is also political in that it responds to one of the Council’s habitual strategies, which is to fund its own priorities before it funds Parliament’s."
"In other words, through the vote on Thursday we shall try to create an interinstitutional balance, and without that balance the European Union cannot function properly."
"I would like, Mr President, to address a few words to the Commissioner, because today is her last day as a member of the European Commission."
"The Commissioner for Budgets always has a very difficult role to play between Parliament and the Council – two budgetary authorities which have no choice but to reach agreement, although on occasions it seems that agreement is a very long way off."
"The Commissioner is to a large extent responsible for the budgetary peace over recent years and I would, therefore, like to point out that, thanks to the agreements she and her team have presented at the last minute, we have managed to resolve certain complicated situations."
"I hope that she will be just as successful over the coming years in her new life beyond Brussels."
"In any event, I want you to know that it has been a pleasure for everybody involved in the budget to work with you."
"The patience and negotiating skills of the outgoing Commissioner – and of the new one, let us hope – are going to be required for this first reading of the European Parliament, because it is very different from the first reading by the Council."
"As rapporteur and a veteran member of the Committee on Budgets for ten years, I am perfectly able to distinguish between the limits of what may be required and those of political reality."
"But this House has positions on certain items it will not relinquish."
"The reality is that the European Parliament is defending its priorities at a time when the budgetary situation is very difficult and very restrictive."
"In general terms, we accept the Commission's preliminary draft budget as amended by the competent committees, the political groups and individual Members who have proposed amendments."
"You are already aware that there has been a technical adjustment to the maximum limits of Headings 3, 4 and 5, which in themselves create an almost insoluble problem in terms of achieving the figures for the 2004 budget."
"Mr Mulder – rapporteur for the 2004 budget – did a brilliant budgetary job."
"I am trying to do the same thing this year, although I am aware that the financial resources available to me are less than last year."
"The Council has cut internal policies by EUR 55 million from the preliminary draft budget, creating an impossible margin of EUR 108 million."
"The amendments which the honourable Members have presented to this draft budget, in this Heading 3 alone, represent more than EUR 350 million."
"And every single amendment is perfectly justified."
"The Council has cut external policies by EUR 129 million in comparison with the Commission’s preliminary draft budget, leaving a margin of 14 million, when the negative margin in committee was EUR 115 million and that already seriously jeopardised Parliament’s traditional external priorities."
"The amendments to this Heading 4 represent more than EUR 400 million, and I must consider them, in part, because they fundamentally respond to the wishes expressed by two important parliamentary committees: the Committee on Development and the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"In Heading 5 – the heading in which agreement may, in principle, have seemed the easiest to reach – the Council took it upon itself to make cuts which reduced the administrative spending of the Commission and the other institutions to one and a half points below the amount provided for in the Commission's preliminary draft and it is very difficult – as the Commissioner well knows – to maintain an administrative budget calculated to the last penny, if another institution then comes along and reduces it."
"Thank heavens that the Commission – and I would congratulate the Commissioner once again in this regard – has managed to make an additional effort to save without reducing efficiency."
"In any event, I would like to say that the European Parliament wishes to re-establish the administrative spending laid down in the preliminary draft budget."
"Given these circumstances, we have had to establish a series of priorities. They are the following:"
"Firstly, the Lisbon strategy and its job creation and growth policies, because they are included in practically all the political programmes on the basis of which the honourable Members stood for election."
"At a time of difficult and weak economic growth in the European Union, it would be suicidal not to strengthen those policies which are aimed precisely at growth, development and job creation."
"We have therefore voted for amendments which increase these lines relating to the Lisbon strategy by EUR 80 million."
"Secondly, communications strategy, in particular, because of the European elections and the low turnout at those elections, because of our enlargement and the need to explain the idea of the Union much better to the new citizens and because we are in the midst of a constitutional debate on the future of the European Union, this is another priority for Parliament and we have, therefore, presented an amendment to the tune of EUR 24 million."
"Thirdly, strengthening security, the fight against terrorism and the consolidation of a European immigration and asylum strategy."
"I believe this is a priority for all of you and, unfortunately, there is no need to explain why it must be a priority for Parliament and the European Union in 2005."
"Fourthly, another of our fundamental priorities is the consolidation of the European Union's external action, with a particular emphasis on combating disease and poverty and assistance for geographical regions."
"In this regard, we follow the principle that the European Union's new commitments cannot be achieved at the expense of Parliament's traditional priorities, or to put it another way, new commitments require new resources."
"Fifthly, we want a very serious debate with the Council on the funding of the decentralised Agencies, which I shall analyse later."
"I would like to emphasise the support received by the political groups in translating the priorities into budgetary amendments."
"From the other coordinators I have received nothing but support and positive suggestions."
"They have all sacrificed other priorities and they have all had to offer their colleagues complicated explanations of the decisions taken."
"And this is a message I would like to make very clear to the Commission and the Council: this first reading expresses a clear and unequivocal political compromise for the November negotiation."
"We are not going to vote for a second reading which abandons our priorities unilaterally."
"If there are going to be any sacrifices, they must be made by all the institutions, by all of them."
"Let us now move on to the reading by headings, remembering that the vote the European Parliament will take on Thursday will be on the budget as a whole and that, as such, when it comes to the negotiation, we will take it to the three-way dialogues and to conciliation."
"In Heading 1 – Agriculture – we have voted for EUR 50 779 million in commitment appropriations."
"Our reference has been the preliminary draft budget presented by the Commission, but we still have to provide the appropriations necessary to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria."
"In subheading 1b) we have a political priority expressed by the Committee on Budgets and which, as such, will be included in the vote on Thursday."
"According to that, we raise the sum of EUR 57 million above the maximum limit of subheading 1b), the item which would go to the establishment and training of young farmers."
"We have also increased appropriations on measures to eradicate animal diseases and food safety, because they are also Parliament’s priorities."
"In Heading 2 we are going to vote for EUR 42 378 million in commitment appropriations."
"Payments are the essential in this category, the category in which the amendments we present on payments have the greatest impact."
"In order to prevent and absorb the RALs, which now amount, ladies and gentlemen, to EUR 122 000 million – which represent one budgetary year – we raise the draft preliminary budget in those lines in which the RALs double the annual commitments."
"In the other lines, we support the Commission’s requests for payments, which we hope the Council will take into consideration."
"We are therefore raising our request for payments to EUR 3 800 million."
"In Heading 3 – Internal Policies – we are voting for EUR 9 012 million, we leave a zero margin and are voting for an amendment with asterisk."
"In any event – apart from the traditional horizontal amendments relating to performance facilities and improvements in execution – our fundamental intention in this heading is to hold very serious discussions with the Council on the funding of the Agencies."
"Ladies and gentlemen, between 2000 and 2005 the number of decentralised Agencies has increased from 7 to 23 – this was Parliament’s idea; I remember the budgetary procedure during which we adopted it."
"The budgetary increase for the Agencies has risen from EUR 96 to 281 million and for the next 2005 budget we expect an increase of 20%."
"The number of staff posts for the Agencies has risen from 418 in 2000 to 2695."
"All of this has meant a reduction in the maximum limit for the heading of around EUR 134 million in order to fund other priorities."
"I cannot accept this situation and I intend to hold very serious negotiations with the Council."
"For the purposes of the negotiation with this Parliament’s rapporteur for the Agencies – Mrs Haug – we have presented an amendment which affects all the Agencies and which represents a reduction of EUR 40 million, leaving the budget for them at the level of the 2004 budget."
"Our intention in this case is, firstly, to point out that the funding of any additional increase the Council intends for newly-established Agencies must be discussed with this Parliament, because with the financial straitjacket we are in, with the financial perspectives set from 2000 to 2006, this annual increase in the Agencies already has to be at the expense of Parliament’s priorities, and the Agencies are not Parliament’s only priority, although the Agencies do, of course, need to be funded and we are committed to that as well."
"I would like to talk about pilot projects."
"We have already agreed on a package acceptable to the political groups."
"Some of them are extremely important, such as the pilot projects for small and medium-sized businesses, combating terrorism, nuclear arms reduction and conflict prevention."
"I believe we are producing a broad and ambitious package."
"In a similar way, in terms of preparatory actions I would like to stress the parliamentary agreement on the voluntary return of immigrants, on aid in the fight against poverty-related diseases – for which we allocate EUR 10 million, which I believe constitutes significant financial support – and, furthermore, the new strategy we have employed of treating certain pilot projects as studies."
"Finally, in Heading 4 we have voted for EUR 5 119 million – plus an amendment with asterisk."
"What is basically happening in Heading 4 is that we are once again faced with having to fund Iraq."
"This funding was not scheduled for 2005 and what is being proposed is that we fund it at the expense of Parliament’s traditional priorities, like the external policy voted for by Parliament this year, the previous year and in 2000."
"This is not acceptable either."
"Taking account, therefore, of the suggestions of the Committee on Development and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, we have requested that this heading be funded with the new resources provided for in the Interinstitutional Agreement in the additional sum of EUR 190 million."
"At the same time we call in to question – or we place within the same package – the common foreign and security policy, which is very important to this Parliament, but its funding must be considered within the general framework of what needs to be funded in Heading 4."
"Mr President, we are presenting a proposal which I hope will be voted for by a large majority of our fellow Members on Thursday and which will provide us with a serious position for negotiating with the Council, because I would insist that what we are taking into consideration are the political priorities this Parliament has set itself."
"Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, I wish firstly to say thank you to Commissioner Schreyer, who is taking part in her last budget reading today, and, in common with Mr Garriga, I find that quite sad."
"I can remember, when you started a little over five years ago, how relations were between Parliament and the Commission in the area of the budget."
"There was almost a chill in the air on entering a committee room to talk about budgetary matters, because relations were not good after the fall of the Santer Commission."
"There was quite a lot of mistrust between the Commission and Parliament, and many hard words were spoken."
"I think that, through your way of working, Mrs Schreyer, and through the way in which you have tackled things, you have made a very large contribution to rebuilding trust between Parliament and the Commission."
"You deserve thanks for that."
"I really do think there have been fantastic successes throughout these five years."
"I must say something about the budgets for the other institutions."
"We together decided, Mr Garriga and I, to follow a strategy in which we tried to find as many funds as possible under expenditure heading five so that we might return many of the savings agreed by the Council and so be able to meet the desire for staff increases as a result of enlargement, staffing reform and changes to financial management."
"If we look at the budgets for the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, the Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Supervisor, the budget that we are now presenting, and that was adopted in the Committee on Budgets, has increased by EUR 10 million in respect of the preliminary budget from the Council."
"We have, then, returned close on two thirds of the Council’s savings, and that in actual fact makes it possible for all the institutions to implement the desired staff appointments as a result of enlargement and staffing reform and the reform of financial management."
"I am pleased that, in dialogue with the institutions, a solution has successfully been found that can satisfy everybody, or at least I hope it can, and I would thank you for your constructive work in this process."
"I think it was especially unfair that the Council’s savings hit the budgets for the Ombudsman and the Data Protection Supervisor."
"These are small new institutions which are in the process of development, and I feel that the solution we have found in the Committee on Budgets is a reasonable result for these two institutions."
"On the other hand, we have only a very modest margin below the ceiling for the administrative expenditure."
"We have, in a way, almost used up the margin."
"I understand that new statistics from Eurostat show that wages will increase less than we had originally expected in 2005."
"When we reach the budget figures during second reading, the pressure on the administrative expenditure will therefore be less than we had at first believed, so we may perhaps, in spite of everything, find a margin."
"We have also, in different institutions, investigated the possibility of whether, through accelerated payments this year, we might help create some leeway in the budget for next year. Last but not least, the institutions should of course continually ensure that administration takes place as efficiently and inexpensively as possible so that financial surpluses are prevented through cooperation between the institutions."
"Where Parliament’s budget is concerned, we have kept this down to 20% of administrative expenditure, that is to say 20% of the money under expenditure heading five."
"That level seems quite reasonable in relation to needs."
"I nonetheless wish to emphasise that, in recent years, it has been possible, within our budget – that is to say, within the 20% – for Parliament to expend quite a significant amount on buildings, thereby saving ourselves rent in future years’ budgets."
"There is a clear desire in the Committee on Budgets for us, in connection with such investments, to obtain increased transparency in Parliament’s budget."
"We are in the process of having two new buildings constructed in connection with Parliament’s building in Brussels."
"These two new buildings will cost more than EUR 300 million, and it must be assumed that the contractual negotiations are now at last progressing quickly enough for it to be possible, both this year and in 2005, to pay off a portion of this sum."
"There is still the hope that it will soon be possible for a statute of members, which will guarantee MEPs uniform financial conditions, to be adopted for Parliament."
"The fact remains, however, that, even if a statute of members is adopted very quickly, it will take some time getting the new system to operate in practice."
"It is uncertain to how many MEPs a statute of members will apply at first, for there will obviously be a number of transitional arrangements."
"We have therefore thought it most sensible not to state an actual amount for what the statute of members might cost in 2005."
"A figure with what is called a ‘p.m.’ () is quoted."
"In the 2005 budget, EUR 17.5 million has, moreover, been appropriated to increasing the remuneration paid to MEPs’ secretariats."
"At the moment, some investigative committee work is under way in which we are looking at whether our rules can be written out in a clearer and more easily understandable way, and we in the Committee on Budgets have entered the amount for increasing the secretariats’ remuneration in the reserve while we await an actual decision from the Bureau."
"An amount has also been appropriated from Parliament’s budget to a campaign concerning the new Constitutional Treaty."
"It is not a campaign in the sense that we have to go out and engage in propaganda, but Parliament’s leaders have felt that we in the European Parliament have a quite specific duty to ensure that the population of the EU is informed about what this Treaty really contains and is given a knowledge it can use as a basis for the votes that are to take place in the individual countries."
"It will be the national governments and national parties that do the information work with a view to the actual campaigns prior to the votes."
"It was felt that we have a special obligation, and that is something with which, in a way, I agree."
"We have a special obligation to provide information about what is contained in the new Constitutional Treaty, and that is what the amount appropriated from the budget is to be used for."
"In its agreement, Parliament’s Committee on Budgets maintained the gentlemen’s agreement with the Council."
"We, for our part, do not interfere in the Council’s budget, and the Council does not, for its part, interfere in ours."
"In the course of our negotiations, amendments were, however, tabled that, in actual fact, cut into the Council’s budget for administration of the common foreign and security policy and, at the same time, cut into Parliament’s budget, namely that for the buildings reserve."
"The proposal was not accepted by the Committee on Budgets, but was retabled here in plenary."
"However much sympathy I may have for the intention behind the proposal, I did not, as rapporteur, recommend or support it."
"The intention behind this proposal is, of course, to press the Council to bring about greater transparency in the administration of the common foreign and security policy."
"It is, to a large extent, the growing expenditure in this field that has led to a rate of increase of almost 5% in the Council’s budget for 2005, while the budgets of the other institutions have increased by a little over 3%."
"I very much agree that we should ensure transparency and also ensure that no items are entered in this part of the Council’s budget that should properly be part of the action expenditure."
"I would therefore repeat my appeal to the Council to keep a tighter rein on the budget and to ensure greater transparency."
"I must emphasise that, from Parliament’s point of view, the expenditure on the common foreign and security policy does not form part of the gentlemen’s agreement."
"It is obviously an area that we shall discuss further over the next few years."
"In turn, we in Parliament shall, of course, also keep an eye on our administrative expenditure and continually look to see whether there is scope for savings and increases in efficiency. That is something I believe we owe our taxpayers."
". – Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the general rapporteur for the budget, Mr Garriga Polledo, on the excellent work he has done and his tireless quest for an always difficult consensus in the field of foreign policy."
"As in previous years, it has not been easy, as he himself has pointed out."
"It has not been easy because we have once again had to deal with the funding of new priorities on the basis of the same resources and at the expense of the European Union's traditional foreign action priorities – and I am referring of course to the Balkans, to the policy of neighbourliness, to CFSP actions, to action in the Mediterranean, the Middle East, Latin America and Asia."
"We therefore hope, Mr President, that a solution can be found to these difficulties which arise every year by revising the financial perspectives so that we do not have to resolve these situations every financial year ‘from hand to mouth’."
"We therefore fully support the rapporteur's approach of obtaining EUR 190 million in extra funding – and I would like to add that the Committee on Foreign Affairs has asked the Commission to present a report on the application of the democratic clause – and at the same time to intensify action in the field of cooperation with the United Nations."
"Mr President, I would also like to repeat Parliament’s demand that the Commission consider creating a bi-regional solidarity fund between the European Union and Latin America which would not involve additional sums."
"I would also like to join the other Members in offering Commissioner Schreyer our best wishes in the next stage of her life, while not forgetting that Commissioners leave but officials remain."
"I do not wish to recall the climate of the discussion we have held this morning in Parliament, but I would like to ask you to be very attentive, to take into consideration and not forget the decisions and priorities established by this Parliament as an arm of the Budgetary Authority."
"Mr President, I too wish to thank Mr Garriga Polledo for his extremely competent work on the budget in a difficult situation."
"I also wish to express my satisfaction at the fact that, during the last five years, the Commission has appreciably improved reporting on activities in the development area, which is the area with which we work in the committee that I am representing in the House today."
"A lot remains to be done, especially on developing measurements of results, but progress has undoubtedly been made."
"There is considerable agreement in the committee I represent as to the need for the EU, in its external activities, to give maximum attention to the issues of poverty and the millennium objectives."
"If this is to be possible, a larger proportion of the budget must, however, give priority to efforts in countries with low incomes."
"At present, only slightly more than 40% of the money ends up in those countries."
"We have therefore proposed changes to the distribution and, of course, also additions to the Council’s proposals, both to strengthen efforts to combat HIV, malaria and TB, and specifically to allocate more aid to Asia, the region in which far and away the largest number of poor people live."
"We also propose a new budget item totalling EUR 10 million to enable us to be proactive in efficiently tackling diseases other than HIV, malaria and TB that claim many millions of lives each year, especially among children."
"These proposals can only be put into practice if use can be made of the flexibility mechanism. We have no objections whatsoever to contributing to the reconstruction in Iraq."
"On the contrary. We cannot, however, accept its impairing our long-term efforts to combat poverty."
"Since the Committee on Budgets’ proposals were presented, I have, finally, tabled three amendments at the request of the Committee on Development."
"They do not involve more money, but are about moving a number of budget items from Title 19 of the budget, External Relations, to Title 21, Development Cooperation."
"We do not understand why efforts to combat poverty in Asia and Latin America should be given a different heading and position in the budget than corresponding efforts in Africa."
"The budget should reflect political objectives and not the Commission’s organisational structure."
"I hope our demands are supported, not only at first, but also at second, reading."
". Mr President, the Committee on International Trade's demands are very modest and we are pleased that the Committee on Budgets has agreed to the two key demands that we made."
"First we objected to the Council's reductions from the preliminary draft budget in terms of staffing for DG Trade."
"Given the extent of the talks taking place at WTO level, the number of disputes that now go before the WTO disputes panel and the need to open further external offices of the European Union, we thought that to cut the DG Trade's budget was unacceptable."
"I am pleased to say that the Committee on Budgets agreed with us and through the global amendment has restored those cuts."
"The second issue that the Committee on International Trade had concerns about was the need to have a parliamentary forum to follow the work of the WTO."
"Again we wanted to make sure there was a budget line to finance that parliamentary forum and again the Committee on Budgets agreed with us."
"So the Committee on International Trade is very happy that the Committee on Budgets has approved, in their entirety, both the amendments we put forward."
"I hope now that this House will back the Committee on Budgets and that the Council will accept the amendments made by Parliament."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, respecting Parliament’s desired political guidelines is an almost impossible task every year."
"For 2005, it was completely impossible, as it has been in other years, because, despite the agreement on the financial perspectives in force, the Council’s priorities mean not providing the resources our ambitions require."
"Respecting our priorities has, therefore, more to do with squaring the books than with reality."
"That has led the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to follow the strategy proposed by our rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, whom I thank."
"This strategy consists of prioritising the policies decided on by Parliament, while calling on the Council to fulfil its commitments in terms of the operation of the agencies, just as for Heading V and the Union’s external policies, where the aid promised for Iran can be funded without difficulty from the sums available from the flexibility instrument of more than EUR 450 million."
"Only this strategy has allowed us to produce a budget which reflects the very reasonable orientations established by the Socialist Group for the European Union in 2005."
"With regard to Heading I, we are aware that we are only consulted and, with regard to Headings II and V, which do not raise any great problems today, we have followed the rapporteur."
"Nevertheless, by providing this draft budget with such reduced funding and distributing money in a random manner, the Council is expecting us to abandon what we hold most dear in terms of European integration: solidarity."
"By that I mean solidarity between the peoples of Europe, but also solidarity between Europe and the rest of the world."
"Without the involvement of the European Parliament, we would have had to choose between the geographical regions benefiting from the Union’s development policy."
"This is contrary to how we European Socialists view the geographical scope of the Union’s cooperation."
"We cannot create a hierarchy of suffering, hunger or oppression."
"We must act in any region we can, and provide ourselves with the necessary resources to do so."
"That is why, when we voted in committee, all the lines dedicated to cooperation were reinforced, regardless of geography."
"Similarly, we have reinforced the budgetary lines dedicated to the Lisbon strategy, for SMEs, employment and social dialogue."
"We believe that solidarity means prioritising growth and employment, because solidarity means sharing the fruits of growth."
"Finally, ladies and gentlemen, our last priority is inspired by European solidarity and consists of making the European Union’s information policy one of our fundamental policies."
"For the Union to be able to continue its actions, it is urgent that people understand the work it does."
"Our priority is to make the European Union’s intentions clear and visible."
"In our societies faced with violence and the spectre of recession, and witnessing the war in Iraq and in the world, the Union must be seen as a model for economic growth based on solidarity."
"This is the main requirement if we are to combat terrorism and continue to bring peace."
"Our budget, which we are presenting and on which we will vote on Thursday, must respect our priorities and be our main tool for implementing our political project."
"Finally, I do not wish to end without thanking our Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, most warmly for the all the work she has done over the last five years."
"Like Mrs Jensen, I must acknowledge everything she has contributed to the budgetary procedure, to its renewal and modernisation."
"Mrs Schreyer, on behalf of my group, I would like thank you most warmly for what you have done together with us, the European Parliament, over the last five years, and wish you every success in continuing your work of pursuing our Union’s greatest possible democratic well-being."
". Mr President, I should like to echo the words of thanks, not only to Commissioner Schreyer, but also to our rapporteur, Mr Garriga."
"There were times when he enabled me to keep my good temper."
"The Committee on Budgets has wanted to simplify matters on a number of scores, which has been at the expense of some amendments tabled by us on the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"Indeed, the Committee on Budgets has divided all the proposed amendments, that is to say, it has voted on the amendments pertaining to agencies and subsequently on everything related to Lisbon, the information strategy and pilot projects."
"That means that in this vote takes as its starting point the obligations and payments for 2004."
"That is not straightforward, because no consideration has been given to the fact that ten new Member States have joined and that for those ten new Member States new activities need to be developed."
"For example, Bilbao has been given additional tasks relating to small and medium-sized enterprises, and it is not easy to keep these within the budget of 2004."
"We at the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs are therefore not happy with the failure to adopt some of our changes to certain items."
"We do hope that the amendments tabled by the members of the Socialist Group in the area of social affairs, including our own amendments, will as yet be adopted."
"Indeed, I would very much like to be able to join with Mr Ferber, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, in once again raising a glass to our future successful cooperation."
"With regard to the technical bureau and information that the employees’ organisations have tabled by way of a proposal, we hope to reach agreement again."
"I would like to thank Mr Ferber, as well as the rapporteur, at this stage for the way in which they are meeting us halfway."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Environment Committee is a committee with significant legislative powers, but it is also a committee with a very small budget, and the only financial instrument for the environment, the LIFE Programme, has had its funding cut yet again in the 2005 budget compared with 2004."
"We are actually very thrifty."
"Expenditure under the environment heading is not even 0.25% of the European budget, that is, less than a quarter of 1%."
"In addition, it is our impression that the Environment DG has insufficient staff to implement the policies that we want."
"The same applies, incidentally, to the Health and Consumer Protection DG."
"And when we hear the word ‘health’ of course we all immediately think ‘tobacco’."
"That is clear."
"We spend more than EUR 950 million on subsidies to tobacco growers."
"That is more than five and a half times as much as the entire environment budget."
"However, we allocate only EUR 14 million to developing alternatives for tobacco growers."
"This has to change!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad that this debate on the future of the European Union is happening today, for the future is always about money and where it is invested, and I believe that we are going the right way about investing in the Lisbon agenda, having allocated EUR 92 million to preparatory measures and pilot projects, and EUR 49 million to the financial environment, concentrating on the economic divide in the border regions."
"I believe that it is the latest developments – the crisis in the motor industry, the rise in energy prices – that demonstrate the necessity of our gearing the European Budget up for growth, and appropriate communication also has a part to play in this."
"Over the next five years, we will be devoting much attention to the theme of information policy."
"We have to do a much better job of explaining Europe."
"In the run-up to the elections, we could see that there were various elements strategically ganging up on the European Union and on democracy in Europe."
"I believe that we have the task of explaining to the public what goes on in this place and how important Europe’s position in the world will be for us in the future."
"It is for that reason, too, that we are committed to the infopoints, to the campaign for Europe’s future, to the Carrefours, to Prince, to all these important things, in order to bring Europe closer to its citizens and to explain it."
"We all see the ‘Intelligent Energy for Europe’ programme as being very important too."
"With energy prices in mind, I hope that we will add more in future."
"In this House, we should even now be starting to get our technical infrastructure, whether it be information and communication technology or the Internet and television up to the very latest state of the art and trying to become the most modern parliament in the world."
"Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer, ladies and gentlemen. I, too, will gladly do my bit towards our becoming the most modern parliament in the world, even though my contribution, in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, will be a modest one."
"In considering the Budget, we set clear priorities, particularly with regard to the Lisbon agenda."
"Concrete initiatives to push forward the Lisbon agenda, including in this Budget procedure, are more important than a constant succession of statements, whether by the Heads of State and Government, or sometimes by us ourselves, that cost those who make them nothing."
"We still regard the internal market as being at the heart of our competition strategy, and, seeing as there has been no change in the obstacles to it, we have proposed allocating funds to the holding of another forum on the internal market in order to discuss the various minor obstacles remaining in the internal market with those who are affected by them, thus enabling us to fashion forward-looking legislative instruments to deal with them."
"We in the Internal Market Committee also regard the eastward enlargement as potentially crucial in promoting growth, prosperity and employment, but we do of course also see that there are still difficulties involved in getting economies to grow together across borders."
"For that reason, we are proposing a pilot project for the formation of clusters in the border regions, through which strategic alliances can be forged."
"We also regard the internal market for consumers as still having considerable potential for enhancing our competitiveness and have, to this end, allocated funds for the fields of food safety and the combating of diseases in animals."
"I myself would also like to extend warm thanks to Commissioner Schreyer for her cooperation."
"It is a fact of life that those responsible for the Budget may make a lot of enemies and annoy a lot of people, but they also make some friends."
"When it comes to the border regions, though, they have become friends, as has the rapporteur on our Budget, Mr Garriga Polledo, and for that many thanks."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, we too in the Committee on Transport and Tourism would like to thank Commissioner Schreyer for the work she has done."
"The same is true of us as of the other committees: sometimes our expectations are greater than the funds available to us, and that is why, rather than setting new priorities, we have tried at least to allocate the necessary funds to what has been agreed jointly by the Council, the Commission and Parliament, so that the public can have confidence that what you announce will then be done."
"I want to give three examples of this, and one thing they relate to is safety and the environment."
"Frequent reference has been made to the agencies in this debate."
"We do not take a sympathetic view, when, for example, the three partners come to a clear consensus on policies on railway safety, safety in the air and the combating of marine pollution, and then along comes the Council and reduces the funds for these to nothing."
"When that happens, we are no longer talking in terms of technical decisions about finance, but about policy decisions on the Budget."
"I think the indications from the Transport Committee have been very clear, namely that we have to make the funds available at least for our shared policy objectives, particularly when it is the environment and safety that are at stake."
"We are familiar with the problems of transport, which affect us internationally, nationally, and also locally."
"The public expect more than just crisis management; they expect signs, and a sustainable policy in these fields."
"Secondly – and I regard this as having been very important – we also give priority to the trans-European networks."
"We must not forget that there are now 25 of us, rather than 15."
"We were realistic in our estimates of the expenditure authorisations, bearing in mind the current situation and the Commission’s depiction of it."
"Although we know that there is no point in providing money in excess of the projects currently being tackled, we also want to send a message to the effect that we aspire to planning, in future, a trans-European network including the 25 countries and more besides, and the new countries, who are represented in this House, expect the same priorities to be set."
"Mobility and transport fall between the economy, safety and the environment and affect all the citizens who want to live together in Europe."
"For that reason I would like to see good financial provision made for these well-known priorities."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, speaking on behalf of the Regional Policy Committee, I too would like to express my gratitude – both to the rapporteur and to the Commissioner – for the good cooperation over the past five years."
"As far as Structural Funds and regional policy are concerned, there are three prominent aspects of the 2005 Budget procedure to be noted."
"The first is that 2005 is the first complete financial year for the Europe of Twenty-Five."
"Secondly, and in consequence of that, it is only right that the overall funds available in the preliminary draft Budget for regional policy were increased, the payment appropriations to a greater extent than the commitment appropriations, where the increase was more modest."
"Thirdly, the way in which the funds have been appropriated makes it clear that, in the case of eight new Member States, there is a continuing transition from the pre-accession instruments to support being given from the Cohesion Fund."
"The Council has made cuts in the preliminary draft Budget that we regard as unacceptable."
"In the Budget procedure, the Committee on Regional Development has done no more than avail itself of its right to use amendments as a means of restoring the amounts cut by the Council – with reference, of course, to the Budget expenditure as a whole."
"To sum up, every one of the amendments we called for and adopted provides only for the restoration of the Budget line to what it was in the preliminary draft Budget, thereby preventing the regional policy budget from being cut."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, for his work, since he has shown great sensitivity towards the issue of agriculture in the budget for next year, and also the members of the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Agriculture because, amongst all of them, they have cooperated and their work has helped to make the agricultural part of the budget for next year magnificent."
"The amendments have moved in the general direction for the agricultural budget of re-establishing the draft preliminary budget presented by the Commission, because the Council had cut it in an arbitrary manner, using saving as their only criterion and without taking account of the different agricultural items."
"I am pleased with the increase in aid to young European farmers and I would like to point out once again that the average age of a European farmer is over 50 and that henceforth this is the biggest problem facing European agriculture."
"Furthermore, I wish to reject the proposed cut to aid for tobacco, reminding all of you that this issue has already been debated in this House and that we decided on a cut of 50% from 2010 and that from 2006 the cut should begin in a modulated fashion from a minimum of 40%, and the debate was therefore settled at that point, to the satisfaction of the opponents of tobacco cultivation."
"I therefore do not believe we should return to this issue during the current budgetary debate."
"In addition, I also believe there is no place for Amendment No 285, which opposes aid to cattle rearing, because there is no legal basis for combating cattle rearing and this would therefore create discrimination."
"If we want to open a debate on that, it will have to be about bull-fighting: this aid is not for Spain’s national fiesta."
"Furthermore, with regard to the cuts to aid for exports, and particularly for exports of beef, I believe that the COM is still open and the Doha round will tell us what the solution must be when it closes."
"This is not, therefore, the time."
". Mr President, I too would like to thank the general rapporteur for the budget and I must point out that the majority of our amendments have been accepted by the Committee on Budgets."
"What have been the essential objectives of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries?"
"Firstly, to reincorporate the appropriations unjustifiably cut by the Council from the draft preliminary budget presented by the Commission in relation to two important issues: international fisheries agreements in relation to cuts of payments from the financial instrument for fisheries guidance."
"Secondly, there has been an amendment, also accepted by the Committee on Budgets, relating to the new Community agency for fisheries control, in which this Parliament has shown great interest and which requires a contribution so that it can be implemented urgently."
"I would like to insist on two amendments, which have been rejected by the Committee on Budgets, and which I would like to present once again."
"They are Amendments Nos 98 and 99."
"The first, relating to the regional advisory councils, and the second, relating to the increase in aid for improving scientific information."
"Mr President, the fisheries advisory councils have been the great innovation of the reform and the only instrument we have for ensuring the participation of the sector in the decision-making process."
"This Parliament's objective is for all the councils provided for in the Community legislation to be operational during next year and in order to achieve this, we need an increase of some EUR 500 000."
"In the second case, relating to improving scientific information, neither the Council nor the Commission have provided for an increase on last year."
"Neither does the Sixth Framework Research Programme provide for anything."
"We believe that a budget of EUR 1.5 million for this issue is not too much to ask."
"Mr President, I believe that we, unlike other committees, have only proposed an increase of EUR 3 million compared to the preliminary draft budget;"
"I would therefore ask you to support the amendments of the Committee on Fisheries."
". – Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, speaking as rapporteur for the Committee on Culture and Education, I would like to start by stressing that our Budget policy over the coming years should reflect our identity as a continent of art, culture and cultural diversity, in which we, as Europeans, take such pride."
"For that reason, it is not fortuitous that all the members of the Culture Committee took the view that we had to reject the Council’s reduction in funds for cultural policy, for there can be no credible cultural policy in a Europe of 25 Member States if the funds for it are cut in 2005, the first year in which there is a single Budget for all of them."
"For that reason members of the Culture Committee, from whatever political groups they came, demanded above all the restoration of the Commission’s Budget estimates for town twinning and information policy, in order to gain the public’s acceptance, as also for the youth programmes."
"These in particular are the areas affecting the public."
"We should do something to show that, in the cultural field too, we are prepared to take up the cudgels for this wonderful Europe of ours."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Legal Affairs, too, is one of those with small demands to make on the Budget, for our share in it, on the management of which we are consulted, is probably in the order of a few thousandths of the whole."
"The point to which I want to draw attention is extraordinarily significant, quite simply because it is the only one, and it is that the Legal Affairs Committee’s remit includes the European Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance."
"The public often complain that proceedings in them often take a very long time and that decisions are taken only at a very late stage in them; this often happens when they deal with matters of great public importance."
"Let me make it quite clear that the reason for this is not to be found with the judges but elsewhere, namely in the inadequate capacity for translating documentation and forms."
"If we were, by means of this Budget, to succeed in making an appropriate contribution to adapting the ECJ’s equipment to current circumstances and requirements, that would be a great triumph, and one that would benefit the many members of the European public who have recourse to the law to resolve their disputes."
"Finally, there is no doubt that the ECJ plays an outstanding part in the further development and integration of Europe, and so I think it appropriate that it should be properly equipped to enable it to do justice to its task."
"If this Budget helps to do this, we in the Legal Affairs Committee will be content, for then an essential objective will have been achieved."
"Even if not everything can be completed this year, it will be a step in the right direction if there is continuous development towards this end."
"That concludes my statement on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, I would like to begin by thanking the members of the Committee on Budgets and in particular the general rapporteur, our friend Mr Garriga Polledo, for having supported and approved the majority of the amendments presented by our committee."
"I would like to highlight four of them."
"Firstly, following the Fourniret affair, which has recently shaken Belgium and France, we have provided for a new budgetary line to allow the Commission to make proposals with a view to organising the interconnection of national registers of criminal convictions for crimes such as paedophilia, sexual assault and serious crimes committed by repeat offenders."
"Secondly, with regard to the visa information system, commonly know as the VIS, we have put most of the appropriations in reserve, and they will not be released until the Commission has presented a second proposal precisely defining the architecture and functioning of the VIS system itself, as it has said it will."
"This is a delicate area in terms of the protection of personal information."
"Thirdly, with regard to the Agency for the management of external borders, we have placed all the appropriations in reserve."
"It is not that we question the importance of that agency and the need to make it operational as quickly as possible, quite the opposite, but we shall release the appropriations in reserve when the Council has made the decision on the final headquarters of the agency."
"We call on the Council to give its opinion before the end of this year."
"If this is a strategic agency, it cannot be content with a provisional headquarters with all the costs and operational inconvenience that would entail."
"Fourthly, we have also put in reserve most of the appropriations requested for the line relating to the rights of passengers."
"We all know the differences of opinion between Parliament and the Commission on this, with regard to the level of protection for the personal information which airlines must communicate to the American customs authorities."
"The Commission has promised on several occasions that the current passive system for communicating data, the PULL system, would be replaced with an active system, the PUSH system."
"So far, the Commission has done nothing."
"The appropriations will be released when the Commission has fulfilled its commitments."
"I must end by mentioning a final amendment which the Committee on Budgets has unfortunately not retained, to my regret."
"It concerns the Commission's desire to launch a preparatory action in the field of managing the return of immigrants who are not authorised to remain in Union territory."
"Of course it is desirable and urgent to organise better cooperation amongst the Member States in this field, but it must be done according to rules, and in a preparatory action there are no rules."
"In accordance with Declaration 5, annexed to the Treaty of Nice, the Heads of State or Government have formally been calling on the Council to rule on this issue since 1 May 2004, pursuant to the procedure laid down in Article 251, that is to say, qualified majority and codecision."
"The Council has done nothing, ignoring the will of the Heads of Government and the rights of Parliament."
"I would like the Council’s institutional infringement to be penalised, in accordance with Amendment No 146 presented by the Committee on Civil Liberties."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, how can the views of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs be summed up in sixty seconds?"
"It is very simple."
"First of all, we wanted to re-establish what the Council had taken away: I am referring in particular to the budget lines relating to the information relays or the Jean Monnet action programme."
"It was, however, when we came to the Prince programme in particular that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs had to pinch itself to see if it had really understood the figures before its eyes."
"We were amazed to discover that the Commission had divided the sum for 2004 by three at a time when we are about to enter the decisive stage in the public debate on the Constitution."
"Was it really possible that it had escaped the Commission’s attention that a debate on the Constitutional Treaty was going to start on 18 June?"
"The Council, however, had no such excuse, since the Council knew in the summer that a draft Constitution was on the table and that it was essential that it be debated."
"That is why our committee is not content simply with re-establishing this budget line, but wishes to multiply the figure proposed by the Commission by five, raising it to seven and a half million."
"Democracy does not have a price but it does have a cost, and I hope that the Council will finally understand that."
"As my fellow Members have done, I would like to end by congratulating our Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, on the excellent work she has done over the last five years with this Parliament, and on another more personal note, I would like to express my hope, my dear Michaele, that tomorrow, on the turn of a vote, your mandate will be extended by a few weeks."
". – Mr President, I too wish to thank the Commissioner for having, over recent years, supported the Committee on Women’s Rights in its endeavour to advance gender budgeting."
"As our committee does not have that many Budget lines to administer, this horizontal policy is of particular importance to us."
"I have to say, however, that I agree with Mr Prodi’s assessment that successes have not been conclusive everywhere."
"As with the Lisbon strategy, we have given gender budgeting and gender mainstreaming a fixed place in the Structural Funds, but, at the end of the day, only 6% goes to gender-centred projects."
"Hence it has been our great concern that the amendments should be used to achieve progress in this area by laying down minimum margins in the major programmes, in MEDA, in the major cooperation programmes, including those with other countries, in aid for Afghanistan and for Iraq."
"It is regrettable that the Committee on Budgets was unwilling to go down this road; it stated that part of these sums was to be used for gender-centred projects, but actually lacked the courage for this."
"If we really want change, minimum rates must be laid down."
"I think more debate on this is called for, and we need to muster the courage to do this."
"Where the Committee on Women’s Rights does have competences is in the field of gender mainstreaming under the Framework Programme, but it is again and again becoming apparent to us that we lack reliable data on how EU funds are spent on women and on men."
"It is therefore very important that we should get the gender institute started."
"Although the Council has voted in favour of the idea, the whole thing is meant to be run in a budget-neutral way, in other words, it is not allowed to cost anything, and women are allowed to do as they like if it does not."
"That is not acceptable, so what we want is to introduce at least a token entry for the gender institute."
"I would also like to mention a project from the DAPHNE programme, that being the European Year against Violence against Women."
"Many approaches have been made to the Commission seeking its support for this, but if you want something done, you do it yourself, so let us declare the ‘Year against Violence’!"
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my first speech to this House as a member of the European Commission five years ago was, of course, about the 2000 Budget."
"It was a Budget for only 15 Member States, for a Union of only 375 million people."
"It was in that Budget that pre-accession aid was adopted for the first time, from which funds flowed to six states with which negotiations were in progress."
"What I expect to be my last speech to this House has to do with the first Budget for a European Union with 25 Member States."
"That sums up the historic change that we have brought about in those five years."
"Not one day goes past when I do not rejoice that we have managed to overcome the division of Europe, and that now, here in Strasbourg and in Brussels, policies can be made for a Union of 450 million people."
"What a great development!"
"The European Budget has also become steadily more important and an important tool for European policy."
"For that reason, it must be solid; it must be developed within a reliable framework; it must be set out transparently and implemented efficiently."
"I am glad that, in these five years, we have managed to reform and modernise the Budget procedure as a whole – not only in drawing up a now more political Budget, but also in structuring one that is activity-based."
"The Budget itself has become more political."
"The new Budget Regulation and the reformed accounting system were major feats of strength on the part of all the institutions together – Parliament, Commission, Council, and the Court of Auditors as well."
"I would like to extend very, very warm thanks for these great shared efforts and for this very efficient cooperation, particularly of course to the members of the Committee on Budgets, of the Committee on Budgetary Control, and to the members of the Council’s Budget Committee."
"It was another feat of strength on the part of the Budget Committee to package, process and prioritise the many amendments tabled by Members to the Budget for 2005, and I compliment the rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, who has drafted this report and the many amendments to it with the sure-footedness of one who is very experienced in budgeting."
"Congratulations on this achievement!"
"My compliments also to the new chairman of the Committee on Budgets."
"It is always a very difficult task to take over such an important and difficult task in the midst of a Budget procedure."
"The committee under your chairmanship is also a very fine one, with very fine members."
"Over recent years, Budgets have been at their lowest in the recent history of their kind in the European Union."
"As Commissioner for the Budget, I am very proud of the fact, for it shows that we are working in strict accordance with the principles of budgetary discipline, but the relative reduction in recent years’ budgets was intended to make room for the taking on of new tasks, in particular of expenditure destined for the new Member States, which they will indeed receive."
"Agenda 2000, the current Financial Perspective, made provision for this."
"The Financial Perspective makes corresponding provision for the 2005 Budget to have an upper limit of EUR 119 billion in commitment appropriations, equivalent to 1.14% of the gross national income of the Union of Fifteen, and we always have to remind ourselves of that when considering what the Financial Perspective should be like in the future."
"According to all the institutions – the Council, Parliament and the Commission – the 2005 Budget requires at least EUR 116 billion in commitment appropriations."
"The three institutions’ proposals for commitment appropriations differ only very slightly."
"Why is this so?"
"It is, of course, because there is very little room for manoeuvre, as so much was laid down both by Agenda 2000 and in the accession treaties."
"There is, however, a great disparity in the estimates of the actual amount to be spent or paid next year."
"It does, of course, depend on what is being estimated, and on how much is to be taken up."
"We have to be serious about ensuring that voting commitment appropriations actually results in the money being paid out in succeeding years, and so the Commission cannot in fact support the cuts that the Council has proposed in this area."
"We are grateful to your House for insisting that at least the funds we proposed must be reinstated, and indeed, for proposing an increase in them."
"We are talking specifically here about the take-up of funds from the Structural Funds."
"All the parties concerned have joined together over recent years in making an effort to improve implementation, and now we have succeeded, in that, this year, take-up of funds is much improved in comparison with what it had been in the past."
"For this year, then, we have applied for an additional EUR 2 billion as means of payment for the Structural Funds, as there is demand for them on the part of the Member States."
"We can therefore safely work on the assumption that implementation will work very well next year too."
"Let me move on to personnel issues and to administrative expenditure."
"2005 will be the second year of the enlarged EU, and the Commission is asking for a second of additional staff in order to be able to handle the greater requirements of an enlarged Union."
"Mrs Jensen noted that the Council is awarding itself a far greater increase in administrative expenditure than it is allowing to the other institutions."
"To you too, Mrs Jensen, I would like to express my congratulations on your work; being the rapporteur for all the other institutions makes all kinds of demands on you."
"I wish to thank your House for accepting the 700 posts that the Commission had requested, but you can well imagine that I am not equally enthusiastic to learn that you are saying that 150 of them should be put in reserve in the first instance."
"It goes without saying that it is one of Parliament’s important duties to constantly monitor what is done with these posts and whether the right priorities are being set for their use, but I would like to argue in favour of the imposition of conditions on the release of the reserve that can actually be met in future."
"We do of course know that the whole recruitment process will take time."
"I would also, on behalf of the Prodi Commission, like to thank Parliament for always having approved the increases in posts for which we asked, for you are of course aware that increased expectations cannot be met without the resources to do so being in place."
"Throughout all these years, it was the foreign policy section of the Budget that was under the greatest pressure; this was partly in consequence of events around the world and also because the European Union has actually started to take more joint responsibility, and the resources have to be provided for it to do so."
"This was in part facilitated only by drawing on the flexibility reserve."
"Likewise, in 2005, it is highly probable that we will find it impossible to manage the foreign policy budget without having recourse to funds from the flexibility reserve."
"The letter of amendment that you have received from the Commission in respect of the 2005 Budget frees up funds in the foreign policy sphere and in the foreign budget, and so we are able to propose that support grants for Croatia be made in future out of Category 7, as accession negotiations with Croatia are to begin next year."
"We have also proposed that economic aid to the Turkish Cypriot community be funded from the category for pre-accession aid."
"It is gratifying to learn that the Council has now decided to treat this financial package as additional."
"I would ask your House to treat this proposal as a matter of great urgency and endorse the aid that we are proposing for the Turkish part of Cyprus."
"In so doing, we should also be aiming to help both communities to arrive at a final solution to the division of Cyprus and to overcome it."
"In response to a request from the Council, the Commission also proposes, as part of the 2005 Budget, the continuation of the PEACE programme for Northern Ireland for another two years."
"Although this, too, is a sensible course of action, let me observe, as regards the last three points I have mentioned, that it was always the Council that made the request, and always had very good reasons of policy for doing so."
"I must remind you, though, that resolutions at lofty summits, right though they are in policy terms, must always be followed by Budget resolutions laboriously hammered out on the down-to-earth environment of the Budget."
"In comparison with the current year, we will see the greatest increase in the 2005 Budget in the agricultural budget, which will rise from EUR 44 billion to EUR 50 billion next year."
"There are important and good reasons for this."
"Firstly, this will be the first time that the Budget includes direct grants to farmers in the new Member States."
"Secondly, the exchange rate is higher than it was."
"Thirdly, there have been agricultural reforms decided on by the Council, which have resulted in increased – rather than reduced – outgoings."
"Taking everything into consideration, then, the agricultural budget will next year require 0.48% of each Member State’s gross national income, and nearly 45% of the total European Budget."
"Although this structure, with its bias towards the agricultural sector, has its own history and sound reasoning behind it, we have to ask ourselves the simple question as to whether this structure is appropriate to the challenges of the future, or whether we need to set other priorities for the future and for the next Financial Perspective."
"One of these priorities will of course be to achieve the Lisbon targets, and all must be called on to help do this."
"Targets have been set, they have been agreed to by all, and either we take seriously these targets that have been set or we do not."
"If, though, we take them seriously, more must in future be made available from the European Budget for such investments in the future as research, education and innovation."
"This is a quite crucial challenge."
"It is apparent from some of the debates among the Member States at Council level that the Member States are advocating a future reduction of the Budget to 1% of gross national income, expressed as commitment appropriations, which would mean that the absolute level for the 2005 Budget would be perpetuated in the future."
"If, at the same time, agricultural expenditure were to be included in this area on a permanent basis, it would mean that little of the structure would change in future, but the European Union will not be capable of mastering the tasks and challenges of the future with a structure from the past."
"A change is therefore needed."
"Before you lie difficult negotiations; there have been others in the past, but what must be given attention is the discrepancy between what the European public have been promised and what is actually done later; it must not be allowed to grow, or else Europe will be a cause of frustration and disappointment."
"We are all endeavouring to ensure that this does not happen, and that the European Budget will instead have a structure appropriate to the demands of the future."
"I now hope that the European Parliament, the European Council and the future Commission will take very wise decisions, not only in relation to the Budget for 2005, but also, and in particular, to the next Financial Perspective."
"I hope that the cooperation between Parliament and the Commission in matters relating to the Budget will continue to be as good as it has been over the last five years."
". Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats stands for transparency and maximum efficiency in the use of European Union budgetary funds."
"The PPE-DE Group considers the Council’s approach, which implements reductions of 1.5% in the expenditure of other European Union institutions but does not apply the same reduction to its own budget, to be unjustified."
"Our group supports austerity measures with respect to administrative expenditure and supports maximum efficiency in the use of European Union budgetary funds, and the elimination of wasteful expenditure and of duplication of functions between European Union institutions."
"We consider that such an approach should be applied to all European Union institutions, including the Council and the European Parliament."
"That is why the PPE-DE Group has, for example, repeatedly moved motions calling for a reduction of the European Parliament’s expenditure to below the traditional ceiling of 20% of total administrative expenditure."
"Of course, the enlargement of the European Union has caused the European Union’s budgetary expenditure to increase."
"The PPE-DE Group is in favour of providing the means necessary for satisfying the requirements arising from the enlargement of the European Union."
"That also applies to administrative expenses and new staff posts."
"However, the PPE-DE Group considers the creation of new posts to be permissible only on submission of a clear and comprehensive justification of the need for such posts."
"The same principle applies to supplementary budget requests connected to the introduction of the new Financial Regulation and the new Staff Regulations in the European Union."
"The proportion of total expenditure that is represented by administrative expenses is one of the indicators in evaluating the effectiveness of the policies implemented by the European Union."
"An unwieldy and costly administration reduces that effectiveness."
"Our task and that of all other European institutions is to strive to increase the effectiveness of the policies implemented by the European Union."
"I call on fellow Members of the European Parliament to support the PPE-DE Group’s stance in voting on the 2005 budget for the other institutions of the European Union and to remember that we also bear on our shoulders responsibility to ensure the most efficient use of European Union taxpayers’ money."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by expressing my high regard for the work done by the outgoing Commissioner."
"Over the past five years, I have been able, as spokesman of my group, to work closely with her, and I can say that I have the greatest respect for her and for the work she has done, for hers is not an easy portfolio, and she has not always had the steady support of those around her; on the contrary, she has often had to make a very great effort, and that is why we respect her so highly."
"Let me also pay tribute to my two fellow-Members who are now this House’s rapporteurs – Mr Salvador Garriga Polledo, and Mrs Anne Jensen in particular, who took over the work of rapporteur only a month ago."
"Making such a good job of it without preparation is remarkable in itself, and so every respect to her."
"The Budget before us is not some sort of abstract entity with nothing but figures floating around in it; on the contrary, it reflects the sort of policies we want to make and on which we have decided; it reflects how we want the European Union to further develop, and what we want it to be like."
"At the same time, we must always bear in mind that it is the taxpayer’s money that we are spending, and we are obliged to be very careful in what we do with it."
"It can, I think, be said that this House has, over recent years, been a very careful steward of the European taxpayers’ resources."
"If the impression is communicated every year during the Budget debate that Parliament wants more to be spent while the Council, representing the governments, always wants to cut outgoings, that amounts only to fake frugality on the part of the Council."
"This, I believe, is where we have to ensure that the funds we need to make the policies that we want to happen are actually available."
"Let me clarify that by using two or three examples."
"Over past years, we have again and again seen the categories narrowed down."
"It has just been said that Category 4 has become more and more restrictive."
"Commissioner Schreyer rightly pointed out that Category 4 used to include not only foreign policy, but also Afghanistan, Iraq and the Balkans as well."
"All these things were to be paid for using the same funds."
"The Council wanted more to be spent on its common foreign and security policy, but the things we wanted, it cut – such things, for example, as funds that would have been made available for democratisation or for conflict prevention."
"That is just not on!"
"You cannot fund what you are promising for the future with money for promises made in the past; it merely baffles the public, who no longer have any clear idea of what the European Union actually stands for."
"This we will not go along with, and we will keep on telling uncomfortable truths."
"In the other field, that of internal policy, which has also just been mentioned, we have created several extra agencies."
"These agencies exist to perform administrative tasks, but they are introduced into a portfolio with which we want to make internal policies, environmental policy, policies on research, development, and education."
"All these things are crammed in on top."
"Additional tasks are transferred and the whole thing is rubber-stamped by the Council, which then comes to us and tells us that we must be more careful with money!"
"We will tighten our belts, even in this Budget procedure."
"We will look to see exactly what we need."
"In this Budget procedure, then, we will take up our positions, exert our influence successfully, and make it clear to the public that what we have announced in the past we will stick to and make happen."
"There will be no blank cheques handed out, neither in the 2005 Budget procedure, nor when it comes to the future funding of the European Union."
"You can expect this House to stand firm; we will tell people what is needed and also where we can make savings."
",. Mr President, I first of all wish to congratulate our rapporteurs for the budget, Mrs Jensen and Mr Garriga Polledo, for their excellent work in shaping this year’s draft budget."
"It has been a weighty and onerous task, but both rapporteurs have carried it out extremely well."
"I also wish to thank the new Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Lewandowski, for his skilful leadership of the committee."
"I would like to say a special thank you, however, to Commissioner Schreyer for the outstanding degree of cooperation she has shown, not just this year, but across the whole five-year period of the last Parliamentary term."
"Under your leadership, the EU budgets have been produced and the legal basis for them revised."
"The structure of the budget has been amended, the Financial Regulation and the rules for its implementation have been revised, and the accounts system is being reformed as we speak."
"I would like to thank her warmly for her excellent level of cooperation and wish her every success for the future."
"The EU budget for 2005 aims to foster economic growth."
"The special areas of focus in the committee’s proposal are the enhancement of economic cohesion and the creation of employment, and we believe they are the correct ones."
"One aim is to safeguard EU agriculture prior to the massive reform which will take place."
"Accordingly, the committee has restored approximately one billion euros of the cuts that the Council had made."
"It is particularly important to reduce transportation of livestock step by step, and to this end the committee has set aside 10% of the appropriations for further research."
"The committee has proposed an additional EUR 40 million for the prevention of animal diseases."
"This has been one of my group’s main areas of focus."
"The Structural Funds are an important instrument for job creation, and so it was right of the committee to endorse the sum of EUR 3.8 billion in payment appropriations."
"In this way, we can speed up the implementation of programmes, and at the same time reduce outstanding commitments, which have grown to a sum equivalent to approximately two years of appropriations."
"This is a threat to structural policy in the years to come."
"The promotion of entrepreneurial activity has been a particular area of focus."
"It has been crucial to validate the relevant budget headings and to strengthen support for small and medium-sized businesses as well as research and training programmes."
"My group backs these proposals."
"Likewise, the areas of focus are in harmony with the new financial perspectives, as these also aim to enhance EU competitiveness by endorsing these items of expenditure."
"The proposal before us, possibly in amended form, will be Parliament’s first chance to present its view of next year’s budget."
"Hopefully, the budget will be approved, by December, in a positive spirit."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, I too welcome this opportunity to reiterate the warm gratitude of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to Commissioner Schreyer for the work she has done."
"I would like to add, with reference to Green policy on women, that I am very proud and glad that you have represented us in this allegedly tough area of politics in recent years, and with such courage and decisiveness, such openness to dialogue and such competence."
"That was a tremendous success for us Greens, and also for the European Union as a whole."
"In that I take pride, and I wish you all the best for the future."
"You have also been courageous enough to raise the question of for how long budget policy can be structured in the way it is."
"In the very same way as the rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, you have today made it clear that budget policy is pre-eminently a political task, that not only do we have to handle columns of figures, but we also have to express the priorities of what we are endeavouring to do politically and hence also our political self-conception in Europe."
"Let me start by emphasising that we generally endorse the broad outlines of what our rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, has said, and by following a number of the previous speakers in illustrating this by reference to a number of policy areas."
"Things are improving in the field of structural policy, which is being better implemented, and which is about solidarity and real cohesion in Europe, and about reducing the differences in standards of living."
"Now that it is working better, it is self-evident that we must allocate more money to it."
"Mr Walter has just pointed out that, as an increase in their number was what we wanted, the Council must be willing to make new funds available to the new agencies, for we cannot allow the policy of decentralised agencies to result in a price war in European politics."
"The third point I would like to highlight – and on this I very much agree with many of the positions expressed by the specialist committees – is that we have to attach greater importance to information policy."
"Only if we communicate what we are trying to do to people where they actually are, and only if we are really pro-active in promoting the Constitution over the coming months, will we be able to win the people of Europe over to the European project, which makes political sense."
"A majority in our group supports precisely this approach, which involves making work on Europe more transparent and going into battle for Europe’s cause."
"You then spoke about foreign policy; here, too, we take the view that we must press on with the reconstruction of Iraq with real determination."
"That will not, however, be possible with the present structure of the Budget, so we will have to make use of the flexibility instrument."
"I would also like to stress something that Mr Garriga Polledo said, that this House and the Committee on Budgets possess the political will to counteract terrorism, the fundamentalism that strengthens it, and totalitarian thinking."
"Whilst endorsing this approach in principle, we do believe that we absolutely need to fight for specific measures that really make sense."
"Finally, let me observe that everyone in this House is constantly talking about the Lisbon strategy."
"We, too, think this right and proper, but it is evident that some Members are talking about different aspects of it."
"We are convinced in our heart of hearts that growth policy may not be separated from sustainable growth."
"Green thinking and measures to protect the environment can add up, too."
"That, and not reverting to the mindset of the 1960s by again treating the economy and the environment as separate, is the truly modern policy for the economy and for innovation."
"With that in mind, I hope that we will be able to arrive at compromises with the members of the other groups in the forthcoming discussions."
", . Mr President, Commissioner, I too had something positive to say about Commissioner Schreyer’s five-year term of office, but I cannot find anything to add to what has already been said here today, and I will therefore simply say thank you, on behalf of my group, to Commissioner Schreyer."
"Regarding next year’s budget, it has to be said that our group’s opinion of it varies considerably."
"Many of the representatives of countries classified as net contributors support the Council’s stringent 1% line."
"The majority of our group, however, think the budget is too stringent, as the priorities highlighted by Parliament are not being implemented, especially in the area of external relations."
"Of the priorities set out by the rapporteur for the Commission’s budget, we support the idea of highlighting the importance of the Lisbon Strategy, but we regret that the large parliamentary groups were unwilling to increase funding in areas relating to employment and social welfare."
"Business is setting the terms for the way we proceed to too great an extent."
"There are two aspects to consider with regard to increasing appropriations for information."
"More money is being proposed for campaigns in favour of the new Constitution of the European Union."
"It is our experience that both the Commission and Parliament are channelling these funds for purposes of propaganda, and are trying to influence the final result of the referenda in the Member States."
"Money set aside for information on the EU is all too often used for persuasive advertising, without presenting all the sides of an issue."
"This is not justified, especially as far as the issue of the Constitution is concerned, as that currently falls exclusively within the competence of the Member States, and not at all within that of the Community institutions."
"The national parties in our group do not constitute a common European political party."
"Not all parties on the left wish to restrict their freedom of action with some sort of rigid party line or enforced solidarity at Union level."
"Some members of our group therefore take a dim view of parliamentary funds being spent on supporting European political parties."
"There would seem to be more sympathy for increasing funding for the salaries of assistants."
"We await with interest the negotiations between Parliament and the Council for the second reading of the budget."
"The margins that are now being created are not sufficient to cover the priorities of both the Council and Parliament, and both have to make compromises on their objectives."
"Our group will adopt a final position on the draft budget when we see the outcome of the talks that are now commencing."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are two particularly important reasons why we believe the EU budget for 2005 to be unsatisfactory and why we will vote against it."
"The first is of a formal and political nature. The draft budget for 2005 was drawn up at a time when it was assumed that Poland and nine other countries would become EU Member States, yet the draft was not discussed or drawn up with these countries."
"In Polish politics there is a principle according to which ‘nothing about us without us’ should ever be done."
"A failure to hold consultations demonstrates a lack of equality and a lack of respect for one’s partner."
"The second reason relates to substance."
"There are two issues upon which the EU should focus."
"These are firstly, the enlargement to include ten new countries, and, secondly, the slow-down in economic growth within the EU, particularly in comparison with South-Eastern Asia and the United States."
"The new Member States are characterised by low levels of wealth, backward economic structures, a lack of capital and extremely high levels of unemployment."
"The acceptance of these countries into the European Union should act as a catalyst for a change in EU economic policy to ensure that the backwardness I referred to is eliminated as quickly as possible."
"The draft 2005 budget is not a good response to this challenge, as it only represents 1.03% of countries’ GDP, and the amount by which budget expenditure will grow will not be much greater than the contributions paid in by the new Member States."
"As in previous years, a budget surplus can be anticipated, because it is likely that not all the money in the Structural Funds will be spent."
"This will mean that the new Member States, instead of receiving more from the budget than they pay in, will become net payers."
"I called for the 2004 budget surplus of EUR 5470 million to be earmarked for a fund to modernise the new Member States, but this did not happen."
"The Structural Funds will be increased, but only by a small amount."
"This is too slow a tempo, in view of the fact that consumption levels in the new Member States are often ten times lower than those in the old Member States."
"A little over EUR 1.4 billion is to be earmarked for direct aid to farmers in the new Member States."
"In a situation such as that in Poland, where the EU imposed significant restrictions on the majority of producers, aid cannot compensate for these losses."
"If it wishes to overcome its problems, the EU must understand that investment in the new Member States would be the most effective form of investment."
"If there is not such investment, the whole of the EU will face increasing economic and social problems, which is not what we want."
"I thank you."
". Thank you, Mr President."
"I should like to add my voice to those thanking Mrs Schreyer for her many years of work on the EU budget."
"I should also like to say on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group that in principle we accept the strategy whereby Parliament reinstates the budget figures suggested by the Commission and reduced by the Council."
"The majority of the members of the UEN Group would of course gladly see a more striking increase in these figures, in particular those under Heading 2, but as a Polish pop song says, ‘when you don’t have what you love, you should love what you have’."
"We welcome the increase in funding for implementation of the Lisbon Strategy and for information policy."
"At the same time, however, we would like to stress that funding for information campaigns relating to the referendums on the Constitutional Treaty must not be spent merely on propaganda for the Treaty."
"An equal amount must be spent on critical media coverage."
"We must respect public opinion in our countries, and public opinion is very divided on this issue."
"We welcome the reinstatement of funding for programmes under the budget line covering TACIS and MEDA, which are of particular interest to our group."
"We are, however, concerned at the ambiguous position adopted by the Committee on Budgets with regard to our amendment."
"This amendment relates to a ban on the provision of Community aid to projects in third countries that could result in the carrying out of forced abortions, sterilisation or female circumcision."
"It is an amendment aimed at protecting human rights."
"In order to ensure that the right to choose is a genuine right, and not a mere mockery of the phrase, we call for this House to vote in favour of our amendment, Amendment No 5."
"This does not, of course, change the fact that in principle the UEN Group supports the draft 2005 budget in the version put forward by the Committee on Budgets, and will vote in favour of this draft at its first reading."
"At the same time, however, we hope that in future years the EU budget will be increased in order to allow the EU to achieve the ambitious tasks it has set itself."
"We have in mind in particular the rapid development, or development demands, of the new Member States, given that the development of these countries, and the acceleration of their development, will be to the benefit of the EU as a whole."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about dividing up the cake but less has been said about how the size of the cake was arrived at."
"It is worth remembering that approximately 90% of the budgetary resources comes from the base of gross national income and from resources derived from income from Value Added Tax, and that these resources are closely related to the pace of economic growth."
"Yesterday the President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, stated that 2003 was accompanied by sluggish growth of just 0.5% of GDP."
"He also stated that, at present, the world economy is recording its strongest growth in the last 30 years, and that the European Union should be exploiting this positive global environment."
"The draft budget plan totally fails to respond to these realities, however."
"In 2004, a provisional growth of 7.9% in the amounts of commitments paid is expected in relation to 2003."
"This is based on the latest figures, taking into account trends in July or August."
"In comparison with this, and in spite of the advised favourable growth environment, the draft European Union budget allows for an increase of just 5.4% compared to 2003, which means that the year on year growth in funds paid out should be 30% lower than in 2004."
"Moreover, unlike the budget for 2004, the EU budget for 2005 now has to reflect a full year’s membership of the ten new Member States."
"From this point of view, the starting-point parameters as set by the Council and in principle accepted by the Commission are, from the developmental point of view, both cosy and restrictive, and will present considerable problems in the implementation of the basic structural, regional and solidarity policies of the EU."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me join in the gratitude expressed for the five years we have been able to spend working with the Commissioner."
"Back at the beginning, when we had negotiations and Agenda 2000, those years were not easy."
"Nor were they easy when it came to bringing together the various aspirations and drawing up a single European Budget."
"Let me very warmly thank you for your cooperation, which has been marked by a high degree of trust, and I of course wish you speedy resumption of your work at the Free University of Berlin in the winter semester, in other words that, if a new Commission takes office tomorrow, the burden of European labours will be lifted from your shoulders and you will again be able to completely devote yourself to your research."
"Let me also thank both the rapporteurs, who have managed, under conditions that have not exactly been easy, to put together a very decent package."
"That is what we have to discuss among ourselves today – where it is that Europe can become visible, where we can create added European value that gives people visible evidence of where our priorities lie, and where Europe makes a contribution to progress."
"Turning to the Lisbon strategy, let me say quite plainly that I find myself wondering whether this strategy for establishing a competitive economy throughout Europe is just a matter of redistribution by way of the European Budget, or whether certain Member States have particular tasks to perform; I am thinking in particular, Commissioner, of the country from which both you and I come and in which your party shares in the responsibilities of government."
"Might we not do much more for Europe’s competitiveness if structures were to be broken up, thereby helping to create real growth?"
"It should not, therefore, be said only that Lisbon means using the European Budget as a roundabout way of distributing more money among the people."
"We have to begin by making the necessary reforms possible at ground level."
"There have already been many proposals relating to this from both Lisbon and the German Government, and I would like to see them put into practice."
"To move on to the Budget, though, the past five years have seen the administrative apparatus of the European Union expand as never before, something that has to do not only with enlargement, but also with the Council’s inventiveness in extending administration in the shape of the agencies."
"Like Mr Walter, I wonder whether we are paying for all this out of the policy sections of the budget, where it does not belong in the first place, or whether the Council is at last willing to include it under the heading of administrative expenditure?"
"When it comes to foreign policy, I am fed up with the foreign ministers wandering the earth doling out money, and us then being supposed, again and again, to give the new priorities budgetary form, a task which is far from simple."
"That, too, has been mentioned, and, as the old priorities have become irrelevant, we have opted for a tough approach to the Budget, and I hope we will get out of the Council some sensible results that will help, not only to make this Europe of ours visible, but also to make savings where it really is possible to do so."
"Mr President, I would like to express my agreement with the criticisms already made and, above all, the criticisms of the Council's budgetary irresponsibility."
"At the time when this House was approving the current financial perspectives, we were perfectly aware that certain headings were insufficient to cover the needs we already knew about in 1999."
"Heading 4, ‘External Actions’ is an excellent example."
"It was created without sufficient resources, without the resources necessary to implement the aid to Kosovo, and every year the Union has committed itself to special interventions in certain parts of the world, as Mr Ferber has also pointed out: Kosovo, the former Yugoslavian republics, Afghanistan, and, recently, Iraq."
"Nothing was provided for in the figures in May 1999, and unexpected revisions have been required every year."
"This Parliament has had to accept some of the cuts to its traditional policies proposed by the Council."
"After five budgetary years, these cuts amount to a very significant sum for a development aid policy which is diminishing in relative terms, while we are constantly saying that we want a Europe which is open to the world."
"Despite the fact that our Parliament was able to increase the Berlin figures for administrative spending in Category 5, we have been faced with budgetary restrictions which I believe have led to increased inefficiency in the Commission's work."
"Nevertheless, the Council does not hesitate to call for austerity in administrative spending, while awarding itself substantial annual increases."
"This year, the problems which were already becoming obvious in Heading 3, ‘Internal Actions’, have finally come to a head."
"I am not going to repeat what has been said here about the Agencies; we completely and utterly agree with this, but we want the resources necessary to fund them."
"Furthermore, over this period we have used the so-called flexibility instrument, even going as far as to revise the ceiling of Heading 2."
"None of this is good enough, ladies and gentlemen of the Council."
"Of course there should be budgetary discipline and rigour, but what you have been doing over the last five years is not an example of rigour but rather of shoddiness."
"Reducing spending by hundreds of millions of euros is not, in this case, a saving, but rather a short-sighted exercise in accountancy."
"You create new priorities but, in order to put them into practice, you sacrifice some of the existing priorities, based on the principle of not exceeding a certain spending limit."
"This is not politics, but accountancy."
"And I believe that politicians can provide more solutions to the problems faced by our society than accountants and I say this with every respect for accountants."
"In relation to the new financial perspectives, I hope that the Council will change its attitude, that it will take a wider view and realise that the Union’s budgetary policy faces much more important challenges than keeping spending below a particular percentage of gross domestic product, which would appear to be the only objective the Council is actually sure of."
"Commissioner Schreyer, I would naturally like to join in all the thanks for your good work and wish you good luck."
"Mr President, I too should like to start by thanking Mrs Schreyer for the work she has done, and I should like to thank her particularly for the open-minded attitude she has always adopted to this House."
"I have always enjoyed good relations with her, especially when I was rapporteur for this year’s budget."
"I should also like to thank Mr Garriga."
"I am very pleased that he has adopted for this year a number of initiatives that I took last year."
"In this connection, I should immediately add another comment about the Commission, because in the letter of amendment for next year’s agricultural budget, two initiatives have been included with regard to the quality of agricultural products and the future funding of infectious animal diseases."
"I think that we need to investigate at any rate how this will take shape."
"Looking back on the past few years, my slogan has always been that we need to be careful with European money."
"When I consider the level of the European budget of the past few years, that is quite clearly what we have done."
"We should not break the financial perspectives if that proves unwarranted, but I should add immediately that the Council did make it particularly difficult for us."
"What is the use of creating new agencies every year if the necessary funding is not available?"
"Moreover, the self-same Council has difficulty reaching a decision as to the location of those agencies."
"Sometimes they appear in the most bizarre places in Europe and are accommodated elsewhere temporarily."
"All of that costs money."
"Removal costs are to be covered and everything is to be funded from the programmes that appeal to Parliament."
"I do not believe that to be the right attitude, and so I welcome the fact that we are thrashing this issue out properly."
"It is unacceptable for one branch of the budgetary authority to take unilateral decisions that have financial implications, without indicating how these should be funded in future."
"With regard to Heading 3, there is one component of which I am still strongly in favour, and that is investment support, provided by the European Investment Fund in Luxembourg, to fund small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I think that we should give as many opportunities as possible to SMEs, to private enterprise, particularly in the new Member States, because some of them still lack a sound and healthy banking sector."
"That is why it is a good thing that this year again, an amendment has been adopted in the budget at first reading in order to give back-up in areas such as these."
"As for Heading 4, this year’s Budget is again a very tight one."
"Just as we did last year, I think it is inevitable that we will again have recourse to the flexibility reserve."
"Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer has done a good job, and she well deserves the respect of this House."
"I think we would be able to do another five years’ worth of work together, were it not for the reshuffling of the Commission’s membership, something that I very much regret."
"You have left us a little legacy in the form of your speech on the scope and structure of the future Budget."
"In essence I agree with you, and I am very grateful for the way in which you contradicted your own country’s government’s ideas about a shrinking budget."
"If new policies are moved to the European level, money for them cannot be refused."
"You said – and here I must be cautious – that the agricultural budget is substantial."
"It is, but we must resist the tendency to use this Budget as a quarry for the new tasks that are to come."
"What we want is a change of direction, and you talked about the Lisbon targets and economic development."
"I see rural areas as part of this too."
"You talk about research, education and innovation; they are needed in rural areas too."
"Let me remind you that, when the EU was enlarged, a proposal of this House’s Committee on Agriculture was adopted to grant the funds collected for the pro-hectare bonuses as structural aid for rural areas."
"Nothing has been done about that, and I think we will have a repeat of this argument when, in future, Turkey’s accession is on the agenda."
"It is important that we invest in our own rural areas, where money gains added value, and the added value should remain in those countries."
"It might be said that this often makes more sense than investing in certain major industrial projects."
"I believe that we must – and will – take account of this in the structure of budgets in medium-term financial planning."
"I hope that the House agrees with me in this."
"It is unfortunate that our work together is coming to an end."
"As a result of the redeployment of the mandatory funds, we have rather more responsibility for the agricultural budget."
"I hope that we can bring about change in line with what Parliament wants."
"Many thanks for your efforts, Commissioner Schreyer."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am sure that I am not alone in thinking that one of the most important tasks and goals for the enlarged European Union of 25 Member States is unquestionably social cohesion on as wide a scale as possible, in order to guarantee living and working conditions."
"As it stands, however, the draft budget for 2005 is not conducive to ensuring a balance between economic and social development."
"Its aim is rather to achieve a greater degree of balance and solidarity between the Member States and to guarantee equal opportunities on the labour market and in the social sphere."
"Not only does the draft budget fail to reach the possible ceiling of 1.27% of the EU’s gross national product, it will not even reach 1%, as in recent years."
"In my opinion, however, it is not the budget which poses the most serious problem, but rather the planned cuts to the structural funds set aside for retraining programmes, the cuts to the fight against social exclusion, the cuts to education and to support for NGOs working in the social sector."
"In contrast, expenditure on the common foreign and security policy will rise."
"In my opinion, the European Union must not give priority to the goal of a neoliberal market economy and to strengthening its military potential, but must instead concentrate on goals relating to improving the quality of life."
"Many of the social problems experienced by citizens of the new Member States are in part due to the fulfilment of economic demands the European Union made of these Member States."
"It would, therefore, only be fair to reward their efforts and their trust in the European Union."
"I do not believe that the budget accomplishes this task, and I will therefore have to vote against it."
"I thank you."
"Mr President, I represent a party that entered Parliament this year."
"We do not believe that we can approve the 2005 budget."
"We believe that the expenditure is too high, with the commitments amounting to 1.14% of gross domestic income."
"This budget should form the basis for future financial planning, and we believe that it could have been more restrictive."
"There are many areas in which savings could have been made."
"That being said, we of course have nothing against re-prioritising within the framework set up by the Commission and the Council."
"There are many instances of re-prioritising for which there are good reasons."
"We naturally think, however, that it is important for strict limits to be placed upon agricultural subsidies."
"As Mrs Schreyer said, these constitute 55% of the budget, and that is quite unreasonable."
"I know that it is not in accordance with the Treaty, but our development proposal involves, of course, reducing agricultural subsidies considerably and instead using the money for new initiatives."
"We argue in favour of a percentage of gross domestic income as our objective."
"This is not a block on reform, but a demand for re-prioritisation."
"Nor do we think that the Lisbon strategy should be the basis for trying to procure significantly increased expenditure by the EU."
"We believe, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, that growth is a supremely national issue that is not promoted by increased EU expenditure and taxes."
"That is not the route to increased growth."
"We therefore reject the very cornerstone of the thinking behind the budget."
"I shall not go into all the details of the re-prioritising."
"All that must be discussed."
"We need a much clearer link between those who propose expenditure and those who have responsibility for arranging the funding and collecting taxpayers’ money."
"To me, it seems as if Parliament is pushing for expenditure without accepting the political responsibility for demanding further tax revenue."
"In the long term, it is not a good division of labour to have one body that proposes expenditure and another whose task it is to obtain the money."
"That is from where the tensions arise."
"Mr President, I should like to add my thanks for the Commissioner's excellent work over the past five years and to wish him well in his future career."
"The European Union clearly has to prioritise its budgetary commitments."
"It recently brought out proposals to increase cooperation within the Union on international terrorism and organised crime."
"That means an increase in the justice and home affairs budget."
"The European Union is in a strong position to promote cooperation on asylum and immigration and to promote judicial and police cooperation."
"That also appears to be the view of the EU justice ministers, who are meeting today to put in place enhanced EU programmes to better coordinate EU asylum policies."
"The budget in these fields is going to increase next year and in the 2007–2013 financial perspective."
"I should also like to emphasise my support for the agriculture budget, particularly in view of the fact that we have sold the mid-term review to our farmers and they expect that commitment to be honoured."
"EU governments are also committed to playing a key role in the reconstruction of Iraq; the EU made a five-year commitment at the donors' conference in 2003 and will be at the forefront in providing financial assistance to the new Iraqi administration."
"The budget for next year is going to have to take account of these commitments."
"Although there have been differences within the European Union as to how best to deal with Iraq, we are all agreed now that the European Union must remain at the forefront of this reconstruction effort."
"The Iraqi people have suffered too much."
"We must work together to ensure that their quality of life is dramatically improved, sooner rather than later."
"Mr President, I should like to express my emphatic agreement with the broad thrust of what was said by the previous speaker but one, Mr Wohlin."
"I believe that in continuing to waste billions, the EU, which was meant to act as a shield for Europe, is – to put it mildly – committing an extremely serious error."
"Yet the budget is also full of clever little hidden nooks and crannies, a fact known by few better than by most of those now listening to this debate."
"I should like to single out just two of these."
"Firstly, the measures planned in relation to the implementation of the Statute for Political Parties, a great many aspects of which must be described as problematic in terms of democratic politics."
"This is equivalent to acting by stealth, and, to quote Professor von Arnim, a researcher into political parties, to an undercover source of funding that may be turned on at any time at the taxpayer’s cost."
"If we continue in this manner there will be adverse consequences for the European project."
"The same is true of the increase in secretarial allowances for Members of this House, a proposal which is currently only being cleverly held in reserve, but which has nonetheless again been established as a goal."
"It is of course necessary for us to be able to carry out our work here well, but not in such a way that beneficiaries can make easy money and party officials can receive a great deal of money on repeated occasions without contributing anything to the Parliament, a phenomenon which has been proven to occur."
"Mr President, Mrs Schreyer, the task faced firstly by the Committee on Budgets, and today by this House as a whole, in setting out a position on the draft budget for 2005 is an extremely difficult one."
"On the one hand, our room for manoeuvre is extremely limited."
"This is normal towards the end of a Financial Perspective, when new tasks appear for which no provision was made earlier, and funds are eaten up by these tasks."
"I am not referring to enlargement or cohesion, but primarily to aid for Iraq, new tasks in the field of security and defence policy and the ever-increasing number of agencies."
"On the other hand, the newly-formed Parliament urgently needs to reassert its priorities and make good on its electoral promises."
"It must also stand by the position assumed by this House in the past, namely to exert democratic control over the flow of funds within the European Union."
"On this occasion, Parliament’s traditional strategy, whereby the Commission proposals are reinstated in place of the Council’s traditional and extremely mechanical cuts, has proved inadequate in the face of such a challenge."
"The votes held in the Committee on Budgets have revealed an offensive strategy endorsed by Mr Garriga, according to which Parliament expresses itself clearly and creates room for manoeuvre before the second round, or the second reading, in order to defend its traditional priorities."
"These priorities include those mentioned many times in today’s debate, such as the Lisbon Strategy, information policy, development aid for rural areas, which does not necessarily mean the creation of jobs in agriculture, and the fight against terrorism."
"This time the priorities did not leave much room for new initiatives by the new Member States, something that needs to change in future years."
"It should be stressed that this strategy gained the strong support of various forces within the Committee on Budgets."
"The real test of whether inter-party solidarity of this kind can be sustained during the remaining rounds of the 2005 budget battle will, however, come during the vote on Thursday."
"As an MEP from Gdansk, the birthplace of the Solidarity Movement, I await this vote with hope, and the reason for this is obvious."
"The strong position the House has adopted this time will have a far-reaching impact on future annual budgets, but above all on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective."
"With regard to very many words of thanks addressed to Mrs Schreyer again today, there will presently be a further occasion to thank her during our last joint meeting of the Committee on Budgets, which will begin shortly."
"Many thanks."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I too thank you kindly."
"There are many clouds chasing across the skies of Europe now, just as, with enlargement complete and the Constitutional Treaty about to be signed, we should be acting with renewed vigour."
"There is a persistent miserliness in certain Member States with regard to the European project, which also shows itself in the matter of resources, an essential condition if our objectives are to be supported with adequate means."
"The Barroso Commission looks as though it will be a poor ally in this battle and, in this area as well, Parliament must become the main champion of the institutions’ credibility and win back the confidence of the people."
"Essentially, we have supported the strategy of our rapporteurs, Mr Garriga Polledo and Mrs Jensen, in order to restore some coherence to our statements and to honour the principal commitments we made to our electors."
"The most important of these is the commitment to relaunch the growth and competitiveness strategy."
"We have done a good job in the Committee on Budgets, one that ought to be supported further."
"I know that a difficult stage in the negotiations is about to begin, and there will be an outcry because we have cut the funding to the agencies, for instance."
"Who was it, though, that really cut the funding to the agencies?"
"We in Parliament, or the Council, which forces us into making these choices through its penny-pinching miserliness?"
"The same is true for the cohesion policy and external policies: according to the Council, the cost of the reconstruction of Iraq should be borne by the Union’s normal programmes."
"We have to stand united, ladies and gentlemen."
"I agree with Mr Lewandowski’s appeal: on Thursday Parliament can vote by a large majority at first reading to ensure a successful outcome for the credibility of our institution."
"Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the European Bureau for Lesser–Used Languages is running short of funds."
"We have also been informed that no funding can be allocated for the parliamentary use of stateless languages."
"Why has the Ebner report, which was intended to improve real language plurality in Europe and the development of lesser–used and minority languages in the EU, not yet been implemented?"
"This morning we listened to the Queen of the Netherlands talking about the use of one's mother tongue as a right in a multilingual Europe."
"What will happen to some mother tongues which have been forgotten by the EU?"
"I am referring to Catalan, my mother tongue and that of nine million Europeans."
"Is there any other parliament in the world where the president and first vice-president are not able to speak in their own mother tongue?"
"Should the Union be more efficient as regards its budget?"
"With apologies to interpreters and translators, if Europe is not in favour of real language plurality, we should save money by using only one official language: English."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it has already been said that the European Union has set itself the goal of becoming the world’s most economically competitive region by 2010."
"This, however, presupposes the elimination of the far-reaching differences between the Member States and within regions in the Member States."
"If the Gothenburg Strategy is to be taken seriously, this involves not merely economic issues, but also the attainment of a balanced relationship between economic development, social development and environmental development, whilst adhering to the principle of equality."
"After all, the European Union is not merely a project to create an internal market, but also a project based on solidarity!"
"I therefore find it entirely incomprehensible that despite the increased number of tasks incumbent upon the enlarged European Union, a fact referred to in many wise speeches by all kinds of government representatives, funding is now to be limited to 1% of gross domestic product, with the budget at an even lower level."
"This means that there is no chance at all of us ever putting this idea into practice."
"I should therefore also like to say to the Council that this kind of behaviour is opportunistic."
"You make grand proclamations, but when it comes to actually implementing these policies, you backtrack."
"This is in no way acceptable!"
"Furthermore, if we now agree to these proposals, we will already have prejudiced the outcome of the 2007-2013 Budget debate."
"Once we have chosen to go down this road, it is unlikely that we will ever have an opportunity to say that enough is enough, and that we no longer wish to go along with such a policy."
"We must therefore respond to this Council proposal with a categorical ‘no’, in order to provide ourselves with the opportunity to achieve a sensible relationship between the Member States with regard to development in various policy areas."
"Thought must be given to what we want to achieve and which policies we wish to implement before money is made available, rather than the other way round."
"Mr President, after reading the reports on the proposed budget for 2005, I cannot help but wish that they could also be read by those useful idiots back home, upon whom the British Government so often relies, who keep telling us that the EU is not about creating a giant single State."
"I should like them to count how many times the word 'integration' appears in the text."
"Let me concentrate on one issue."
"I am heartily sickened to read the passages about how many millions are to be aside for bodies that are – to quote the jargon – 'active at European level' or 'information relays'."
"They are to receive huge handouts, which they call 'Community subsidies for organisations working to advance the idea of Europe'."
"I will cut through all the jargon and tell you precisely what they are talking about: brainwashing!"
"The European Union is a self-perpetuating political bureaucracy."
"In its quite unprecedented fashion it can arbitrarily allocate vast amounts of taxpayers' money towards the establishment of chairs in universities and to bankrolling educational institutions with deeply worrying titles, such as 'the College of Europe' or 'the European University Institute', and dozens of others."
"In total, there is a financial envelope of EUR 77 million over 3 years in this brainwashing budget."
"This budget is a gross misuse of public money."
"A large slice of the money it encompasses will be used to brainwash the public into thinking that the European Union is wonderful and that 'integration' really is a nice word."
"There is nothing nice about misleading people."
"In my country this is known as leading them down the garden path."
"We should reject this budget."
"In relation to the Budget, Mr President, we are concerned about the positions of the new prospective Commissioner for the Budget, Mrs Grybauskaite, who is apparently announcing the death of the common agricultural policy; that is a warning for the French farmers."
"Our Parliament's Committee on Budgets is, however, partly responsible, since it practises a form of clientelism which leads to a dramatic increase in the Community budget of 11.72% in payment appropriations compared to 2004."
"This is particularly shocking at a time when France, in order to comply with the 3% deficit imposed by the Stability and Growth Pact, is having to tighten its belt and raise taxes."
"The irresponsibility of our Parliament will lead to an increase in France's contribution to the Community budget of more than a billion euros."
"EUR 17 billion in total, equivalent to 110 billion francs."
"The French taxpayer, who is already subject to some of the highest taxes in Europe, will not appreciate this, just as they do not appreciate that France finances Turkey’s pre-accession to the European Union to the tune of EUR 47 million."
"Europe risks becoming a financial bottomless pit, and we do not want to fall into it."
"Mr President, I should like to respond to Mr Gollnisch’s claim that France is the largest contributor to the European Union; it is in fact my own country."
"As far as the agricultural component is concerned, I have to say that 40% is allocated to France, and in my country, 60% of the farmers and market gardeners have to make do without any European contribution."
"I too fight for French agriculture, but he should get his facts right."
"I am strongly opposed to the Council’s course of action with regard to agricultural spending."
"The sweeping reform of 2004 – now listen to this, Mr Gollnisch – is putting incomes, especially those of European farmers, under enormous pressure."
"In some cases, incomes are being halved."
"That is also why I object strongly to excessive cutbacks in the agricultural budget, particularly in export contributions."
"I am pleased that the Commission intends to put this right to some extent, and I am also pleased with the rapporteur’s commitment, for he has, in the area of agriculture in any event, shown his good nature and his willingness to revert back to the Commission’s first initiative and to rectify this digression on the part of the Council of Ministers."
"If I may now turn to fisheries, I should like to urge Parliament to act on the Committee on Fisheries’ proposals and establish regional fishery councils."
"At present, there is a yawning chasm between what is happening in Brussels and what fishermen are experiencing."
"These regional fishery councils could bridge the gap between what is happening in Brussels and how this should be applied in practice."
"It follows that Parliament has every reason to cooperate and to try to actually build that bridge. I am also pleased that the rapporteur is in any event prepared, despite his critical stance towards agencies, to equip and furnish the European Maritime Agency."
"That is of the essence if we want to offer more maritime safety to our coastal communities."
"My last point concerns animal diseases."
"I know that there are fresh proposals to carry out more detailed research."
"As far as I am concerned, the research stage is over and I am pleased with the initiatives by the Dutch Presidency, both at Parliamentary level in November and also via the Council in December, to organise two large conferences in order to achieve better European policy with regard to protection against animal diseases, such as, at the moment, avian flu in Thailand and in Asia."
"Such an approach packs far more punch than filling the coffers of yet another research fund, because, although we have by now acquired a great deal of knowledge, we still have not summoned the political decisiveness in order to effectively deal with the risks of infectious animal diseases."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate both the rapporteurs, and especially Mrs Jensen, who took on responsibility for her report halfway through the year."
"Speaking for the Socialist Group, we support Mrs Jensen's approach and believe that the amendments represent a satisfactory compromise between the Commission's proposals and the Council's cuts in the draft budget."
"In particular, I endorse fully the reinstatement of the PDB for the Ombudsman's budget, and also for funding for an objective information campaign on the constitutional treaty."
"It is important that our citizens are able to make informed decisions based on facts."
"As regards the secretarial allowance, if we are to improve it, it is essential we have in place an assistant's statute."
"That is why the funding for this stays in reserve."
"I have been following the budget for over five years and the issue I have always focused on is transparency."
"The budgetary cycle each year is a repetition of the same exercise whereby the Commission proposes X, the Council then cuts it to Y and Parliament comes up with Z. This process is flawed and does not always lead to the most efficient and effective use of resources."
"I believe the problems arise because we have no opportunity to appreciate the behind the Council's decisions to increase the budget lines or decrease them."
"These decisions are taken behind closed doors."
"If the Council is serious in wanting Parliament to support its approach, then it needs to make these decisions in the public arena."
"Over the years, I have tried to improve our budgeting process, especially in relation to the way other institutions come up with and propose their budgets, by encouraging them to take on Activity Based Budgeting, ABB."
"I have to say that I am deeply disappointed that none of the other institutions have made reasonable efforts to adopt this method."
"I believe that since the Commission has implemented ABB, its budgeting has improved with greater transparency."
"Having said that, there is considerable room for improvement even with the Commission."
"What is urgently needed there is greater openness and a thorough evaluation of programmes, of successes and failures, to ensure that when programmes are re-targeted or re-evaluated, this is done on the basis of independent evaluation."
"There are areas where the Commission is still failing to match policy priorities with an adequate level of resources."
"For example, my particular hobbyhorse is poverty eradication."
"It is not just the Commission and the Council that need to demonstrate greater transparency: it would benefit Parliament too."
"In the last few years, we have seen the emergence of horizontal amendments."
"Of course they simplify voting procedures, but they also create two problems."
"Firstly, they blur the decisions taken by COBU and, secondly, the result is that fewer and fewer people are involved in decision-making, both within Parliament and within the political groups."
"We have a unique opportunity to address these issues, namely in our deliberations on the next financial perspectives."
"We have the chance not just to look at the figures and headings, but also to make our internal processes clearer and simpler."
"The budget process is not just for the anoraks like myself and others who are sitting around here, everyone in this House is accountable to European citizens for the decisions this House makes on the budget."
"Finally, I call on the Council, the Commission, Parliament and the other institutions to take this opportunity to take radical action so that future budgets are simple and transparent."
"I would also like to add my thanks to Commissioner Schreyer."
"I would like to thank her for all her work in this area and wish her all the best for the future."
"Mr President, like other speakers in this debate, I should like to congratulate both rapporteurs."
"It is never an easy matter to represent this House on budgetary matters, whether in relation to the Commission's or Parliament's budget."
"My congratulations go out to them."
"Of course, we are not at the end of the budget procedure but already in this big, first public debate we have come a considerable way."
"I should like quickly to cover a matter that we hold dear in my political group – the question of value for money."
"I should like to underline what Commission Schreyer referred to this afternoon, which is not often mentioned: we have a budget, a very strictly managed budget."
"In 1992, if I remember correctly, it covered 1.1% GDP and is now under 1% GDP, with savings in the running of the agriculture budget, for example."
"However, we have to keep particular lines in focus."
"Mr Titford mentioned the question of funding cultural organisations."
"We have asked for one of those lines to be in reserve precisely so that we can make sure that the funding goes to organisations that actually exist."
"But I would remind Mr Titford that even taking the amount of money that he referred to, it is less than 0.01% of the overall budget."
"Therefore, to refuse to accept the budget on that basis is not really valid."
"I would have been more convinced if he had taken up the issue of funding for Iraq where, as a political group last year, we asked for EUR 500m to be put in, but everyone threw up their arms and said that we would not be able to find that sum of money."
"But we have found it because other lines have been able to be pilfered for it."
"It is always nice to be right in retrospect, but I would agree with Mrs Dührkop that when funding a budget, we should clearly set the priorities that we wish to set as between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament, so that we do not find other objectives submerged within a broader political will."
"This will be highly necessary when we come to set the next financial perspective: we must not be found wanting in this particular area of external policy."
"Secondly, linked to the matter of the financial perspective is one of the questions that we put down on the approval of posts."
"We would like to see whether there are going to be amendments available for the financial regulation to enable us to make sure that monies allocated are properly spent."
"Therefore, we would like those amendments available to us before we come to final decisions on the financial perspective next year."
"Lastly, we have often pioneered the idea of interinstitutional cooperation."
"I know that you have done your best, Commissioner, while in office."
"But I believe that those of us in this House should remember that when we ask the Commission to apply codes of conduct to high-level officials, to the way in which Commissioners run their offices and so on, we should not ask the Commission to apply standards that we ourselves refuse to apply."
"Therefore, if we ask for a code of conduct we will have to apply it ourselves in the future to retain credibility."
"Ladies and gentlemen, much has already been said on the strategy adopted this year by this House with regard to the 2005 Budget."
"It has also been said that the decentralised agencies play an important role for us in negotiations with the Council."
"Once again, I should like to make it very clear to everyone that we are not opposed to the agencies; indeed quite the opposite is true, as we believe that most of them make an outstanding contribution to our common European concern."
"Yet we must be aware of the fact that in recent years the rate at which agencies are established has accelerated considerably."
"Whereas in 1990 there were only three agencies, in 1995 six and in 2000 seven, and there will be 23 as soon as 2005."
"We have always supported the Commission’s intention to concentrate on its core competencies and transfer certain areas to the agencies, but we want this to occur in a focused manner and under extremely strict political and budgetary control."
"The Council is always in favour of creating new agencies, and since the Member States have been represented on agencies’ management boards this has been particularly true, above all in the case of agencies which implement European legislation."
"In the preliminary draft budget for 2005 EUR 281 303 million is earmarked for agencies, EUR 53.7 million more than in the 2004 financial year."
"We must, however, bear in mind that all but four agencies are funded under Heading 3, internal policies, where very little money remains."
"We are therefore left with only two options; either we provide the funding earmarked for the agencies without complaint, and cut funding in other priority budget lines in order to find the money to do so; or we negotiate with the Council in order to increase funding under Heading 3 by the missing EUR 54 million."
"The latter is exactly what we want to happen."
"I should now like to address Mrs Schreyer once again, and to thank her, as have all the previous speakers."
"All the men who have spoken before this House know how to pay compliments much better than I am able to, yet, as you are aware, my thanks are sincere, as Mrs Schreyer has persuaded her fellow Commissioners to put forward proposals which are genuinely forward-looking."
"In fact, they are so forward-looking that I do not believe that it will be possible to implement them during my time as a Member of this House."
"You are aware of the proposals to which I am referring, which include the general correction mechanism and the own resources report, with the ‘window to the future’ of an income system intended to undergo successive amendments."
"This was an extremely courageous feat, and one which none of your predecessors achieved, in any case not the two men who were your immediate predecessors."
"I would like to offer you my heartfelt thanks for this."
"Mrs Schreyer, women can do it!"
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has essentially absorbed all the basic competences of the common foreign policy and of European defence and security policy."
"It has basically created a mini-budget under the absolute control of the Council, fully integrated into the operational spending of the Council which, on the basis of the gentlemen's agreement, we in Parliament are hardly even allowed to touch."
"They are taking crucial responsibilities and powers of financial control away from us and holding up the gentlemen's agreement in order to stave off our reaction."
"For example, the account of the new counter-terrorism coordinator is not audited by the European Parliament, but comes directly under the Council's expenditure."
"The same applies to the account of the representative for the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the FADO programme."
"Even in its explanatory statement on the budget, the Council itself boasts that its General Secretariat has acquired a new, more dynamic, more flexible profile, a development of which, I repeat, the Council boasts, even adding that it will be demanding new terms for the benefit of the Council."
"So the Council is building up this separate mini-budget, thereby creating its own separate bureaucracy on foreign affairs."
"Our question therefore should be: do we want a European Parliament which exercises policy on behalf of Europe or a European Parliament which rubber stamps the funding of policies exercised by intergovernmental institutions?"
"Do we want a European Parliament involved in codecision, as provided for in the new Constitution, or a European Parliament which everyone takes for granted and takes no notice of?"
"If this is what we want, we know what we have to do."
"Absolutely nothing."
"If we want to be taken notice of and to represent the Union, then we must send the message out in every direction that we are here and that our role is not cosmetic."
"– Mr President, I, too, should like to express my appreciation for the work done by our rapporteurs, Mr Garriga and Mrs Jensen. I should also particularly like to join in the congratulations expressed to Commissioner Schreyer on the excellent work she has done, which, most importantly, has not, contrary to what we have heard in this House, led to an astronomical increase in the budget – far from it – and which has succeeded in meeting many of our objectives and maintaining considerable budgetary discipline."
"Whether we say goodbye this week, or put off this goodbye for a little longer, I should like to express my sincere gratitude to you, Mrs Schreyer, and to wish you much happiness for the future."
"I should also like to say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that the in-coming Commissioner – although we do not yet know when she will take up her post – has given us guarantees that she will carry on the work that is already under way and has given some signals as regards her commitment that I feel are most welcome and that make me think that we will continue along the same path that we have thus far been following."
"In relation to the Financial Perspectives, we must ensure that the hand-over takes place smoothly, and we must resist the temptation to debate everything all over again and start from scratch."
"This would have a damaging effect on the defence of our interests and on European integration."
"Consequently, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot stress enough how important this point is."
"Let us continue the work that we have developed thus far with a new Commission, but without ever forgetting all that we have constructed together."
"Thank you very much."
"Mr President, if you ask our constituents what they want from Europe, they will probably tell us to do less."
"But they will also tell us that what we do, we must do better."
"Commissioner, if you ask them what sort of things they want us to do, they say 'the things that protect us, the things that help us'."
"Nowhere is that more true than in the areas of public health: in terms of the safety of medicines; in terms of food safety; and in terms of protection from diseases and health emergencies."
"That is why I want to follow what Mrs Haug said about these agencies."
"Some agencies are crucial to our citizens, and we are not providing them with sufficient funding to do the job we expect from them."
"The first of these I would pick out is the European Medicines Evaluation Agency, where new drugs – orphan drugs, pharmacovigilance, herbal medicines and so on – are piled on top of its initial responsibilities, but the funding is static."
"I ask the House to support the amendment on orphan drugs that Mrs Haug has tabled on behalf of the Environment Committee, and to look very carefully at funding for the future in that area."
"The second example is the European Food Safety Authority, which is expected to move to Parma."
"It is also being expected to take on new responsibilities, not least in terms of health claims with regard to nutrient profiling and so on. We are not funding that adequately either."
"That can fall flat on its face, and if does so, then public confidence is lost."
"That is true of both the bodies I have mentioned."
"The third example is that of our new 'baby', the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, which is being set up in Stockholm."
"In Stockholm, it has already been found that costs are higher than anticipated."
"The value of the Krona has shot up against the euro, and the costs of employment and premises are both having an impact."
"As a result it will not be possible to implement the expected recruitment policies."
"I ask that this should be looked into as well, because if we do not protect people from health emergencies and from the dramatic increase in health threats, the public will not thank us."
"If we wish to pay for this – and we should – then we need to look at the budget for subsidies for tobacco–growing."
"That would pay for all those agencies."
"Moreover, if we removed these subsidies, we would also remove a health threat."
"– Mr President, I too should like to start by warmly thanking our rapporteurs, Mr Garriga and Mrs Jensen, for their excellent work."
"The 2005 budget is of particular importance."
"It is the first Union budget following enlargement, while in 2005 we shall be half way through the Lisbon strategy timetable."
"Unfortunately, the first reading by the Council was governed by a cutback rationale."
"The Council displayed inconsistency between the objectives it has set and the resources which it ultimately decided to use in order to achieve them."
"The question arises of the political reliability of the Council, when it decides to cut EUR 3 billion from payment appropriations for the structural funds at a time when the European Commission and the Commissioner responsible have repeatedly stressed to us that implementation of these programmes is expected to intensify in 2005."
"The question arises of the political reliability of the Council, when it makes significant cuts to crucial Lisbon strategy policies."
"The question of political reliability arises when we are currently debating the new financial framework of the Union for 2007-2013 and the impression is created that the symbolic 1% ceiling is concealed behind the Council's cutbacks."
"Ladies and gentlemen, at the first reading on Thursday, the European Parliament must support the restoration of the appropriations for structural policies, in accordance with the strategy which we also followed in the Committee on Budgets, with a sense of responsibility towards the citizens of Europe and towards the objectives which we have set."
"We consider it necessary to reinforce policies which aim at sustainable development and employment."
"We aim to strengthen social Europe and to give serious support to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"We really need to use the first reading as part of our effort, by December, to make the 2005 budget a reliable development resource which will safeguard the smooth integration of the new Member States, the reduction in differences within the Union and the efficient implementation of European policies."
"In closing, I too should like to warmly thank the Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, for her work and to wish her all the best in her future political career."
"Thank you, Mrs Xenogiannakopoulou."
"As that was the final speaker, the debate is now closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"The sitting is now adjourned, and will resume at 6 p.m. with Question Time."
"I thank you."
"The next item is Question Time, during which we will examine questions to the Commission (B6-0017/2004)."
"A missing children’s web site linked to a global network has just been launched in Ireland."
"Similar web sites have also been set up in the USA, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, South Africa, Malaysia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Canada and Australia and, at EU level, apart from Ireland, in Belgium, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain."
"Can the Commission indicate if EU support is available for such web sites and, if so, why are so few EU Member States participating in this global network?"
"What steps can it take to ensure that every Member State has its own web site and becomes actively involved in the activities of the network which enables the public to come forward with information on unsolved cases of missing children?"
". Let me say at the outset that the Commission very much appreciates the work of the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children."
"I greatly welcome the fact that six Member States of the European Union are connected with this global network on missing children, which has been set up on an American initiative."
"Existing funding programmes, especially AGIS and Daphne, and previously STOP – which has now expired – continuously addressed the issues of child-trafficking, sexual exploitation of children, child pornography, violence against children in general and, in this context, the issue of missing children also."
"In particular, both STOP and Daphne have been used to support financially the Childoscope project of the Belgian organisation Child Focus, and also the Institute for International Research on Criminal Policy of the University of Ghent, in line with the Council resolution of 2001 on the contribution of civil society to finding missing and sexually exploited children."
"Programmes, such as AGIS and Daphne, however, focus on cooperation among EU Member States."
"The global network on missing children, on the other hand, is a worldwide initiative and is not limited to the Member States of the Union."
"In principle, the creation of websites in the EU Member States that could be used to search out and find missing children could be an appropriate subject for funding using one of the relevant funding programmes."
"The Commission can only encourage relevant governmental administrations and civil society organisations in the Member States to set up websites in the framework of the global network on missing children and submit appropriate project proposals for the relevant programmes."
"I thank the Commissioner for his answer."
"We all know that speed is of the essence in finding missing children, not only through the Internet which, when properly used, can be a powerful tool in finding people as quickly as possible, but also through the mobile phone networks."
"I have two questions to put to the Commission."
"Firstly, do we know how many missing children there are in the enlarged European Union?"
"Secondly, I would like to ask the Commission whether it would undertake through its 2005 work programme an initiative to establish a missing children website in all European Union Member States?"
". In reply to the first question, I am afraid the only thing we can do is to make intelligent if rather gloomy guesses about the number."
"It is very difficult to be precise and the accession of ten new Member States to the European Union does not make it any easier to give a general figure."
"Whatever the figure is, it is far too high."
"That is therefore a strong argument for us to develop the website proposal which the honourable Member has mentioned."
"I will make certain that my successors – I hope, my successors! – in the European Commission are made aware of his proposal and take it seriously."
"This is a very worrying problem and we should, as the honourable Member has said, use every possible resource, including modern technology, to try to cope with it."
"It is now clear that, despite the EU Foreign Ministers' agreement to accept Burma's (Myanmar) participation at the ASEM Summit, there has been no improvement in the human rights situation in that country and that Aung San Suu Kyi has not been freed."
"EU Foreign Ministers have consequently declared they will step up measures against the Burmese military leadership."
"What specific measures have been planned or put in place to ensure that the Burmese regime will now release Aung San Suu Kyi and fulfil the other demands made at the Gymnich meeting in Tullamore, Ireland?"
"How does the Commission intend to implement these measures and the proposal to strengthen European aid to the people of Burma?"
". Following the abject failure of the Burmese military regime to fulfil the Tullamore conditions to which the question refers, the European Union on 11 October agreed to adopt further targeted measures against the Burmese military regime."
"The additional measures agreed by the Council are designed to apply both direct political pressure and indirect economic pressure on the Burmese military regime."
"To apply direct political pressure and to sharpen the international isolation of the military regime, the Council has agreed to expand the EU-wide travel ban on senior Burmese military officers and their families."
"Under the new rules all Burmese military officers of the rank of brigadier-general and above will be barred from entering the European Union."
"To apply indirect economic pressure, the Council has agreed to adopt new measures prohibiting new investment in listed Burmese state-owned enterprises."
"Under these new measures, it would also be forbidden to provide loans or credits to Burmese state-owned enterprises."
"The Commission realises that the new measures, though they further isolate the military regime, cannot force it to carry out the actions demanded by the European Union at Tullamore."
"However, we believe that this increased pressure will significantly increase the costs to the regime of not complying with European Union demands."
"Perhaps I could add one point about assistance."
"At the moment, as the honourable Member will know, assistance from the Community budget is restricted to basic humanitarian aid and health care, and it is delivered through UN agencies and non-governmental agencies active inside Burma and close to the country's borders in Thailand and Bangladesh."
"The Commission is currently discussing with the Member States, but also with UN agencies and other donor organisations, the means which will allow us to optimise and expand our assistance from the budget to the Burmese people."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner if he could expand on the remark he made on the Council taking decisions regarding investment in state–owned companies."
"This relates to specifically named companies."
"I understand that Total has recently done a deal with the Myanmar Oil and Gas Exploration Company."
"Is that deal affected by the Council's decision?"
"If not, why not, if we are serious about exerting serious economic pressure?"
"Lastly I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he would agree that this matter should now be raised within the UN Security Council."
". The financial sanctions politically agreed by the Council will be implemented by a Council resolution, which is directly applicable in the Member States and is binding for economic operators."
"Off the cuff, I cannot give the honourable Member details of all the companies that are, or will be, covered by the proposals, but I can certainly ensure that we correspond with him on the particular company that he has in mind."
"I do not want to hide a couple of points from Parliament."
"Firstly, in applying sanctions against named companies, you have to be careful that you are not obliging companies to break existing contractual arrangements or deny payments for goods they have received."
"It is always a trickier business to apply financial or economic sanctions than it sounds when one addresses the issue rhetorically."
"However, the point the honourable Member makes about the crucial importance of the energy sector in Burma is one we have to take account of."
"The other thing that I would like to say very frankly to the honourable Member is that there are limits to the extent to which we can apply pressure and achieve the desired outcome."
"Like, I am sure, every Member in this Parliament, I would like to see Aung San Suu Kyi released from house arrest."
"I would like to see her and the NLD able to play a full part in the political life of Burma and Burma itself released from the trap of impoverishment and totalitarianism in which it at present finds itself."
"It is also the case that Aung San Suu Kyi's husband taught at a university with which I am now intimately associated, so it is a case that I have followed with huge interest and concern."
"My own judgement is that, a little like the case of Zimbabwe, it is more difficult to achieve the desired outcome if neighbouring countries and regional organisations do not cooperate in achieving a desired human rights objective."
"I hope that, in this case, ASEAN will act rather more vigorously in the future than it has in the recent past."
"The situation in Burma is horrendous, and we must do everything we can to achieve some improvement."
"I do not have another question, I simply wanted to remind the Commissioner that there was a second part to my original question, i.e. whether the matter would be brought up in the Security Council."
". It remains the case that the Commission is not represented in the Security Council and I imagine that will continue even during the lifetime of the next Commission, distinguished though it doubtless will be."
"My own personal view is that it would help to raise this question regularly in the Security Council."
"Whether that position would be shared by say, China, or some other Member States of the United Nations, I am not sure."
"But if I may make a point about two countries which have a strong relationship with Burma, China and India, I think they should both recognise that Burma is a destabilising force in their region and the sooner they work with others to help achieve a more democratic regime there, the better off the whole region will be."
"Can I tempt my right honourable friend to agree that this House was right, and the foreign ministers were wrong, over the decision to permit Burma to attend the ASEM Summit?"
"I should also like to ask him whether he would agree that banning the senior generals and others from entering the EU is only as successful as the policies of individual Member States."
"We have not seen a very effective policy on Zimbabwe, for instance."
"Lastly, I ask the Commissioner to concur that although Aung San Suu Kyi – whose house arrest is unreasonable – is a crucial player in the Burma affair, we must accept that many others are also languishing in prison, including many members of the Burmese parliament."
". Of course, the last point which the honourable Member made is entirely correct."
"The focus is understandably on Aung San Suu Kyi, both because of her record and because of her international status."
"She has been garlanded – alas, – for the extraordinary heroism she has shown over the years."
"There are, as she would say, very many who have been persecuted along with her, whom we also need to take account of, and that includes most of the leadership of the NLD."
"Secondly, the honourable Member is entirely correct that the effectiveness of any sanctions – and certainly of travel bans – is entirely dependent on the extent to which Member States implement those sanctions."
"He might not be surprised to hear me say that, during the last five years, I have sometimes seen a little distance opening up between what people advocate at European level and what happens in the Member States."
"That is unfortunate."
"On his first question, we know Parliament took a more vigorous view of ASEM and Burmese participation in the Council."
"I am not, at this late hour, going to pick an argument with the Council, even when it is not present."
"I think it was understandably concerned that we should not allow the ASEM process, which has been reasonably valuable over the years, to be taken hostage by our concerns over Burma."
"It is possible to take a different view on that."
"At least we were able to ensure that Burma's human rights record was discussed in plenary session in ASEM and to toughen up the sanctions regime against Burma in the Council."
"It was a difficult matter of judgment and I can understand why Parliament has its own view, but I hope Parliament will understand that the Council did not take the view it did because of pusillanimity."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for the commitment you have made during your term of office to trying to ensure a better situation for the suffering people of Burma."
"I just wanted to follow up on the last common position, where there is a distinct lack of clarity regarding the lists of companies."
"What exactly is meant by the measures that have been put in place?"
"Having said that – and it is clear from your response earlier on, Commissioner, that we are not going to get much more clarity on this – could we have an assurance from you that the Commission will look very closely and on a regular basis at the list of companies affected, and will update the list regularly, having monitored very carefully what will be necessary if this is going to be effective in any way?"
". My experience over the years, not only in the case of Burma but also in other cases, has been that when the Commission is asked to police a sanctions regime it does so as diligently as possible."
"The diligence with which we pursue these policies is not always as popular with some Member States as it might be."
"Sanctions can be sometimes a rather Pavlovian foreign policy reaction: what is important is to examine the credibility of sanctions and to ensure that, where you put them in place, you apply them as rigorously as possible."
"I was unable to give the honourable Member who asked the first question all the information he would have liked, but I have tried – as I am sure that my successors will try – to be as open on this as possible."
"It is perfectly legitimate for Parliament to want to be absolutely clear about these matters: about what is being done in the name of human rights policy in Burma and about how we are trying to make a success of an objective which we presumably all share both in principle and in practice."
"That is, to secure the release of an extraordinarily brave woman and those who, with her, have fought not just for democracy, better human rights and civil liberties in Burma but also for a better deal for an extremely talented people who have been impoverished by totalitarianism."
"In view of the forthcoming review of the Financial Regulation, does the Commission plan to submit a proposal to simplify procurement procedures in the external action field, in particular in connection with military and non-military crisis management operations?"
". First it should be stated that operations having military or defence implications cannot be financed from the Community budget – I have spent too long looking at the provisions of Article 28(3) – and are therefore financed on an intergovernmental basis."
"As regards the financing of non-military crisis management operations, the rules referred to in the question are laid down not only in the Financial Regulation, but also in its implementing rules."
"The implementing rules already offer simplified procurement procedures for crisis situations in external relations, such as the use of negotiated procedures."
"It should be recalled that such simplified procedures constitute derogations from the normal procedures."
"Moreover, Parliament monitors their use by the Commission and a special report on their use is presented every year to the budgetary authority."
"Arrangements for crisis management operations under the CFSP are currently being reviewed in the light of the functional needs of these operations, which it should be possible to accommodate within the existing framework of rules."
"For the longer term, the Financial Regulation provides for a review every three years, or whenever necessary."
"The Commission undertook to report on its experiences after the first two years of application of these new rules, that is, by the spring of 2005."
"This review will cover both the Financial Regulation and its implementing rules in order to see if, in the light of experience, any modifications to the rules are necessary, including the procurement rules for external actions in general and for crisis management operations in particular."
"I hope that is relatively clear."
"Commissioner, although I do of course agree with you that military operations are excluded from funding under the EU budget, my question relates to the police operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"According to reports I have received, there have been long delays in the arrival of equipment in the country, with six to eight months passing between the requirements being determined and the equipment actually arriving."
"The European Union has decided that it wishes to provide itself with instruments to ensure that crises, especially those in neighbouring countries, are overcome rapidly."
"Yet we are surely failing to achieve our aims if equipment arrives only when the crisis is already over."
"I should therefore like to urge the Commission – perhaps jointly with this House – to re-examine this procedure."
". I have some sympathy with what the honourable Member says in relation to both Bosnia and Macedonia."
"At present, each time there is a crisis-management operation, all the necessary supplies and equipment have to be procured from scratch."
"However, the contracting, which obviously takes some time, cannot begin until the head of mission has been appointed and has engaged his own staff."
"Therefore we have to find some way to allow the procurement to begin before the crisis-management operation is formally adopted so that the supplies are available as soon as the operation starts, or very shortly thereafter."
"We could obviously provide technical assistance with this preparatory work, but I am sure this is one of the factors that will be taken into account in the review of the implementing rules which I mentioned earlier."
"In my experience it is not always possible for us to operate as rapidly as we would like, and that is because of the rules which have been put in place, usually with good reasons – greater transparency, proper budgetary procedure, etc. Unfortunately, when people draw up those rules they do not always think about the real world in which we have to operate."
"The next item is the second part of Question Time, during which the Commissioners present at this sitting will answer questions."
"I should like to welcome Commissioner Verheugen and to begin with Question No 37 by Mr Ferber, on EU membership for Turkey and its consequences for the population."
"Are the Turkish-speaking members of the population in the countries bordering Turkey and in the Turkic Republics of Central Asia automatically entitled to Turkish nationality if they reside in Turkey?"
"Madam President, the answer to Mr Ferber’s question is in the negative; there is no such automatic entitlement."
"In that case I shall ask the following question; in your proposal on the opening of negotiations with Turkey, provision was made for a comprehensive suspension of one of the four fundamental freedoms of the internal market."
"Do you believe that this will stand up to scrutiny by the European Court of Justice?"
". I am unable to reply to that question, as I do not know the answer."
"During his recent trip to Turkey Commissioner Verheugen was confronted with complaints about cases of torture alleged to still be taking place in Turkish prisons."
"The human rights organisation Human Rights Watch also commented in a recent report that, whilst such practices have decreased in number, they still continue in Turkey."
"At a press conference on 23 September Commissioner Verheugen announced that a group sent by the Commission to investigate had come to the conclusion that there were no grounds for accusing Turkey of systematic violation of the rights of prisoners."
"Were the Commission observers able to visit prisons unannounced as they chose?"
"Does the Commission envisage sending observers regularly if the number of complaints does not fall"
". Mr Claeys, only a few days ago the Commission reported in detail on the situation in Turkey with regard to torture and ill-treatment, and I should therefore like to refer you to the Commission’s regular report published on 6 October 2004, which includes the outcome of the visit to which you referred."
"During this visit, Commission representatives met representatives from five human rights organisations and from two organisations in the field of forensic medicine, as well as government representatives and representatives from the police, gendarmerie and judicial institutions."
"The Commission came to the conclusion that further efforts had been made to step up measures against torture and ill-treatment, with the provisions of the new Penal Code playing an important role in this connection."
"Custody procedures have been brought into line with European standards, although prison officers do not always inform detainees of their rights."
"The authorities have announced a zero-tolerance policy against torture, and punishments have already been handed out to a large number of torturers."
"The Commission emphasises that there continues to be a large number of cases of ill-treatment and presumably also of torture in Turkey, and that it is now a case of eradicating these practices entirely."
"Further efforts must be made in this regard by the Turkish Government."
"With regard to Turkey’s progress towards accession, the Commission stresses in its recommendation that reform processes and the fight against torture and ill-treatment, which are to be extended, must also be consolidated, and that the Commission will continue to monitor this process closely."
"Madam President, Commissioner, my question was, in fact, whether the Commission intends in future to send investigation teams to Turkey as soon as there are complaints about incidents of torture in that country."
"I think that the Commissioner will have to agree with me that Turkey is a very special candidate Member State."
"Today, there was an article in the German newspaper stating that in Germany alone, more than 11 000 refugees have arrived since the beginning of 2003 asking for asylum on political grounds."
"How is this possible?"
"Either Turkey is democratic – and political refugees do not exist – or there is a real problem."
". Mr Claeys, the two questions you have asked are very different ones."
"The answer to the first is a clear ‘yes’."
"The Commission will continue to take all necessary measures, firstly to help Turkey in its fight against torture and ill-treatment, and secondly in order to monitor current developments."
"Special missions will of course also be sent to Turkey in the event that this is necessary."
"I should also like to make one further point; the sources to which you refer in your question, Mr Claeys, and which speak of systematic torture in Turkey, come from a political camp which you would not normally use as a reference source, and one which is diametrically opposed to your political position."
"You would not normally associate yourself with views that come from this part of the political spectrum."
"I am merely pointing this out for your information."
"With regard to the second question, as a candidate country Turkey naturally undertakes to comply fully with the political criteria, as do all candidate countries."
"Ensuring that this does in fact happen in future is regarded by the Commission as its most important task in relation to Turkey."
"With the strategic decision of the European Commission to begin official negotiations with Turkey regarding its membership, and in view of contradictory reports on the subject, what impact will the potential accession of Turkey in 2014-2015 have on the funds for the ten newly admitted Member States, particularly in the context of the common agricultural policy as well as on regional policy?"
". Mr Czarnecki, one can, at present, do no more than speculate on this issue."
"The Financial Perspective put forward by the Prodi Commission, which covers the period until 2013, does not earmark any funds for a potential accession by Turkey."
"This means that it is impossible to comment on the way in which the potential costs of such an accession might be distributed."
"There is no way in which detailed comments can be made on this issue at present, as Turkey cannot be expected to join the EU for another 12 to 15 years."
"During this period both the European Union and Turkey will experience economic developments which are as yet unknown to us, the budget of the European Union may undergo far-reaching changes of which we are unaware, and expenditure on related policies may also change."
"As a basic principle, it will be possible for any matters which require regulation to be regulated under the Accession Treaty, including matters relating to costs."
"Turkey’s accession will not cost more than the Member States and the Community budget are prepared to spend at that point in time."
"Thank you, Madam President."
"Mr Verheugen, I should like to take this opportunity to thank you for your personal contribution to the recent EU enlargement, involving my country, Poland, amongst others."
"I should also like to thank you for providing us with an extremely important piece of information, namely that Turkey may join the EU in 2019, but no earlier."
"I have an additional question to put to you, Mr Verheugen."
"Do you believe that EU funding will tend to be used mostly to eliminate differences between Turkish regions and European regions or mostly to support Turkish agriculture?"
". Mr Czarnecki, firstly I should like to extend my sincere thanks for the compliment."
"As in the case of Poland, the elimination of regional disparities will of course also be an important factor if Turkey ever joins the EU."
"At present, however, it is still entirely impossible to comment on the financial implications this will have."
"I should merely like to point out that there is an upper ceiling for resource transfers into the new Member States, as well as into the old ones, which is set at 4% of gross national product."
"This means that the transfer of unlimited quantities of money is impossible."
"In fact this 4% ceiling has never been reached for the large Member States such as Spain, Italy or Poland, and it never will be."
"It is therefore reasonably safe to assume that, when the time comes, it will not be a question of comparing Turkey with Estonia or Lithuania, but rather with Spain or Poland, and this means figures of a very different order."
"What measures is the Commission taking to improve the operational capability of the administration and justice system in Romania and Bulgaria?"
". This is a very complex issue, Mr Posselt."
"The Commission attaches great importance to the ongoing reforms of public administration and the judiciary in both countries."
"Not only must these reforms ensure that both countries are able to meet the conditions for membership, but they must also, above all, guarantee that after accession both countries are able to honour their commitments effectively as Member States."
"Signs of concrete progress have recently emerged in Romania, for example the formal adoption of a strategy to accelerate reform of public administration, the 2003 strategy on reform of the judiciary and the adoption of three fundamental laws for judicial reform in June 2004."
"Romania still needs to ensure, however, that these measures are implemented successfully."
"A strategy was adopted in Bulgaria over a year ago on reform of the public administration, not least as a result of a great deal of pressure on my part, and in general the country is making good progress with its implementation."
"I must make it clear, however, that major efforts are still required in order to make improvements to the organisation of work, to the administrative capacity necessary for implementation of the and in particular to the management structures of the Bulgarian administration."
"With regard to the judiciary, Bulgaria is continuing to make progress in implementing the 2001 strategy on judicial reform, even though there have been delays in certain areas."
"The Commission is closely monitoring developments in this field, and has supported these reforms by means of pre-accession assistance and close cooperation with other donors, including the Member States."
"Reforms of public administration and the judiciary are among the absolute priorities to be supported in the framework of PHARE multi-annual programming for 2004-2006."
"In addition, informal committees on reforms of the public administration and judiciary will be set up in order to conduct a structured dialogue with both countries on these issues and to monitor and support the extension of operative capacities in both fields."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"Following the summer holidays I received a huge number of enquiries from people living in my electoral district relating to this issue, in particular with regard to the extremely slow progress of border controls at the borders between Bulgaria and Romania and between Bulgaria and Turkey, with such controls often being halted entirely for hours at a time and the delays lasting for up to twelve hours."
"The issue of corruption was also raised in a great many of these complaints."
"As these complaints have raised the specific issues of border controls and corruption, I should like to ask you for your views on both of these."
". Mr Posselt, I am of course also aware of these complaints, and indeed some of the complaints we receive are probably the same."
"The Commission looks into all of them."
"As far as border controls are concerned, we are working with both countries to improve the system, albeit not always successfully, as is apparent, and in fact the programmes are not yet complete."
"Overall, however, we believe that there has been an improvement."
"With regard to corruption, you know that I have made very frequent reference to the issue in this House, and that all our progress reports call on Romania and Bulgaria to take firmer, more transparent and more decisive action in the fight against it."
"Although there are signs of progress in both countries, overall I should like to make it clear that I am not yet satisfied with the progress made in the fight against corruption in either of them. During the talks I held with both regions this stood at the top of the list of issues where the Commission expects to see significant improvements."
"In any case, I should like to make it clear that, before any possible accession by Romania and Bulgaria, they need to have effective legislation and effective institutions in place to fight corruption."
"Five Greek regions have been included in the Community action to address the effects of enlargement in regions of the Member States having borders with applicant countries."
"Given that the Commission itself has taken the view that Macedonia (Western, Central and Eastern) and Thrace are in by far the most difficult position, according to the criteria of income, the strength of the labour market, infrastructures and human resources, will the Commission give its assessment so far of the use of Community financial resources for these regions?"
"Which direction will Community action take after 2006 in view of the expected accession of Bulgaria and Romania and the beginning of EU-Turkey accession negotiations (it should be noted that Greece has borders with all three applicant countries)?"
"What provision has been made for transborder infrastructures with a view to promoting the integration of the area?"
". The contribution made by the Commission under the Structural Funds to the development of the northern regions of Greece consists not only in the implementation of operative programmes in individual sectors, but also in the running of the INTERREG programmes within the framework of Community initiatives."
"These programmes provide for the funding of measures to promote cross-border, transnational and transregional cooperation in the regions of EU Member States."
"The European Union provides cofinancing for structural policy measures in the Greek regions under the third Community Support Framework for Greece, which covers the period from 2000 to 2006, and programmes have been agreed for the regions of Western, Central and Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, the aim of which is to promote development and structural adjustment."
"A planned total of EUR 2.7 billion in public funding is to be allocated to measures in the three regions in question, with EUR 2 billion, or 75%, being provided under the Structural Funds."
"Although extremely good progress has been made with measures to improve local infrastructure, delays have unfortunately been experienced with measures to improve the performance of the local economy and the labour market and with those to promote use of human potential, due to the difficulty of implementing these measures."
"In many cases, the actual implementation of these extremely complex and ambitious programmes remains too demanding a task for the authorities responsible."
"In addition to these sources of funding, the above-mentioned regions also receive significant amounts of funding via the operative programmes implemented throughout the country under the Community Support Framework for Greece, and over 65% of Structural Funds earmarked for Greece flow through these horizontal programmes."
"The northern regions are also involved in a number of cross-border programmes, which include firstly the EUR 46.6 million INTERREG programme for Greece and Turkey, which was approved in late 2003, although no measures have yet been implemented under it."
"The second of these programmes is the cross-border INTERREG/PHARE programme for Greece and Bulgaria, for which EUR 254 million have been earmarked."
"A large number of projects have begun under this programme, including measures in the field of transport infrastructure."
"Thirdly, the northern regions are involved in INTERREG/CARDS for Greece and Albania, as well as INTERREG/CARDS for Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"EUR 126 million are earmarked for the programme with Albania, as well as EUR 103 million for that with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and several programmes are underway, including those relating to economic development and employment."
"The INTERREG/CARDS programmes are likely to be converted shortly into Neighbourhood Programmes in order to promote and strengthen cooperation between Greece and Albania and between Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"Pre-accession assistance for Turkey will begin with the 2004 programme, and includes a component for cross-border cooperation between Turkey and Greece, with annual funding of around EUR 2 million at present."
"The project’s aim is to improve cross-border cooperation between Greece and Turkey at a local level and to support the development of the economic potential of border regions."
"It is expected that funding for these measures will be increased in future years."
"One of the focuses of the PHARE programme for cross-border cooperation between Bulgaria and Greece, which currently receives EUR 20 million in funding annually, has been infrastructure, and in particular the rehabilitation of regional roads with access to the two existing border crossings."
"There are also plans for the cofinancing of three new border crossings with approach roads, of which one is nearing completion."
"To date over two thirds of programme funds have been allocated to this priority."
"Environmental issues are second on the list of priorities, and after Bulgaria and Romania join the EU cross-border cooperation between Greece and Bulgaria will be promoted under INTERREG on both sides of the border."
"– Madam President, following the transition to the Europe of the 25, the definition of border regions has surely also changed."
"My question is clear: will we have a differentiated extension and extension in time of the scope of this truly useful Community action?"
"Moreover, the Commission itself has confirmed that the Greek regions in question face very serious problems according to criteria of income, the strength of the labour market and human resources."
"Madam President, in conclusion I should like congratulate Commissioner Verheugen most warmly on the significant contribution he has made to the enlargement of the European Union."
". Thank you, Mr Papastamkos, for your kind words of appreciation."
"I should like to try once again to explain this in my own words."
"There are three different programmes covering the north of Greece, including firstly those relating to cross-border cooperation with Bulgaria, a future Member State."
"As soon as Bulgaria joins the EU, this programme will be discontinued and replaced by a normal INTERREG programme at the border between Bulgaria and Greece, as is usually the case between Member States."
"This does not, however, mean that less money will be provided; it will merely be a different programme."
"Greece also has a joint programme with the neighbouring countries of Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which are not yet candidate countries."
"Provision has therefore been made here for another programme, and the Commission is planning to combine these instruments into a single Neighbourhood Programme in order to simplify matters."
"This programme will run for the whole of the next Financial Perspective."
"It is not my impression that a lower level of funding is to be expected at this border, indeed rather the opposite, in view of the high priority accorded to the Western Balkans in our strategic considerations."
"Thirdly, programmes exist in relation to the border with the candidate country Turkey, and more funding will be made available for this border region as part of the intensive cooperation with Turkey, which is only in its initial stages."
"Overall, it can be said that purely technical alterations will be made to certain aspects of the situation in the Greek border regions, but that there is no reason to expect that funding will be reduced; in fact, it is more likely that the opposite will be true."
"Question No 44 will be answered in writing."
"In the spring of 2004, Advocate-General Phillipe Leger of the Court of Justice declared the Swedish State monopoly on pharmacies to be contrary to EU competition principles."
"Final judgment in the Hanner case is expected during the year but, usually, the Court of Justice adheres to the opinion of the Advocate-General."
"In the light of this opinion concerning pharmacies, what is the Commission's view of the future for the Swedish State monopoly on the sale of alcoholic beverages, Systembolaget?"
". – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, even though the Court of Justice may adhere to the opinion of the Advocate-General, it should be emphasised that such an opinion is not legally binding either on the Commission or on any other party."
"That is also true for the opinion that Advocate-General Léger issued on 25 May 2004 in case C-438/02 Åklagaren versus Krister Hanner, regarding the compatibility of Apoteket, the monopoly that exists in Sweden for the distribution of medicinal products, with certain Treaty provisions on the free movement of goods and the right of establishment (Articles 28, 31 and 43)."
"With regard to Systembolaget, the distribution system for alcoholic beverages in Sweden, the Court of Justice has already made a pronouncement on that monopoly’s compatibility with Article 31 of the Treaty, in its ruling of 23 October 1997 on the Franzén case."
"The article states that the structure and activity of State monopolies must be organised so as to ensure that no discrimination regarding the conditions under which goods are procured and marketed exists between nationals of Member States, so that trade in goods from another Member State shall not suffer any disadvantage in law or in fact compared with a domestic product."
"Having thoroughly examined the Systembolaget system with regard to points of sale, choice of products and promotional activities, the Court decided that the monopoly sales structure of Systembolaget was compatible with Article 31 of the Treaty."
"In the current state of affairs, the Franzén ruling provides the Commission with a guideline from a legal point of view in the context of assessing the compatibility of Systembolaget with EU rules."
"Madam President, I thank the Commission for that answer, which I think was an extremely good one."
"The reason for the question is that not only the issue of pharmacies but also that of the Swedish state monopoly on the sale of alcoholic beverages, Systembolaget, is mentioned in the Advocate-General’s opinion."
"I interpret the answer as saying that the Commission does not today believe that there are any problems with Systembolaget and considers that its activity is compatible with the EU’s regulations, a position I think is a wise one."
". I have nothing to add at this stage."
"The workers at the ten publicly-owned Spanish shipyards grouped within the IZAR company are now undertaking numerous mobilisations and stoppages in various cities in Spain, in protest at the Industrial Viability Plan for the sector of the State Industrial Holding Company (SEPI), which would mean splitting off the military from the civilian shipyards and privatising the latter."
"This is happening because the outgoing Aznar government granted 'illegal' aids to the publicly-owned shipyards involving a sum of EUR 1100 million, which now has to be reimbursed to the Commission."
"Does the Commission intend to negotiate the reimbursement of the above illegal aids in order to prevent the break-up and closure of the Spanish shipyards?"
"Does it not consider that the aids concerned should be declared 'legal' with a view to ensuring the viability of the Spanish shipbuilding industry?"
". – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission would like to underline the fact that the state aid that has been recalled, because it is considered illegal and incompatible, is to be returned to the Member State in question and not to the Commission."
"This is a misapprehension that crops up occasionally: whereas a fine imposed by the Commission for a cartel or abuse of a dominant position is credited to the Community budget, an order for reimbursement of illegal and incompatible state aid requires a transfer of money from the firm that wrongfully received it to the Member State in question and not to the Community budget."
"According to the case law of the Court of Justice and Article 10 of the Treaty, when a Member State encounters difficulty in enforcing a Commission decision requiring the reimbursement of an illegal and incompatible state aid, the Member State and the Commission must cooperate in order to find a solution to the difficulty."
"It is not a case of negotiation, and the Commission’s decisions remain valid in all respects."
"This kind of cooperation is currently taking place between Spain and the Commission."
"The Commission does not intend to review the decisions in question since that would create a distortion of competition in the EU shipbuilding market."
"In recent years the Commission has received a large number of complaints from EU competitors regarding the aid granted to Spanish shipyards."
"Moreover, it would seem impossible, anyway, from a legal viewpoint, to authorise the aid in question, in view of the condition not to grant any further aid in future to Spanish shipyards, which was laid down by the Council back in 1997 and repeated in Article 5 of the regulation on aid to shipbuilding that was applicable at the time when the aid was granted."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the truth is that the request for withdrawal or return of aid is an immense blow to the Spanish shipbuilding sector, a strategic sector."
"You are well aware, as I am, that the vast majority of the world’s heavy ships are directly or indirectly subsidised."
"This aid is permitted within the European Union and different formulae have been sought through regional governments, by unifying the private and military shipbuilding sectors."
"I would therefore urge the Commissioner and the political leadership of the European Union to reconsider this idea of preventing subsidisation of the shipbuilding sector, which is a strategic sector for Europe, particularly in view of the unfair competition on the part of Korea and the protectionism of the United States of America."
". Thank you for this complementary question, which raises a point of general interest."
"The Commission is perfectly aware of the importance of the shipbuilding industry in Europe and also of the importance the shipbuilding industry attaches to a level playing field within Europe, which would be at odds with an unregulated system of State aid to shipbuilding."
"There have been two recent visible signs of the importance the Commission attaches to this sector."
"First, you mentioned unfair Korean competition: you will certainly be aware of the Commission's bold initiative – which unfortunately took a long time to be reflected in a Council decision – firstly to bring Korea to the WTO and secondly, at the same time, to put in place a temporary defensive mechanism against unfair Korean competition."
"The second visible sign of interest is the Leadership 2015 programme, which was coordinated by the Commission with the participation of representatives of the European Parliament and the shipbuilding industry, to identify a number of proactive policies."
"This gives you an indication of how the Commission, with the other European institutions, has tried to accommodate the needs of the sector, while at the same time trying to comply with the law when it comes to specific subsidies."
"As you know, in the case of IZAR there is a whole history of non-compliance with the rules."
"Madam President, I would like to ask the Commissioner, in view of the international situation he has referred to and Europe’s situation in relation to the World Trade Organisation and unfair competition on the part of Korea, whether the Commission would be in favour of revising its current policy on State aid to the European shipbuilding industry."
". It is rather unusual to talk about the policy intentions of the Commission when – this Parliament permitting – the term of office of the present European Commission is only seven more days."
"They will be very intensive days, at least for competition policy."
"As far as the question on shipbuilding is concerned, and without, of course, committing our successors to a policy along the lines I have just described – namely, rigorous control of compliance with the existing, fairly generous rules for this sector, as well as active measures to promote, in cooperation with the industry, the sector's development – I would expect this kind of policy to be pursued."
"The tax relief scheme ‘unlawfully introduced by Italy’ because it was not the subject of prior notification, and ‘incompatible with the common market’ in violation of European legislation on State aids, was launched in 2002 for the benefit of 1 600 municipalities in northern Italy, some of which have never been hit by natural disasters."
"How did it come about that the provision was analysed two years after the entry into force of the decree and one year after the latest date envisaged for the execution of the measures?"
"Why was the rejection of ‘Tremonti-Bis’ announced without the interdepartmental consultation having been completed?"
"What steps will the Commission take to ensure recovery of the sums obtained fraudulently from the State, at least as regards the amount exceeding the damages suffered by the beneficiaries?"
". – Madam President, with reference to Mrs Sbarbati’s oral question, to tell the truth I should like to underline the speed with which the Commission has followed up this case, as it only learnt about it through the complaints received from 6 March 2003 onwards."
"The decision to begin the formal investigation procedure was actually adopted on 17 September 2003, once information had been forwarded by the Italian authorities on 4 July 2003."
"Besides, the applicable regulation does not set any time limit for the examination of a case by the Commission."
"Lastly, I must point out that the Commission adopted the decision to close the formal investigation procedure on 20 October 2004, or five weeks after receiving the final details from Italy."
"With regard to the second part of the question, the articles that appeared in the press before the Commission adopted its decision were based on information that did not come from the Commission itself, which only informs the media of its decisions after they have been adopted, usually by means of a press conference and/or press release."
"Finally, the Commission’s decision specifies that Italy must order all the beneficiaries to refund the incompatible aid, with interest, and it must inform the Commission of the measures implemented and planned in order to comply with the decision within two months."
"The Commission is monitoring the recovery procedure and may take the case to the Court of Justice if it is not properly carried out."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I just wish to state that I am quite satisfied with the Commissioner’s answer, and I take the opportunity to thank him not only for all he has done in carrying out his mandate for Europe but also for the prestige he has brought to our country."
". – May I just thank Mrs Sbarbati very much for her kind words?"
"Thank you."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of state aid is raised every time there is a natural disaster."
"As a result of the EU’s enlargement, Objective 1 or 2 areas in border regions are now bordered by other areas which have been deprived of this status."
"Do you believe it possible that temporary exceptions relating to state aid could be put in place for these border regions in future?"
". Unfortunately Europe, like every other area of the world, is no stranger to natural disasters."
"There have been a number in recent years."
"I am sure that some of us will remember the huge floods in Germany and Austria only a few years ago."
"With the support of Parliament, the Commission has tried to put in place appropriate mechanisms, within the limits of the financial resources available."
"These included the monitoring of state aid – subsidies or contributions from national budgets – and also direct contributions from the Community budget."
"As regards the 'Tremonti Bis' law referred to in Mrs Sbarbati's oral question, the Commission was not questioning whether companies suffering the consequences of natural disasters should be helped."
"The issue was whether the way the law was formulated enabled that objective to be met."
"In answer to question E-0699/03(1), the European Commission said that it had 'recently initiated a case concerning, amongst others, the inkjet cartridges and printers sectors."
"It is currently analysing the conduct of a number of companies in these markets in light of the Community's competition rules'."
"What progress has the Commission since made in this matter and is the market for ink cartridges and printers compatible with Community competition rules and, if not, what were the findings of its investigation?"
". – Madam President, this short series of questions shows the variety of topics on which the Commission has been active in the field of competition."
"I should like to say in reply to Mr Staes that he must surely be aware of the fact that early in 2003 the Commission began an investigation into the inkjet and laser printer market."
"Since then, the Commission has gathered a large amount of evidence and held many talks with printer manufacturers and reconditioned cartridge suppliers."
"Our inquiries have focused on the problem of determining whether the printer manufacturers are infringing Community competition rules because of the shapes and prices of their cartridges."
"The investigation is extremely complex in both economic and legal terms."
"The Commission is currently completing its analysis of the evidence gathered, and at this stage it is still too early to say whether or not there has been any infringement of competition law or whether the proceedings can be closed."
"The Commission will, of course, make any further news on this matter public as soon as possible."
"Madam President, I thank the Commissioner for his response."
"I should nevertheless like to point out – and I have investigated this for myself – that 75 cl of ink-jet printer ink is more expensive than a bottle of champagne."
"That is surely absurd."
"I very much have the impression that this is a case of tied selling, whereby printers are sold at bargain prices and ink is very much overpriced."
"For the time being, I content myself with the Commissioner’s response, but I should like to note that this inquiry should be completed urgently, because this is not benefiting the consumer."
". Thank you for that observation."
"I can assure you that the Commission will make public all the relevant elements."
"We are not yet in a position to find out whether there has been an infringement."
"You will certainly be aware that the Commission does not have the role of a price regulator."
"We live and work in a social market economy and it is of paramount importance that the Commission ensures that the conditions for competition are in place, pursuant to European law."
"These may or may not lead to consumers perceiving prices to be high."
"It would not be right in an efficient market economy for the Commission to set prices."
"This is not an option."
"But I am sure that just as this Commission did, the incoming Commission will closely monitor all the phenomena which might violate competition rules, causing adverse effects for European consumers."
"Thank you, Commissioner Monti."
"I will now bring the questions to you to a close, so that Questions No 49 and 50 will be answered in writing."
"We will now move on to the next group of issues."
"In an era when the food market is becoming increasingly globalised, a trend which will grow with the greater role of the WTO, many countries outside the EU do not have the same standards in terms of animal welfare, food safety and environmental regulations as exist in the EU."
"Therefore does the Commission agree that there should be greater emphasis placed on labelling of food coming from outside the EU, in terms of country of origin and methods of production, thus providing consumers with clear information?"
"Does the Commission not feel that it would be more just for Europe´s food producers and more in the interests of European consumers, if these other countries were made to have the same standards of food safety as exist within the EU?"
". I would first like to thank Mrs McGuinness for this question."
"The main objective of the food labelling legislation in the EU is to provide consumers with factual information regarding the characteristics of foodstuffs, such as composition, quantity and shelf-life."
"Under EU food law, origin labelling is not mandatory, unless the origin is clearly connected with one or more characteristics of a foodstuff, or it is necessary that the purchaser should not be misled as to its true origin, for instance where its name includes a geographical reference."
"Origin labelling in itself would not provide the consumer with clear information as regards animal welfare or methods of production."
"We continue to work through international organisations to improve world standards in areas such as animal welfare."
"This would offer the best way forward in meeting the honourable Member's concerns about the application of these rules in third countries."
"As regards standards of food safety, all food and feed placed on the market in the EU must be safe, irrespective of where it comes from."
"Third countries may only export food products to the EU if stringent conditions are met and a verification mission has been carried out by the Food and Veterinary Office."
"In addition, obligatory checks are carried out on all imports of animal products at the point of entry, in the EU border inspection posts."
"The recently adopted Food and Feed Regulation aims to harmonise controls on all other imported food products."
"These measures ensure that the food standards applied in the export sector of third countries trading with the EU meet EU food safety requirements."
"At the outset, I wish to compliment the Commissioner on his good work in a very difficult area."
"There have never been as many issues about food safety, and he has been there to protect consumers."
"You are correct in saying that food labelling is not enough to protect consumers."
"I have recently learnt that, in Ireland, beef from South America has been found to be labelled as Irish."
"That has to be a cause for concern in terms of misleading consumers."
"Would the Commissioner just comment on that as an area where the new Commission should certainly take an interest, since, if consumers are to have accurate information, we need to tighten up on labelling."
"I am not calling for a police force for food, but it certainly looks as if we need something more than we currently have."
". I would firstly like to thank Mrs McGuinness for her kind words about the work I have been doing over the past five years."
"I much appreciate that."
"On the issue of her supplementary question: there is specific legislation relating to beef labelling, namely Regulation No 1760/2000, which specifies the particular requirements in relation to beef, including its origin, and was enacted in response to the issues surrounding the BSE controversy some years ago."
"Any labelling in any Member State which mis-states the origin of the beef in question is a failure to comply with that piece of legislation."
"The Commission is always concerned at any failure to comply with EU law."
"If this has happened on any occasion in Ireland or indeed anywhere else in the manner that you have described, this is a clear failure of compliance with EU legislation."
"In those circumstances it is a matter for the competent authorities of the Member States, and in this instance the competent authorities in Ireland, to ensure that any failure to comply with EU legislation is properly investigated and dealt with in the appropriate manner."
"It certainly would not be the wish of the Commission to see any failure to comply with legislation of this kind and this is a matter which should be dealt with properly and by the competent authorities of the Member State in question."
"My question is about the Commission's position on the fact that the law of the Russian Federation on additional guarantees and compensations for military servicemen etc., in its versions of 21 January 1993, 21 July 1993 etc. …"
"I regret that I have to interrupt you, Mr Landsbergis."
"What I have heard so far does not appear to relate to the question, and you can only put supplementary and specific questions on this point."
"The extent of foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and the best advice to offer to expectant women remains controversial."
"A recent study by Dr Raja Mukherjee, London, claims that drinking any amount of alcohol can be damaging and that one in every 100 babies born is damaged by their mother drinking while pregnant but that many cases go unrecognised."
"Studies in the US, South Africa and Scandinavia suggest that one in 300 infants is affected by FAS."
"Affected children can suffer problems with memory, attention span, hyperactivity, physical abnormalities and a diminished IQ."
"There is a need for further research into FAS."
"However, heavy alcohol consumption is known to be damaging to the unborn child and some EU governments recommend a limit of one to two units of alcohol per week for pregnant mothers-to-be."
"In the light of this does the Commission have any plans to introduce EU legislation requiring alcoholic beverages to carry warning labels about the potential for damage to unborn children?"
". First of all, I thank Mrs Stihler for this important question."
"I fully share her concerns on this issue."
"Foetal Alcohol Syndrome – FAS – is a mental and physical disorder that can include mental retardation, brain dysfunction, physical abnormalities, learning disabilities and psychological disorders."
"FAS occurs as the result of prenatal alcohol exposure."
"Recent studies increasingly suggest that there may be no clearly safe drinking limit above zero alcohol for pregnant women."
"Key elements to prevent FAS are awareness–raising and consumer information."
"The Commission is at present developing a working paper on a coordinated approach in Europe to tackle alcohol–related harm."
"FAS is one of the possible topics to be addressed in the paper."
"The Commission is carefully studying the types of information that should be provided in addressing this problem."
"Possible guidelines on these could be included in the Commission's working paper on alcohol, which is planned for next year."
"The Commission also intends to prepare a report on the application of Council recommendations on alcohol and young people from 2001, which, among other things, will address the need for further action."
"In addition, the possibility of having a conference on alcohol next year, together with the WHO European office, is being explored."
"Finally, I should like to emphasise that we should not forget the central role of our Member States in tackling alcohol–related harm."
"An integrated approach needs concerted action by all stakeholders, including families, schools, employers, industry, advertisers and national regulators."
"Thank you for that answer, Commissioner Byrne."
"I also thank you for all the work that you have done over the past five years on the public health agenda."
"It is much appreciated."
"As you said, new research suggests that in some cases, one in a hundred babies could be affected."
"Other research suggests that the figure is one in three hundred."
"In fact, according to Friday's , which dealt with what is happening in France, about 7 000 babies born there are thought to be mentally or physically damaged by passive consumption of alcohol in the womb."
"Mr Philippe Douste-Blazy, the French Minister for Health, said that FAS was 'aside from genetic factors, the prime cause of mental retardation in children'."
"This is clearly a European issue and one that we have to take seriously."
"I hope that the Commission's alcohol strategy will look at what is happening in the United States of America, where alcohol products are properly labelled with a health warning."
"Commissioner, how can we make the possibility a reality?"
". Thank you for that supplementary question and for your kind words, Mrs Stihler."
"I appreciate that."
"As you may know, DG SANCO is at present preparing a Community strategy to reduce alcohol-related harm, as called for in the Council conclusions in 2001."
"Several areas for action have been identified as key areas."
"One of them is consumer information, to improve awareness of the risks connected with the consumption of alcoholic beverages."
"At the moment the draft proposals concern the legal and practical feasibility of having health warnings on the containers of alcoholic beverages, as well as at points of sale."
"These would include information on, for instance, pregnancy."
"If the public health authorities do not move in and occupy the field, it might well be occupied by industry."
"That is not entirely satisfactory, because the information being made available by the industry might not be consistent with best public health practice."
"I look forward to further discussion of this important issue in the future."
"The Commission's Food and Veterinary Office carries out regular inspections in the Member States to check whether slaughterhouses comply with Community hygiene rules."
"Following its most recent inspections in Greece, can the Commission say to what extent Greek slaughterhouses or meat markets, such as Rendi in Athens, have met the requisite Community standards?"
"Is the Commission satisfied with the progress made towards modernisation and does it consider that there are still shortcomings in food safety checks in Greece?"
"What measures has the Commission taken, or will it take, to ensure that Greece complies with its obligations under the relevant Community legislation?"
". Two inspections carried out by the Commission's Food and Veterinary Office in Greece, in July 2003, March and April 2004, revealed breaches of Community requirements with regard to procedures for licensing abattoirs and respect of hygiene requirements."
"These findings confirm the results of earlier FVO missions."
"Based on Commission recommendations, commitments were received from the Greek authorities on action to rectify these deficiencies."
"As regards the new Rentis market, there has been slipping in the timetable notified by the Greek authorities for its construction."
"According to our latest information, the construction works are scheduled for completion in mid-2006."
"Despite the fact that the Commission has had a number of high-level contacts with the Greek authorities in recent years about the food control system, progress has not been satisfactory."
"This relates to the specific issue of insufficient staffing levels in the Greek veterinary service to ensure effective implementation of EU veterinary legislation."
"That is why, in May 2004, the Commission sent a letter of formal notice to the Greek authorities urging them to remedy this situation."
"In the absence of appropriate assurances from the Greek authorities, the Commission sent a reasoned opinion to Greece on 18 October, asking the Greek Government to address effectively the problem of understaffing in its veterinary services within a period of two months."
"Failure to do so could lead the Commission to bring the case before the Court of Justice."
"The Commission is also considering similar action in relation to the control systems in Greece for the approval of red meat establishments."
"The Commission has been keeping the situation in Greece under close review and intends to continue to ensure that the necessary corrective actions are taken."
"Will the Commission confirm that the mental health sector will receive increased emphasis in the 2005 Work Programme?"
"Will it further confirm that human rights and humane treatment are fundamental to good mental health practice in the European Union?"
"Will it welcome the announcements in Hungary and Slovenia that caged beds are to be abolished, and will it continue to protest against their continued use in the Czech Republic and Slovakia?"
"In this connection, will it also salute Dr Jan Pfeiffer, named as one of Time Magazine's 2004 European Heroes for his campaign for a humane mental health system, without such beds, in the Czech Republic?"
". Mental Health is indeed a priority of the Community’s public health policy and under the Public Health Programme (2003-2008)."
"Under its first strand, dealing with health information, the Working Party on Mental Health has been created, bringing together project leaders and stakeholders."
"In the 2005 work plan, the focus of activities will be on promoting mental health and preventing mental disorders in children, adolescents and young people, based on improved data collection and analysis."
"There can be no doubt that human rights and humane treatment are fundamental to mental health practice."
"The Commission welcomes the recent adoption of the Council of Europe’s recommendation concerning the protection of the human rights and dignity of persons with mental disorders."
"It also supports the UN standard rules for the equalisation of opportunities for people with disabilities as well as the efforts to establish a UN legally binding instrument to protect the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities."
"The Commission is fully engaged in the negotiations on this instrument."
"The Commission is aware of the use of caged beds within psychiatric and social care facilities in Hungary and Slovenia as well as in Slovakia and the Czech Republic and welcomes the report on this issue that was published in 2003 by the Mental Disability Advocacy Center."
"As a result of this report, the Commission made enquiries about the exact position on the use of caged beds in these countries and drew the attention of the national authorities to the necessity to remedy this problem."
"According to information then received by the Commission, it appeared that the situation was improving."
"It was reported that Hungary has imposed a caged bed ban that will come fully into force at the beginning of 2005."
"In the Czech Republic, caged beds are reported as being gradually replaced."
"The Commission has launched a study on conditions in institutions in all the 25 Member States in order to establish the situation that currently exists, with a focus on disabled persons."
"The findings of this study, undertaken by Inclusion Europe, were presented in Brussels on 22 and 23 October."
"The study confirmed that caged beds, or netted beds – as they are also called – are indeed being used in several Member States, including old and new Member States."
"Furthermore, the study showed that the question of caged beds cannot be dissociated from the more general context of living conditions in large residential institutions."
"These conditions are sometimes unacceptable and do not respect the most elementary requirements of human respect and dignity."
"The study found that community-based residential services provide opportunities, but not guarantees, for better outcomes."
"From 2005, the Commission will produce a biennial public report on the overall situation of people with disabilities in the European Union."
"The report is intended to provide a useful tool for all disability decision- makers by providing accurate, dynamic and up-to-date information on the situation of people with disabilities throughout the European Union."
"The Commission salutes any appropriate efforts to make mental health systems as humane as possible."
"We also congratulate Dr Pfeiffer on his nomination as European Hero by Time Magazine."
"There are not many of us here, but I hope that the answer given by Mr Byrne, our Commissioner, will be widely read."
"I would like to place on the record our thanks as a Parliament for his work for public health over the last five years, particularly in the area of mental health and the way he has ensured that this issue has risen up the agenda."
"I invite him, as a last clarion call, to repeat that inhumane treatment in mental health is not to be tolerated in this Union."
"That includes such things as caged beds, which should not be a part of any country's policy."
"As he says, rights and dignity are what we seek."
"Rights and dignity are what he has talked about."
"Rights and dignity must be the future of European mental health policy."
". I should like to respond to my friend John Bowis' kind words to me by saying how much I have appreciated working with this Parliament over the last five years on issues relating to public health, and not least with one of the leaders in Parliament on this subject: Mr Bowis himself."
"It has been a pleasure for me to work so closely with such experts in the field for the benefit of our citizens here in the European Union."
"I accept his invitation to repeat what I have just said in relation to this issue, that the protection of those with disabilities, particularly those with mental health disorders in the European Union, is of paramount importance."
"Their human rights and dignity ought to be respected by all Member States."
"This is something that I believe is appropriate, I believe the Commission believes it is appropriate, and I am happy to hear that this House takes the same view."
"Thank you, Commissioner. Exceptionally, and with your permission, I would like, from the Chair, to express my agreement with what you have said and thank you for your work."
"Madam President, unfortunately I was chairing my group meeting when my question came up."
"I should like to apologise to the Commissioner and to the House for not being here to take the question myself."
"This is the last opportunity that I will have to thank Commissioner Byrne for all his help and great leadership over many crises over the last five years."
"I wish him well."
"It will not be retirement for him, but a new phase in his life."
". I should like to respond very briefly to my old friend, Mr Crowley, and thank him very much for his kind words."
"We have worked together and I now look forward to a deep friendship in the future."
"Thank you, Mr Crowley."
"What you have said will be recorded in the Minutes."
"I would now like to conclude Question Time."
"Questions No 56 to 93 will be answered in writing."
"The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the preparation of the Brussels European Council on 4 and 5 November."
"Minister Nicolaï has the floor first on behalf of the Council."
". Mr President, on 5 November the first European Council under this Netherlands presidency will be held."
"The last European Council under a Netherlands presidency took place in Amsterdam in June 1997 and resulted, as you know, in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"There are no such grand ambitions this time around."
"However, it will not surprise you that the major topics of the forthcoming European Council coincide with some of the main items discussed seven years ago."
"In 1997, as a consequence of the procedures for approval of the Maastricht Treaty – which had caused problems in some Member States – the issue of how the Union could be brought closer to the citizens was added as an agenda item."
"That issue has lost none of its immediacy."
"At the forthcoming summit we shall also be discussing citizens' involvement in the European Union."
"The other important topics for the European Council are: first, a new multiannual programme for justice and home affairs; second, preparation of the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy and the Luxembourg presidency next year; and, third, external relations."
"I shall start with cooperation in the area of justice and home affairs."
"This is a highly important topic for this European Council."
"On the basis of the Tampere European Council programme, much work has been done over the last five years to create a European area of freedom, security and justice."
"The European Union has strengthened cooperation between the Member States' justice and police departments and developed policy in the area of asylum, migration and external borders, but the work is not complete."
"The problems facing the Union are very much cross-border in nature: terrorism, organised crime, and flows of asylum seekers and illegal immigrants."
"In addition, the attacks of 11 September 2001 in New York and 11 March 2004 in Madrid have shown more than ever the extraordinary scale of the challenge of improving citizens' security."
"At the same time, the Union must ensure that citizens can continue to enjoy their fundamental freedoms and travel freely within the Union."
"The Council has therefore drawn up the programme for the next five years on the basis of the evaluation submitted by the Commission in June."
"This new multiannual programme – also called The Hague Programme – builds on the Tampere Programme."
"Over the last two days the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers have been discussing this project further in Luxembourg."
"The Council has reached broad agreement on the substance of the programme."
"The issue of qualified majority voting and codecision on asylum and immigration matters may, however, be the subject of further discussion in the General Affairs Council."
"Another point of discussion was the common asylum system."
"It seems that a reasonable compromise has been reached on this issue."
"The intention is that the European Council should establish the multiannual programme."
"The Hague Programme is based on the Constitutional Treaty but does not anticipate it."
"The presidency's aim is that the multiannual programme should make maximum use of the possibilities offered by the current Treaty."
"Other aspects of the new multiannual programme include combating illegal immigration, a strengthened partnership with third countries and a common visa policy, formulating basic principles for the integration of migrants, effective border surveillance, rapid information exchange between justice, police and security departments, combating terrorism and working towards a genuine European legal area."
"These are all essential components of a more secure Europe where the rule of law prevails and each person knows his freedom is a reality."
"The intention is that the European Council will ask the Commission to submit an action plan in 2005 with the measures to be adopted and related deadlines for the implementation of this multiannual programme."
"The second topic is the preparation of the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy."
"As you are aware, during the Luxembourg presidency essential issues concerning the Lisbon strategy will be up for discussion."
"The Spring Council in March 2005 will have to address the mid-term evaluation of the Lisbon strategy."
"The Netherlands presidency wishes to make its contribution to the success of this important Spring Council."
"On 4 November the European Council will take note of the report by Wim Kok's working party."
"The European Council can subsequently ask the Commission and the Council to use the Kok report as a starting point for their preparation of the Spring Council."
"At a dinner for Heads of State and Government, an informal discussion will be held on public support for reform of the Member States' economies under the title 'Managing Change'. The discussion will be introduced by the German Chancellor, the Prime Minister of Finland and the Prime Minister of Slovakia."
"They will share their experiences in this area with the other members of the European Council."
"The new President of the Commission will then explain briefly his vision for the future of the Lisbon strategy."
"The role of the social partners in implementing the Lisbon strategy will also be on the agenda at this European Council."
"Prior to the European Council meeting, the tripartite social summit of employers and employees will take place at European level."
"As I said in my introduction, we will also focus on citizens' involvement in the European Union."
"Following the disappointing turnout at the last European parliamentary elections, the June European Council decided it was time to return to this matter."
"To prepare the discussion in the European Council, the presidency organised an informal meeting of the European Affairs Ministers on 5 October, exclusively devoted to increasing citizens' involvement in Europe."
"The meeting focused on the forthcoming ratification procedures in Member States, which entail referenda in at least ten countries."
"The outcome of that meeting will serve as the basis for discussion within the European Council."
"The third topic of importance to the European Council is external relations."
"Four subjects will be discussed."
"First, the situation in Iraq: the European Council will examine a package of support measures for Iraq's interim government."
"This package will be presented formally during the working lunch with Iraqi Prime Minister Allawi."
"The package will, I hope, contain a political statement of intent for establishing relations with the EU and also a series of specific measures supporting the Iraqi Interim Government."
"Here I am thinking of EU support for the elections early next year, activities relating to civilian crisis management – such as police training – and building up the skills of the judiciary."
"Not only will this demonstrate the unity of the European Union, so badly needed following the events of the last year and a half, but it will also allow us in the Union to contribute actively to a real improvement in the situation in Iraq."
"The European Council will also address the situation in the Middle East."
"We will look at how the EU can further contribute to the peace process in the short and medium term against the background of the political decision in Israel on plans to withdraw from the Gaza Strip."
"I cannot say at this stage what might emerge from this discussion."
"As far as I am concerned, the five key points formulated at the March European Council are still valid."
"The European Council will also briefly discuss Iran."
"The international community, which includes the EU, must unanimously continue to put pressure on Iran to totally suspend all enrichment activities and improve its human rights situation."
"In this connection, the meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors on 25 November will be an important benchmark."
"Lastly, we will reflect on the situation in Sudan, especially in Darfur."
"We must bring pressure to bear on all the parties to achieve progress in the various peace processes."
"Our starting point remains that if progress is insufficient, suitable measures – including sanctions – are definitely an option."
"The Council will also discuss positive action, including the support the EU can offer to the recently approved extension of the African Union's mission in Darfur."
"That is an overview of the forthcoming European Council, for which preparations are currently in full swing."
"The presidency will brief you on the outcome of the summit at the November part–session."
". Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I had actually wanted to start my speech with the words ‘Next week we will have a new Commission’, but today I will leave that to you to decide, ..."
"... and will say that, whatever happens today, offices are about to be handed over."
"The present Commission’s term of office is coming to an end, and that of a new Commission will begin."
"That does not mean, however, that a whole new policy is in the offing; on the contrary, whatever you decide, there will be continuity in the broad outlines of European policy."
"It is important to point out that there is no dispute about the great issues facing Europe today, and that European policy will still be reliable, stable and constant even after the offices have changed over."
"It was with this in mind that Mr Barroso, whom you have already elected as President of the Commission, reaffirmed yesterday morning that the next Commission, every bit as much as the present one, was committed to creating a competitive Europe and to making the European economy more competitive."
"At the heart of these efforts was and is the Lisbon strategy, and it must remain so, with all its essential components intact."
"Change is, however, essential in one respect, and that is that we cannot be content with devising plans or ambitious perspectives, but we must also do some serious work on making these plans and ambitions reality, by which I mean really breathing life into this Lisbon strategy."
"Another essential aspect on which the President-designate laid stress is the creation of a secure Europe, one that concentrates on the needs of its citizens."
"The Europe we want is one that builds up its external relations with all its important partners, with prospective Member States in particular and with its neighbours in general."
"The topics with which the European Council intends to deal next week are very closely connected to these issues."
"I want to highlight the most important items, with particular reference to the Lisbon strategy and to the new programme for strengthening justice, freedom and security."
"The Commission very much welcomes the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy, which is now entering its decisive phase; the high-level group chaired by the former Dutch prime minister, Mr Wim Kok, is to present its report next week."
"The Commission is working on the assumption that it, on the basis of this report, will be mandated to draft concrete proposals for this mid-term review in preparation for the Council’s Spring Summit."
"This is a time window; it is the moment at which we will be allowed to get the Lisbon strategy onto the right track."
"That should not be taken to mean that nothing has happened in the last five years, but there is no point in skirting around the fact that not enough has happened, and the Commission is seriously concerned to note that one Member State after another has, above all, failed to summon up sufficient energy to translate its promises into actions."
"This now has to change."
"The Commission is still willing to closely consider all the options as to how the process can actually be got moving and can also be better supervised."
"The Commission believes that the EU must now really focus on the growth aspect."
"There is no doubt that Europe needs dynamic and sustainable growth in order to create more jobs and thus securely underpin our social model."
"For that to happen, we need more entrepreneurial initiative, greater willingness to be innovative, and more investment in research and education."
"Europe needs us to implement the reforms that make for more economic dynamism."
"In order to become a real knowledge-based economic area capable of keeping up with ever-tougher international competition, Europe must play the trump cards it holds in the areas of education, expertise and technical development."
"Let me very plainly reiterate, though, that creating a more dynamic and more competitive Europe must go hand in hand with the maintenance of the European social model; only in a more dynamic and more competitive Europe will we be able to uphold that model."
"We should not forget that some of our Member States are still far from possessing really adequate social protection."
"Competitiveness, cohesion and solidarity must be advanced in parallel, they must, so to speak, move forward in step with each other."
"The Lisbon mid-term review gives us the chance to achieve these goals."
"I want to point out, in connection with this, that the Commission is not relaxing in its efforts to improve lawmaking, in other words, making it simpler and more comprehensible, and, in particular, to attach more importance to the broadest possible impact assessment, making visible what happens to the sectors of society affected by the laws we make, especially the economy and businesses."
"The Presidency has prioritised measures aimed at simplification and those intended to improve impact assessment and to measure administrative costs, and these measures the Commission unreservedly endorses."
"We are sharing in the work on these measures, and we welcome the work that is being done by the high-level group representing Parliament, the Commission and the Council on improving lawmaking."
"Turning to the area of freedom, security and justice, the European Council will be adopting, by way of following up the Tampere programmes, a multiannual programme that will determine what the Union does in this area over the coming years."
"Since Tampere, we have laid the foundations for a common area of freedom, security and justice."
"The new Hague Programme will continue these efforts with the same vision and with a renewed willingness to cooperate with an enlarged and enlarging Union founded on the basic values of justice, freedom and security for all its citizens."
"Since Tampere, we have adapted our priorities to take account of the many tragic events and appalling atrocities that we have had to witness in recent years."
"It is now largely accepted that the Member States cannot meet these challenges alone."
"If we are to prevail, we must continue to work together within the structure of the EU."
"Another important element was the progressive development of a new policy, which deals with fundamental rights."
"The incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Constitutional Treaty, the forthcoming accession to the European Convention on Human Rights, the development of mechanisms under Article 7, the adoption of the anti-discrimination directives – all these things have had an effect on the EU, and they are reflected in every area of its policies."
"In the same way that we, in the field of economic policy, make the claim to be seeking, by our own efforts, to become the world’s strongest economic area, we should also be ambitious enough to make every effort to become the area of the world with the strongest guarantees of human rights."
"These aspects remind us that we have to find the right way between the need for, and right to, freedom on the one hand and security considerations on the other."
"Where security is concerned, the events of recent years have compelled us to make the combating of terrorism a priority."
"Although we cannot allow ourselves to be distracted from this, we should not forget the need to press on with the effective prevention and combating of all serious forms of organised crime, and this features in the new programme."
"In terms of practical implementation, the Commission welcomes the Council’s decision to introduce the codecision procedure for the sectors covered by Title IV of the Treaty of Nice, and will be producing an annual progress report on the results and the way in which this works in practice."
"Next week’s European Council will also consider the question of how to communicate Europe to its citizens."
"Here in the House, I do not need to enlarge on this task, for it is one with which every one of you has to do on a daily basis, and I am sure that we all agree that communication can be improved and needs to be one of our principal priorities."
"There is a perceptible gulf between the European institutions and the public, and we must close it."
"I believe that the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty in all the Member States will provide a great opportunity for discussing Europe with the public and for involving them in its political processes."
"While the ratification process remains a matter for the national level, the Commission will, while it is going on, communicate more with people in order to be of assistance wherever they need to be informed about the Constitution or have its advantages for our Union explained to them."
"It does of course go without saying that a communications offensive of this kind can be mounted only in close cooperation and partnership with the European Parliament."
"Let me conclude by saying something further about enlargement."
"The European Council will not, over the coming weeks, be taking any decisions about the most recent reports by the Commission, but they will be discussed and presented."
"Your House has already received the proposals that the Commission adopted at the beginning of this month, and I think we have reached a very important point where enlargement is concerned."
"Even today, we can predict, with a fair degree of certainty, that the fifth enlargement will be completed, as planned, by the accession of Romania and Bulgaria in 2007."
"We can fairly accurately predict that we will commence negotiations with Croatia at the beginning of next year, and we know that it will be at the end of this year that the great decision, with its far-reaching implications, must be taken as to whether or not to start negotiations with Turkey."
"Let me just say at this point that the Commission has endeavoured to produce a consensus-based proposal, one that has paid very close attention to the discussions that have gone on in the Member States and to what was discussed in this House – in every one of its political groups, no less."
"It was also intended that the proposal should take as much account as possible of people’s thoughts and ideas, not to mention their fears and concerns, which we do indeed share."
"The Commission is, for that reason, convinced that the proposals it has made constitute a sound basis for the decisions that have to be taken."
"The Commission believes that next week’s European Council will provide an outstanding opportunity to demonstrate both the continuity of European policy and its new-found dynamism."
". – Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, one of the most important items at next week’s European Council is, of course, the report on the mid-term review of the Lisbon process."
"Almost everyone is familiar with the key words of that programme: growth, competitiveness, knowledge, economy, employment and sustainable development."
"Everyone talks about them, everyone supports them, but results are lacking or altogether far too insubstantial."
"Of course, the world has changed a great deal since Lisbon."
"Certain Asian countries are experiencing tremendous growth, and the EU itself has also become much larger."
"We have been joined by ten more countries, and that does not make things any easier."
"We have also learnt – indeed, it was spelt out to us in black and white in the spring – that, whereas the Member States are adopting Lisbon directives, they are showing far less enthusiasm for actually transposing them."
"We also note that the structural measures necessary in the Member States have not been taken, or have not been taken in all cases, or have not been taken in all cases to a sufficient degree."
"Should we dilute the Lisbon ambitions on grounds that they are not achievable?"
"No, we need to do the opposite; a better approach is to go up a gear."
"I therefore wish the Dutch Presidency success in providing the initial impetus that steers the debate in the right direction."
"The obvious question, however, is how to achieve what we need to do."
"In our opinion, what we must not do on any account is to dilute the Stability and Growth Pact, nor must we on any account reduce our own room for manoeuvre to effectively do nothing in the debate on the financial perspective."
"What Europe must do, however, is to facilitate the evolution of Lisbon, and many things are needed and indeed possible in order to do this."
"I have always wondered whether the Member States can commit themselves to each other such that they are able to use that commitment as an external factor that can be called upon when they lack the courage at domestic level to do what they have to do, and when they are once again tempted to put off the necessary action for maybe just another year."
"It helped when we created Economic and Monetary Union, and it can help now."
"Should we not also all make an effort to speak about the Lisbon process in different terms; to convey it to people in a different way?"
"Even changing our vocabulary could help move the matter a great deal further forward."
"We have always talked of growth and competitiveness; we could also talk about prosperity for more people and greater opportunities for good jobs."
"We talk of the problem of population ageing; we could also talk about the prospect of a longer and better life."
"We must refine the message, but we must also provide a good messenger, and indeed this is something we have been lacking in recent years."
"I hope that we shall have a new Commission President who carries out that aspect of his duties, too, because we need him to."
"This could give processes such as Lisbon a boost."
"That is our task, and we must all do our share."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if you are planning to vote against the proposed Commission later on, bear in mind that this will be another factor causing considerable delay to the evolution of the Lisbon process, and people can really do without that."
"President-in-Office of the Council, I wish you every success."
". – Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists has concerns about the Dutch Presidency."
"We are afraid that you are pushing Europe further and further into the conservative corner, and thus actually exchanging the Lisbon agenda for a right-wing agenda."
"This means harder work and longer hours for the same pay, instead of entering into global competition by maintaining protection, by means of more intelligent manufacturing, by investing more in people and in knowledge networks, and also creating scope for this in public funds; thus revealing social Europe."
"It is no wonder that Queen Beatrix said yesterday in this House that Europe has a regrettable lack of enthusiasm."
"We are also concerned that you are found wanting at critical junctures in the political drama set to reach its climax here this morning."
"Whilst Heads of State or Government such as Mr Verhofstadt of Belgium and Mr Persson of Sweden are adamant that they would not want the likes of Mr Buttiglione either in their own or the European administration, you refuse to give the President of the Barroso Commission a signal to indicate that he must back down and meet the manifest wish of a majority in the European Parliament."
"What is more, the Dutch minister Mr Bot even says that he is squarely behind Mr Buttiglione."
"You are very free with your opinions on tax reductions and economising; yet lacking as a Presidency when it comes to the utterances of the Commissioner-Designate who constitutes a threat to European values: the values that you yourselves advocate so fervently."
"At a time when citizens seem to be seized with political passion, the Dutch Presidency is found wanting; yesterday morning it was even physically missing."
"However good the Dutch Presidency’s technical ability, it is politically divided and is thus becoming a sickly figure."
"Europe deserves something better, more socially focused, stronger and above all more democratic."
"We challenge you, the Dutch Presidency, to develop your profile and political face."
"European citizens are entitled to this, beginning with a clear statement from the Council asking that Mr Barroso meet the demands of the European Parliament; or is your talk of a strong European Parliament really just for show?"
"The choice is yours."
". Mr President, in view of current events, Liberals and Democrats in this House will have enjoyed the President–in–Office's deadpan presentation of a Council agenda of almost baroque design."
"The delivery of his speech at 33 r.p.m. was quite exquisite."
"This Council will work through the findings of the Kok Report on reviving the Lisbon Agenda."
"Advance sightings of that report suggest a surprisingly coherent piece of work."
"My Group welcomes the prospect of a leaner, more focused redirection of the Lisbon Agenda."
"I notice, incidentally, that the Kok Report tempers our rhetoric a little: instead of 'the most competitive knowledge–based economy in the world', it talks of 'among the best in the world'."
"I do not take this as a lessening of ambition."
"The focus for the Lisbon Agenda should not be international benchmarking."
"The goal is delivering sustainable prosperity and a better quality of life for Europe's citizens in a way that reflects the innate potential and unique dynamic of European life, not crossing some notional finish line ahead of China or the United States."
"The Kok Report rightly stresses the need for European Member States to coordinate better."
"We cannot run a single market without a single mindset."
"How many European states are setting their national economic agendas with Lisbon in mind?"
"Not many."
"Not enough."
"What matters this weekend is that the Kok Report does not become a substitute for concerted action by the Council."
"Welcome it; approve it; restate your commitment to it, but for the good of the European Union, make it real."
"The Council will also address the multiannual agenda for justice and home affairs, the 'Tampere-Plus', of which Mr Verheugen spoke."
"The ambition is to restate the broad scope of justice and home affairs policy in the European Union."
"Liberals and Democrats welcome that, but Europe has changed since Tampere and this new agenda must reflect that."
"Europe has never had a greater need of a balanced, liberal approach to migration and asylum."
"The evident desire in some national capitals to outsource our international legal duties to refugees and asylum seekers to clapboard states outside our borders must be resisted."
"'Tampere-Plus' also means 'after-Madrid'."
"The fight against terrorism and the urgent need for better judicial and police cooperation must be priorities."
"Liberals and Democrats will be particularly vigilant in ensuring that measures to make us safer in Europe do not erode our fundamental freedoms."
"The Union will soon have new legislation on procedural safeguards and the rights of defendants, and we remind the Council that those rights are non-negotiable."
"We also want a commitment to a new third-pillar data protection instrument to guarantee Europe-wide data protection for Europe's citizens."
"These rights must form the centrepiece of the new agenda."
"Yesterday I referred to the Council as the invisible elephant."
"Now the elephant is here, and I hope that it will listen to what this House says today, reflect on our rights and the way we choose to exercise them and respect the prerogatives of this Chamber, whatever happens during the vote today."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to ask the President-in-Office two questions."
"One is about yesterday’s sitting: I should like to know what the President-in-Office had to do that was so urgent that he could not join us."
"I think his presence would have been important and most welcome in the kind of debate we had yesterday."
"My second question is about the Lisbon strategy: before I go into it in detail, I should like to know how the Presidency is thinking of organising the relationships between the three high-level reports that have recently been produced: the Strauss-Kahn report, the Sapir report and the latest Kok report."
"Most of what is said in these three reports is rather similar, but then it is not clear what the relationship between them is or, above all, how they will be followed up."
"I should be grateful if the President-in-Office could tell us something about these two points."
"Regarding the content of the Kok report and how we might carry the Lisbon strategy forward, I should like to offer three considerations."
"First, when the European social model is mentioned, at least in these reports within the context of the discussion on the Lisbon strategy, there is a tendency to focus exclusively on the living standards and income levels that have to be guaranteed."
"We believe, however, that that is an extremely limited view of the European social model, which also involves the issue of how people live and hence the models of social cohesion that exist in Europe, how people consume and hence also the respect they have for our environment, and how people produce, thus trying to apply criteria of transparency and participation in a positive manner."
"Secondly, we think it is a real mistake, especially for a group of top experts, to consider that just labour market reforms and the need to cut down rules and constraints are the only real ways for us to become truly competitive."
"We believe that there has been a complete lack of any serious thought about the macroeconomic reforms that are needed and, for instance, about how to overcome the weaknesses on the demand side."
"Thirdly, in this as in other reports, the inclusion of the environmental dimension in the Lisbon strategy really seems to be merely a kind of token gesture: no one believes in it very much but there is a feeling that it has at least to be mentioned for the sake of conformism and political correctness."
"It is pushed into the background and left out of the real notion of growth."
"I should like to know what the Presidency intends to do on this subject as well."
"With regard to the sphere of justice and home affairs, we have two concerns on topics you will be discussing."
"On the one hand, while it is true that the G5 substantially ruled out the idea of camps outside the European Union, it is also true that the report you are going to consider does mention dealing with asylum applications outside the European Union, in cooperation with third countries. We do not, of course, oppose such cooperation – we just have to see how it works in practice."
"The report also mentions increasing the asylum capacity of third countries, something that I find particularly heartless when talking about developing countries. I should be grateful if you could tell us why this general opposition to the camps is then somehow picked up again in the report and how the Presidency intends to approach this issue."
"The second difficulty is clearly that of codecision, the infamous ‘bridge’, to which there is considerable opposition."
"What is the Dutch Presidency’s strategy?"
"Lastly, Mr President-in-Office, a question about the issue of enlargement or, rather, about this period straddling enlargement and the accession of the new Member States."
"I should like to know whether the Presidency intends to do anything about the Turkish Cypriot question."
"As you know, the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community has lost his majority."
"I should be grateful to hear what you intend to do, because the European Union clearly cannot abandon the Turkish Cypriots as it is doing at the moment."
". – Mr President, after this debate, Parliament has the opportunity to demonstrate that it is not a puppet of the Council and the Commission."
"If the new European Commission is voted down under the Dutch Presidency, that will go down in history as the moment when European democracy took a step forward."
"The new composition of the Commission that is to be decided later on will not change politically, but it is in everyone’s interests to remove the most controversial candidates."
"This applies equally to candidates with a history of putting their own business interests first and to candidates wanting to maintain the second-class status of women and homosexuals."
"Some important news is that the media have reported that Mr Prodi and Mr Kok are finally acknowledging that the most important objective of the Lisbon agenda of 2000 cannot be achieved."
"The measures chosen, aimed at giving large multinational enterprises greater scope and freedom, will not produce the most competitive economy."
"Establishing that Lisbon is failing presents Europe with new opportunities."
"It is time for a new objective: Europe as the most socially focused economy in the world."
"That was the original aim in 2000."
"We then made the mistake of confusing the long-standing pursuit of a social Europe with the quest for as many jobs in the commercial sector as possible."
"That mistake has now led to the proposal for a Services Directive that allows national legislation and collective labour agreements to compete with each other, to more extensive privatisation, leading to lower quality at higher costs, and again to a Ports Directive that would further destroy the work of the dockers."
"We come from the richest part of the world."
"Our problems are the disintegration of society and environmental pollution; problems that will not be solved by ever increasing economic growth at any price."
"It is not growth but a better distribution of what we already have that must receive much more attention."
"Instead of maintaining a constrictive Stability and Growth Pact that seriously undermines the role of the democratically elected government as a problem-solver, we can strive for better public services, social security for all and the fair distribution of the available work."
"We have the means to actively combat poverty, indifference, crime, damage to nature and environmental degradation."
"It is there that the new challenge lies following the failure of Lisbon."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union’s communications strategy has just been drawn up."
"Everyone agrees that this strategy has been and remains unsatisfactory and even inappropriate."
"Mr Verheugen was one of several speakers to say so today."
"Both within EU Member States and beyond the EU, the only viewpoint put forward is that of a single centralist approach to the building of Europe’s common future."
"Many of the Members of this House are actually sceptical about this model of integration, which after all is only one of many possible models."
"For example, a significant number of Members are opposed to Turkey being accepted into the EU, and the arguments they put forward are rational ones."
"As we search for a way in which the EU can communicate more effectively with its citizens, I would emphasise the importance of not disregarding attitudes and ideas which are as yet held by a minority, but which are becoming increasingly widespread and are equally valid."
"This is the only way in which democracy and pluralism will gain respect in this House, in the EU Member States and in the candidate countries."
"I thank you."
". Thank you, Mr President."
"This House has heard a great deal about the Lisbon strategy, and we would of course like it to succeed."
"For this to happen, however, we cannot treat it like some kind of magic formula that will solve all our problems by itself."
"Mr Verheugen has said Europe must be competitive, and we agree that it must be competitive in relation to other regions of the world."
"At the same time, however, it has been said that we need to build a European social model, which I take to mean an over-supportive welfare state, or a state that robs citizens of initiative by providing them with everything the state believes they need."
"Clearly, a choice has to be made."
"Either we opt for a social model and an over-supportive welfare state, or for competitiveness in relation to America."
"If no such choice is made, we will not be in a position to build Europe’s economic success."
"By way of example, Mr Nicolaï’s announcement that consultations will be held with employers, employees and trade unions are a step too far."
"It is quite sufficient for employers and employees to take part."
"If it turns out that trade unions need to take part as well as employees, I do not believe agreement will ever be reached."
"As regards the common legal area, we need to be aware that this must not extend beyond the legal framework laid down in the European Treaties that have been signed to date."
"If it were to do so, it would amount to a violation of the Treaties and thus to an attack on the EU’s cohesion."
"It should also be emphasised that foreign policy needs to be based on aspects common to us all, or in other words on positive values."
"Policy is extremely important in this field, for example in the case of Darfur."
"I thank you."
"Mr President, Mr Nicolaï, Commissioner, at the EU summit in November the German Chancellor will put forward proposals for the full liberalisation of the EU energy market by 2007, as well as for the creation of a European system for monitoring financial markets and for the harmonisation of the principles of financial transactions in the 25 Member States."
"Another of Mr Schröder’s proposals is the consolidation of the European armaments market."
"In this context, I should like to quote the French proverb ‘grasp all, lose all’."
"It might be better to have fewer plans, but for those plans to be more realistic."
"What is genuinely disturbing, however, is Mr Schröder’s proposal to harmonise the corporate tax base in the EU."
"This project, details of which were revealed in an article in yesterday’s edition of the German business daily , is supposed to be completed in 2006, and will result in tax bands being implemented in the EU, following the example of the VAT system."
"Does this really have anything to do with competitiveness, one of the European Union’s watchwords?"
"It certainly does not."
"Instead, it fits in with the latest proposals put forward by the French Finance Minister, Mr Sarkozy, the implementation of which would be a particular blow to the economies of the new Member States."
"We will not agree to this."
"Mr President, my thanks to Mr Nicolaï for his presentation."
"In my opinion, he has identified three very important issues on behalf of the Council; the first being the Lisbon agenda."
"I agree with all of those who say it is time that all the fine words are translated into real action."
"It is time that our European economy really establishes a lead."
"In my opinion, it is a good thing that there has actually been a certain change of model."
"I am not referring to those grand plans some people have for a ‘Super-Commissioner’ or something similar, and the change is not only from above, but more oriented towards the countries themselves: where can good examples be found; how can we support them?"
"I am talking about a bottom-up approach, in which I should like to call for special attention to the regional dimension, to improving compatibility between a European policy and an effective national policy, including by promoting the most technologically advanced regions."
"We must lend support to these success factors, but one aspect of this is the need for better determination of whether national parliaments are really keeping their side of the bargain."
"Perhaps His Excellency could elaborate on this."
"The second issue is terrorism."
"Many fine words have been said about this; but how is it possible, Mr President, that we were saying here so soon after the tragic attack in your native Spain that the security services really must now enhance their cooperation – indeed, that is what we had said on 11 September 2001 – that that energy now seems to be ebbing away again, and that it is again considered less important?"
"How can we really ensure cooperation on combating terrorism now, before any more harm is done?"
"The third issue is Tampere."
"This issue is crucial if we hope to uphold the credibility of a social Union."
"We will need to act boldly on this."
"It is no longer acceptable to have divergent policies that give people traffickers the opportunity to smuggle hundreds of thousands of people per annum like cattle across the internal borders of our Union."
"For this reason, I agree wholeheartedly with the Council about using qualified majority voting and codecision."
"We must stay firmly on this path, because it is time that Europe really solves the problem of these people."
"My message to those perhaps hoping to defeat the Commission this afternoon is therefore: bear in mind that there will be confusion amongst many people out there, because they cannot understand why the EU is shooting itself in the foot whilst there is so much to be done."
"Mr President, I shall concentrate on the problems of enlargement and on the important date for opening accession negotiations with Turkey."
"I should like firstly to congratulate Commissioner Verheugen for the extraordinary report on Turkey with which he has provided us."
"I believe it alludes to everything: arguments in favour of this accession and factors that only reinforce the fears we might have."
"The discussion we began to have in the Committee on Foreign Affairs yesterday evening has enabled us to distinguish two ‘clans’."
"The first is already beginning to draw up a formal list of everything Turkey should do before the accession negotiations are even entered into. As we are very aware, it is human rights that are at issue, as well as Cyprus and the situation of the Kurds."
"These are all matters that must be dealt with but that can be so over a very long period in the course of the accession negotiations."
"Others, like my own group, are, however, of the view that, at the geopolitical and geostrategic levels, Turkey constitutes an opportunity for Europe."
"We must examine the conditions of this accession very seriously."
"We must not already say ‘yes’ or ‘no’, but begin to work in an entirely even-handed way, that is to say in the same way that we have worked with the other countries."
"I should like, however, to express surprise, Mr Verheugen, that the report does not contain more scenarios or perspectives regarding the repercussions that Turkey’s accession might have for our social model."
"Shall we be able, for example, to continue with the current policy of social cohesion and with the Structural Funds, both of which are indispensable to European cohesion?"
"Would not this social model be damaged by enlargements that did not take account of it?"
"The report contains only very vague ideas about the adjustments Europe would have to make following a future accession, and these seem to me to be quite inadequate."
"The issue of Turkey’s accession is, above all, the issue of Europe."
"Shall we be able to enlarge while maintaining our model of solidarity?"
"We shall be particularly vigilant in this regard, no less than we shall be regarding the issue of human rights in Turkey."
"Mr President, public opinion and the people of Europe expect three things from the European Council."
"The first is that the Council make clear progress in the fight against terrorism."
"The Madrid attacks reminded us of how urgent it is to make significant progress, especially in the fields of cooperation between police forces, the organisation of Europol and judicial cooperation in criminal matters."
"The second thing we expect is that you do not go back on the protection of fundamental rights, whether this be in connection with exchanges of data, which must be subject to strict legal controls, or whether, above all, it be in connection with asylum and immigration, which cannot be subject to solutions that ignore human rights."
"Thirdly and finally – and while being very pleased that the Dutch Presidency is actually going down this road – we expect you to cross an important threshold by making the whole of Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community subject to codecision, which is a guarantee of democracy, and to qualified majority voting, which is a guarantee of efficiency."
"– Mr President, the President-in-Office of the Council has talked a great deal today about the need to have a safer Europe."
"We believe that before we have a safer Europe we ought to have a more democratic, freer and more welcoming Europe."
"On the subject of guaranteeing the right to asylum, a number of abuses and illegal acts have in fact been committed recently: from the Cap Anamur affair to the Lampedusa deportations, to the latest song and dance about the 13 Kurds who landed at the port of Augusta."
"All too often there are breaches of the Geneva Convention on non-, asylum seekers are hastily identified, and abuses are committed that even extend to the use of handcuffs, as we saw recently."
"The Council that will be meeting next week on the subject of freedom, security and justice will clearly be constrained by the decisions already taken by the G5 in Florence last week."
"In this context, I should like to ask what opinion the Presidency of the Council holds on the use of biometric data in passports and visas, and what the Council’s position is on the establishment of reception camps outside EU territory."
"Mr President, five years into Lisbon, in Ireland – and, I wonder, where else? – poverty, discrimination and homelessness are alive and well."
"A selective interpretation of Lisbon gave our countries' financial planners an excuse to push profit, even where it was at the expense of people."
"In Ireland, social spending cuts provide money to fuel economic growth."
"But, even when the profits flooded in, the Lisbon strategy, as our leaders chose to understand it, remained an excuse – a kind of mantra – to spend the new and plentiful money on anything but the people who needed it most."
"For example, enormous amounts of money have been put into university-level students but no money into early intervention for children experiencing learning difficulties, to give them hope of reaching college or getting a job and not having a life of dependency."
"In the Lisbon review, I urge you to correct any faulty – or indeed accurate –interpretations of the strategy that have the unfortunate effect of increasing the gap between rich and poor, able and disabled, strong and weak."
"Mr President, it is clear that more initiatives will have to be implemented if the European Union is to become the most knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010."
"The EU 2005 programme must be fully implemented so as to increase broadband access to schools and libraries and ensure that all our young people are guaranteed access to high-speed Internet services and development skills."
"Full broadband facilities must be available to all rural, as well as urban, areas and especially to the most peripheral areas of the European Union."
"The European Union must also implement the Financial Services Action Plan by the end of next year."
"This will ensure that bank and fund managers and insurers are able to operate on an EU-wide basis."
"A new framework directive on services – a key measure needed to complete the internal market – must also be implemented."
"I also believe that the EU must implement the recommendations of the European Employment Task Force."
"This Task Force seeks to promote greater flexibility in education, training and innovation, encourages greater flexibility on the part of workers and companies, and removes disincentives to employment."
"We must also invest more in research and development policies."
"We also look to the European Council to consider ways of raising awareness amongst European citizens about the work of the European Union and the relevance of the EU to our daily lives."
"The European Council is going to ask the European Commission to develop a broader communications strategy."
"This will be the job of Commissioner Wallström, who will have a key role in explaining how Europe takes its decisions and why Europe makes these decisions."
"– Mr President, I speak on behalf of the New Italian Socialist Party, represented in this Chamber by myself and Mr De Michelis."
"The mid-term review should be a time for clear, calm analysis and stocktaking."
"While acknowledging the major results that have been achieved, it is also important to highlight those areas and fields of activity where Community action has fallen short and been too slow in comparison with the parameters set by the Lisbon strategy."
"As reformists, we also want to re-emphasise the importance of the fact that growth and economic development cannot and must not occur to the detriment of the social model of European solidarity that has been put forward, which can be brought up to date but must not have its guidelines and principles eroded away."
"In the end, we believe that the objective of creating a citizens’ Europe should be a fundamental target."
"We have to identify those methods of communicating and interacting with the people that will bring Europe ever closer to the Europeans, because unfortunately the Community institutions have, in the past, been seen all too often as something abstract and distant – a trend that must be reversed."
"Mr President, Mr Verheugen, the Lisbon strategy is crucial, yet today it has been acknowledged that inadequate progress has been made with it."
"It is important to remember that the provisions and goals of the Lisbon strategy disregarded the EU’s enlargement and did not take full advantage of it as a catalyst for development."
"It is also likely that too many priorities were set."
"At present, we note a lack of progress with the implementation of the strategy."
"Key economic reforms have been neglected too, and this has resulted in a slow-down in growth."
"At the same time, certain governments are attempting to share their problems with others, for example by proposing tax harmonisation or initiatives to support European giants instead of the small and medium-sized enterprises that are far more important."
"The end result of all this can only be that we all lose this race."
"How can the situation be rectified?"
"First and foremost, the priorities of the Lisbon strategy should be reduced to an absolute minimum, and priorities relating to economic growth should be placed at the top of the agenda."
"Which priorities would this involve?"
"Firstly, completion of the single market."
"This encompasses aspects such as the market for services and the discrepancy between governments’ declarations and their actions, as in the case of the quota limitations imposed on Polish service providers on the German market, and the fact that the situation has in fact deteriorated since 1 May 2004."
"Secondly, support for small and medium-sized enterprises, above all by simplifying legislation."
"Thirdly, modernisation of the labour market as employees must be mobile in order to win the fight to be competitive."
"We should therefore work on the assumption that as of 1 May 2006, two years after enlargement, there will be no restrictions on the movement of persons within the European Union."
"Fourthly, the Seventh EU Framework Programme should abolish the existing preference given to research institutions from the old Member States over those from the new Member States."
"Fifthly, one of the instruments used to increase the EU’s competitiveness should be an effectively implemented cohesion policy, which takes into account the additional catalyst for development provided by the new Member States."
"In addition, the role of the European Commission should be stepped up to include the task of holding governments to account for the effectiveness of their actions."
"And last but not least, the European Parliament should not only be kept informed of decisions relating to the Lisbon strategy, but should also have an influence on such decisions, as this would facilitate the building of consensus at national level."
"I thank you."
"– Mr President, I have been forced to note with some amazement that in both introductory speeches – in their discussions of the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy – the words ‘environment’ and ‘sustainable development’ were never used."
"I am not interested in formal acknowledgements or ritual tributes, but I do wonder, Mr Verheugen, if this is the type of continuity to which you alluded."
"Apart from that, however, there are three good reasons to consider this third pillar of the Lisbon strategy to be still relevant."
"The first is that a few days ago an international event of the greatest importance occurred, something highly positive for once: the ratification by the Duma of the Kyoto Protocol, a field in which the European Union has been a world leader."
"The second is that, as chance would have it, the environment is precisely the field in which the Member States are furthest behind schedule in their implementation of Community policies."
"There is yet another even more important reason, which has to do with the subject that government offices throughout Europe are quite rightly – and rather obsessively – concerned about at the moment: competitiveness."
"How can the European Union regain its competitiveness in world markets if it does not commit itself to the new technologies, or if it does not take on leadership – including technological leadership – in the field of environmental technologies?"
"This is the issue that I am raising, and I hope it will be a key point in the strategy review process."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I should like to express my thanks for the report."
"I should like to speak on two matters: the first concerns Lisbon."
"The European social model can certainly be combined with competitiveness, cohesion and solidarity, which are not mere buzzwords but need to be transformed into political actions."
"To this end the results will have to be assessed in practical terms and our great ambitions must not be abandoned."
"The main road, I must insist, is the one that leads on firmly towards training, schools and research, to give everyone the means to grow and to take part in active citizenship, so that social protection does not turn into a benefits culture."
"The second matter concerns citizens’ Europe, which is having difficulty in taking off and certainly requires a great effort on our part in the area of communications."
"If, however, we do not want it to remain a mere statement of intention, we must support it with adequate funding within our budget, and the Constitutional Treaty can certainly provide some valuable momentum."
"– Mr President, we are very concerned about the implementation and revision of the Lisbon Agenda, which was adopted in March 2000."
"The concern is that today, instead of what was promised, we have 20 million people unemployed and around 70 million people at risk of poverty."
"These figures are appalling."
"If it is true that the Lisbon Agenda has been one big failure, as President Prodi recently stated at the end of his term in office, it has failed solely in terms of the expectations it aroused and the promises it made in social areas, namely full employment and social inclusion, and in terms of knowledge and research. It has not failed in the areas that were of interest to the large economic and financial groups."
"Liberalisation and privatisation in essential sectors such as energy, postal services, telecommunications, essential public services and financial sectors continues apace, to the extent that more and more legislative proposals have appeared in areas that jeopardise fundamental human rights and workers’ rights, such as the proposal for a directive aimed at creating an internal services market – in other words, more privatisations – and the retrograde and unacceptable proposal for a directive on working hours."
"The Lisbon Agenda must, therefore, be reviewed, so that its content can be amended and so that jobs, and the social inclusion that is needed, can be given priority."
"– Mr President, to talk of security problems in Europe and to ignore the dangers of Islamic terrorism, as the reports at the beginning of this debate did to a great extent, is extremely serious. It shows just how inured we have become, perhaps partly because of the propaganda about the fairy tale of moderate Islam and partly because of the influence that the extremely powerful Islamic lobby, rich in petrodollars, exerts over European politics, the individual Member States and the media."
"With regard to the important and sensitive problem of asylum, however, I believe we should encourage the perhaps belated efforts to relocate the examination of asylum-seekers’ files and situations to the territories of third countries, where it should come within the political and social remit of those countries – and I am thinking of the African countries here."
"Perhaps African leaders have clearer ideas on this subject, since they have told us of the trend to fraudulently use this technique – this trick – of falsely applying for asylum, and they have called on us to open our eyes."
"In order to involve the African countries, however, we need to change our aid policy and make it more transparent and more worthwhile for the peoples of Africa."
"Mr President, the European Council should understand that the British people have never voted to be governed by former communists, especially those who helped to enforce the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe."
"Neither do we want unelected commissioners who hide their murky involvement in the corrupt use of public money, tax evasion and bribery."
"We demand a duty of care from our government, which is why, last week, I gave detailed information about institutionalised corruption in this place to the Serious Fraud Office in London and I called on the British Government to withhold all future funding of the European Union under the terms of the Vienna Convention."
"No British Parliament has ever voted to pass British taxpayers' public money to third parties who cannot be trusted."
"Mr President, I welcome this debate, which takes place only two weeks before the European Council discusses Wim Kok's report on the Lisbon Agenda."
"This is the European Union's most pressing issue."
"The health of the European economy is a matter of deep concern to millions of our citizens who remain without a job."
"It is of vital concern to future competitiveness that Europe will need to deal with the twin challenges of major demographic change and the competition that we are increasingly facing from China, India and other emerging economies."
"In July when Prime Minister Balkenende addressed Parliament, he said that Europe's economy has 'stiff joints and makes little use of its head'."
"This makes our competitors too quick and too smart for us."
"Anyone who looks objectively at the developments sees that Europe is losing ground, even in periods of economic recovery."
"These were wise words and I applaud the priority which the presidency is giving to the economic sclerosis that affects significant areas of this continent."
"If we do not push radical economic reform, then Europe will fail."
"This does not apply only to our current generation: it will also leave a legacy of failure for those who come after us."
"Mr Prodi claimed earlier this week that the reason for the failure of the Lisbon process is the lack of majority voting in the European Union."
"What nonsense!"
"The failure lies in the lack of political will to pursue the reforms that are plainly needed."
"Some people are trying to recast Lisbon to place more emphasis on the social and environmental goals at the expense of the hard economic decisions that are required."
"It is no surprise to me that the nations of Europe that are producing economic growth are those that have pushed the necessary reforms."
"No-one denies that these reforms were painful, but they were necessary."
"It seems to me that Parliament, the Commission and the Kok Working Group all agree that real progress needs to be made."
"The question is whether Europe has the courage to move to action, rather than just continuing to express words."
"Having taken two minutes to consider the matter, I would like to state that what Mr Mote is asking for is of course contrary to the laws of the European Union."
"I say this in order that the Minutes may record that Mr Mote made an illegal demand in this House."
"Mr President, I am pleased that both the President-in-Office and Commissioner Verheugen stressed that the Kok report is not an end-point but a starting point for the mid-term review of Lisbon to be concluded at next year's spring summit."
"I am glad about that because the early drafts I have seen of the Kok report would be an inappropriate conclusion for a mid-term review as the balance is wrong."
"I disagree with Mr Evans on this point."
"Quite correctly, the report makes much of the need for improved growth and competitiveness, but you have to read well into it before you come across the notion that social policy can be a productive factor."
"It is a productive factor."
"We need improved competitiveness to maintain our European social model, but that model is a productive factor in itself for achieving competitiveness."
"Rather than talking in grand terms, let me give a specific example."
"I read recently that in the new Member States, as many as 40% of workers are affected by ill-health or injury related to work."
"The figure in the former 15 Member States is much lower, at 25%."
"I think that is in large part due to the comprehensive framework of health and safety laws we have had in place in Europe for over a decade."
"We need to bear that in mind."
"That is social policy as a productive factor, contributing to competitiveness, contributing to quality at work, quality jobs, and maintaining people's active involvement in the labour market."
"Let us maintain the Lisbon balance overall."
"Mr President, nobody questions the importance of Tampere I: it set a direction, it opened up an internal space and, consequently, numerous actions were initiated in all areas."
"Those of us who promoted and actively participated in Tampere I know that Tampere II has to be radically different."
"It cannot simply be a multi-annual programme with the same characteristics as the previous one."
"It must be able to choose, select, specify, emphasise and, above all, prioritise."
"These are not the only verbs one could use to describe what Tampere II must achieve."
"We must move on from the general fight against terrorism to a European political project able to deal with the fight against Islamist terrorism; from general plans to combat terrorism, we must move on to explaining what concrete measures our fight against a specific organisation requires."
"I would like to point out that our colleague Alain Lamassoure has just introduced a European pilot project for combating Islamist terrorism into this Parliament’s budget: I believe that that is the path the European Council must take."
"The Prime Minister of Luxembourg, replacing the European Union’s President-in-Office, has stated that combating terrorism is our continent’s priority, since the attacks in Madrid, the Philippines and Asia show that this problem affects all of us."
"But it is not just a question of foreign policy: it must have consequences for internal policy."
"There can be no European foreign policy unless we first have a shared internal policy within the European Union; there can be no foreign policy in Europe unless we first create an area of freedom capable of dealing with the fight against terrorism."
"Mr President, the new priorities of the area of freedom, security and justice must, above all, be the promotion and protection of fundamental rights, and not only those of Europeans but also those of third country nationals."
"This objective can, moreover, only be achieved if the efforts made to develop this area are not confined to creating a Fortress Europe."
"The debate on asylum must be refocused upon Europe’s humanitarian duty."
"We must, indeed, preserve the right of asylum."
"All those in danger must be able to find refuge in Europe."
"Our objective is still to obtain an acceptable level of European harmonisation."
"It turns out that the first phase has not led to the harmonisation we wanted."
"Harmonisation has mainly been from the bottom up."
"It is therefore vital that we as quickly as possible enable new legislative instruments to be adopted."
"We must have an overall approach to the management of migration flows and of borders."
"I welcome the Presidency’s proposal to make the transition, on 1 April 2005, to qualified majority voting and to codecision for the whole of the chapter on asylum, immigration and borders, and I call for those Member States which are not convinced to allow, as quickly as possible, this transition to codecision in all areas in accordance with Article 67 of the Treaty."
"European cooperation against terrorism should also continue to be strengthened and, in particular, it should be made easier for the relevant national services and the services responsible for the fight against terrorism to exchange information."
"This must go hand in hand with a strengthening of the roles of Europol and Eurojust."
"We therefore call upon the Member States to remain faithful to the spirit of Tampere in order to respond to these challenges."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Nicolaï, Commissioner, in the 1980s, Jacques Delors gave the European project a new impetus and a new vision, when he proposed the internal market and the single currency."
"In 2000, at the Lisbon Summit, the EU once again set itself a challenge for a decade: to become the most dynamic and most competitive economy in the world."
"2005 is almost upon us, already the midway point in the decade, and the balance sheet does not make very cheerful reading."
"Scant progress has been made and in a matter of days Mr Kok will present his interim evaluation report, which will be the main item on the agenda at the November European Summit."
"We are not yet able to comment on the conclusions of the interim report in this House, but I do wish to raise two points that I feel are extremely relevant."
"The first relates to the fact that when the intention of a strategy is to influence everything, it normally influences nothing."
"We must therefore set clear priorities within a clear strategy."
"There is no point in favouring the economic strand of the strategy to the detriment of the social or environmental strand, or vice-versa."
"What we must do is set out political priorities for all of the strands."
"These are difficult choices, but they cannot be put off any longer."
"The second point is that I wish to emphasise that the Lisbon Strategy cannot only be seen as a responsibility of the EU."
"Success will depend, to a large extent, on the Member States’ ability to put the structural reforms into practice, which means that they will have to play a leading role at world level."
"I still believe that the aims of the Lisbon Strategy are neither utopian nor impossible to achieve."
"Back in the 1980s, for example, who would have believed that more than 300 million Europeans would be using the single currency today?"
"As Kohl once said, the visionaries end up being the realists."
"One last word, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to welcome the position taken by the President – or so I hope – of the next European Commission, in making the Lisbon Strategy a priority for his term in office."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by emphasising strongly how pleased I am to be here in your midst, particularly against the background of questions asked in the course of the very important debate on the Commission that I attended yesterday."
"One of these specifically related to the reason for my absence."
"It is simple: it was my duty to escort the Queen of the Netherlands here and to be present for her speech."
"The main thing, however, is that you can be assured that we are following everything that is said here about the extremely important issue of Parliament’s decision on the new Commission particularly closely."
"The Presidency is keeping in close contact with all the parties concerned and is not missing a word: you can be assured of that."
"All the same, the Presidency is not involved in this important discussion between Parliament and the new Commission President."
"However involved we feel in this, fully fledged democracy determines that Parliament enters into discussion with the new Commission President."
"I should like to emphasise here that no one, including the Presidency, would deny you as a Parliament any right to take decisions at your own discretion."
"That, too, is compatible with the fully fledged democracy that is Europe."
"That right is yours and I take it for granted that you as a Parliament will presently take a prudent, considered decision."
"I should then like to express my thanks for the words of encouragement that many of you have given to the Presidency and regarding the coming European Council, and for your endorsement in many cases of the issues and the way in which they are discussed."
"Of course, your opinions may subsequently differ on the subject matter, and that is just the way it should be."
"In fact, the only general criticism I have heard regarding the role of the Presidency has come from Dutch Member Mr van den Berg from the Socialists Group in the European Parliament, but other than that I feel encouraged, on the whole, in the path we are taking as a Presidency."
"As regards the coming European Council, many of you have called for attention to the Lisbon Strategy."
"I should therefore like to formally draw attention to the fact that, as you know, the Spring European Council is the crucial European Council – the one at which decisions on the whole Lisbon Strategy are to be taken – and that the activities of this November’s European Council should be seen as a preparation for this Spring European Council, to be led by the Luxemburg Presidency."
"Nevertheless, a great deal is at stake, and I very much agree with everyone – Mr Verheugen was the first to emphasise this – that it is extremely important to give a renewed impetus to this Lisbon Strategy, and therefore to the development of the most competitive possible knowledge-based economy in the world."
"I also very much agree with the many people, such as Mr Eurlings and Mr Jonathan Evans, who have called for action rather than words; for theory to be translated into tangible actions."
"I also very much agree with the many people who advocated looking to national governments and trying not to pass the buck to Brussels."
"Let us be aware, however, that the Lisbon agenda is primarily the responsibility of national governments and that they must put their money where their mouth is."
"Mrs Thyssen was one of the first to underline this, but Mr Watson, Mr Eurlings and others also emphasised that it is important to have the courage to implement structural reforms at national level."
"Indeed, this is the very topic for discussion at the informal dinner with the Heads of State or Government."
"The implementation of such badly needed reforms will involve an exchange of national experiences."
"Some have pointed out that the balance in the Lisbon Strategy, as presented here by the Presidency, and as planned for discussion in the European Council, is not correct, paying too little attention to the components other than economic growth itself, namely the social and environmental components."
"I can assure those who drew attention to this, such as Mr van den Berg and Mrs Frassoni, and others that we shall maintain that balance."
"Of course, the Council will have its say and will have to draw its own conclusions but, in Council, the Presidency will explicitly hold on to the three pillars that the Lisbon Strategy had and must continue to have."
"I do not at all agree, therefore – this was another of Mr van den Berg’s more cutting remarks – that this is a conservative approach and scheme."
"On the contrary, I think that we should actually be progressive in the way we promote economic growth in conjunction with the two other pillars."
"Indeed, it is good that the former Labour Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Mr Kok, is chairing the task force for the mid-term review and is to present his report."
"I really do hope that the Council can use that as a good starting point for further discussion."
"A number of you rightly and understandably mentioned the other important item that is on the agenda more with a view to decision making, in a sense, at the coming European Council: justice and home affairs."
"Many have rightly said in this regard that we must not lose energy following the horrific attack in Madrid."
"We must use this energy to really take steps towards the interchange of data and towards greater police and judicial cooperation."
"Mr Eurlings and Mr Bourlanges and many others rightly made this remark."
"That is exactly what we are doing."
"This process is under way, as you know, and I am decidedly positive about the steps that are now being taken."
"We shall be discussing these."
"We shall also be discussing them in December, because then we shall have the actual report by the Counter-Terrorism Coordinator at our disposal, and shall bring this up for discussion in the European Council."
"It has also been rightly pointed out that, in the face of the great need to produce closer cooperation and come up with more extreme possibilities and measures in the fight against terrorism, we must not lose sight of the essential fundamental human rights and freedoms."
"Mr Watson and others made this observation."
"This important issue will certainly come up for discussion in this way at this and the December European Councils."
"Some – Mrs Frassoni and Mr Catania – asked more specifically about the ideas on asylum and migration policy."
"Camps have been mentioned, although we do not call them that, but rather speak of reception capacities in the region."
"Cooperation is needed with the third countries from which the asylum seekers originate."
"The Presidency proposes tackling the problems at source by means of enhanced cooperation with third countries, and hopes that this approach can be confirmed and decided at the European Council."
"This means that we must show real commitment on our part, but can also expect something from these third countries as regards migration and asylum."
"Many, including Mr Eurlings and Mr Bourlanges and Mrs Rühle, have rightly and very importantly referred to the question of principle that is the desired transition to qualified majority voting and codecision in this whole field of asylum and migration."
"I perfectly understand the desire on the part of everyone that has talked about this to see the changeover in this field."
"I cannot deny that it is a difficult discussion."
"You know that the Presidency shares the views expressed by a number of you here, namely that we should indeed take that path as far as possible."
"At all events, the Presidency is making a supreme effort towards this, and so I hope that we can achieve a sufficiently positive decision in this direction."
"A number of you have drawn attention to a third item that also features on the agenda of the coming European Council, which concerns the problem of ‘communicating Europe’: that is to say, promoting greater involvement of citizens in Europe, in what you do here, in what the Council does, in what the Commission does, in what we do in Brussels."
"Various remarks have been made about this, but in all cases there was agreement that this subject requires a better, more vigorous approach, because we cannot carry on like this: distributing pamphlets and then keeping our fingers crossed that citizens finally understand the merit and importance of the work that we are all doing here."
"In that sense, I also agree with Mr Piotrowski, for example, who says that we should not just give one side of the story, but also include the aspects of criticism and scepticism."
"Indeed, let us not fear criticism, let us not fear debates in which negative judgments are expressed, nor let us fear clashes between various institutions such as Parliament and Commission as regards the maturity of the democracy and the encouragement of debate, because debate will ultimately be the most important means to enhance citizens’ involvement in Europe."
"When they see that important things are decided here on which opinions can differ and on which citizens also have an opinion, they will become involved in Europe, and then – and I also address this to Mr Battilocchio – Europe will be less remote than many people currently find it."
"In practical terms, Mrs Sbarbati, yes, it will cost money."
"Commission, Council, national governments will need to have something set aside in order to attend to this."
"If I may mention one thing: the Dutch Presidency has promoted the showing of a television broadcast on the eve of the December European Council that will confront people in a broadly accessible manner and hold them to account on subjects discussed there, and the Dutch Presidency is putting money into that, too."
"Finally, I should like to mention other topics that have been raised, such as enlargement, to which Mr Verheugen has already referred."
"No discussion of the substance of this is planned for this European Council, because this is scheduled for the December European Council."
"There will of course be a presentation, and we are all familiar with the important and very valuable Commission report on this."
"I wish to hereby add my voice to the compliments paid to the Commission, particularly Mr Verheugen, by Mrs De Keyser and others regarding the value of the report we now have before us."
"I also concur with the remarks that she and others made about Turkey, namely that we must focus on the various aspects, on the opportunities and positive sides."
"Nevertheless, I also think that it was a very wise observation of Mr Verheugen’s that even the concerns that exist are shared by us, and these are also being included, have been included, in the proposals the Commission has presented, which also mention the possible results."
"By way of conclusion, Mrs Frassoni put a specific question regarding the Turkish part of Cyprus and what the Council intends to do about it."
"This is not on the agenda of the European Council, but I can tell you, and tell her via you, that her remark that the European Union cannot leave the Turkish part of Cyprus out in the cold is the exact essence of the guiding principle the Presidency has been following since the negative outcome of the referendum."
"This is also why, as you know, we are working hard with others to make as much progress as possible with direct aid and direct trade during our Presidency."
"At all events, we aim to continue working in that direction."
"I hope that I have covered the key issues and responded to the issues that Parliament has raised."
"Mr President, I hope that I may be excused after this speech."
"On this occasion, too, we shall keep track of every word the Commission says;"
"I do not believe that this has to be in person."
"If you will permit me to take my leave now, I shall gladly do so."
"Otherwise, I shall of course remain here at your request."
"This is a free country, Mr Nicolaï."
"You cannot be compelled to remain here."
"Although we are glad to see you here, you are of course also discharging your duties if you want to be informed of what is said here even though you cannot be present."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the simple fact about Lisbon is that, on the core points of productivity, growth and employment, we have failed to live up to our own expectations."
"This has two causes, the first being factors over which we have little control, such as external indicators, global economic influences, oil prices, and so on, whilst the second, over which we do indeed have some control, has to do with the fact that only very rarely was the Lisbon project recast as a national project at Member State level."
"As most of the Lisbon project is outside the Community framework and has to be implemented at national level, the Member States must now be induced to devise national plans for its implementation and make the Lisbon project a priority for their own national policies."
"If they do not do that, it will not work, and I agree entirely with Mr Watson, that the question of whether or not we will be as good as the Americans in 2010 is an interesting issue, but probably not the decisive one."
"What I do think of as realistically feasible by 2010 is reversing the trend, which means reducing the productivity, growth and employment gaps and creating in Europe the dynamism that will enable us to achieve our goal of being the economically strongest region of the world, but, as little more than a perceptible reversal of trends will be possible in time for 2010, we should take a more realistic view of things."
"I would like to spell out some home truths about the relationship between the Lisbon strategy, the environment, and the social framework."
"We do, of course, want environmental and social standards to be as high as possible; as a fundamental of European policy, this is beyond dispute."
"If, though, we want to have the highest possible environmental and social standards, we need the economy to be as competitive as possible, with competitive industries and competitive businesses."
"Competitiveness is not just about individuals being able to make the largest profits possible, but about making our national economies so strong that they can achieve the great social goals, such as high standards of environmental protection and social security."
"The fact is, though, that the set phrases used in Europe conceal fundamental differences in thinking."
"I noticed that in this debate, in which, for example, Members spoke about quite different concepts of the European social model, with one Member saying that workers in Europe were over-protected, and others saying that they enjoyed too few social rights."
"One said that reform must mean the dismantling of social rights; another that it must involve more social rights."
"Within Europe, there is absolutely no agreement as to what the term ‘social model’ actually means."
"If, over the coming years, I get the chance to do some work in this area of policy, I will not play along with this policy of suppression and concealment."
"I will make it clear that there are conflicts here, conflicts that must be called by their names;"
"I will make it clear that decisions have to be taken in full awareness of where the conflicts actually lie, and that these empty phrases and code words, concealing as they do what are actually utterly different outlooks, do not help to solve our problems."
"Please excuse my vehemence, but there are times when, in order to achieve a policy objective, one has to become accustomed to the truth, which is that there is no agreement as to how to go about organising the relationship between maximum environmental and social standards on the one hand and competitiveness on the other – but we will work at it."
"Let me just say something about two other issues that have been addressed."
"I am grateful to Mrs Frassoni for again raising the subject of Cyprus, which gives me the chance to tell your House something more about it."
"I do not wish to conceal from you how deeply disappointed I am that it proved impossible to keep the promise made to the Turkish Cypriots after the April referendum by this Parliament, this Council, this Commission and the international community as a whole."
"They were promised that they would not suffer on account of the rejection of the referendum in the Greek part of Cyprus."
"We promised them that we would lead them out of their economic isolation."
"The Council has not yet been able to adopt the Commission proposal to this effect, and I appeal urgently, not only to the Government of the Republic of Cyprus, but also to a number of other Member States, to ensure, as a matter of urgency, that the policies of the international community and of the European Union in relation to Cyprus are implemented."
"The adverse effects are already visible."
"We worked for years to get a democratic, pro-European government in Turkish Cyprus; that government has now collapsed, as Denktash and his people were able to argue that the Europeans had, as usual, made empty promises that they could not keep."
"The damage already done to the prospects for a resolution of the Cyprus issue is beyond calculation, and the Commission urges that its proposal be adopted before the end of this year and that the promise we all made to the Turkish Cypriots be actually kept."
"Let me conclude, ladies and gentlemen, with an observation on the economic effects of the enlargement that has already taken place and of the plans we have for the future."
"Mr Buzek said something very important, and the Commission endorses his view that the membership of the ten countries has brought with it a very beneficial economic surge."
"Our analysis shows clearly that enlargement has brought favourable economic results, not only in the new Member States, but also in the old ones, that both sides are benefiting from our integration of what are growing regions."
"We can expect the same thing of the accessions of Romania and Bulgaria, which are in the offing."
"Speaking personally, for I can say this only for myself, I am firmly convinced that, if the process of political and economic reform continues in Turkey over the next ten years, the result will be an economic situation in that country which, were it to accede, would put us in the same win-win situation as we have already had with the enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"That answers the question as to whether such an accession would jeopardise our social model, and the answer to that question is an unequivocal ‘no’."
"These countries’ accessions will not imperil our social standards; quite the contrary, they will make Europe stronger, and they will help us to achieve our goals."
"I have been notified by the French authorities that, with effect from 22 October, Mrs Simonot has been replaced by Mr Le Rachinel."
"I welcome our new Member and would point out that Rule 3(5) of the Rules of Procedure states that a Member shall take his seat in Parliament and on its bodies and shall enjoy all the rights attaching thereto until such time as his credentials have been verified or a ruling has been given on any dispute."
"– The workers should not expect any good to come out of the forthcoming summit on 4-5 November; on the contrary."
"After the first five years of implementation of the Tampere decisions restricting democratic rights and freedoms and the anti-labour Lisbon strategy, they are planning a second five-year attack with new, more repressive, anti-grass roots measures."
"Tampere II speeds up procedures for restricting the granting of asylum, promotes camps for rounding up immigrants outside Europe, introduces biometric data and strengthens obscure, centralised services, EU information systems and mechanisms for legalising repression on the pretext of organised crime and terrorism, thereby shielding the dictatorship of European capital."
"The new anti-grass roots measures contained in Mr Κok's report will also make their appearance at the summit; they will form the basis for promoting the anti-labour Lisbon strategy at a faster pace and decisions will be taken about the militarisation of the ΕU and its enhanced participation in the Iraq war alongside the USA."
"The repressive measures, however, will not be able to stop the fight by the workers against this warmongering, anti-labour, autocratic policy and the promising march to claim satisfaction of their contemporary needs."
"The next item is the speech by Mr Barroso, President-elect of the European Commission."
". Mr President, honourable Members, I have asked for the floor at this point because I believe it is important that I share with you my analysis of the current situation and that I convey to you my position at this stage of our debate."
"I listened very attentively to yesterday's debate."
"I have had extensive contacts with the Group leaders, and I have also spoken with the President–in–Office of the Council."
"I have come to the conclusion that if a vote were to take place today, the outcome would not be positive for the European institutions or for the European project."
"In these circumstances I have decided not to submit a new Commission for your approval today."
"I need more time to look at this issue, to consult with the Council and to consult further with you, so that we can have strong support for the new Commission."
"It is better to have more time to get it right."
"These last few days have demonstrated that the European Union is a strong political construction and that this Parliament, elected by popular vote across all our Member States, has a vital role to play in the governance of Europe."
"I was honoured to receive your support as President-designate of the Commission in July."
"At that time I committed myself to working actively with you in the European interest."
"I renew that commitment today."
"I believe that we can agree on our common commitment to reinforcing the democratic nature of European integration."
"In that spirit, I hope we can arrive at an outcome in the next few weeks that will permit us to take forward our work in the European Union."
"You can count on me."
"I can always offer you loyal, constructive cooperation for the good of Europe and the European Union project."
"Thank you, Mr Barroso."
"We remain in politically uncharted territory, since this is a situation we could never have foreseen."
"The Treaties clearly lay down that the new Commission must commence its duties on 1 November and that beforehand the European Parliament must give its opinion on a proposal."
"But Parliament clearly cannot give its opinion if there is no proposal."
"Mr Barroso tells us that there is no proposal."
"I believe it would be good to know the Council’s position, since, if there is no proposal, the Council must also give its opinion."
". Mr President, Members of Parliament, we understand the situation."
"The consequence of this situation is that the current Prodi Commission will stay in office for as long as is necessary."
"Before the President continues his considerations, perhaps we should hear the Presidents of the political groups."
"I believe there is a point of order."
"Mr Pannella has the floor for a point of order."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my point of order is based on the combined provisions of Article 214 of the Treaty and Rule 99(2) and Rule 132 of the parliamentary Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, the point of order that I want to raise, as you have already correctly pointed out, concerns the deadline set by the Treaty for November, in a few days’ time."
"Secondly, the President-designate, as the Rules also state, is obliged to present the Commission to Parliament, and the Council will then be notified if it is approved."
"That is not a point of order."
"Mr Pannella, you do not have the floor."
"Mr Schulz has the floor."
". Mr President, following the statements by the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to ask you, on behalf of my group and, I believe, on behalf of others, for the sitting to be suspended, as originally planned, as our group wants to discuss how to proceed further."
". Mr President, this is a decisive moment for the European Union, for Parliament, and for its relations with the Commission."
"Our group has had a consultation, but in order that all those who wish to speak may do so – not everyone has been invited to – we should meet this concern, as we want the decision we take when we reassemble to be taken on as broad a basis as possible."
"I therefore support the request for the sitting to be suspended now."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Presidency considers it essential to suspend the sitting and ask the political groups to meet, but before resuming the plenary sitting and following the meetings of the political groups, I shall call the Conference of Presidents."
"Groups, Conference of Presidents and then plenary."
"We shall meet again in plenary at noon."
"Mr Rogalski has the floor on a point of order."
"This is a point of order, Mr President."
"On behalf of the League of Polish Families I should like to propose that this House dissolve itself, as it has become hostage to the European homosexual lobby."
"It is an inefficient, expensive and unproductive institution."
"That is clearly not a point of order."
"The Chairmen of the political groups shall speak."
"Mr Poettering has the floor first."
". Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, José Manuel Durão Barroso was elected on 22 July, by a large majority, as the next President of the European Commission, and today he has taken the initiative."
"In doing so, he has shown that he possesses the strength to be a leader."
"And what we expect of the Presidency of José Manuel Durão Barroso"
"is a strong European Commission."
"The President of the Commission has said that he has no proposal to make today, and that he needs more time."
"Mr President of the Commission, let me tell you, on behalf of our Group, that of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that our support for you has never wavered over the past few weeks, and you can be sure that we will continue to support you in the difficult days and weeks now, so that there will eventually be a strong Commission under your decisive leadership."
"Today’s applause showed that your proposal enjoys wide support."
"We would have preferred to see a vote in favour of your team today – that I will not deny – but politics is a process."
"I hope that it is apparent to all in the European Union that this House possesses influence and power, and the European Union is undergoing a process of parliamentarisation."
"Today is for that reason a significant day in the history of the European Parliament."
"Our group has always had the strategic objective of having a strong Commission presided over by you, and of not isolating one single member of your team."
"Instead, we must take note of the overall results of the hearings and draw conclusions from them."
"It will be your task to join, on this basis, with all interested parties and with the Council in coming to the right decisions."
"We also, in order that you may not be the tool of governments, must see to it that the future President of the Commission can have the last word and reject candidates put forward to him."
"This leads our group to believe that we do not need a decision today."
"It is now for us in this House to discharge our responsibilities."
"In difficult times, when, on Friday, the Constitutional Treaty is to be signed in Rome, with us affirming our belief in our continent’s future, we want a strong European Parliament, a strong Commission and a Council of Ministers that works well with both institutions."
"Believing as we do that Europe has a future, we now wish you, Mr President-designate of the European Commission, much success in presenting your team, to which we hope we will be able to give a great deal of support and a vote of approval."
"You have our support as we go this way together."
". Mr President, Mr President-designate of the Commission ..."
"Mr President, perhaps the medical service could give the honourable gentleman a tranquilliser."
"Mr President, I am quite happy to sacrifice two minutes of my time to hooliganism in the European Union."
"This is intolerable."
"These people claim to speak on behalf of the European people!"
"You should be ashamed of yourself, you louts!"
"Mr Kilroy-Silk, please be quiet and sit down."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the decision we have to take today is one of great importance for the European Union and for its future."
"We have had lively discussions and vigorous disagreements over the last few weeks."
"My group’s resolution, taken unanimously yesterday evening, was preceded by hard, tough debates and serious disagreements, even in our own ranks."
"We had disagreements because our decision would involve passing judgment on our Social Democrat friends in the Commission."
"After lengthy discussions yesterday evening, which involved them – and let me tell them that they were the outstanding members of the proposed Commission – our solidarity with these friends from our group meant that the decision was not, for us, an easy one."
"The decision we took yesterday evening is that we, despite everything, cannot have confidence in the Commission that you, Mr Barroso, would have proposed, or intended to propose, this morning."
"Rather than revisit the debate, which was a lively one, I want to tell you that, having recognised – this morning, yesterday evening and during the course of yesterday – that this proposal would not gain a majority, you came to the right conclusion by acceding to Parliament’s wishes."
"On behalf of my group, let me say that this was the right course of action."
"What you are doing this morning opens up the way to a shared future for all of us, both the Commission and the broad majority in the European Parliament."
"I was pleased to hear Mr Poettering say that he supported this development, and I can tell him that it is never too late to join those who said that the European Parliament also needs to be strengthened when debates are cut short, when they are reduced to a presentation, on the basis that the European Parliament talks sense only when it agrees with the Commission."
"So, welcome to the club, Mr Poettering."
"Those who want a strong Commission, enabled to work by the broad support for it in the European Parliament, are those who want one strong institution – the Commission – supported by another strong institution – Parliament – to be capable of dealing with the real challenges of the years to come."
"If you strengthen such a Commission, then you are for Europe."
"If you seek to make it dependent on the votes of that gentleman, whose three or four votes just might help the Commission get a majority, then you are weakening Europe."
"That is why a broad majority is necessary."
"In the last few weeks, Mr Barroso, we have had various proposals to put to you."
"My group expects you, in your future considerations, to bear in mind the proposals that this House put to you at the end of the hearings."
"Speaking on behalf of my group, I can tell you that we also expect your considerations to be influenced by what the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has told you, for one thing is clear, and that is that you will need my group’s support for your future Commission too."
"While offering you cooperation, we also urge you to take seriously the advice that the Socialist Group in this House has given you."
"On 22 July, you had 413 votes, some of them from members of my group."
"Many in my group did not vote for you on that occasion, but what you got then was a great vote of confidence."
"Over the last three months, you have been gambling with some of your credit, but, with your decision today, you have won some of it back."
"We in the European Parliament’s Socialist Group are ready for constructive collaboration, and that is the road you have chosen today – something we have sometimes missed over the last few weeks."
"If we are to achieve something in the next few weeks, I ask you not to bring back the same Commission that you would have presented to us today, as otherwise we could have voted on it today."
"I ask you to bring us a new proposal, one offering the possibility of broader support for the Commission."
". Mr President, today this House on the river Rhine has grown in stature."
"Its will was tested, its will has prevailed."
"At no time did we ask for anything more than is our right."
"We asked for no prerogative that is not laid down in the law of Europe."
"We asked for our considered judgment to be treated with respect."
"At every stage, our willingness to stand by that judgment was doubted, mistrusted and tested."
"It was tested to the edge of political crisis until the price of exerting our will became so high that only the unwalked ground of political crisis stretched ahead of us, and none of us wanted to venture onto it."
"However, our will and our willingness to stand by our judgment prevailed."
"Nobody in this Chamber seeks confrontation for its own sake."
"We value the tension that exists between our institutions, because the ability to turn that tension to mutual benefit is the sign of our institutions' maturity."
"Mr Barroso, you suggested yesterday that it was anti–European to vote against your Commission."
"I do not honestly think you believe that."
"You know that when pro–Europeans criticise your Commission, they are not doing the work of Euroscepticism, but the very opposite: today, Euroscepticism loses because the voice of democracy in Europe has risen by an octave and has made itself heard in every national capital and beyond."
"You know that Liberals and Democrats in this House challenged you and your Commission, because we want it to be stronger than you were given the chance to build it – stronger so that the European Union is stronger."
"Mr Barroso, I restate now that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports you."
"We voted for you in the knowledge that your commitment to the European Union matches our own."
"I say again today what I said yesterday: if our House is weak, then so is yours, because if the governments of Europe do not respect us, they will not respect you or the independence of your College."
"Our strength is your strength."
"You have a chance to rebuild a Commission that can win the support of this House."
"Work fast!"
"You know the will of this Chamber."
"Through resignation, reshuffle or withdrawal, you can come back to us with a new Commission, confident that we hold you in high regard as a committed European and a President of the European Commission with a capacity for great work."
"Yesterday I spoke of an elephant in this Chamber, and it is here again."
"Once again I call on the Council to reflect on the rights of this House and on the way in which it chooses to exercise them."
"Liberals and Democrats call on the Council to respect the prerogatives of this House and the independence of the Commission, which it is charged with approving."
"We call on you to reflect on your own responsibility for the impasse at which we found ourselves."
"We will work with you to surmount that impasse."
"Over the rich summit dinner on Friday, let there be food for thought."
"Mr Barroso, on behalf of my Group, I commit the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe to working with you to see a Commission approved in November."
"I thank you for your candour and commitment."
"I repeat that this House has today grown in stature: our will was tested and our will has prevailed."
"Mr Kilroy-Silk, if you continue to disrupt the sitting, I shall expel you from the Chamber."
"Mr President, Mr President-designate, Mr Barroso, I should like to begin in a language that is our language of the past by quoting Mao Zedong to you."
"Mao Zedong said that to understand defeat is to prepare for victory."
"Mr Poettering, you and Mr Barroso should read some Mao Zedong together."
"Secondly, winning Parliament’s confidence is a long march."
"We shall help you on that long march ..."
"Mr Watson, I am very happy that you did not have to vote contrary to the way you spoke."
"That would not have been good."
"We know from the feminists that when a woman says 'No', it means no."
"From you, we have learned that when the Liberals say 'No', it can mean yes, and this is wrong."
"And so, Mr President, I ask you to listen to this House in future."
"If you listen carefully, you will get a large majority for a Commission."
"That is something you need to know."
"As Mr Poettering discovered today, the strongest group does not always add up to a majority in this House."
"This is a democratic learning process, one that we have all been fortunate to be able to undergo in these days."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it turns out that Mr Barroso needed to be given a fright in order to resign himself to withdrawing his Commission."
"It is a victory for European democracy and a great encouragement to all those who helped create the conditions for this decision."
"I would point out that when, under the pretext that it was criticising his team, the President-designate accused half of this House of siding with, and I quote, ‘the anti-European extremists’, he yesterday revealed himself once more to be precisely the person he not long ago maintained he did not want to be: a President of the Right in conflict with the Left and, indeed, the liberals."
"The Commission did not believe that we could agree upon a common position, but we succeeded and we won."
"Now, the next stage has to be prepared and, with that in view, lessons learned from what has just happened."
"How did such an unprecedented situation arise?"
"Yesterday, I drew attention to the disaffection felt by the majority of people and to some of the symptoms of the evil that is eating away at our institutions."
"In this context, the challenge to be taken up by European leaders at all levels was, and remains, that of daring to carry out a critical evaluation of what is now lacking and of showing that they are determined to invest the European adventure with meaning again, for, contrary to what you said, Mr Barroso, I, for my part, believe in Europe."
"I am convinced of the need for Europe, so do not go on classifying me among the anti-Europeans."
"Mr Barroso did the opposite of taking up this challenge."
"Not only did he accentuate the most controversial features of European economic and social policy by placing champions of liberalism in strategic posts, but he also fuelled fears of a return to the moral and patriarchal order of times gone by and of people uniting behind a vision of the world closer to that of American neo-conservatives than to the expectations of Europeans."
"That is what, in our view, must change in the future Commission, not just the identity of the person responsible for a particular portfolio."
"In this troubled context, I shall single out one very good piece of news."
"Others have said it before me: what we have here are fresh stirrings of political confrontation in the European Parliament, finally replacing half-heartedness and feeble consensus."
"A real debate about the civilised order has begun that may have far-reaching consequences for the greater good of Europe."
"In this sense, these historic moments constitute a genuine milestone."
"May their promise be fulfilled!"
"Mr President, today’s crisis shows that the rules for appointing the Commission do not work."
"Nor will they work where the Constitution is concerned. The prime ministers appoint people they want or, often, people they want to get rid of, and expect us to rubber-stamp their choice."
"We propose instead that each individual national parliament choose its own Commissioner and hold him or her responsible."
"In that way, we should have a democratically appointed Commission."
"What is the body we now call the Commission?"
"It is the engine of integration."
"It is not subject to control by elected representatives, be they national representatives from the parliaments or supranational representatives from this House."
"It operates through 30 000 officials and more than 3 000 working groups, through which the Commission secures influence for itself, and through a network in the Member States that also bypasses the national authorities."
"The working groups are secret and cannot be controlled by the national parliaments’ Europe committees."
"The thousands of decisions and laws adopted by the Commission are rarely made in the Commission itself but, more often than not, in working groups involving participants of whom we have no knowledge."
"Only relatively few votes are taken in the Commission, and the general public is unaware of the results."
"The Commission administers a budget of EUR 100 billion, but this is not controlled by the Commission’s own accounts department, by the Court of Auditors or by the Committee on Budgetary Control set up for the purpose by the European Parliament. Nor, for safety’s sake, can the Ombudsman obtain any documents he might request."
"In the Commission itself, the presidents cannot control the various Directors General, even though it is formally the president who is responsible for doing so."
"The whole lot of them are, however, in agreement as to the direction to be taken, namely ever more power to Brussels."
"Every opportunity must be taken to obtain more power, and concessions to transparency are made only rarely."
"It took Mr Santer four years to have the Commission’s telephone directory made publicly available."
"It is now on the Net as an experiment."
"It has taken Mr Prodi four years to have the Commission’s agendas and minutes put on the Net."
"It took Mr Barroso a day to make the list of Commission working groups available."
"That was the day before he was to be elected here in this House."
"He wanted in that way to show that it was he who made the decisions, but then transparency came to an end."
"We have not been given a promise that we shall be told who participates in the working groups and what they do."
"My group is not taking part in the onslaught on an individual Commissioner’s personal beliefs."
"Nor, however, will we deliver votes to a supranational, anti-democratic organisation which one departing Commissioner described very precisely as a ‘monster’."
"This ‘monster’ has a monopoly on tabling bills."
"No one can blame the European Parliament for using its limited powers to reject the Commission, but the undignified hounding of an individual Commissioner shows that the best form of control is obtained if each country’s electorate and own national parliament chooses its own Commissioner and holds him or her responsible."
"In that way, the Commission would be elected from the bottom up and not from the top down by a qualified majority of prime ministers."
"The individual Commissioners could attend their national parliaments each week and listen to, and talk with, the representatives of the electorate, and the Commission would then constitute our representatives in Brussels, and the officials its servants. The Commission would no longer be an unruly ‘monster’, and people would stand up and applaud spontaneously if the Commission President were to pass by."
"There is a long way still to go, and Mr Barroso has not shown that he dares take the leap of becoming the voters’ servant."
"Today, he has talked with the representatives of the three largest groups."
"The four smallest groups have not been consulted."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many of us have suffered from injustice during our lives, and for people of good faith that is a reason to make every effort so that others should not suffer discrimination and abuse."
"Before making any decision, Martin Luther King used to ask himself: ‘Is it right?’"
"I believe it is right that every political person should stand up for his or her own convictions and fight to defend the ideas of others for the sake of the common good."
"Politics, in fact, is about making laws in the overall interests of today’s and tomorrow’s citizens."
"Those who do not express their reasoned opinions are acting in the interests of their parties but not in the interests of Parliament, which represents all voters and not just those who voted for us personally."
"We should therefore have preferred to vote today so as to carry out our mutual responsibilities."
"Nevertheless, we accept Mr Barroso’s decision in the hope that further time for calm reflection will provide an opportunity for the Council, which is due to meet in Rome shortly for the signing of the Constitutional Treaty, to reach a considered understanding with Parliament and the Commission."
"We renew our trust in Mr Barroso in the certainty that his choices and the appointments made by the governments will comply with the people’s call for a transparent Commission that respects the principle of subsidiarity and is able to uphold everyone’s rights, within the context of the overall interests of society from a European viewpoint, but also in the interests of the rest of the world."
"We call on Parliament, in any case, to provide all the committees with specific rules in common, so that future hearings will all follow the same procedures."
"The different procedures used to date have not, in fact, guaranteed either impartial methods or respect for true democracy."
"In response to the statement by the Council representative, we do not consider that the Prodi Commission can remain in office for as long as necessary."
"The Prodi Commission must remain in office for ordinary administration until the next plenary part-session of Parliament in Strasbourg."
"On that date, Mr Barroso must come before this House again with the complete list of Commissioners."
"Otherwise we would have a poor image of this Europe, which I do not think anybody wants."
"Over the past fifteen years in this House, I have always remembered that the secular spirit of Parliament can only be preserved so long as this secularity is not transformed into a new kind of fundamentalism, which, while supporting the protection of some groups, breaches the rights of others."
"Two wrongs never make a right but create new oppressions and divisions in society."
"Anyone who tries to protect differences in culture or sexual orientation by discriminating against the culture or religious beliefs of others is not acting for the common good but perpetrating new discrimination."
"Intellectual narrow-mindedness makes human beings petty and arrogant."
"Respect for others, on the other hand, enables them to formulate rules that ensure peaceful coexistence for all."
"Mr Barroso, the Commission must listen to Parliament but reject the attempts by some to blackmail you."
"The Commission does not need guardians along its way, but loyal and intellectually honest partners in dialogue."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, there is an anecdote told in my country according to which an outstanding Polish politician is one who never agrees to a compromise, whereas a good American statesman is one who can always find a compromise."
"If this anecdote were to be translated, taken seriously, and adapted for the European Parliament, Mr Barroso would have a successful career ahead of him in America, and many outstanding politicians and speakers in this House would triumph over the political scene in my country."
"In response to Mr Barroso’s critics, I should like to remind them that it is the governments of the Member States who decide on the appointment of Commissioners."
"Mr Barroso’s room for manoeuvre is limited, and we should be clear about the fact that it will remain limited until there is a change in the way the Commission is appointed."
"If this House wishes to say that the governments of the Member States play too large a role in this process, it should say so clearly."
"I do not share this opinion, however, as I do not believe the role governments play is too large."
"If the Commission is to have the support of the Member States, the Member States’ governments must have a major part to play in its appointment, even if this sometimes prolongs the decision-making process."
"We have great respect for all those speakers who have expressed their reservations concerning individual Commissioners-designate, as many of us also had doubts about a number of them."
"The voting procedure is what it is, however, and we vote on the Commission as a whole, without being able to vote on individual Commissioners, something that has both positive and negative sides."
"The ball is now back in the court of the President of the Commission and the EU Member States, but this decision-making process should not be allowed to drag on, as Europe needs a new Commission, just as Europe needs a strong European Parliament."
"Indeed this House is now proving its strength, and I am sure we are all aware of this, both those who would vote in favour of Mr Barroso and his Commission and those who would vote against."
"It is to be hoped that the heated dispute we are witnessing and involved in will not cause a permanent rift in this House."
"Even when we have fundamental differences of opinion, we should remember the aspects that unite us and not only those that may divide us."
"Finally, I should like to express my respect for Mr Barroso."
"You do not have an easy life, and you have embarked upon a difficult mission."
"This makes it even more important for me to tell you, at this difficult time, that I value your efforts and the strength of character you have demonstrated."
"I believe that before long we will be able to congratulate you on your political success."
"Many thanks."
"Thank you very much."
"That concludes the scheduled speeches of the Chairmen of the political groups."
"Mr Kilroy-Silk has the floor for a point of order."
"Mr President, on a point of order;"
"Mr Barroso showed his disdain for Parliament yesterday by turning up late and not apologising."
"He has now demonstrated his incompetence by having no proposals to put before Parliament today."
"Any self-respecting Parliament would now vote no confidence in the ..."
"That is not a point of order."
"Mrs Mussolini has the floor for a point of order."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to raise a point of order."
"I refer to Article 99(2) – just as the Member whose name I do not know wished to."
"I find it absurd that Parliament should be deprived of its right to speak when faced with such an important political change as this, and I consider it essential to open a debate."
"It should not only be the group leaders who can speak."
"By withdrawing his proposal, Mr Barroso has deprived Parliament of its right."
"The President-designate has, in fact, taken a political line in structuring his Commission and, seeing that each Commissioner has already appeared before the appropriate parliamentary committee, the vote should have taken place."
"It is not an option now to put everything off for a month and to go looking for a majority, because Parliament is sovereign; otherwise we would not count for anything."
"It should not only be the group leaders who can speak: it should be everyone…"
"Mrs Mussolini, that is not a point of order."
"Mr Nicolaï, President-in-Office of the Council, has the floor."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving me the floor."
"Strictly speaking, the presidency and the Council are not official parties to the discussion that is taking place between Parliament and the new President of the Commission."
"We are naturally very closely involved in this debate and this situation."
"I can also respond to Mr Watson’s remark by assuring you that we have, literally, missed not one word of anything that the Members of this House have had to say about this important issue, as I already explained this morning."
"Needless to say, the Council bears a share of responsibility in this situation."
"As Mr Barroso has already indicated, we will take that responsibility by consulting the new President of the Commission and the other Members of the European Council at the earliest opportunity, in a bid to bring about a speedy solution to this situation."
"I should like to repeat what I stated this morning, namely that the European Parliament has, of course, got every right to take its responsibility, determine its position and make its choice."
"I also said that the present confrontation between Parliament and the incoming Commission can also be seen as evidence of a European democracy that is reaching maturity, and that I naturally have every confidence that the position that your House will adopt will be well thought-out."
"I expressly repeated this morning that the presidency and the Council had every confidence in Mr Barroso as the incoming President of the Commission, and that is still the case."
"I also expressed my sympathy and understanding for the step that he has just taken."
"So, finally, I trust that the situation will be resolved as soon as possible."
"To that I would add that your work, the work of the Council and the presidency, as well as the work of the Commission, carries on as before."
"It is thus important to know that the present Prodi Commission will be carrying on its duties, so that the European citizen does not lose out as a result of this situation."
"The work will be continued at all levels and in all institutions, and the Prodi Commission will for that reason continue to carry out its tasks as long as this proves to be necessary."
"Mr President, thank you very much for giving me the floor."
"I believe that everything has already been said."
"I want first of all to thank all those who supported me and understood my approach."
"I hope to be able to work with you over the next five years."
"I think it may be said that we shall get to know each other."
"I am keen for you to know that I am a man of compromise."
"Compromise is something in which I profoundly believe."
"You should know that I am in favour of a ‘coalition’, if I can put it like that, between all those who are in favour of the European project."
"This point is important."
"I already mentioned it at the meeting of the chairmen of political groups when the issue of politicisation came up. Admittedly, I belong to a political family."
"I have the great honour of belonging to the political family of Konrad Adenauer, Robert Schuman and Alcide De Gasperi. I also believe, however, that we must unite all those who wish to work together, be they from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe or other groups who are in favour of Europe."
"I want you to know that my Commission is not partisan."
"It is a Commission in which there are Christian Democrats and members of the European People’s Party and in which there are socialists and liberals and, too, a member of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group."
"It is a pluralist Commission."
"The real Europe is characterised by pluralism, tolerance and balance and by a consensus designed to benefit our people."
"I therefore did what I had to do."
"I came here with my team and made a rational assessment of what was best, not only for the Commission but for all the European institutions."
"That, moreover, is an aspect I am keen to emphasise."
"As is natural in political debate – and I too am a politician – people do indeed sometimes say: it is we who have won, and the others have lost."
"I do not think of institutional relations within the European Union in terms of a victory by Parliament over the Council or of a victory of the Commission over Parliament."
"I do not think of our relations in those terms."
"It is not a football match."
"I believe that, on the contrary, we are sources of mutual strength."
"As has been said, and very commendably, we need a strong Parliament and a strong Commission too. That much is obvious."
"Our authority cannot be established at the expense of the other institutions."
"In this connection, I also want to give prominence to the Council, because the Council is the representative of the Member States, and I believe that all those who have been elected by the citizens of the Member States are democrats."
"To summarise, we must respect all our institutions, and that is indeed the way I intend to continue if, of course, I have your backing and support."
"We need this culture of respect between the various institutions in order to strengthen all those in Europe who are in favour of the idea of compromise."
"I do not believe there is any mileage in imagining that what the one institution gains, the other loses."
"Today, I believe that we have made broader and more fruitful cooperation possible."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have not talked very much about Europe’s basic problems, but we need broader support in order to make progress towards achieving our priorities in Europe."
"For my part, I am, of course, prepared to work with you in a spirit of mutual respect and loyalty, with the European project – that of our citizens – always our main priority."
"Thank you very much, Mr Barroso."
"Having listened to you, the Council and the Chairmen of the political groups, the Presidency would draw the following conclusions from what has been said."
"This is not a request to delay the vote."
"If that were the case, Parliament would give its opinion on whether or not to accept this request."
"But that is not the case."
"We are not being asked to delay the vote. We are being told that there is not yet any proposal on which to vote."
"Mr Barroso needs more time to draw it up and the Council understands this and accepts it, and the Prodi Commission will therefore remain in office until we can debate and vote on a proposal."
"There is, therefore, nothing to vote on at the moment."
"Neither does it make much sense to vote on motions for resolutions related to the debate on the Commission."
"Although we are not going to vote on the motions for resolutions, I would ask you, Mr Barroso, to read them carefully."
"I believe you will find elements in them which may help you in the work you have yet to do."
"There will not, therefore, be a vote on any issue."
"When I say that I invite Mr Barroso to read them, I also invite him to read all of the proposals presented by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"It only remains for me to invite Mr Barroso and the Council to present us with a proposal as soon as possible, without setting any strict time limit, which Parliament can decide upon, and to keep us informed of how their work is progressing in this regard."
"If there are no comments, the sitting is suspended."
"The Minutesof yesterday’s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, on a point of order under Rule 172 I have a correction to make to yesterday's Minutes."
"In Item 3 there is some confusion over a name."
"The second name in section 2 – 'From Members' – should be Wojciech Wierzejski, not 'Wojciechowski Janusz Czesław'."
"The first name was confused with the surname."
"I ask that the Minutes be corrected in this regard."
"Of course, Mr Giertych, I duly note your comment, and we shall naturally make the required changes."
"Mr President, this morning Parliament's agenda was changed."
"Does this change affect the whole of the day's agenda, or just part of it, and who decided on the change?"
"As everyone will have noticed, a number of events have taken place this morning, but the agenda, as planned, remains unchanged."
"We shall therefore resume the debates at 3 p.m. today, as provided for in the agenda."
"Many thanks, Mr President."
"I was about to say Minister, as I remember you from your days as French Minister for European Integration."
"I have an objection and an important observation to make relating to yesterday’s Minutes, and in particular to the one-minute speeches."
"My speech on the ‘golden share’ and the dispute between the European Commission and the German and Polish Governments has been attributed to an entirely different Member, namely to Mr Jałowiecki from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"I would therefore ask for this to be corrected, as it was definitely not Mr Jałowiecki who spoke, but me."
"I also have an objection regarding the list of speakers who gave one-minute speeches, as my name does not appear in it at all."
"I am a modest person and do not believe such an omission would be detrimental to me in any way."
"Nevertheless, I would like the relevant corrections to be made for the sake of accuracy."
"Thank you for those comments. As the saying goes, one must ‘give to Caesar what is Caesar’s’."
"Here too, the necessary changes will therefore be made."
"Are there no more comments?"
"The next item is the joint debate on the EU-India Summit, with the Council and Commission statements on EU-India relations, then Mr Menéndez del Valle’s report on the same subject."
". Mr President, the first summit between the EU and India took place in Lisbon in 2000."
"Since then, our relationship has undergone a fast and dynamic development."
"Our cooperation covers a wide range of subjects, from economic to cultural, and we address local, regional and global issues."
"The framework of our strategic partnership, set up in 2000, now really has flesh on the bones."
"The Netherlands presidency is very much looking forward to hosting the forthcoming summit in The Hague on 8 November."
"This will give a further boost to our relations."
"What do we want to get out of this summit?"
"The first thing we should do is to set a deadline for the completion of a comprehensive EU-India Action Plan for a Strategic Partnership."
"This action plan should be approved at the next Summit in 2005."
"This will reflect the ambition to further develop EU-India relations in several key areas, such as cooperation in the UN and other multilateral fora; conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction; cooperation on non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery; the fight against terrorism and organised crime; dialogue on democracy and human rights and EU support for India’s achievement of the Millennium Development Goals."
"The Commission’s communication, which was published last June, and the Indian reaction to it form the basis for this Action Plan."
"There are a number of global challenges that we should address at the summit."
"Both the EU and India are committed to strengthening the role of the UN."
"We should therefore emphasise that an effective multilateral system based on the principles of international law, with a strong United Nations at its centre, is essential for achieving peace and international stability."
"In addition to 'old' challenges, we also have to address new ones, such as the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, HIV/AIDS and the fight against terrorism."
"On the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, we should increase our cooperation, particularly with a view to reinforcing the consistency and effectiveness of export control measures for dual-use goods."
"The EU wants to strengthen the political dialogue with India in this field and on issues relating to weapons of mass destruction."
"We hope India will react positively."
"The European Union is very concerned about the threat posed by the spread of HIV/AIDS in India."
"The International Conference on Population and Development formulated a clear agenda on the fight against AIDS, and in 2001 the UN General Assembly adopted a Declaration of Commitment on AIDS."
"We want to reiterate the importance of implementing the agenda and declaration."
"On terrorism, we now have a clear resolution from the UN Security Council."
"The EU will confirm to the Indians our commitment to the fight against terrorism."
"We will also inform them of the concrete EU action to combat terrorism."
"At the summit, we will also be discussing international and regional developments."
"I will focus on the latter."
"The EU has an interest in a stable, peaceful and prosperous South Asia."
"Looking to this region, we are encouraged by the developments in SAARC and the ongoing and genuine efforts to take forward the composite dialogue between India and Pakistan."
"At various meetings at both political and official level the EU has expressed its full support and its satisfaction with the steps taken by both countries."
"At the summit, the EU will encourage India to continue to make progress in agreeing on substantive confidence-building measures, through improvements in transport, trade and economic links and more personal contact across the Line of Control."
"But we cannot expect rapid progress: a cautious, gradual approach is needed."
"We are encouraged by what we see as shifting parameters in India-Pakistan relations during the last months."
"The EU hopes that both sides will continue to engage fully in this process, for instance through consolidation of the Line of Control ceasefire."
"We also welcome the agreement of both sides to explore possible options for a peaceful, negotiated settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir issue as part of the wider process of the composite dialogue between both countries."
"This is critical to the future of the process."
"Of course, Pakistan must continue to make every effort to curb terrorist infiltration across the Line of Control and cross-border terrorism."
"But at the same time India needs to take further action to reduce human rights violations."
"Improved social and economic quality of life in Jammu and Kashmir is important in sustaining peace."
"India should continue to take into account the views of local leaders, representing a broad spectrum of Kashmiri stakeholders."
"Indian involvement is also needed when it comes to the situation in Afghanistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Burma, issues that we will also discuss at the summit."
"The EU is ready to express its commitment to the reconstruction and stabilisation of Afghanistan in partnership with the Afghan Government and is counting on India to do the same."
"Peace and stability is also needed in Nepal and Sri Lanka."
"We will encourage the Indians to use their influence to contribute to this goal."
"Economics form an important part of EU-India relations."
"Therefore, we also want to give some signals in this field."
"We want to intensify bilateral cooperation in order to facilitate and expand trade and investment flows."
"The European Union is India’s first partner in terms of trade and actual investment inflows and is in the front rank of its partners in the field of economic cooperation."
"We want to maintain that."
"The summit will also provide an opportunity to express our commitment to the multilateral trading system and the desire to make progress in the Doha Development Round."
"We also want India to participate in Galileo, our global satellite navigation system, and we want to discuss the negotiations on a maritime agreement."
"Although the first summit took place only four years ago, the European and Indian cultures go back thousands of years."
"They first came into contact at the time of Alexander the Great."
"It is therefore only natural to stress the cultural dimension of our relationship by the signing of a common declaration on cultural relations."
"I would like to conclude by saying that EU-India relations are improving all the time."
"The relationship covers many areas and it is bound to succeed."
"The Summit on 8 November will prove this."
". Mr President, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to talk to you about EU-India relations."
"India is a partner that deserves special attention, and this Commission has made a point of bringing the relationship with India to new heights during its mandate."
"Our objective has been a more comprehensive and forward-looking European policy towards India, and this is taking shape."
"Looking at the state of our relations today, it is clear that they have come a long way since our first summit in Lisbon in June 2000."
"In particular, we have deepened and strengthened our dialogue in all areas."
"At last year's EU-India summit it was agreed that we should seize the opportunity to develop our friendship into a strategic partnership."
"As global actors with strong democracies and common values and with many years of growing trade and political links, there is much to build on."
"India has a formidable economic potential, as it looks set to emulate China’s economic growth."
"It plays an increasingly assertive role on the international stage. It is engaged in a process of conciliation with Pakistan."
"For these and many more reasons, the European Union simply cannot afford to miss out on opportunities for cooperation."
"The Commission has set out proposals for doing just that."
"The Communication on an EU-India Strategic Partnership identifies the challenges, opportunities and expectations for strengthening our international, economic and development cooperation with India."
"Firstly, it is important to recognise that our relationship is no longer just about trade."
"We are both more active on issues such as promoting peace, security and democracy in the world, where we hold common views."
"The European Union and India could work more effectively together to support multilateralism and the role of the United Nations."
"We could strengthen our cooperation in conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction, and in addressing global concerns such as non-proliferation and terrorism."
"Certainly, the European Union and India should enhance their dialogue on human rights and democracy, bilaterally and internationally."
"The European Union and India could also work more closely on promoting regional peace, prosperity and stability."
"In areas where the European Union is involved in the peace process and reconstruction, such as Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, dialogue and cooperation with India could be stepped up."
"The role of the European Parliament is crucial."
"We encourage contacts with the Indian Lower House and suggest, in particular, regular meetings between delegations from both sides."
"The planned visit of Members of the European Parliament to India early next month is excellent news."
"India could become a major economic partner, and much remains to be done to tap the full potential of the European Union and India’s trade and investment relationship."
"India has been one of the world’s fastest growing economies for over a decade."
"Its growing prosperity is attracting increased attention from European business."
"India should assure its climb to economic prosperity by continued economic reforms, including greater market access and better regulation."
"We should therefore initiate a policy dialogue in important areas of economic management, such as industrial policy, the environment or competition."
"We intend to promote strategic dialogues – ranging from regulatory dialogue to cooperation in research – in sectors such as information technology, transport, energy, biotechnology or space science."
"We want to foster progress on trade and investment."
"This includes strengthening the multilateral trading system from which we have both benefited."
"The recent agreement on a South Asia Free Trade Agreement takes explicit inspiration from the EU process."
"We stand ready to offer assistance based on our experience."
"Mutual understanding is an area that has been neglected for too long."
"Educational exchanges will receive a boost through a scholarship programme in the framework of Erasmus Mundus."
"When we hold the next summit in The Hague in early November, we will adopt a declaration on cultural cooperation, hoping to make this area a priority for our future cooperation."
"The Council has produced conclusions endorsing the main thrust of the communication, and India has responded with a very positive strategy paper."
"Together with the excellent recommendations of Parliament, all elements are in place for the fifth summit to take the necessary decision to open a new era in our relations and to upgrade the relationship with India to a strategic partnership."
"Political leaders are expected to task officials to prepare a detailed action plan and a new political statement for the sixth summit in 2005."
"Implementation can only work with sustained and committed support from all actors, including the European Parliament."
". Mr President, I believe it is sad that we had to experience the attacks of 11 September for certain analyses and actions to be carried out and for certain objectives to be taken seriously."
"If we want terrorism to be eradicated one day, we must not just use force, but also intelligence, and if we use our intelligence we will realise that very often the scourge we are facing is led by educated people who find a perfect breeding ground amongst the wretched of the Earth."
"The combination of extreme ideology and hunger is undoubtedly explosive."
"So I believe it is essential for us, while not dropping our guard, to deal with the different causes of terrorism simultaneously."
"International relations are in turmoil and the Union, which is seeking to consolidate itself institutionally through the approval of the European Constitution, can play a significant and beneficial role in the quest for peace, stability and justice, including ecological justice, on our tormented planet, if we acquire the political will to do so."
"I say this at a time when we are about to find out whether, on 2 November, the American superpower will opt for the path of constructive cooperation and respect for the opinions of others, including the international institutions, or whether it will choose the opposite direction."
"In any event, we should bear in mind that, despite the enormous hegemony of the great American power, which can be either benevolent or hostile, as well as the European Union, other States are increasing in importance in terms of international relations, such as, to differing degrees and by way of example, China, India, Japan, Brazil and South Africa, to name but a few."
"Close, respectful and mutually beneficial cooperation between the Union and some of these countries may contribute to stabilising a prosperous, just and peaceful southern Asia."
"I do not believe there is any need to extol the virtues of India taking a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, something it aspires to, as we all know."
"Nevertheless, the very fact that that possibility is on the table clearly demonstrates not just the need to carry out a reform of the United Nations, but also the essential need to consider the structural injustice that distorts relations between the human beings and peoples of the planet."
"The fact that in the twenty-first century it is still necessary to create an alliance against hunger, as several countries have done recently in the headquarters of the United Nations, demonstrates what a disaster the international social organisation we are immersed in is."
"Our relations with India go back to the sixties."
"In fact, India was one of the first States to establish diplomatic relations with what was then the European Economic Community."
"It is no to say that that great country is the largest democracy in the world – although it may have shortcomings and defects, it is nevertheless the case."
"The Union is India’s most important trade partner and investor, but India is fourteenth on the list of the European Union’s trade partners – just behind China, Brazil and South Africa in fact."
"For all these reasons, we must take a positive view of the Commission’s communication, proposing the establishment of strategic cooperation as well as positive conclusions from the Council of 11 October."
"I believe we can all take heart from the fact that this is an issue the three Institutions agree on, which will provide us with suggestions and details to make the journey towards this strategic cooperation easier and richer."
"I believe, therefore, that, in accordance with our respective competences, but always in a coordinated fashion, we three Institutions can and must promote sustainable development and appropriate management of globalisation, encouraging New Delhi to wage a decisive war against poverty, in which I am sure it can count on the cooperation of the Union."
"The fact that India is a significant country in terms of certain important technologies, while at the same time 300 million of its inhabitants are living in poverty, is something that is quite frankly difficult to stomach."
"Nevertheless, I am convinced that the strategic cooperation proposed, and which will be properly laid out at the bilateral Summit of 8 November, will contribute to finding solutions and to sharing effective multilateralism in international relations."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we fully agree with the statements made by the Commission and the Council, as well as the rapporteur’s report."
"We believe that India, which is today the largest multicultural democracy in the world, should be a strategic partner for the European Union in defining new international political alignments to ensure peace and security."
"We therefore fully agree with the recommendation that the Council should, at the fifth EU-India Summit on 8 November, identify India as a strategic partner for the Union."
"A multilateral approach that also focuses on closer collaboration within the United Nations should be a central objective of the European Union’s foreign policy, with which we are today coming face to face with the approval of the new Constitution."
"That is why, if India is a strategic partner, we must ensure that the conditions are right for India and Pakistan to resolve the Kashmir dispute in a peaceful and civilised manner."
"I am not suggesting any useless external interference but something much simpler, giving as much helpful and welcome support as the European Union can provide based on its own experience in matters of foreign policy."
"We hope, therefore, that cooperation can go much further."
"The European Union is in fact India’s largest trading partner, but India only ranks fourteenth for the countries of Europe."
"There is thus a need for greater investment in economic cooperation among our enterprises, in research and in sustainable development."
"We think that the proposals put forward for the establishment of a Centre for Indian Studies through collaboration between the European Union and India, the possibility of holding cultural weeks to coincide with India-EU summits and designing a strategy to make the European Union better known to the Indian people should be fundamental."
"That is why we hope that the Indian Parliament will come and visit the European Parliament as soon as possible."
"It has been too many years since that happened, and we should instead develop much closer interparliamentary cooperation between our countries."
". Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent report and his insightful work into EU-India relations;"
"I endorse the report as it currently stands."
"However, speaking as Chair of the Parliament's South Asia delegation, I would like to go further."
"I am extremely keen that we develop a meaningful, strategic partnership."
"My hope for the fifth EU-India Summit on 8 November is that it is a landmark one; one that propels the relationship between the world's largest democracy and ourselves – the second-largest – into the twenty-first century."
"This can only happen if both sides have a strong will to turn dialogue and statements into a tangible reality."
"Therefore, I ask the Council to reflect on why, despite many proposals and summits in the past, very little progress has been made on this issue."
"Could it be that we have not had a clear vision of where we want our relations to be in five or ten years' time?"
"Mr Nicolaï and Commissioner Verheugen outlined a long list of areas where we need cooperation."
"But I believe we need to prioritise, because having this vast range of areas means we cannot focus on what we want to achieve."
"The list is also missing some crucial priorities: one of our main priorities, for example, is realising the Lisbon goals, which also happens to be one of India's top priorities."
"Their objective, like ours, is to create a knowledge-based society."
"We have the same goals and we can learn from each other, but we need to have the means to translate the wish-list into actual achievements if we are to ensure that happens."
"We also need to ensure that there are adequate resources in place."
"I am keen to see the Commission communication creating a tangible difference on the ground and a partnership that allows the benefits of the enlarged Union to be reflected in the new neighbourhood policy."
"I am leading a Parliamentary delegation to New Delhi next week and I will be urging our Indian counterparts to take action in the same areas – to prioritise, to produce a document – with a view to improving EU-India relations."
". Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for the report and emphasise how important it is that relations between the European Union and India be strengthened and cooperation stepped up."
"It has taken us too long to comprehend India’s significance."
"For a long time, we have treated India differently from other countries in the region, China for example, and so we are glad that, to judge by the journeys undertaken recently, both the European Union and many national governments are giving greater attention to relations with it."
"As many previous speakers have pointed out, India is the world’s largest democracy, with a diversity of religions, cultures and ethnicities, whilst being at the same time a rising economic power."
"We would therefore be well advised, to our mutual benefit, to attach the necessary importance to that country."
"I do believe, though, that honesty, honest friendship and honest relationships involve neither party sweeping problems under the carpet, but rather addressing them frankly."
"Indians see one of these problems as being the issue of the import restrictions that we in the European Union still impose on India, some of which are rigid."
"India is right to address this issue, and we should consider whether fair trade might not be of more help to India than development aid has been to date."
"I believe that critical scrutiny is needed here."
"I would, however, like to add that we very definitely see human rights as being another of these issues."
"While we welcome the indications that relations between India and Pakistan are bearing fruit in the shape of a potential resolution of the conflict in Kashmir, which gives cause for rejoicing, we also demand and expressly seek the acceleration, as a matter of urgency, of nuclear disarmament across the region, for the sake of the safety of the people who live there."
"As I have already indicated, one issue that must not be allowed to drop off the agenda in discussions with India is that of human rights; from the role of women to the caste system, these issues have a place in this context."
". Mr President, in his first statement in July, Mr Barroso said that we have to choose one priority, and that priority must be employment."
"This does not seem to have transmitted itself to this particular committee, which recommends upgrading EU-India relations by outsourcing and insourcing."
"I am sorry the rapporteur did not have the time to tell us how much insourcing there has been, but there has been a great deal of outsourcing."
"In Britain alone, most of the banks, the insurance companies and even the National Health Service have outsourced."
"My point concerns 3SE, which was set up by the EU and the Indian Government."
"On its website it goes a little further."
"According to the website, the value of outsourcing is in increased working days."
"It invites employers to harness the time difference of three-and-a-half to five-and-a-half hours to pack in hours."
"So there are no Commission hang-ups then about the working-time directive, as long it is the poor exploited workers of India who are involved!"
"The rapporteur tells us that we must help Delhi fight against poverty, but would he just tell his own organisation what it is doing to help?"
"Mr Barroso, as I said at the outset, says that he wants to boost employment in the EU."
"This report does just the opposite."
"– Mr President, for reasons of principle, I would prefer the chairman of the Committee on International Trade, Mr Barón Crespo, to speak first, but parliamentary order dictates otherwise."
"The geo-strategic and geo-economic importance of India are self-evident."
"As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade, I should like to focus on the following: it has already been said and it is a fact that, for the European Union, India is only the fourteenth most important trading partner."
"On the other hand, the European Union is India's main trading partner and the greatest source of foreign investment."
"Consequently, these are important trade links, although there is still room for greater improvement, given that the volume of trade and investment has not reached its full potential."
"As you know, the huge population in India creates the preconditions for a broad range and large number of potential consumers of European products."
"Nonetheless, the precondition on India's side is that it needs to open up the market further and introduce economic reforms."
"Indeed, it is in the common interests of the European Union and India to work to promote trade and investment, at both multilateral and bilateral level."
"At multilateral level, the European Union and India need to highlight common objectives and common ground in order to bring negotiations on the Doha development programme to a successful conclusion."
"For example, both sides have a common interest in protecting indications of origin."
"There is also room to further increase and intensify work at bilateral level."
"Customs cooperation between the European Union and India forms a good basis, as does holding a dialogue on matters such as investments and intellectual property rights."
"To conclude, I should like to mention India's development policy, to which the European Union could contribute by giving priority both to the attainment of the development objectives of this country in general and to improving governance, the quality of the environment, social and economic cohesion, the social insurance system and the adoption of international working standards, as provided for by the International Labour Organisation."
"Mr President, I am speaking firstly as somebody who for many years has advocated intensifying our political and economic relations with the great multi-lingual, multi-ethnic and multi-religious democracy of India, and, secondly, having heard our draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade, Mr Papastamkos, explain our position as a committee, to stress not just the increasing importance of our economic relations – and I recommend that you read the editorial in today’s , which explains that Indian companies are becoming increasingly important in terms of multinational development – but also the fact that the European Parliament, together with the Interparliamentary Union, is implementing an initiative from Seattle, which we have now given concrete form, and that, from 24 to 26 November, the European Parliament is going to host an interparliamentary conference to accompany the WTO conferences."
"I must point out, having chaired Parliament’s delegation in Geneva two months ago, that we have drawn up a regulation, approved jointly by Indian, Chinese, African, Latin American and European parliamentarians, and I believe that this is an important step towards making globalisation more democratic."
"Mr President, I would like to apologise for being late."
"It is a good thing that we in the European Union are striving towards a strategic alliance with India in order to promote peace, security, human rights and democracy."
"Our trade relations with India are also of importance."
"That country is very successfully developing into an economic growth area of some stature."
"In that respect, it is necessary for us to consider the implications of outsourcing European jobs to India, something that the present report rather overlooks."
"Another aspect that deserves more attention is the difficult relationship between India and Pakistan."
"I am not only referring to the Kashmir issue."
"Pakistan’s stance towards international Muslim terrorism is – to put it mildly – ambiguous, and this must emphatically be denounced by the European Union."
"The terrorists that are given shelter in Pakistan are a threat, not only to India, but also to the rest of the world, and thus also to the European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I hope the Commission’s recent communication and today’s debate in this House will usher in a new era of relations between the EU and India."
"The Lisbon strategy, commits us to achieving an economy racing along at the crazy speed of the US economy within a space of time that I regard as unrealistic."
"If this strategy is to be implemented, the European Union will need the help of a partner and friend over the next few years."
"Could Russia or China act as such a partner for the next 20 or 50 years?"
"This appears highly improbable."
"Anyone who has lived and worked in those countries and become acquainted with their policies and development plans would agree with me."
"For many years, we have been receiving clear declarations from India it would like to build closer links, and that these could involve more than the economy and investment."
"A willingness to forge closer political and global relations has also been expressed."
"Now is an excellent time for the newly-enlarged and 450-million-strong European Union, which has been reinvigorated by an influx of new countries, to build links with the Indian economy of over a billion people."
"This would create a new alliance of the kind we need."
"It would bring together a quarter of the world’s population."
"It is in our interests to forge links with a country where 50% of the population is under 20 years of age, and where GDP has risen by an average of 7% for the past few years."
"India is a world leader in many fields of science and industry, such as biotechnology, bioinformatics, electronics, the space industry and defence."
"There remains a great deal for us to do."
"There is work to be done with regard to the economy, investment, technological exchange and the building of civil society, and also with regard to the joint reconstruction of old international organisations such as the UN that do not always function as well as they should."
"Whilst adopting today’s Council statement and the recommendations made by this House, we should now think in such terms ..."
"– Mr President, I should like to start by thanking our rapporteur, Mr Menéndez del Valle, for the very important work he has done in his report, and I should also like to thank the Dutch Presidency, Mr Nicolaï, and Commission Verheugen for their statements."
"The further development of relations between the European Union and India will be of crucial importance to world peace, stability, security and development."
"India is a huge democratic country in the region with a history and cultural past."
"At the same time, however, it is a country of the future, which is building consistent and stable bases for its economic, social, scientific and technological development."
"The European Union and the Member States have every interest in developing a new strategic alliance, a new strategic partnership with India, and this relationship will contribute to the democratisation of the international system, to the necessary global and regional balances, to the creation of a multipolar world, to the defence of peace, democracy and human rights, to the reform of the UN system and to the strengthening of its role in legitimising the peaceful resolution of conflicts."
"India has a long tradition of independent and non-aligned foreign policy and of participation in UN international peacekeeping missions, such as in Cyprus, for example."
"The European Union must take full advantage of this tradition."
"I should like to finish by agreeing with what Commissioner Verheugen said; that we must, and that it is a major priority for the European Union to develop relations with India in particular in the areas of research, technology and the information society, where India has truly made tremendous progress, as confirmed by the thousands of Indians working in software and IT companies in Europe."
"That is why the European Union must promote educational exchange and research institute programmes and immediately implement the scholarship programmes."
"Mr President, over the past few weeks, and with the EU-India Summit in the offing – it is taking place in The Hague at the beginning of November – the Dutch Human Rights ambassador has declared that the violation of the rights of 260 million outcaste Dalits is an international human rights problem."
"Despite democracy and law in the world’s largest democracy, practice is proving somewhat different."
"Even though Indian law prohibits caste discrimination, it is still a fact of life."
"I would call for this problem to be explicitly put on the agenda in our bilateral and multilateral trade talks and in context of the broad EU-India partnership that we have, which has been rightly championed."
"In my view, positive support could help give the partnership a boost to such an extent that social isolation, child labour, exploitation and unfair trading are all addressed in one fell swoop."
"In this respect, a positive agenda is being drafted, where the problems of the Dalits are being addressed and as a result of which their situation can be actively improved."
"That is the platform where it should happen, but it is precisely this kind of international trade problem, linked to a real international legal problem of 260 million people, that calls for a common approach, not only in India but also in other countries."
"I hope we have the courage to interpret this broader partnership in that way where this is concerned too."
". Mr President, I will start by giving my compliments to the rapporteur, Mr Menéndez del Valle."
"The presidency can agree with most of the remarks and recommendations in this interesting and good report."
"I also fully agree with everyone who said that it is very important to give priority to good relations with this very important country, one which is becoming more important economically, technically and politically."
"Mr Menéndez del Valle also mentioned the importance of UN reforms."
"As everyone knows, the Council does not have a common position on the enlargement of the UN Security Council, so it is clear that the Union will not be able explicitly to state whether it will support the Indian request to become a permanent member of the Security Council."
"I emphasise that the UN reforms cover much more than just the Security Council."
"Possible disagreements on those reforms should not prevent us from implementing other necessary reforms in the UN."
"Some Members of Parliament – Mr Özdemir and Mr van den Berg – mentioned the important issue of human rights."
"As you know, discussing human rights within the United Nations is a sensitive issue;"
"I am sure the European Parliament delegation which visited Kashmir last June noted that too."
"Nevertheless, we will discuss the human rights issue, the situation of women and children, and other subjects, at the summit."
"We have been consistent in our position that in the fight against terrorism, or any other kind of militant extremism, human rights should also be respected."
"Thank you, Mr Nicolaï."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the result of the referendum and elections in Belarus."
". Mr President, the political situation in Belarus is going from bad to worse."
"During the parliamentary elections of 17 October 2004, very few opposition candidates were allowed to run and none of them were elected to parliament."
"The referendum to allow a third presidential term is said to have been won by a large majority of votes."
"The way is now open for President Lukashenko to put up his candidature for the presidential elections in 2006 and be elected for a third time, if not become president for life."
"If these presidential elections are conducted the same way as the elections and referendum of 17 October, there is no doubt that he will succeed in this."
"In our declaration of 20 October 2004 we clearly condemned the voting process."
"We noted with great concern that the elections and referendum failed to meet the international standards for democratic elections."
"The OSCE/ODIHR preliminary findings are clear about what went wrong."
"The European Union is deeply disappointed that both during the election campaign and on election day there were concrete signs of the Belarussian authorities’ disregard for democratic rules."
"The extent and character of the irregularities observed by the OSCE International Election Observation Mission raise serious doubts whether the results reflect the will of the Belarussian electorate at all. Exit polls, which we consider to be more credible, suggest that this is not the case."
"You probably all saw the subsequent pictures on television last week, of peaceful demonstrators and opposition leaders in Belarus being beaten up by police."
"We are very concerned about these violent attacks."
"These attacks, especially the attack on the life and health of opposition leader Lebedko, seem to have been well targeted and prepared."
"We call upon the Belarussian authorities to release immediately all those who were arrested in exercising their right to free speech, as provided by the constitution of Belarus."
"Needless to say, we also condemn the attacks on journalists, including Russian TV journalists, who tried to cover the demonstrations."
"We are faced with a neighbouring country where one man on his own decides what is best for the population."
"Opposition and independent media are repressed, democracy is a far cry."
"And this is not a new situation: the situation has existed since 1996 when President Lukashenko abrogated the elected parliament, and changed the constitution to invest all the executive powers in the president, i.e. his own person."
"It is not only in the interest of the Belarus people, but also in the European Union’s interest to have democracy, respect for human rights, peace, security and prosperity in this neighbouring country."
"So what can the European Union do to further developments in order to bring about a better life for the people of Belarus?"
"Since 1997, the European Union's relations with Belarus have been at a very low level."
"In that year the EU decided not to ratify the partnership and cooperation agreement with Belarus, in view of the abrogation of democracy in 1996."
"All technical assistance was stopped except if promoting democracy or humanitarian aid."
"After the presidential elections of 2001, when Lukashenko was re-elected, the EU decided to continue its strict policy towards the regime, but at the same time to try to continue and – if possible – to expand relations with civil society."
"Unfortunately, the situation is only getting worse."
"The popular support of President Lukashenko diminishes, and the regime – as a reaction – gets more and more oppressive."
"So what can the EU do about it, in terms of both carrots and sticks?"
"Firstly, what has the EU to offer?"
"In order to bring about an area of peace, security and prosperity the EU has developed the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"If Belarus decides to choose the path of democracy and rule of law, where the population decides on its own economic and political future, the EU is prepared to make Belarus the same offer as other neighbouring countries."
"Of course we should not offer this whilst Belarus is not making any changes."
"But how big is this carrot?"
"As prosperity in the new EU Member States neighbouring Belarus grows along with democratic stability, this may be expected to have a strong psychological effect on the people of Belarus."
"This will hopefully be an irreversible process."
"Assistance to civil society is already a long-standing policy of the EU."
"But to bring about this support within the borders of Belarus is getting more and more difficult in practice."
"The regime is doing everything to prevent western support to non-governmental organisations."
"An alternative is to develop more activities for Belarus civil society outside Belarus."
"The invitation of a number of opposition and civil society leaders to visit to Brussels in May is one example of this new policy."
"But more can be done, in the form of participation of Belarussians in seminars, courses and studies abroad."
"In the years ahead we should invest more in the Belarussian people in this way."
"I am also very happy about the establishment of a separate delegation for Belarus in the European Parliament."
"This will give you as parliamentarians a chance to focus more on this neighbouring country and to establish your own contacts."
"I think that this step also proves to the Belarussians that the EU takes the situation in their country very seriously."
"Secondly, what negative measures can the EU take?"
"Relations are already on a very low level."
"We have had sanctions in the form of a visa ban against the Belarus leaders in the past."
"Recently, we extended it to cover other high-level people."
"The only area that is still left aside is the economy and trade."
"Such a policy would clearly also hit the population as such, and will further isolate Belarus."
"President Lukashenko would argue that the population is worse off as a result of the EU’s action, not his own policy."
"Furthermore, the ordinary citizen will be worst hit."
"So it is I am afraid a double-edged sword."
"We have to be very careful when considering such steps."
"The political developments in Belarus are of great concern not only to the EU, but also to others such as the OSCE and the US."
"If we give the signals together, our voice will be better heard."
"But we will also have to work together with Russia, which seems to be the only country to have some influence over Belarus."
"We therefore also raised the situation in Belarus at the ministerial troika with Minister Lavrov last week."
"Whilst the Russian government shares our concern about the situation, unfortunately we disagree about the way forward."
"The Russians do not want to maintain the strict policy that the EU is implementing."
"And that I deeply regret."
"As I explained, the instruments available to the EU to influence developments are limited."
"But we will continue, as the EU, as individual Member States and through the OSCE, to try to influence the situation with these instruments and bring about a real improvement of the lives of the Belarus people."
". Mr President, the developments in Belarus are of great concern to the European Union."
"The European Union has a major interest in the stability, prosperity and democracy of its neighbourhood."
"It is deplorable that Belarus has not taken the opportunity of the October parliamentary elections to take positive steps towards democratic pluralism."
"On the contrary, the parliamentary elections on 17 October fell significantly short of OSCE commitments for democratic elections."
"The controversial referendum on the removal of the two-term limit on the office of the president failed to meet international standards."
"As pointed out in the preliminary findings of the international Election Observation Mission of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, the extent and the seriousness of irregularities during the electoral period and the voting day itself raise serious doubts as to whether the results of the elections fully reflect the will of the Belarussian electorate."
"Freedom of expression, association and assembly were seriously challenged."
"Election campaigning by the candidates was, in many ways, restricted."
"The state media conducted an extensive campaign in favour of the incumbent political forces, whilst portraying the opposition in overwhelmingly negative terms."
"Non-state print media had only a minor role to play."
"Access to independent information sources remains limited by the fact that all nation-wide radio and television channels are state-controlled."
"In the days following the elections, the negative trend in the political climate in Belarus has persisted."
"Since election day, the authorities have turned, in an increasingly harsh and intolerant manner, against those citizens who have challenged the outcome of the elections and referendum in peaceful street demonstrations."
"Many of those who have expressed themselves in public have been arrested or fined."
"Opposition leaders and journalists have been beaten up."
"It is extremely worrying that, time after time, dissident voices in Belarus are not listened to, but repressed by the authorities."
"For better or for worse, Belarus is a neighbour country of the European Union, with important historical, cultural and social ties with the enlarged European Union."
"We cannot be indifferent to the future of our relations with this or any other country in our immediate neighbourhood."
"The European Union has developed a framework to reinforce further the relationship between the enlarged EU and its neighbours, including Belarus: the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), for which I happen to be responsible, for longer than expected."
"As President Prodi has said, the aim of the ENP is to create a 'ring of friends'."
"A key principle of the 'ring of friends' we are forging is joint ownership."
"We cannot impose the policy on anyone, but we are ready to convince our neighbours of the benefits of the ENP."
"We are offering closer cooperation across the spectrum of our relations, from political dialogue to economic integration, on the basis of commitment to common values."
"This offer is also valid for Belarus."
"Through the ENP, the European Union is ready to reinforce its lasting commitment to supporting democratic development in Belarus."
"If and when fundamental political and economic reforms take place, it will be possible for Belarus to be fully involved in the ENP, with all the benefits that would bring."
"Under the current conditions, however, there can be no fully-fledged ENP action plan for Belarus."
"The October parliamentary elections and the referendum were an important milestone for Belarus under the ENP, but, unfortunately, Belarus failed to meet it."
"However, closer relations, including relations in the framework of the ENP, are still a possibility, provided that fundamental reforms are introduced."
"In the absence of fundamental reforms, one extremely important question remains: how should the democratic process in Belarus be further encouraged?"
"First of all, we believe in lasting engagement with the people of Belarus."
"At present, a key element in EU policy towards Belarus is support for civil society and the process of democratisation."
"The Commission wishes to pass a clear message to the Belarussian people, so that they know the EU has not forgotten them."
"The needs of the population should be addressed by way of technical assistance."
"People-to-people contacts between Belarus and the EU can be further fostered."
"The European Union is aiming to raise awareness of EU policies and assistance benefiting Belarussian citizens."
"I strongly believe that our new Member States in that region of Europe will help us to achieve our goals."
"The Commission intends to use the assistance instruments at its disposal to continue support and assistance to civil society organisations, journalists and independent media, universities and, where appropriate, local authorities."
"Belarus will continue to be able to benefit from relevant regional, cross-border and thematic programmes."
"It should be mentioned, however, that the delivery of international assistance to civil society and independent media is far from easy."
"In the past few years Belarus has refused to grant tax exemptions for EU assistance, in breach of earlier commitments between Belarus and the European Union."
"Today, Belarus requires all foreign gratuitous aid projects to be registered by the state authorities, which allows them effectively to turn down any international assistance that they do not appreciate."
"Secondly, we continue to monitor closely the state of human rights, respect for fundamental freedoms and the rule of law in the country and raise our concerns with the Belarussian Government."
"Based on information submitted by European trade union confederations, the Commission has launched an investigation into alleged violations of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining in the framework of the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP)."
"Depending on the findings of the investigation, the EU will need to reconsider whether Belarus should have access to the benefits of the GSP scheme in the future."
"Thirdly, it is important to take account of the long-term prospects."
"In the longer term, our proximity to Belarus could and should be translated into close cooperation and exchanges in fields of common interest, such as trade, justice and home affairs, transport, energy and the environment, provided that fundamental political reforms are carried out."
"The Commission wants to keep the door open for full participation in the ENP by a democratic Belarus."
"I would like to conclude by underlining again that it is important that the Belarussian people – and especially those striving for democratic change – are not left out in the cold."
"It is more important than ever to continue and develop our efforts to support civil society and democratic forces in Belarus."
"The Commission is committed to doing so."
". Mr President, dear colleagues, if we just look at a map, we would see immediately that the expansion of the European Union offered Belarus a unique opportunity, if that opportunity itself is not only theoretical."
"Both of these ‘ifs’ are the particularly fragile props, on which we can only imagine Belarus as a bridge between the European Union and Russia."
"The Belorussian bridge would be needed by all three sides, and profitable for Belarus itself."
"However, first there has to exist a democratic, independent Belorussian state."
"At present Belarus is a semi-dependent protectorate, ruled by an autocratic dictator, supported by Russia."
"Those who believe that everything in Belarus, including the elections, depends only on Mr Lukashenko, are wrong."
"When we criticise only the rulers of Belarus, we are departing from reality."
"Since 1997 a Russia-Belarus union has formed, which is expanding in the direction of ever greater state amalgamation."
"And so Russia's responsibility must not be ignored."
"For instance Mr Lukashenko appointed General Ushopchik, a man wanted by the Court of Lithuania for the murder of unarmed civilians during the events in Vilnius in 1991, a Vice-Minister in today's Belorussian Government."
"We hope that Lukashenko made this political provocation without instruction from Moscow's advisers."
"But as for his friendship with the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein, including arms trading, it is doubtful whether this could have been achieved without Moscow's approval."
"It seems that the present situation is useful to Russia."
"Were it not useful to Russia, the situation there would have changed long ago and the country would not be run by Lukashenko."
"But the protectorate is given to none other than Lukashenko."
"Not only to the country, but to the regime."
"The situation will change when Russia understands that this is not the most useful scenario for Russia either."
"Meanwhile an information centre on a democratic Belarus could already be operating now in Brussels, if the European Union were to help found it."
". Mr President, six weeks ago, this Parliament urged the authorities in Belarus to call free and fair parliamentary elections on 7 October 2004 and to abandon a referendum to change the constitution."
"This constitutional change would, in theory, make it possible for the current President, Mr Lukashenko, to remain in power for life."
"At the time, I called this an impending constitutional ."
"Unfortunately, we have to conclude – and that is not the first time – that our appeal has been in vain."
"No attempt has been made by the authorities to repair the damage of previous violations of the rights of opposition candidates."
"Media coverage has been neither fair nor balanced, and the OSCE came to the conclusion that the parliamentary elections failed to meet international standards."
"This also applied to the campaign preceding the referendum."
"The outcome, a turnout of around 90%, 75% of whom voted in favour of the constitutional change, is shrouded in suspicion."
"The parliament is paralysed, not one single opposition candidate having been elected to it."
"Since the elections, small, but persistent, peaceful protests take place in Minsk almost every day, but absolutely all of them are violently quashed."
"This situation calls for a response."
"It should be made quite clear that, in the present situation, there is no room for reinforcing relations with the regime in Belarus."
"It should be absolutely clear to Mr Lukashenko that rapprochement is out of the question as long as the regime does not commit to making efforts with a view to bringing about democratic reforms."
"In those circumstances, Lukashenko will remain internationally isolated, but the force of this lever is limited."
"We must also try to help bring about changes for the better in Belarus by supporting the democratic opposition forces in that country."
"Last week, the American Congress adopted a Belarus Democracy Act, which takes measures to which Europe should also give consideration."
"Finally, I have chaired the observation delegation during parliamentary and presidential elections in Belarus for several times now, and my frustration about the lack of change, despite all efforts on our part, is still very great."
"Policy proposed by the Council and Commission receives our unqualified support, but in my view, the key to change lies with Belarus’ other neighbour, not the EU, but Russia."
"I should like to urge the Council once again to take a firmer stand in talks with Moscow, for my experience has been only that, as soon as we declare the elections unlawful, a telegram would arrive from President Putin that very same day to congratulate Mr Lukashenko, for the umpteenth time, on successful elections."
". Mr President, recent events in Belarus have mainly been observed in terms of the elections taking place in the country."
"In the shadow of these elections, however, a referendum was held, aimed at amending the constitution and making it possible for Mr Lukashenko to remain in power in Belarus for the rest of his life."
"President Lukashenko prevented observers from monitoring this referendum, which was of enormous significance for him."
"It was therefore held without any kind of external checks."
"Its significance was due to the increased difficulty of rigging the results."
"In order for the referendum to be legally valid it was necessary not only for there to be a high turn-out, but also for over half of those entitled to vote to do so in favour of the proposals."
"According to independent investigations carried out by Gallup, these requirements were not met."
"There is therefore ample reason for neither this referendum nor Mr Lukashenko’s right to run for re-election to the post of president to be recognised, even though no independent observers were present."
"With regard to the European Union’s policy, I believe it is worth noting that there is only a comparatively small chance of any sanctions imposed actually having an effect."
"Belarus is fast heading towards self-isolation, and is turning into a country that entirely disregards the influence of other countries."
"In view of this, the economic effect of such measures can also be only slight, and the impact of the promised aid and ‘Cooperation with Belarus’ programme will doubtless remain very limited too, as President Lukashenko regards them as a poisoned chalice."
"If this is the case, what else can be done?"
"The most essential action required, as already mentioned in this House, is the building of civil society."
"This must be achieved not only through measures in Belarus itself, which could prove difficult, but by taking advantage of the opportunities provided by modern technology, including radio and television. The latter could convey certain values and attitudes to Belarus, even if the transmitters are located outside Belarus’ borders, as would be the case under the proposals put forward by the United States."
"Incidentally, and finally, it might be a good idea for EU actions of this kind to be synchronised and coordinated in some way with the US actions set out in recent decisions by Congress and the President."
"I thank you."
". Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it has become apparent in this House today that progress and change can result from democratic processes."
"For the people who live in Belarus, such a thing is the stuff of dreams."
"We cannot fail to see that the European Union is continuing to look on while a Stalinist and dictatorial system comes into being on its doorstep, with a long list of violations of democratic and human rights, and a roll of victims that gets ever longer, day after day."
"Many people in Belarus resigned themselves to this long ago."
"If they can, they leave the country."
"There is no hope any more."
"It was only by using methods of this sort that Lukashenko was able to secure power for himself."
"I am very far from satisfied with the statement by the Council and the Commission, which really has nothing new to offer."
"It is not true to say that a framework is in place; the fact of the matter is that there is only a piece of paper."
"There is not really a change in attitude, with a specific concentration on the situation in Belarus and consideration of which measures are feasible in order to support the opposition and civil society in that country."
"None of the actual instruments make that possible; they must be changed."
"That must go on the agenda now, for it is now that it is urgent, and not at some undefined time."
"Let me take this opportunity to remind the House of Mr Marset Campos’ report on its behalf, which said in plain language what is now to be done."
"Only if Belarus is democratic can we ensure our own security."
"For that reason, I believe that we should be backing a democratic Belarus rather than playing the Russian card."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe I have had numerous opportunities to participate in the monitoring of elections in many of the Member States of the Council of Europe, including the elections in Belarus three years ago as well as those which took place in the country last week, and I am therefore in a position to make comparisons."
"In this context, I agree with several of the critical observations contained in the OSCE report, for example that the political parties have had unequal access to television coverage."
"I also reject the use of violence of any kind, whether perpetrated by individuals or by the state authority."
"We should not, however, forget the apparent facts which proved so misleading in policy-making before the conflicts in Yugoslavia and in Iraq."
"Secondly, we should bear in mind that what we say about Minsk today will hold true for Kiev tomorrow."
"It is my belief, and it has already been stated before this House, that we all want Belarus to become a member of the European concert in a dignified manner."
"In my opinion, the way to aid this process is not to impose isolation, but to provide help for the ordinary Belarussian people."
"Belarussians should feel that the European Union is keen to see a stable and democratic neighbour on its eastern border, which respects the right to free elections."
"I believe that we will achieve this not by means of resolutions alone, but also by means of concrete actions, for example by stepping up aid for people in areas affected by the Chernobyl disaster, by helping resolve the issues of migration and border protection, by facilitating greater communication between students and by supporting civil initiatives."
"These are all tools which may improve the situation for ordinary people, those for whom democracy is most important, in my opinion."
"Mr President, there can be no doubt that human rights are violated in Belarus, that basic democratic standards are not respected in that country and that there is discrimination against minorities, primarily the Polish minority."
"Furthermore, there can be no doubt that this situation is far from normal, and that it fails to meet our expectations with regard to the standards of a democratic state."
"Nonetheless, we stand by the statements we made on behalf of the Independence and Democracy Group at the last part-session."
"As members of the League of Polish Families, we dispute the European Parliament’s right to interfere in the foreign policy of other countries, as it is not competent to do so."
"This House should concern itself with its own affairs instead of judging standards in other countries, especially ones that do not belong to the European Union, as such activities do not lie within its field of competence."
"A parallel may be drawn here with Turkey, a country that has recently been the subject of much discussion."
"Turkey is a country that is occupying half of Cyprus."
"Turkey does not maintain diplomatic relations with Greece or Armenia."
"It persecutes the Kurdish minority and has still not apologised for the genocide of the Armenian people."
"In spite of all this, Turkey is regarded as a potential member of the European Union."
"Belarus is a country where the persecution of minorities is not as widespread as in Turkey."
"Belarus does not pursue any kind of hostile policy towards other nations and it wishes to open up its foreign policy and cooperate with other countries."
"Even so, Belarus is condemned, whilst Turkey is regarded as a country that could belong to the European Union."
"At the very least, we should apply similar standards to both countries."
"Many thanks."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is abundantly obvious that the elections and the referendum in Belarus were conducted in a manner that violated all the principles of the rule of law and of democracy."
"We all know what happened."
"The events have been described to us by the Council, the Commission and individual Members of this House."
"We need to be honest with ourselves, however, and admit that this is also a failure for the European Union’s policy on Belarus so far."
"Furthermore, it is an unusually vivid example of what could happen to Ukraine if we do not carry out far-reaching reforms of our neighbourhood policy towards the latter."
"The history of Belarus since 1996 is an extremely alarming example of what could happen in this region, above all in Ukraine."
"What action can now be taken?"
"Above all, major changes are needed."
"Firstly, we should not recognise the results of either the elections or the referendum."
"Indeed, none of the EU Member States should do so."
"Secondly, we must extend the list of people whom we do not wish to see in EU Member States to include members of the Belarussian authorities."
"Thirdly, this issue must be raised at summits held between the European Union and Russia."
"Russia has recognised the results of the elections, and exercises political patronage over this political experiment in the heart of Europe."
"It is also vital to invest in society, and we must make major investments in civil society."
"In order to do so, I believe a separate fund to support freedom and democracy is needed."
"We must have the courage and sufficient funding to set up an independent radio station broadcasting to Belarussians."
"The Belarussian intelligentsia is currently stifled in its own country."
"We must have sufficient funding to enable these individuals to study throughout Europe and to build a future for their country whenever such an opportunity arises, and whenever Belarus regains its independence."
"This will be an investment in our common European future, a future in which I believe deeply."
"If we do not make this investment, the United States will."
"In so doing, it will gain the good will of yet another country of Central and Eastern Europe."
"Personally, I would be very glad to see this happen, but I know many European politicians would not welcome such a development."
"Many thanks."
"Mr President, on 17 October, the Belarussian voters went to the polls to vote in a referendum on a change to their constitution and to elect their Members of Parliament."
"The turn-out was huge, and the constitutional change was approved by 77% of the electorate."
"We should be very pleased about this awakening of democratic awareness and about the broad popular turn-out."
"A number of people, such as the Vice-President of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, believe themselves, however, authorised to take Belarus to task."
"Some of the accusations voiced have been hypocritical and demagogic, especially those made by governments that, before lecturing others, should put their own houses in order."
"Will the German people be consulted about the European Constitution?"
"No."
"Mr Chirac will reach a decision on behalf of France concerning Turkey’s accession to Europe and do so against the obvious will of the French people."
"These accusations are, moreover, ill-considered. Rather than demonise a nation that has only been independent for 12 years, we should be very pleased about the progress it has accomplished on the road to democracy and not interfere in such an arrogant and moralistic way in its internal affairs."
"Mr President, there can be no doubt that the elections and the referendum in Belarus were conducted in an undemocratic manner, that they were not free, and that they were not honest."
"If Mr Maštálka and Mr Lang cannot see this, it is because they do not wish to do so."
"I was a member of the observation mission sent to monitor the elections, and I saw for myself the way in which they were conducted."
"The electoral procedure did not ensure that the election or referendum were democratic, and what is more, electoral practices frequently did not comply with this procedure."
"We should draw two very important conclusions from this."
"Firstly, the Belarussian Parliament has no democratic mandate to represent the Belarussian people."
"Secondly, and this is something frequently overlooked, President Lukashenko has no democratic mandate to run for president in 2006, that is, to run for a third term of office and maybe even for subsequent ones."
"The first conclusion is contained in the resolution I hope this House will adopt with an overwhelming majority of votes."
"The second can be found in the amendments."
"What action should be taken?"
"It has already been said that our policy on Belarus must be reconsidered."
"One extremely important principle was referred to in both the Presidency and the Commission statements, namely the principle of support for society."
"Our European policy on Belarus should be guided by the principle of supporting society and isolating the authorities, and this principle should remain in place until the authorities become democratic."
"Alternative sources of information for the Belarussian people must be created."
"A radio station broadcasting from Poland or Latvia should be established first, followed by a television channel."
"Secondly, an extensive programme of scholarships should be set up for Belarussian young people and students who wish to study in one of the EU Member States, as well as a programme to support universities willing to accept them."
"Finally, it is extremely important for there to be a unilateral abolition by EU Member States of visas and visa fees for Belarussians, a point which has not yet been raised in this House."
"This would be a very significant gesture, demonstrating that the European Union is open to the Belarussian people."
"Mr President, dear colleagues. Ten days ago in Belarus steps were taken which have distanced the country even more from democratic Europe."
"And Belarus has already been a neighbour of the EU for half a year."
"It is one thing for us to be more or less tolerant of a regime turning into an autocracy because it is far away, it is something altogether different, when a state, whose borders are barely thirty kilometres from Vilnius, one of the capitals of the EU States, is becoming unpredictable."
"Ties with Russia, where anti-European moods are spreading, and where some of the gains of democracy are being removed, are becoming stronger and this has a certain influence on Minsk."
"While supporting the position of the Council, I also believe that in the time left before the 2006 presidential elections it is necessary to adjust in principle EU policy on Belarus, to adapt it to new conditions."
"It is doubtful whether measures, which partially support the efforts of Belarus' rulers to isolate themselves, the country and its inhabitants, are effective."
"Generally speaking in the age of television, computers and information, self-isolation can only be successful over a historically short period of time."
"We must draw Belorussians into true cooperation with the European Union, offer the hope of being a fully entitled democratic part of Europe."
"Lithuania and Belarus' other neighbours have specific plans."
"These include the broadcasting of a free radio programme, the publishing of an opposition newspaper and the foundation of a European University of the Humanities in exile."
"Additional EU funding is needed in order to implement these ideas."
"Note that after 17 October, not double, but ten times more resources are needed for the creation of a civil society in Belarus."
"– Mr President, the elections and referenda in Belarus were held under acute pressure and intolerable interference, primarily on the part of the United States of America, which put into operation the so-called 'Act of 2004', allegedly for democracy in Belarus."
"NATO delegates also suddenly discovered a link between Belarus and international terrorism."
"The European Union followed a similar tack."
"The statement by the Dutch Presidency and the Commission on the results of the elections are, in our opinion, yet more pressure on and coercion of the government of Belarus."
"They violate international law and the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of another state."
"The allegations both on the part of the European Union and on the part of the United States of America about alleged violations of democratic rights are hypocritical."
"The real reason, as we all know, for such intense intervention is the refusal by Belarus to yield to ΝΑΤΟ and the other imperialist organisations."
"The reports by the various western observers cannot be reliable, because they serve political expediencies, or should I say they are to order."
"Moreover, there are other reports, by Russia, China and the Commonwealth of Independent States, which are different."
"In our opinion, the people of Belarus alone have the authority and responsibility to decide on their future, which is why we denounce and condemn such pressure and interference."
"No one gives you the right, gentlemen of the Commission, gentlemen of the Council, to teach and export democracy to other countries."
"The people alone have the authority to resolve their problems."
"Obviously, of course, both the European Union and the United States of America would express their satisfaction if the elections had been held as in Afghanistan, in Iraq, in Kosovo or in Bosnia, which are under occupation, which have been turned into protectorates and in which, of course, in your opinion ..."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this House has given much attention to Sudan, and rightly so."
"Yet we have maybe paid too little attention to Belarus and the East, given that Mr Lukashenko and the Belarussian authorities pay no heed to the European Union’s position."
"The reason for this may be that our demands for the protection of human rights and democracy in Belarus have to date been voiced in a mere whisper."
"It is not a whisper that is needed, however."
"We need to make ourselves heard in a loud and firm voice, maybe even shout sometimes."
"That is what is required to protect national minorities in Belarus, including the large Polish minority, for example."
"After all, we are not talking about a distant African or Asian country where a local tyrant is violating democracy."
"We are talking about the European Union’s closest neighbour, which is situated closer to Strasbourg or Brussels than some regions in a number of EU Member States."
"Are freedom of the media and freedom of elections, things that are the daily bread of Europeans, to be foreign words in Belarus?"
"The short answer to this is ‘no’."
"We need to do more than merely discuss this issue."
"It is time to take action."
"We should boycott Mr Lukashenko, but we should not boycott the Belarussian people, organisations and youth."
"Mr President, on 19 October the European Commission endorsed the conclusions of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe that the elections in Belarus on 17 October fell well short of democratic standards – they were not free and fair – and I fully support the Commission's conclusions."
"In addition, it has been said that Belarus can forget about the neighbourhood policy; instead, sanctions are in the offing, as the EU has a history of being willing to respond with sanctions to violations against democracy and human rights."
"A week later, the opposite view was announced by the Russian Parliament, which declared that the elections and the referendum in Belarus were fair, free, democratic and legitimate."
"Only eight members of the Russian Duma voted against, while 416 were in favour."
"Our conclusion should be clear: the Russian Parliament has distanced itself from all democratic parliaments in the world and has also proved that the last dictator in Europe has the full backing of the Russian Duma, controlled by political forces closely linked to President Putin."
"Almost at the same time, another document – the Belarus Democracy Act of 2004 – was signed by the American President."
"This is a clear commitment to support those in Belarus who are working towards democracy: students, trade unionists, civic and religious leaders, journalists and all citizens of Belarus claiming freedom for their nation."
"This document provides for USD 45 million to be used to strengthen democracy in Belarus."
"What then should and could the European Union – and we, the European Parliament in particular – do?"
"A month ago here in Strasbourg I spoke about the radio for good neighbourhood project for international broadcasting to Belarus."
"This aims to renew cross-border broadcasting to Belarus in one radio channel, using the data resources of Radyjo Ratsyya from Belarus and the high-powered broadcasting licence of Radio Baltic Waves from Vilnius, Lithuania."
"The support of Commissioner Verheugen and my colleagues from this Parliament is necessary to implement this idea."
". Mr President, I very much agree with all those who made critical remarks about the situation and expressed concern about developments."
"I also agree with those who said it is important to try to find ways to improve the situation, especially by direct contact with civil society."
"I will reply on one issue, which was mentioned by Mr Wiersma, Mr Szymański, Mrs Andrikienė and others: namely Russia and the role that we and Russia could play."
"We regularly discuss with Russia the situation in Belarus."
"It is an important country for Russia and for the EU."
"Unfortunately, the Russian and EU approaches to improving the situation in Belarus differ."
"Russia understands EU concern about the human rights situation in general and about more specific issues such as the situation of the media and the closure of the European Humanities University."
"However, the Russians think that democratic change can best be promoted by involving Belarus more in the international community."
"As I tried to explain before, our approaches are really different, but you can be sure that where possible we are working with Russia on this important issue and trying to do what we can."
"– At the end of the debate I received six motions for a resolution(1)."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday."
"– The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the forthcoming elections in Ukraine."
". Mr President, I welcome this opportunity to discuss with you the situation in Ukraine before the presidential elections, and the state of relations between the European Union and Ukraine."
"The Ukrainian people stand at the crossroads of very important presidential elections."
"These elections will determine the direction Ukraine will take over the next four years."
"At this important time, the European Union has four clear messages for the Ukrainian people."
"The first message is simple: the EU is following the developments in Ukraine very closely."
"Since we are neighbours, we know we matter to each other."
"However, this does not mean that we always think the same way."
"In fact, certain developments within Ukraine are followed with a certain degree of concern by the EU."
"Ukraine’s track record in the areas of democratisation, human rights, upholding the rule of law, and the reform process, is mixed at best."
"To give just a few examples, there still remain questions about the disappearance of a Ukrainian journalist, the current process of constitutional reform and the virtual absence of a pluralist media."
"The EU regularly conveys its concerns to the Ukrainian authorities, for example during the recent EU-Ukraine summit, but also during other political dialogue meetings and through our embassies in Kiev."
"We are therefore following very closely and with particular attention the electoral campaign in Ukraine in the run-up to the elections on 31 October."
"We are pleased that Ukraine has generously provided invitations for international monitoring of the elections by ODIHR."
"Many EU Member States will send observers and the ODIHR findings will be a very important reference point for the EU."
"But we already have some concerns about the electoral process."
"I will give a few examples."
"There are clear indications that there is a biased media coverage."
"As you all know, it is essential to provide all political candidates with equal access to the media."
"Direct pressure on independent media has been growing in Ukraine, making it extremely difficult for the electoral process to be covered by a pluralistic and independent mass media."
"Only independent and free media coverage of the electoral process can ensure free, fair and transparent elections."
"Furthermore, there are reports of political pressure against voters, coercing them to take part in rallies and campaign events."
"Other reports mention administrative harassment of the opposition, use of administrative resources to obstruct presidential candidates from campaigning by depriving them of campaign materials, the use of state money, property and equipment for campaign purposes, and so on. We hope that these incidents will not threaten a credible and democratic election outcome."
"The Ukrainian Government has to ensure this."
"As I said, we appreciate the Ukrainian invitation to monitor the election campaign and the elections, but foreign observers alone are not enough."
"These are Ukrainian elections, for the Ukrainian people, needing Ukrainian observers."
"We regret, therefore, that independent, non-partisan observers are not allowed to monitor the presidential elections as well."
"We have communicated this message to the Ukrainian Government through our Council conclusions and through the declarations of an earlier presidency."
"We have also used our various high-level contacts to get this message across."
"And the Council will remain active, not just during the first round of elections, but also at the possible second round later in November."
"We hope that this message will convince the Ukrainian Government to respect democratic norms more strictly."
"There should be no manipulation of the election process to the advantage of one particular candidate and to the detriment of others."
"Free and fair elections and respect of democratic standards are essential if Ukraine really wants a rapprochement with the EU."
"The second message we have for the Ukrainian people is closely linked to the first one: Ukraine matters to the EU and vice versa, especially since enlargement."
"Several of the new Member States of the EU have strong economic, cultural and historical ties to Ukraine."
"Since enlargement, Ukraine is now a direct neighbour of the EU."
"The enlargement process has increased the importance of Ukraine to the EU."
"Moreover, the knowledge which the new Member States have enables the EU to conduct a more active and effective policy."
"But our relationship is not just about economics, culture and history."
"Ukraine is also an important political actor."
"Its close relationship with Russia and its role in the UN, illustrated by numerous Ukrainian contributions to peace-keeping operations, are clear proof."
"Our cooperation, therefore, in the area of foreign policy should be developed further."
"ESDP is one area, and the fact that a framework agreement for Ukraine's participation in EU crisis management operations will be signed soon is testimony to this."
"This brings me to the third message."
"The EU has the right instruments to conduct an effective policy towards Ukraine and intensify our relationship."
"First and foremost there is the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which comes with ministerial troikas, political dialogues and numerous expert-level working groups."
"The PCA will remain the cornerstone of EU-Ukraine cooperation."
"Furthermore, I hope that we will soon be able to adopt the action plan under the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"This action plan is an EU-Ukraine co-production and it will offer concrete objectives for the coming years."
"As President Kuchma stated at the last EU-Ukraine Summit, we need to commit ourselves to implementing what should be a plan of action and not merely a plan of intention."
"And the EU is committed to working on this in close cooperation with any candidate who wins in free, fair and transparent elections."
"Finally, our fourth message: EU-Ukraine cooperation will not always be easy, but it is in our mutual interests that the long-term trend is uphill, not downhill."
"If one listens to the comments and opinions of opinion-makers and politicians, both in the EU and in Ukraine, one often gets the impression that the EU-Ukraine relationship is sub-optimal at best."
"Ukraine wants the EU to offer more: the prospect of EU membership, better treatment in the area of free movement, etc."
"The single economic area is often quoted as evidence that this is already happening."
"Furthermore, the conduct of the upcoming presidential elections could possibly cast a shadow on our relations."
"Here lies a task for the Ukrainian Government and its people."
"But I believe that, even though our cooperation may sometimes be difficult, the long-term trend will be positive."
"The trend simply is not towards isolationism one, but towards integration."
"On 14 September the Ukrainian Parliament held a debate on EU-Ukraine relations."
"At that meeting a large majority of the parliamentarians supported EU integration."
"The joint action plan will be testimony of our own desire to enhance the quality of our relationship."
"I would like to conclude that it is time for the Ukrainian people to make a choice."
"Our message is clear, both on the elections and on the future of EU-Ukraine relations."
"Election time is always hard and we wish the Ukrainian people every wisdom."
"We hope they make the right choice: a choice for democracy and development, for justice and for the rule of law."
"And let us hope the circumstances will be such that they can make that choice."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to point out the enormous importance of Ukraine as a strategic partner of the European Union."
"Ukraine, being one of our immediate neighbours, with which we have close economic, social and human ties, is very particularly significant in terms of the long-term stability, security and prosperity of our European continent."
"Ukraine is an important partner in establishing security and stability throughout the region; there is no doubt that it shares in our European culture and in our common history."
"In its November 2003 resolution on the European Neighbourhood Policy, the European Parliament reaffirmed that Ukraine – like any other European state with a democratic constitution and a market economy – should have the option of, one day, applying for membership of the European Union, subject to its fulfilling the relevant conditions."
"This is not, at present, on our agenda, but my staff and I have nonetheless, over the past months, devised a medium-term and concrete perspective for the enlarged European Union’s neighbours – the European Neighbourhood Policy to which Mr Nicolaï has already referred."
"Liasing closely with the Ukrainian Government, we have devised a concrete and tailor-made action plan, which I will shortly be submitting to the Commission and, immediately thereafter, also to the Council and to Parliament."
"Mr Nicolaï has already referred to the many vital and new things that are on offer to Ukraine and to its people through the Neighbourhood Policy."
"We should not forget that we have cooperated to a significantly greater extent with Ukraine over recent years, especially since the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement entered into force in 1998."
"Dialogue is being cultivated in a variety of ways, including an annual summit."
"The European Parliament also, under our Partnership Agreement, has developed its own framework for in-depth dialogue with the Ukrainian Parliament."
"It gives me great pleasure that the new chairman of your House’s delegation to Ukraine, Mr Siwiec, is from Poland, one of Ukraine’s immediate neighbours."
"Although open and frank dialogue between partners ought to be the most obvious thing in the world, it is rather remarkable that the Ukrainian presidential elections scheduled for the coming weekend have shown themselves to be – to put it mildly – deserving of criticism to a significant degree."
"I can, unfortunately, do no other than concur wholeheartedly with Mr Nicolaï’s expressions of the gravest concern at the omissions and irregularities apparent in the election campaign, especially as regards the freedom of the media."
"I do not want the Members of this House to misunderstand me; this has only a very tenuous connection with the debate we have just had on Belarus."
"There is no doubt whatever of the progress Ukraine has made towards becoming a democratically constituted state, and, when it is borne in mind that the states that succeeded the former Soviet Union found this road a particularly long one, credit should be given for that."
"Real political parties are coming into being."
"Civil society is taking shape, and a whole array of non-governmental organisations are becoming vigorously active."
"Regulations and mechanisms intended to guarantee due legal and democratic process have been drawn up and reformed in close cooperation with the Council of Europe and the OSCE, in which the support of the European Commission has been crucial."
"Still to this day, though, it is a regrettable fact that, in Ukraine, many of these ground rules of democracy and the rule of law exist only on paper."
"This is probably the fundamental truth that emerges from the present situation, as that country is preparing to go to the polls."
"It is a fact that what we can see going on there now is an election campaign with virtually no holds barred."
"We can of course see that as a positive sign, an indication of political competition, but it can also be seen as evidence that there is much still to be desired as regards political culture."
"We should not forget, though, that there is a significant difference in comparison with other states in the region."
"Whatever else might be said about it, the present election campaign in Ukraine is a real one, with several genuine and competing candidates."
"I would also like to make it clear to you, though, that we cannot lower our standards for adherence to shared values and democratic principles, on which depends the implementation of our European Neighbourhood Policy action plan for the future – which is a very ambitious one."
"It is not acceptable that authorities and other state bodies should interfere in elections at various levels and in all manner of different ways."
"Nor is it acceptable that not only opposition politicians, but also independent civil society initiatives should be subject to increasingly repressive measures."
"The first preliminary reports by the observers sent by the OSCE’s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights paint a somewhat gloomy picture of only partly objective reporting on the part of the national electronic media."
"Critical and sceptical I may be, but I remain confident that the presence of election observers can help the elections to proceed in a democratic and legitimate manner."
"The European Union has mounted a number of projects in order to try to help the Central Election Commission, non-governmental organisations and journalists to play their parts in the election process."
"It is cause for gratitude that the European Parliament, like the EU’s Member States and the Commission, is sending observers to participate in the OSCE’s International Election Observation Mission."
"Those who are then to report to us from Ukraine will have very great responsibilities, for much of what we do in Ukraine in the future will depend on what they have to say."
"There is no doubt that the election represents a crucial test for democracy in Ukraine."
"We in this place should appeal to the state authorities, to the media, to the political parties and, not least, to the candidates, to allow the remaining days of the campaign leading up to the election to be characterised by democracy, the rule of law and fairness, which are absolute requirements."
"While the Commission is indeed prepared to promptly implement, under the New Neighbourhood Policy, the closer cooperation with the new President that we seek, it is not in the least irrelevant to us how this election is won."
"Let me conclude by repeating that the closer partnership with Ukraine that we want is dependent on its commitment to common values and democratic principles and a determined and unambiguous policy of allowing these values and principles to be realised in day-to-day political life."
". Mr President, the election schedule for this Sunday is critical for the future of Ukraine."
"Unlike other former Soviet countries, the outcome is still genuinely uncertain and contrasts markedly with the election two weeks ago in Belarus, where a massive fraud was perpetrated on the people of that country."
"Nevertheless, so far in the campaign, there have been widespread allegations of bias by the authorities against the opposition front-runner, Mr Yushchenko, ranging from the use of administrative resources dedicated to backing the incumbent Prime Minister Yanukovych as a presidential candidate, to bizarre allegations of KGB-style poisoning with ricin."
"Of more concern has been the harassment of opposition print media and impeded access to state and private TV coverage. There are also allegations that there have been numerous paper or technical candidates submitted by backers of Mr Yanukovych in order to distort the composition of the local election committees."
"In fairness, such tactics occur everywhere, are legal, and the government of Ukraine would have faced Lukashenka-style criticism if these candidates had been rejected."
"There are also concerns that the polling stations set up in the Russian Federation will be very hard to monitor independently."
"Also, I was personally concerned to hear last weekend that two serving policemen were found to be part of the mob that physically attacked a pro-Yushchenko rally."
"On behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I welcome the government of Ukraine's invitation for me to attend – with six other MEPs – as an observer in Kiev."
"I call for restraint from any action to distort the true will of the people to elect a president of their choosing."
"Ukraine now has an opportunity to demonstrate its commitments to free, fair and transparent elections as part of the European community of nations, where it truly belongs."
". Mr President, Ukraine occupies a central position in the EU’s Neighbourhood Policy on account of its location – between the European Union and Russia – its size and its historical link with our part of Europe."
"Democratisation in Ukraine is one of the greatest challenges for the Neighbourhood Policy, which aims to build up relations with the countries surrounding the European Union."
"Needless to say, the developments in Ukraine are also an important indicator of that Policy’s success."
"The presidential elections on 31 October and the second round a few weeks after that play a central role in those developments."
"In simplified terms, the choice is between the present course of a semi-democratic regime on the one hand and the European course of the democratic opposition on the other."
"The government, President Kuchma, with the oligarchs supporting him behind the scenes, and the Russian President Putin who yesterday started a visit to the Ukraine lasting several days, support their own candidate, Prime Minister Yanukovych."
"Despite a number of official reforms, the latter does not have a good reputation as regards freedom of the press, freedom of opinion and the guaranteeing of an open and fair democratic process."
"In the run-up to the elections, countless incidents have been reported, including, as the most striking of all, the mysterious illness of the most important opposition candidate, Mr Yushchenko."
"We have grave concerns about this."
"Nevertheless, as Commissioner Verheugen already stated, we welcome the fact that there is a true election battle being fought in that country, and we also hope that those campaigns persist."
"Despite this, it remains to be seen whether the elections will receive the full approval of the international observers, our own and that of the OSCE."
"I endorse Commissioner Verheugen’s appeal to those observers, urging them to take their weighty responsibilities very seriously indeed."
"After all, the declarations that are made at the end of such an election often have a significant impact on relations between the European Union and the relevant country."
"We would therefore urge the Ukrainian authorities, in the last days before the first round of those presidential elections, to ensure that all candidates have equal access to the media, to repair what damage can be repaired and to commit to a fair campaign in the second round – which will, of course, be the most important – so that the Ukrainian population can make up their own minds."
"Ukraine has expressed a desire for still closer cooperation with the European institutions, and for stronger relations with the European Union."
"The ties with the European Union can be strengthened only if Ukraine demonstrates that it takes its own democracy seriously, because a disruption in the democratic process in those elections could greatly encumber relations between the European Union and Ukraine."
". Mr President, there have already been many occasions on which this House has heard of various violations of the principles governing the conduct of election campaigns."
"I would, however, like to draw your attention to several new and, in my opinion, novel aspects that have emerged during this particular campaign."
"The first of these is the appearance of fictional candidates in lists of candidates."
"Twenty-three candidates are running for president of Ukraine, but in reality only a few are genuinely doing so."
"Most of the others are registered in exactly the same way, but their participation in the election campaign is limited to a statement that although they are standing for election, the better candidate is in fact someone quite other."
"In addition, their representatives in electoral committees are in practice representatives of an entirely different candidate."
"The second aspect which has recently become apparent, and which could pose a risk, although the risk may have abated somewhat at present, is the large number of electoral constituencies outside Ukraine."
"These have been set up because of the large Ukrainian minority living in Russia."
"According to statistics, this minority numbers several million."
"The electoral constituencies on Russian territory will be exclusively under the control of candidates, at least officially."
"They will be beyond any kind of international control, and the number of votes cast there could influence the outcome of the election."
"Finally, there is a third aspect to this electoral campaign, namely Russia’s very strong support for one of the candidates."
"Russia reacts sharply with accusations of interference in the affairs of other countries to any criticism of the way in which the electoral campaign in Belarus and in other countries is conducted, for example, yet in the case at hand it has absolutely no inhibitions."
"An additional threat emerging is that the situation might be resolved by force."
"I recently returned from a visit to Ukraine, during which I met a number of people, and concerns of this nature are frequently voiced in the country."
"We need to be aware that such a threat could emerge."
"I thank you."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with Commissioner Verheugen that, in contrast to the situation in the neighbouring country of Belarus, the presidential elections in Ukraine will involve a genuinely exciting neck-and-neck race between two strong personalities."
"It really is a decision for the Ukrainian people."
"Yet, as many other Members of this House have noted before me, we await this weekend and this electoral process with concern, as it is becoming apparent that the campaign is being fought on unfair terms, and with no holds barred."
"President Kuchma is cracking the whip for his preferred candidate, and forcing state officials and television channels into line to support him."
"We support Mr Wiersma in his call for an end to be put to this and for a fair electoral process to be given a chance."
"I concur with the Presidency’s demands and share its regret that local election observers could not be deployed, as during the last elections this proved to be a key factor in ensuring that the public viewed the elections as democratic."
"An extremely high turnout has made clear the country’s potential as a democracy , and it is therefore crucial that measures are taken to prevent any undesirable developments, as well as to ensure that these elections are conducted in a genuinely democratic fashion."
"I have confidence in the people of Ukraine, but I also call on the Presidency and the Commission to ensure that support for democratic structures and, above all, for civil society is accorded a central role in the action plan, and is given higher priority than economic development, as the development of democracy in Ukraine still stands on shaky ground, and must be consolidated."
". Mr President, Commissioner, Ukraine plays an enormously important role for the EU’s Member States."
"It has a common border with three of them, which of course gives rise to social and economic links, and, when overall relations with it are considered, it also wields powerful influence."
"In addition, it plays a significant role in relation to Moldova, a country where Ukraine’s involvement is necessary."
"Having spent six years of my life in Ukraine and having known the country for over 30 years, I can tell you that it is currently following a path which leads quite clearly to democracy."
"We should be rather more restrained in our demands for tremendous speed and transformation, as some things simply take time."
"As previous speakers have observed, it is of course the case that some doubts always remain; for example, Russia’s support for a certain candidate can be said to present a problem."
"Yet a problem is also presented by Mr Blair’s support for Mr Bush in the USA."
"It is nothing new for there to be talk of checking certain votes cast by voters living abroad; indeed, a large number of Americans are allowed to vote in Germany."
"It is always assumed in advance that there is an enormous risk that the democratic rules of play will not be adhered to in certain countries, whereas no such assumptions are made in the case of others."
"We are all aware as well that in the last presidential elections in Florida there were heated disputes over popular votes."
"We should have confidence in Ukraine."
". Mr President, Mr Nicolaï, Commissioner, the first-round election campaign in Ukraine is drawing to a close."
"Several international organisations have voiced a great many reservations about the way the campaign was conducted, a fact noted in key comments by previous speakers."
"It cannot be said that the situation in Ukraine is similar to that in Belarus."
"That would be a step too far."
"There is, however, something both countries have in common, namely Russia’s strategic interest."
"In the course of the electoral campaign in Ukraine, this interest was very apparent at the Sochi summit on 26 July of this year and during President Putin’s later visit."
"We know Russia is interested in maintaining a particular political configuration in Ukraine."
"The candidate who represents this configuration is the current President, Mr Yanukovich."
"He enjoys far superior access to the media and more opportunities to communicate with his voters."
"It is important for us to hold talks on issues relating to Ukraine with Russia, a key partner in such matters, and these talks should be placed on the agenda both of meetings held in the framework of the PCA and those held during the EU-Russia summit."
"In addition, I should like to make a few comments on Mr Verheugen’s statement."
"It is true that Ukraine does not yet fully meet the criteria of a democratic state, but we know that membership of the EU is the best incentive for it to fulfil these criteria."
"Mr President, Ukraine, a country where presidential elections are shortly to be held, currently has two development routes open to it."
"One is the European route and the other the sub-Soviet route."
"The first involves democratic standards, the rule of law, a market economy and accelerated political integration into the structures of the European Union."
"The second involves the risk of the present political and economic model becoming entrenched."
"What measures can we take to increase the likelihood that the first route will be taken, and not the second?"
"There is indeed little we can do, but we do have some options currently open to us."
"It would be possible for us to monitor the voting closely and also the electoral campaign between the first and second rounds of voting in the presidential elections, as the campaign during this period will be at its most dramatic."
"In addition, of course, we need to react."
"Following the presidential elections, this House should adopt a resolution, and later a report, containing details of what needs to be changed in the EU’s policy on Ukraine."
"Secondly, we should be prepared to postpone the adoption of an action plan for Ukraine by the European Union, or more specifically by the Commission."
"The fact that the European Commission did not approve the action plan yesterday is to be welcomed, because a victory for Yushchenko would enable us to take more action, to make Ukraine more generous offers and to take measures to support democratic change in the country."
"A victory for Yanukovich, in turn, would enable us to adopt the action plan in its current version, and to observe the measures taken by the new president, if this turns out to be Yanukovich, in the first days after his electoral victory."
"If Yushchenko wins, we must be prepared to free up large amounts of additional funding to support the transformation of Ukraine, and we should send out a clear message now that we are prepared to do so."
"After the elections we should promptly organise a donors’ conference, similar to the conference in Georgia, or rather on behalf of Georgia, which made it possible for the European Union to take steps to support the transformation of this country."
"It is vital to bear in mind that a strong, democratic and independent Ukraine is essential to the stability of Europe."
"Mr President, Mr Verheugen has given us a good description of events in Ukraine, as he avoided speaking in black and white terms, resorting instead to shades of grey."
"We have a tendency to perceive everything positively, like the Ukrainian authorities, or negatively, like the opposition."
"Everything appears to be either good or bad."
"In Ukraine, however, everything is either partly good or partly bad."
"I will act as chairman of Parliament’s observation mission, and I can assure you that the message we are taking to Ukraine is a positive one."
"We wish to assist Ukrainians to build democracy and respect certain principles."
"We are not going there with the intention of supporting anyone."
"We are going to observe the conduct of the elections."
"The aim of our visit is to bring European standards to the Ukrainian public."
"It should be borne in mind that the elections in Ukraine will not be the catalyst for a revolution."
"The mood among the Ukrainian public is not one of expectancy that revolutionary changes will occur."
"I do not believe that Mr Yushchenko will introduce revolutionary changes if he wins, nor that Mr Yanukovich will become an of President Kuchma if he does."
"We need to ask ourselves what contemporary Ukraine is actually like."
"How does it differ from other countries of the former Soviet Union?"
"Speakers in this House have said that a genuine political battle is being fought, and indeed where else is a genuine political battle being fought in this region?"
"A month before the elections in Ukraine we do not know who will be President."
"In the case of the Russian elections, however, it was a foregone conclusion."
"The existence of any genuine opposition and any genuine alternative at all in Ukraine is an achievement of the past few years."
"It is also an achievement for the European Union and the countries that supported the opposition."
"We should not forget, however, that even the victory of an opposition representative would not mean that relations with the European Union could be scaled down."
"It would simply pose new challenges."
"Russia’s unprecedented influence is an aspect that must not be overlooked, as this is the first time the latter has exerted its influence on such a scale."
"We must be patient and consistent in our relations with Ukraine, and for this we also need time."
"Mr President, when I listen to the comments made by Mr Verheugen and by representatives of Western Europe on the subject of Ukraine, I have the curious impression that none of you appreciate the reality of the country we are talking about."
"This is a country that achieved independence a mere 12 years ago."
"It was under some form of occupation or another for centuries."
"For centuries too, efforts were made to stamp out the Ukrainian language."
"It would be impossible for such a country to get back on its feet and become both democratic and European in the Western sense of the word within 12 years."
"After all, your own countries took centuries to do so."
"This is something that simply has to be taken on board."
"I therefore believe that the European Union cannot afford to act merely as a passive observer of events in this country, a country that lies on the European Union’s eastern border and has a population of 50 million."
"It simply cannot afford to do so."
"Regardless of the outcome of the elections, a clearly defined programme is required."
"This needs to be a programme to support pro-European forces, pro-democratic forces and democratic processes in Ukraine."
"It should be targeted at young people, and designed to strengthen the economic dimension and economic progress."
"It must also be allocated the appropriate funding."
"I hope the European Union will put forward proposals for such a programme."
"As Mrs Schroedter said, it must be targeted primarily at the citizens, not at the Ukrainian authorities."
"We all need a programme of this kind."
"There is nothing worse than someone who looks on indifferently as a small, weak child fails to cope with a difficult situation."
"I believe we should take more concerted action."
"It is true that the elections will not be fully democratic, but we should not make future aid dependent on elections and election results."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, caught as it is between two newsworthy events – the parliamentary elections in Belarus and the US presidential election – the election in Ukraine is nevertheless no less important for Europe and the whole world, although this neighbouring country is more democratic than Belarus, of course, and less influential than the United States of America."
"Thanks to the members of the European Parliament from the new Member States, and their knowledge and experience of these questions, issues connected with Ukraine have been given special attention even in these first few months of Parliament’s work, emphasising the importance of this new European neighbour state as a strategic partner."
"In the last few years, a great and powerful democratic opposition has formed in Ukraine, but we can see negative tendencies in the field of media freedom and exploitation of the whole administrative machinery in the hands of the ruling elite."
"These tendencies pose a threat to the process of democratisation and the fairness of the presidential election."
"The election law is legally correct, but compliance with it is compulsory only for the opposition."
"What is most alarming, however, is the attitude of the people themselves: everyone knows what is going on, but there are so many violations that society has become accustomed to them, and there are only a few people who think that such a way of doing things is unlawful."
"What is more, the population is being brainwashed with advertising financed by the oligarchs’ millions."
"The election law does indeed provide for a ceiling on campaign expenditure, but there is no real control of candidates’ funding and political party finances."
"The result of this election must be clearly and effectively reflected in the decisions of the European Union, not merely of censure or support, but also with respect to concrete strategic and financial issues."
"Currently an action plan is being developed between the European Union and Ukraine within the framework of our new neighbouring country policy."
"As a member of the European Parliament, I am in favour of refining the content of the document and signing it only once the election is over, once it is perfectly clear whether the Ukrainian presidential election has been democratic and whether the new government is being formed by democratic methods."
"We all need neighbours who are democratic and free of corruption, so that entrepreneurs can earn greater profits in a freely competitive environment, and our people can sleep more soundly, in the knowledge that Ukraine has not put on the snarling bearskin of its big Russian neighbour."
"Mr President, is Europe aware of what is happening in Ukraine?"
"The media launch constant attacks on the opposition candidate, Mr Yushchenko, who is not allowed to appear on state radio and television. Rallies held by the opposition are disrupted by hecklers and journalists are intimidated."
"That is not the worst of it, however."
"The young Ukrainian democracy would be able to cope with such trials, but it cannot cope if those seeking to destroy it receive support from outside, namely from Russia."
"President Putin is quite clearly backing Mr Yanukovich."
"His current visit to Kiev, during the final days of the election campaign, is an obvious interference in Ukraine’s domestic affairs."
"It is reminiscent of a Tsar’s visit to a subordinate province."
"In addition, the announcement that 45 electoral committees are to be set up for Ukrainians living in Russia casts doubt on the credibility of the election results."
"Yet Ukraine is no exception."
"Russia also remains indifferent to the Belarussian regime’s brutal violations of democracy, as well as to the repeated calls by this House and by the Council of Europe to search for political solutions to the bloody conflict in Chechnya."
"Poland has always shown staunch support for Ukraine’s ambitions to join the Western community of European nations, and will continue to do so. The simple truth is that Ukraine is a state of strategic importance for Western Europe, both from an economic and security point of view and in terms of geopolitical balance in Europe."
"If the European Commission has no doubts as to the legitimacy of recommending Turkey, a ‘yes’ for Ukraine can only be a matter of time."
"We should make every effort to reduce this time to an absolute minimum."
"Our first step should be to say a clear ‘no’ to Russia."
"I therefore call on this House to ensure that the issue of elections in Ukraine is not passed over by the Member States during the upcoming summit between the European Union and Russia on 11 November."
"I would also call for every effort to be made during the next two weeks, which are crucial for Ukraine, to prevent Russia taking any action to strengthen autocratic tendencies in its neighbours."
"This is my appeal to you, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Verheugen."
"We must not tolerate the creation of a new iron curtain."
"Mr President, there are plenty of reasons for being pessimistic about the presidential elections in Ukraine being conducted honestly and fairly."
"Moreover, as it appears that the ballot box battle will require two rounds, it is of great importance that Europe should keep a careful watch on this Ukrainian electoral contest during the so-called interim period of 31 October to 21 November 2004, and I would emphatically call on the European institutions to do just that."
"In addition, the European Union should not place all the emphasis on who leaves the arena as victor, but also on how the battle is fought."
"If this is done in an unlawful manner, I would expect the Council and Commission to send a clear signal in the direction of Kiev."
"Although Ukraine’s international isolation may not be in the interest of the Union’s Member States, a ‘business as usual’ attitude is out of the question if that happens."
"I should like to finish with a pressing question."
"How does the Council view the obvious interference of the Russian President in these Ukrainian presidential elections?"
"After all, this intervention undoubtedly affects the EU Member States’ external interests, not to mention Ukraine’s national independence and its citizens’ political freedom."
". Mr President, it is very clear from remarks made by Members that the European Parliament is following closely developments in Ukraine."
"Let me talk specifically about the election process and EU activities concerning the election, because a lot of Members made remarks about that."
"As I said, we follow the elections very closely."
"The basis for our opinion on the process will be the report of the OSCE Election Observation Mission."
"The EU provides about half of the observers for this mission."
"On a national basis, several Member States provide funding to NGOs that want to contribute to a free and fair election process."
"In any case, the EU will not remain quiet once the first round of the elections has been completed."
"We will issue a declaration clearly expressing our opinion about the election process."
"Some Members – Mr Tannock and Mr Wiersma – spoke of the possible poisoning of the opposition candidate, Viktor Yushchenko."
"We are worried by these reports, but I do not want to speculate about what happened."
"I am just happy that he is alive and able to continue campaigning, thus maintaining the broad field of candidates from which the Ukrainian people can choose."
". Mr President, when I was asked what changes would occur within the European Union as a result of the accession of eight Central and Eastern European countries to the EU on 1 May of this year, my answer was that there would be one extremely important change, namely that we would have to pay greater attention to our neighbours Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, and that our new Member States would ensure that we did so."
"I am glad that this afternoon has proven this prediction to be true, even if I do not agree with everything that has been said before this House, in particular by the Polish Members."
"I do, however, welcome the fact that the representatives from our new Member States have taken advantage of this opportunity to highlight their region’s specific problems."
"I have taken the floor one last time in order to counter the impression that we are ‘neutral’ observers of events in Ukraine."
"This is not the case, and the fact that the country is important to us means that we are extremely active in it."
"Our activities relate precisely to the promotion of civil society for which Mrs Schroedter called, and indeed we have achieved a number of successes in this field."
"It is by no means the case that the picture we have to paint is an entirely negative one."
"It appeared to me that, on the whole, our views on this debate coincide fully with regard both to what we want and how we will achieve it."
"The real issue at stake here is the connection between political reform in Ukraine and the prospect of it acceding to the EU."
"Would a clear prospect of membership in the EU help democratic forces in Ukraine to take the upper hand?"
"My answer to this is a definite ‘yes’, I am absolutely sure that a genuinely convincing prospect of EU membership for Ukraine would help."
"That is precisely the reason why, together with the action plan, we have offered Ukraine a policy in which the action plan only acts as a start, with the policy being made up of various successive steps bringing us ever closer together."
"During talks with President Kuchma I have always deliberately left open the issue of where this policy will ultimately lead, and it has been Ukraine itself which has said that it believes that it will one day lead to the European Union."
"I do not believe that we should reject such an ambition on Ukraine’s part."
"As a final comment, I do not entirely agree with some of the things that have been said in this House this afternoon, for example that we should have more sympathy for democratic deficiencies in Ukraine; after all, the country has a hard time of it, as it is a young democracy, which has been independent for only 12 years."
"If you will forgive my saying so, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have also only been independent for 12 years, and yet we demanded that these three countries meet our political and democratic standards in full."
"They were able to do so, even though their past was as difficult as that of Ukraine."
"I am in favour of us adopting a similarly demanding approach towards Ukraine, and of us telling the democratic forces in the country what we expect of them."
"I do not, however, believe that the comparison made in this House this afternoon between Ukraine and a small child is an appropriate one."
"A small child can be taken by the hand, or occasionally given a smack, if needs be."
"Neither of these actions can be taken in the case of Ukraine, and in both cases the metaphor is inappropriate."
"Ukraine is not a small child, it is a thoroughly self-confident, important and adult country, and I believe that we can very well demand of this country that it should also behave like an adult."
"Mr President, I am very sorry that I arrived only at the end of the debate about Ukraine, as I had a meeting at the same time with the Parliament delegation for relations with Israel."
"It may have escaped me, but I asked the Dutch representative of the Council a pertinent question about the Council’s stance with regard to the Kremlin’s obvious political intervention in these Ukrainian presidential elections."
"The Council may have already responded to this question, but should it not have done so, my question still stands."
"Moreover, I have put this question in the national language of the Council’s representative, and a response would be appreciated."
". Mr President, I can only add that we will also discuss this with Russia at the next summit on 11 November."
"– At the end of the debate I received six motions for a resolution(1)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday."
"The session is suspended until Question Time at 6 p.m."
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0017/2004)."
"We shall take questions to the Council."
"In recent months, there has been a growing tendency towards ethnic violence in the Voivodina province of Serbia and Montenegro."
"The violence has been directed against national minorities living in the region, such as Albanians, Croats and Hungarians, and include defamation of national symbols, destruction of property and cultural heritage as well as the infliction of serious personal injuries."
"Despite repeated complaints by individuals and political groups, the central and local authorities are unwilling to take substantive measures to address the situation and bring the perpetrators to justice."
"Is the Council aware of the serious circumstances in Voivodina?"
"Is it planning to take adequate steps to persuade the Government of Serbia and Montenegro to restore public order and to guarantee the fundamental human rights of ethnic and national minorities?"
"Since the inactivity of the authorities in Serbia and Montenegro constitutes a serious violation of the Copenhagen criteria, might this affect relations between the European Union and Serbia, including any future partnership?"
". Mr President, the issue of inter-ethnic tension in Vojvodina has been discussed in the competent Council bodies and in the Council itself, namely in the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 13 September 2004."
"The EU’s heads of mission in Belgrade have been asked to draw up a report on the situation in the province with a general overview of the inter-ethnic relations and more information about recent incidents."
"The report by the heads of mission, published on 15 September, states that although it appears that inter-ethnic intolerance has increased, the incidents – however disquieting – have generally been on a small scale and there does not seem to be a clear trend."
"In the report, it is recommended that after the local elections taking place between 19 September and 3 October, a follow-up report be drawn up in due course, in the light of which the competent Council bodies will re-assess the situation."
"In its conclusions about the Western Balkans of 11 October 2004, the General Affairs and External Relations Council is satisfied with the undertaking given by the Serbian Government on 8 September that it will step up the dialogue with all ethnic communities, and the Council was looking forward to this undertaking being honoured."
"The EU will continue to follow the developments in this area."
"Respect for human rights and for the rights of minorities forms part of the EU’s fundamental values and is one of the objectives of the Union’s foreign and security policy."
"At present, Serbia and Montenegro have no contractual relationship with the European Union."
"In the coming months, the Commission will be drafting a feasibility report to find out whether it can advise the Council to open negotiations about a stabilisation and association agreement with Serbia and Montenegro."
". – I am very pleased that the European Council pays attention to this important question."
"It is important to emphasise that the safeguarding of minority and nationality rights is a fundamental condition to maintaining relations with the European Union and I am asking the Council to continue to pay serious attention to events in the same way and should any new event occur, then to take decisive action."
". Mr President, I am obliged to the honourable Member for his comment."
"As you know, our second report is not ready, but I can tell you that we are closely monitoring the situation."
"I would also draw your attention to the Council’s conclusions of 11 October, in which the Council welcomed Serbia’s pledges for a dialogue with all ethnic groups."
"To Mr Szent-Iványi and the President, I should like to add that I personally do have the impression that the situation has quietened down somewhat since the elections at the beginning of October."
"At the informal meeting of the Foreign Affairs Ministers of the European Union held in September 2004, an important decision was taken to adopt a twin-track approach in the Commission's feasibility study on Serbia and Montenegro with a view to opening negotiations for the conclusion of a European stabilisation and association agreement in accordance with the strategy adopted at the Thessaloniki European Council (June 2003)."
"However, setting the precondition of cooperating with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia creates the risk not only of a break-up of the federation but also the isolation of Serbia from the European Union despite the country's progress and the recent democratic presidential elections."
"In view of the fact that Serbia is part of the solution to the problem and that, by helping Serbia, the EU is promoting security and stability in the wider region, what action and what decisions will the Council take to overcome the latent crisis which, if it erupts, will soon lead the Balkans into a new cycle of instability and conflict."
". Mr President, thank you."
"At their informal meeting in early September, the EU’s Foreign Affairs Ministers adopted a twin-track approach with regard to Serbia and Montenegro which will entail one blanket stabilisation and association agreement with two differently negotiated protocols on trade, customs and other sectoral areas of policy, which clearly fall within the remit of the republics of Serbia and Montenegro."
"That was a positive gesture towards Serbia and Montenegro."
"At the same time, the Foreign Affairs Ministers decided in favour of enforcing political conditions, including compliance with all international obligations, including those in respect of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, or ICTY."
"The European Union would therefore ask all countries of the Western Balkans to cooperate with the ICTY as a token of their willingness to meet their international obligations and respect the principle of rule of law, the latter being one of the cornerstones on which the Union is founded in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union."
"The leaders of those countries have promised to cooperate with the ICTY on several occasions, including during the Forum of the Western Balkans on 9 December 2003, which brought the Foreign Affairs Ministers of the European Union and of the region together."
"Moreover, the competent political leaders in Serbia and Montenegro, including the Presidents of the Union of States and of the two republics, as well as the Foreign Affairs Minister of Serbia and Montenegro have clearly spoken in favour of cooperation with the ICTY."
"– Mr President, I thank the representative of the Dutch Presidency for his reply; however, I should like to point out that, in the western Balkans, we witness escalating tension and instability on a daily basis."
"We saw a few days ago during the elections in Kosovo that the Serb minority was absent."
"We have seen the present rampant crisis in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"I should like to ask the Dutch Presidency what it intends to do under these circumstances."
"We have the European strategy for the western Balkans."
"What is the Dutch Presidency going to do?"
"The problems are accumulating."
"I fear that a crisis is looming."
"I should like to ask the Dutch Presidency which directions it intends to move in over the next few months."
"."
"Mr President, I am grateful for the honourable Member’s comment, and I understand the concerns he is raising."
"With regard to those items, the Council is looking forward to the Commission’s feasibility study about opening negotiations for a possible stabilisation and association agreement with Serbia and Montenegro."
"As you know, and I will reiterate this point, cooperation with the ICTY is a central issue, and this study also focuses on it."
"It is something that will need to be monitored very carefully."
"I hope, however, that you will understand that I cannot anticipate the outcome of this feasibility study."
"As they deal with the same subject, Question Nos 3, 4 and 5 will be taken together:"
"In Turkey, hundreds of nationalist members of the paramilitary organisation the 'Grey Wolves' held a heated demonstration outside the Ecumenical Patriarchate, throwing stones and pieces of wood, after which they hanged and burned an effigy of a Greek priest."
"These events took place on the eve of the tragic anniversary of 6 September 1955 when a major pogrom was carried out against the Patriarchate and the Greeks of Istanbul."
"The Turkish police did, however, take the necessary measures to prevent the worst."
"What representations will the Council make to the Turkish Government to prevent the occurrence of similar events in the future?"
"Has the Turkish Government committed itself to the reopening of the Halki School of Theology?"
"What measures will the Council take to persuade the Turkish Government to recognise the legal personality of the Patriarchate and the rights associated with the management of its property?"
"Violations of the Christian minority's human rights persist."
"The rights of individuals freely to practise their religion and use their own language are, in practice, restricted."
"Old churches and monasteries fall into ruin or are deliberately destroyed."
"The Turkish authorities continue to deny the genocide of Armenians and Syrians at the beginning of the previous century."
"How does the Council intend to raise the question of the oppression of Armenians and Syrians in Turkey in its contacts with that country with its possible membership of the EU in view?"
"The protection of fundamental rights is a founding principle of the Union and an essential condition of its legitimacy."
"In external relations, respect for fundamental rights is a categorical condition of candidate countries' accession to the Union."
"In the light of Commissioner Verheugen's answer to my previous question, No E-3014/00(1), in which he stated that 'Respect for religious freedom is indeed one of the Copenhagen criteria that all candidate countries must fulfil before accession negotiations can get under way', will the Council say whether Turkey has complied with the criteria set out in Parliament's resolution P5_TA-PROV(2004)0274, with particular regard to the violations of the principle of religious freedom in Turkey (paragraph 36 of the resolution)?"
"Can the Council take a decision on a definite date for opening negotiations with Turkey before such violations, e.g. the failure to reopen the Halki School of Theology, have been eliminated and Turkey has also complied with the criteria set out in the memorandum of the Greek Orthodox, Syrian, Armenian and Roman Catholic churches submitted to the Human Rights Committee of the Turkish National Assembly?"
". Mr President, freedom of religion is one of the priority areas in the revised accession partnership for Turkey that was adopted by the Council on 15 May 2003."
"In line with that priority, Turkey must create conditions corresponding to those in the EU Member States, so as to ensure that non-Muslim religious communities can function."
"This also comprises the use of ownership rights in accordance with Protocol No 1 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"The Council is fully aware that non-Muslim religious communities, including the Ecumenical Patriarchate, continue to experience problems."
"Although some progress has been made in this area, various problems, particularly the problem of the legal position of non-Muslim religious communities and the registration of ownership, have not so far been resolved."
"Comprehensive new legislation is still being drafted."
"Meanwhile, the government is trying to find solutions to most of the critical problems."
"In this context, the situation concerning the reopening of the Halki School of Theology also remains shrouded in uncertainty for the time being."
"The Council is closely following developments with regard to freedom of religion in Turkey against the background of the Copenhagen political criteria for accession."
"The Union will continue to raise this issue with Turkey within the bodies of the association agreement and in the context of the political dialogue, as well as at any other suitable opportunity."
"It is, however, clear that preventing or handling specific incidents, such as the protests mentioned by the honourable Member, fall within the exclusive remit of the Turkish authorities."
"As the honourable Member knows, the Commission accepted its recommendations concerning Turkey’s progress on the road to accession on 6 October and has recommended opening negotiations with Turkey under certain conditions."
"In order to guarantee the permanence and irreversibility of the political criteria, the Commission would recommend a cooperation strategy in order to strengthen and support Turkey’s reform process, particularly with regard to the sustained compliance with the political criteria of Copenhagen."
"The pace of the reforms will determine progress during the negotiations."
"With specific reference to the Armenian and Syrian minorities, the report outlines an update of the situation, which is mainly reflected in the educational systems, schoolbooks and language teaching."
"– Mr President, I thank the representative of the Dutch Presidency."
"I have two questions."
"First, during all this discussion between the Commission and the Council and the Turkish authorities, have any specific commitments been made on the part of the Turkish authorities in order to meet these criteria?"
"Is there some sort of timetable?"
"Secondly, given that there has been a certain amount of tension in Greek airspace over the past few days, caused by Turkish fighter planes, does the Council intend to incorporate good neighbour requirements and non-provocation into the text to be adopted on 17 December?"
"Mr President, I also wish to thank the Council for its answer to the question."
"My follow-up question concerns the Turkish penal code which has, of course, recently been changed."
"A look at this new code reveals an Article 305 which still states that talking about the Armenian genocide in the media is a crime punishable by a prison sentence."
"This means, of course, that it is still directly prohibited to mention this historical fact, namely that hundreds of thousands of Armenians were murdered in the last century in what is now Turkey."
"Will the Council broach the subject of this Article 305 in its contacts with Turkey?"
"How do you view its content?"
"– Mr President, I am afraid that I too wish to repeat questions similar to those raised by my honourable friends."
"Essentially, my question is this: the Council representative has already told us that, basically, Turkey does not at present meet the Copenhagen criteria and Mr Verheugen also said as much in one of his replies."
"My question is this: can we start integration proceedings before the criteria have been met?"
"And, if we do, is there a specific timetable, as referred to by Mr Papadimoulis, whereby if the criteria are not met, integration proceedings are stopped?"
"That is what I want to know."
"Mr President, thank you. We, that is to say you and we, but also we among ourselves, will undoubtedly be discussing at great length the steps both in the run-up to December and thereafter, as regards the issue of whether or not to open negotiations with Turkey, when to do so, and in what way."
"Perhaps I can take the three questions together with the response to them."
"The Commission has indicated – and I agree with what you have said about this – that, where the political criteria are concerned, we still have a long way to go."
"The Commission has indicated, though, that a start could, under certain conditions, be made on negotiations with Turkey."
"One of those very conditions is the entry into effect of this criminal justice system which has, in fact, been enquired about in the way the Commission has indicated."
"What is very important – and it is clearly also important to you, to judge by your questions – is the fact that the Commission notes that once negotiations have started with Turkey, the political criteria will continue to be monitored very closely."
"In fact, at least that is what the Commission proposes, if disappointing developments were to be noted, for example in this very political area in which you are now expressing concerns, it should be possible to activate a so-called emergency break in the form of suspending further negotiations."
"That would be a new, more far-reaching step in the way we conduct accession processes compared to previous accession procedures."
"I am convinced that these proposals and suggestions on the part of the Commission can in any event set the right tone in order to accommodate the concerns that have been expressed here and also by others elsewhere, if we were to take a decision on this in December."
"What specific measures has the Council taken to help and support Bangladesh and the neighbouring regions affected by the recent flooding?"
"Bearing in mind the Netherlands' long experience in countering floodwater and the problems of being a low-lying country, what long-term help can the Council offer to this important region of the world?"
". Mr President, thank you."
"Can non-Dutch-speakers understand me too?"
"The Council wishes to inform the honourable Member of the fact that the European Union has reacted very promptly, and predominantly via Echo, to the recent flooding in Bangladesh and Northern Indian States of Assam and Bihar, and aid has been granted to the tune of EUR 4 million."
"The Council would ask her to approach the Commission, which will be able to provide her with extensive information about the topic, particularly in terms of technical and financial assistance."
"May I thank the Council for its very brief response, though I had been hoping for a little more."
"The floods in Bangladesh, and I have seen them, come nearly every year, but this year have caused some USD 2.2 billion damage."
"This is a huge amount of flood damage: the European Union has very kindly sent EUR 4 million in aid."
"I know that the Netherlands, with its long experience of beating back floodwaters at home, already supports considerable projects in Bangladesh, but I wonder what more can be done in the future."
"Some 36 million people have been flooded, which is more than the population of the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark and Ireland put together."
"Flooding in the Low Countries of Europe is not permitted to get out of hand: the Dutch Government has made great efforts to fight back."
"They do a great deal already in Bangladesh, but I wondered if we could know a bit more of what the plans are for the future."
". Mr President, I too should like to apologise for the confusion about the questioner."
"It is entirely clear to me now, although, if I may be so bold, I am a little less clear about for whom the question is intended."
"After all, President, I can add very little to what I said a moment ago, and I need to refer to the Commission for the factual information."
"On a slightly different note, the honourable Member pointed out that countries can, of course, develop activities in Bangladesh bilaterally, as they are doing, have done and will continue to do."
"Particular attention has been drawn to the Netherlands, which has experience in this area."
"It is true that we have developed activities in Bangladesh, partly based on Dutch expertise and experience of water."
"However, a number of other countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark, Ireland, Sweden, Italy, Belgium and France have also made contributions to Bangladesh bilaterally."
"In August of this year, a considerable number of complaints were made by travellers about corruption involving Romanian and Bulgarian border officials and about delays at the Turkish-Greek border."
"What does the Council intend to do to raise standards in this area as soon as possible?"
". Mr President, as far as Romania and Bulgaria are concerned, the Council would like to point out to the honourable Member that the accession negotiations with Bulgaria about Chapter 24, Justice and Home Affairs, were provisionally completed in October 2003 and that a supervisory process has been set in motion."
"Negotiations with Romania about Chapter 24 are still underway."
"In order to join the European Union, the Member States need to meet the criteria of Copenhagen in which, among others, reference is made to stable institutions that guarantee democracy, rule of law, human rights and respect for, and protection of, minorities."
"Given the importance that is attached to respect for the rule of law, it is obvious that the utmost importance is attached to effective, non-discriminatory law enforcement in Bulgaria and Romania, with efficient mechanisms for lodging complaints about corruption."
"Both countries need to accept, and implement, a timeframe for legislation, as well as other measures aimed at developing the institutional and operational capacity of the law enforcement bodies and the judiciary."
"Anti-corruption legislation forms part of this."
"To date, the Bulgarian and Romanian authorities have taken a number of specific anti-corruption measures, the implementation of which is being monitored by both the Council and the Commission, which will continue to monitor it until the date of entry."
"They will, in particular, be monitored by those bodies that have been established pursuant to the Europa Agreement, namely the Association Council, the Association Committee and the subcommittees."
"The future European agency for external border control that is expected to be operational by 1 May 2005 will draw up, and develop, a common core curriculum for training border patrols and will provide training at European level for instructors for the Member States’ national border patrols."
"Finally, in connection with the delays at the Turkish-Greek border, the Council would remind you of the decision of 29 April 2004 establishing minimum signposts at external border checkpoints."
"The use of these signposts is compulsory at airports."
"At checkpoints of their land and sea borders, Member States are entitled to guide the vehicles in separate lanes."
"These separate lanes are intended to simplify the control procedures and avoid unnecessary delays."
"This separation may also be deviated from when traffic flows at border checkpoints are temporarily disrupted."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to thank you for your detailed answer."
"I have just one additional question; you referred to monitoring, which, if I understood you correctly, will be carried out primarily by the Association Council."
"My question, prompted by specific inquiries from the people who live in my electoral district in Munich, is whether the public can address specific complaints relating to delays or corruption to the Council or the Association Council directly, and, if not, which body is responsible for accepting such complaints, which could subsequently be dealt with as part of the monitoring process?"
". Mr President, my concrete and direct response to a concrete question is to inform the honourable Member that in cases similar to those he describes, people can take their complaints to the Commission."
"Turkey is a member of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, a religious organisation for cooperation among the world's Muslim states."
"Is Turkish membership of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference politically compatible with membership of the secular European Union?"
". Mr President, thank you once again, and thank you for the question."
"As you know, it was during its meeting in Copenhagen in June 1993 that the European Council laid down the criteria for EU membership."
"They include, among other things, political criteria requiring a candidate Member State to possess stable institutions, guaranteeing, as I said a moment ago, democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for, and protection of, minorities."
"In December of this year, the European Council will, on the basis of the Commission’s report and recommendations of 6 October 2004, decide whether negotiations with Turkey can be opened."
"Further to Mr Papadimoulis’ previous question, we have already made reference to the Commission’s recommendations and the conditions under which it advises to open negotiations."
"I think I have already clarified this in a response to the three questions combined."
"Mr President, I should like to ask a question regarding the situation arising following the signing of the draft Constitutional Treaty this month by government representatives."
"During the debate on the Constitutional Treaty, there was much talk of how the European Union should retain its secular character, as well as a discussion concerning the preamble."
"Will Turkey’s membership in the Organisation of the Islamic Conference be compatible with talks on membership or future membership of the European Union?"
"Should the condition imposed during the debate on the Constitutional Treaty not also be put to the Turkish negotiators in a very specific manner?"
". Mr President, Turkey has rules and regulations laying down the separation of church and state, and the secular nature of the latter, more strictly than do some of the current Member States."
"That is, in principle, not what the objection is about and nor is it mentioned by the Commission as such."
"Of a somewhat different nature is the discussion we just had, namely where practice is concerned, the situation and religious freedom, and problems, some of which have, further to your questions, just been discussed."
"The Commission will study this very closely and carefully, and, in this respect, if it is decided to open negotiations, those points will continue to be monitored very closely after these negotiations have started."
"I was quite alarmed by the implications of this question and, indeed, by the contribution we heard from the other side of the House."
"The honourable Member mentioned protecting the secular character of the European Union, and, in its response, the Council referred to the position in Turkey, where there is a separation of church and state."
"Nothing could further emphasise the European Union's determination to commit itself to being fully secular in nature than the accession of Turkey, a large country with a large number of Muslim people."
"Yes, Turkey presents challenges for the European Union."
"Yes, there are issues to be answered on human rights and a whole range of other aspects."
"But I do not believe that religion should be part of this."
"I, for one, welcome Turkey's accession to the European Union in the course of time."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you said that this issue is dealt with better in Turkey’s legislation than in that of some Member States."
"Firstly, I should be interested to know which Member States you have in mind."
"Secondly, I should like to ask what you mean by this statement; that religious communities have no legal status in Turkey, or that Islam, the majority religion, is organised in Turkey by the state, or that no head coverings may be worn for religious reasons?"
"What did you mean to say was better regulated in Turkey?"
". Mr President, as far as the last question is concerned, I indicated that, as I read the Commission’s comments and verdict, the formal separation of church and state is not the issue."
"What the discussion is about, as it was in the past and will be in future, is the factual implementation of church and state separation, in other words freedom of religion as one of the points which is, and will continue to be, closely monitored, where the developments in Turkey are concerned."
"In reaction to the comments – for I do not think it was a question by Mr Evans – I should like to state quite categorically that the position of the presidency in terms of religion as criterion to join, is not at issue."
"Religion does not form part of the Copenhagen criteria or, for that matter, of the political criteria."
"I want to make a point of stating this here emphatically."
"On the eve of, and after, the football match between the European Champions, Greece, and Albania in Tirana on 4 September 2004, Fatos Nano, the Prime Minister of Albania, made unprecedented remarks stoking fanaticism and influencing passions among Greeks and Albanians, while on 9 September he condemned Greeks for their 'racism and xenophobia'. These remarks were made despite the fact that it is well known that at least 1.5 million Albanians have arrived in Greece (legally or illegally), live and work in that country and send valuable foreign exchange back home to Albania."
"In the meantime, members of the Greek ethnic minority in Dervitsani in Northern Epirus have complained that their houses were fired at by Albanians after the end of the football game in question and for days afterwards."
"Is Mr Nano's behaviour that of a democratic leader of a democratic country which seeks closer ties with, and economic aid from, the EU?"
". Mr President, thank you."
"The Council would remind the honourable Member of the statements about Albania made by the Presidency on behalf of the European Union on 14 September 2004, and the Council would emphasise that it never comments on public statements such as those to which this question refers."
"Thank you."
"A military exercise under the name of Majestic Eagle 04 took place from 11 to 16 July some 100 miles north of the Canary Islands and east of Madeira, in which warships from several EU Member States took part."
"As on previous occasions, the use of low-frequency sonar resulted in beaked whales being stranded."
"Does the Council intend, with regard to the development of a European security and defence policy, to take into account the negative impact of the use of low-frequency sonar systems on beaked whales that find themselves in waters near the Union's exclusive economic zone?"
". Mr President, the exercise was carried out between 11 and 16 July 2004."
"It should be noted that the European Union, in the context of the ESDP, does not carry out field exercises, that is to say exercises involving the deployment of troops, such as those mentioned in the honourable Member’s question."
"Exercises of this type, involving the deployment of national or multinational troops, continue to be the Member States’ exclusive responsibility."
"As for the environmental effect of low-frequency sonar at sea, the Council is aware of the current studies into the possibility that whales, dolphins or other sea animals would sustain injuries, become deaf or lose their sense of direction as a result."
"While the European Union has certain obligations at international level, in relation to the Directive on natural habitats, for example, I recognise that issues relating to military manoeuvres fall within national competence."
"However, we are talking about an area in which we are currently developing a common foreign and security policy."
"My concern is that the United States’ courts are currently preventing this type of manoeuvre from being carried out close to the coasts of the United States, which implies that military manoeuvres, mainly carried out by the United States, are being diverted to the coasts of the European Union."
"My supplementary question is whether the President-in-Office of the Council believes that, from the Council’s point of view and within the context of cooperation in the common foreign and security policy, we should begin to adopt a position, at least by means of recommendations, with a view to preventing the United States from exporting this pollution to waters close to the European Union."
". Thank you for the question."
"Unfortunately, there is very little I can add to what has been said here on this subject in the first instance, because formally, this is not a matter for the Council, or for the Presidency."
"The European Union does not carry out the field exercises about which the questioner is concerned, but let me add that I do take those concerns seriously."
"I already mentioned the current investigations we have mounted, and the involvement and interest we are displaying in this connection."
"What I say is that we will continue to monitor the developments and investigations."
"In various euro zone countries, a debate is in progress on the usefulness of the smallest euro coins (one and two cent)."
"In the Netherlands and Finland, prices have already been rounded to the nearest five cents."
"In Belgium, the Minister for Finance is proposing to stop minting the smallest coins as from next year."
"A wide variety of studies have been commissioned: on the one hand, consumers are dissatisfied; on the other, business and manufacturers think that minting the coins is much too expensive."
"There are bound to be arguments in favour of the continued existence of the coins, and against, which need to be taken into consideration."
"There are bound to be benefits in terms of price stability, while costs for manufacturers, business and banks may be a drawback."
"Of course, the EU may allow any Member State to act on its own initiative, which is what is happening now. Is that what the EU wants, however?"
"Does the European Council not think that it is somewhat premature for an irreversible decision? Would it not be preferable to wait, for instance, until euro coins have been in circulation for five years?"
"What is the Council's position on price rounding?"
"Does the Council think that a Member State should simply be able to decide, on its own initiative, to stop minting small coins?"
"As any decision to scrap coins is a matter for the European finance ministers, what is the Council's position?"
"Although, to the best of my knowledge, no Member State is calling for them to be scrapped, will the Dutch Presidency be calling for a clear decision from the European finance ministers or will each Member State be simply allowed to continue to muddle through?"
". Mr President, thank you."
"Neither the European Council nor the Council have taken up a position with regard to the matters raised by the honourable Member, since these fall within the remit of the Member States, as do the ones I mentioned earlier."
"Article 106 of the Treaty clearly defines the respective powers of the European Central Bank and the Member States with regard to the issue of euro notes and coins."
"Paragraph 1 stipulates that the ECB has the exclusive right to authorise the issue of bank notes."
"The notes are issued by the ECB and the national central banks."
"Paragraph 2 specifies that Member States can issue coins on two conditions."
"First of all, the ECB must approve the level of the issue and secondly, the issued coins must meet any other legislative measures that harmonise their nominal values and technical specifications."
"Council Regulation No 975/98/EC determines the nominal values and technical specifications of the coins that can be issued by the Member States."
"It is up to the Member States to decide, within this framework, on the volume of coins they want to issue at which nominal value, with the European Central Bank’s approval being required for every issue."
"Mr President, thank you."
"I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his response."
"Obviously, I too know that this falls within the remit of the Member States."
"Nevertheless, in my view – and I think, in the view of the public and of a number of consumer organisations, if in the euro zone and in the different Member States, different positions are taken up as regards whether or not to continue issuing certain small euro cent coins, or whether or not to round up prices, it is then difficult to still talk about a price policy or financial policy in the euro zone."
"I would therefore like to ask the President-in-Office whether this might after all be submitted for discussion by the Council of Finance Ministers."
". I very much understand the honourable Member’s concern and the question, but as I just indicated in the first instance, this does not fall within the remit and scope of the Presidency or of the Council."
"That being so, I have to disappoint her, because I cannot promise her that I want to table this for discussion."
"This is, first of all, related to the formal positions, but also politically speaking, we in the Presidency do not feel it incumbent upon ourselves to put the important principle of subsidiarity, whereby not everything is always decided upon at this level but also at national level, on the agenda in this way."
"Will the Council state what initiatives it has pursued in the past, or intends to pursue in the future, with a view to strengthening cooperation between police agencies and the various coastguard services in the Member States so as to prevent the importation of illegal drugs, including synthetic drugs?"
". Mr President, thank you."
"For years, the Member States’ various competent law enforcement bodies, including police, customs and coast guards, have made every effort to prevent the import of illegal drugs into the territory of the Member States."
"It is of the utmost importance for those substances to be prevented from reaching the territory of the Member States."
"The framework decision concerning the illegal drugs trade, which will be formally adopted by the Council before long, gives the law enforcement bodies in the Member States the space they need to act effectively against the import of illegal drugs and against a whole catalogue of offences."
"In this connection, the EU’s drugs strategy should be mentioned; it is, as you know, the subject of discussion in the Council at present."
"There is agreement about the priority that is given to the implementation of existing European legal instruments where the fight against the drugs trade is central, such as the European Convention on Mutual Legal Aid in Criminal Matters, which provides for the setting-up of joint investigation teams."
"On 2 June 2004, the Commission published a communication about the reinforcement of police and customs cooperation in the European Union."
"The Council’s response is included in the draft of a multi-annual programme for the area of freedom, security and justice, the so-called The Hague programme, which will be adopted by the European Council on 5 November 2004."
"Over the course of certainly ten years, the customs authorities in the Member States have organised joint operations every year in order to examine the smuggling of drugs, including Ecstasy, by air, land and sea."
"An operation focussing on the smuggling of Ecstasy by air is planned for the near future, and over 20 Member States are set to take part in it."
"I thank the President-in-Office for his reply."
"I am delighted to hear that new initiatives are being undertaken in this area, because it is a growing problem."
"I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council about the presidency's position on tackling the smuggling of Ecstasy, since it can be made in someone's kitchen and does not need to be transported across borders; whereas heroin, opium and cocaine involve importation."
"I should also like to ask about the Council's position on LSD and other illegal narcotics."
"Most synthetic drugs can be produced locally."
"Although some of the ingredients might have to be imported, that can be done legitimately and they are then put to illegal use."
"Perhaps the emphasis could be shifted from Ecstasy smuggling to the major problems of smuggling from areas such as the triangle around Afghanistan, and via shipping routes."
"I would agree with Mr Crowley, but differ slightly on the matter of Ecstasy smuggling."
"This is a major problem for London, the area I represent, where there is a lot of Ecstasy smuggling."
"My question to the President-in-Office, though, relates to the EU drugs strategy within the framework of justice and home affairs, which the Dutch presidency has prioritised."
"A drugs strategy report has begun its progress through Parliament."
"Given the experience of the Dutch with regard to drugs prevention and drugs policy, what does the presidency propose to do to combat drug smuggling?"
"The question is about strengthening cooperation between police agencies and coastguard services."
"After 9/11 in the United States, the Americans discovered there was a lack of cooperation between the FBI and the CIA."
"What is the presidency doing, or what proposals does it have, to improve the quality of between different agencies within Member States and across borders?"
"As the President–in–Office knows well – although I do not think he is listening to me – the problem is trust between the agencies."
"We do not trust each other, and therefore there is no cooperation."
"President–in–Office, what are you proposing to do about improving trust between these agencies?"
". Mr President, thank you."
"With regard to the last question, as you know, there are far-reaching plans to improve cooperation and the exchange of information within the European Union, but the questioner was right to point out the major importance of improving cooperation with bodies outside the European Union too."
"Those contacts have been made, improvements are being carried out, and the honourable Member was right to mention cooperation with the United States."
"Mr Crowley was right to point out that, where the major and, indeed, increasing problem of Ecstasy consumption is concerned, it is not only a question of smuggling from outside the European Union, but also of what is happening in the European Union itself."
"Logically, my initial response dealt with the external dimension of this discussion, but you are right that high priority should also be given to this problem internally, that is, within the European and national borders."
"This does not detract from the fact that, of course, cooperation within the European Union is first and foremost aimed at the cross-border issue and it is, in fact – at least that is how I understand his comment – also an appeal to national governments to shoulder their responsibilities in this area."
"The drugs strategy has been mentioned and questions have been asked about it."
"As it is currently the subject of discussion in the Justice and Home Affairs Council, I am unable to respond to the question about the content of this drugs strategy and the priorities which we are setting in this respect."
"What I can say is that the Dutch Presidency is hoping to take a decision on this subject in December’s European Council."
"This being the case, the European Parliament can find out about our objectives and priorities for the European drugs strategy before then."
"The World Bank and the IMF have been involved in helping to mobilise the resources required if the developing countries are to meet the Millennium Development Goals agreed by the international community in 2000."
"They agree that prudent debt write-off is useful and necessary if certain countries are to reach the agreed development goals, but they have reservations about 100% debt relief."
"They have mobilised more than USD 53 million in debt-service relief."
"What is the Council doing to tackle the debt burden of poor countries? Does it consider that it would be useful for the European Commission to establish a Debt Department along the lines of the one established recently by the World Bank?"
". Mr President, one of the most important elements of the millennium objective for development, which consists of setting up a worldwide partnership for development, is permanent debt relief."
"As well as national and international measures, a broad solution should be found for the debt problem of the developing countries so as to make debts bearable in the long term."
"In accordance with the consensus of Monterrey, which was approved by the Heads of State or Government of the members of the United Nations in March 2002, the EU recognises that permanent debt funding is of the essence for freeing up resources for private and public investments, and that the relief of foreign debt can play a crucial role when resources are freed up for activities that promote sustainable growth and development."
"Achieving the millennium objectives for development is a core objective of the European Union and, in broader terms, of the international communities."
"The commitments into which the EU Member States entered at the Monterrey Conference reflect the Union’s leading role in international efforts to accomplish the millennium objectives and should find expression in the full range of the EU’s policy measures and in its decisions concerning the allocation of financial resources."
"In its conclusions of 14 November 2002, the Council confirmed its willingness to, and I quote ‘continue its efforts to restore the sustainability of debts in the context of the strengthened Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, so that the developing countries, particularly the poorest among them, can continue to pursue growth and development without being hindered by the burden of unsustainable debts’."
"The EU is also looking into the possibility of taking the present HIPC initiative one step further."
"During the high-level dialogue on development funding, which was held in New York in October 2003 in the framework of the 58th UN General Assembly, the EU urged all donor and creditor countries which had not done so, to take on their share of bilateral debt relief and to contribute to the multilateral funding of the HIPC initiative."
"The EU also emphasised that it is of great importance for the IMF and the World Bank to issue regular reports on whether their Member States meet their HIPC obligations, in particular with regard to Article 4 on control."
"It was also mooted that during the official bilateral debt rearrangement in the Club of Paris, consideration should also be given to debtor countries which meet their HIPC obligations as creditors."
"During the dialogue, the EU also declared itself prepared to talk with the international financial institutions and the other donors about possible changes to the way the requirements of additional debt relief, or topping up, are calculated at the end, on behalf of those HIPC countries whose debt burden is considered untenable at that time due to serious exogenous shocks."
"It also showed willing to study ways in which the financial gap can be plugged and at the same time to bring about a fair reduction in the burden."
"According to the EU, HIPC countries, as well as donor and creditor countries, are all responsible for permanent debt relief in the long term."
"The question whether it would be a useful initiative on the part of the European Commission to set up a debt department, as the World Bank did recently, does not fall within my remit, as you will understand, but within that of the Commission."
"Thank you for your answer."
"I have to say that I am slightly disappointed because I have not heard any real proposal."
"A lot of people are talking about this, but very little gets done."
"This issue is of enormous importance and the Commission should have come forward with more concrete ideas, rather than referring to various proposals that have already been made by other people."
"I am disappointed with the answer to the question."
". Mr President, I do apologise."
"I fear, moreover, that I cannot totally allay the disillusionment or disappointment. In my first speech, I did attempt to indicate specifically the Council’s concern and involvement in this, together with the political weight and priority we attach to it, with regard to the very concrete organisation and aspects which the honourable Member mentioned."
"For this I would refer to the Commission once again, as indeed he did himself in his more detailed question."
"We are now coming to the end of the scheduled time for Question Time. I see that there are at least three more Members who are due to ask the next three questions."
"I shall ask the Council if they can stay here for a little longer to answer one or two more questions."
"In that case, Question Time is closed."
"I apologise to Mr Newton Dunn, Mr Moraes and Mrs Malmström, whom I can see are present in this House, but the Council has notified us that they have pressing commitments and cannot stay any longer."
"Mr President, I should just like to point out that the clock says it is 6.56 p.m."
"The agenda says Question Time finishes at 7 p.m."
"Therefore, surely, Question Time cannot be closed?"
"As the time allotted to Question Time has elapsed, Question Nos 14 to 33 will be answered in writing(2), except Question No 18, which has been withdrawn by the questioner."
"Question Time is closed."
"– Mr President, number 20, which is the fourth question in line, is my question. I think I am the last."
"Given the earlier procedure and what you too have said, could you perhaps allow a minor extension of 2 to 3 minutes for my question?"
"Thank you for your understanding."
"As I said, Question Time is closed, as the Council has to leave."
"((1)"
"Mr President, as chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I should like it confirmed – for the record – that all the letters of assessment on the Commissioners–designate have been forwarded to Mr Barroso, President–designate of the Commission."
"Mr Chichester, I note your request."
"You will certainly be given an appropriate confirmation."
"Mr President, last Sunday, speaking to my country’s top newspaper, Mrs Loyola de Palacio stated that Spain was losing weight in the European Union and becoming an appendage of France and Germany."
"We have said in this House over recent days that everybody has the right to think and express their opinions, whatever they may be, but when that opinion clashes with the responsibilities of a Vice-President of the Commission, calling into question three States of the Union, we believe that is very serious."
"Since we believe it to be an insult to my country, Spain, and probably to two other countries of the Union, I would call on the Vice-President of the Commission for a specific rectification and on acting-President Prodi to intervene."
"Mr Martínez, as you yourself have mentioned, the predominant responsibility for reacting to this issue lies with Mr Prodi and the Commission and I have no doubt that appropriate reactions will be given, in accordance with the political sensibilities of those primarily involved."
"The next item is oral question B6-0019/04 by Mrs Záborská, on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, to the Commission, on women and poverty."
", . Mr President, Madam Commissioner, on Sunday 17 October the international community observed the International Day for the Elimination of Poverty, in order to draw attention to poverty as a violation of human rights."
"We are endeavouring to eliminate poverty, but, if we are to succeed in this, society must redouble its efforts."
"It must take as its starting-point the experiences of those who actually live in poverty, and of the families that reject poverty and do everything to ensure a better future for their children."
"Such people are a lasting testimony to the idea that wherever there are women, children and men condemned to a life of poverty, their human rights are violated."
"It is our fundamental duty to unite in order to ensure that these rights are respected throughout the European Union."
"On 17 October 1987, in response to the call of Father Jozef Brezinsky, 100 000 defenders of human rights gathered in rue Trocadero in Paris to pay their respects to the victims of hunger, violence and ignorance."
"They demonstrated their opposition to poverty and called on the human race to unite in order to ensure respect for human rights."
"The European Parliament subsequently adopted this position in its annual reports on basic human rights in the European Union."
"In 1996, in the same spirit, the United Nations launched its first Decade for the Elimination of World Poverty."
"Through the Lisbon Agenda the European Union also became active in this area."
"Allow me to mention two important points that relate to this problem."
"The first is the adoption of a position on participation."
"It is important for the poorest members of society to participate directly in the planning, implementation and evaluation of programmes and strategies."
"The World Bank, for example, has adopted precisely this type of participatory approach in the fight against poverty."
"As far as the European institutions are concerned, there should be much more determination and conviction, as well as the appropriate instruments, if they are to be able to act effectively."
"In spite of the finest resolutions, European Community policy has not been sufficiently successful in dealing with the feminisation of poverty."
"Programmes to counter social exclusion often lack specific measures aimed at women."
"I am thinking, above all, of single mothers, widows, handicapped women and pensioners, women who have become dependent on others, and also of women who suffer sexual discrimination within their ethnic group or other minority."
"In short the European project has failed to create equal opportunities."
"I am, however, filled with pride when I see women taking on important responsibilities with respect to inter-generational solidarity within the framework of the family."
"I am convinced that each and every woman can have a positive influence on the ways in which society is organised and its structure is shaped."
"Since all women support basic human values like truth and justice, love and freedom, they should be supported in the fostering and propagation of these values in their family and professional lives."
"I would like to pay special homage to those who live far from their homes or in difficult conditions, but who manage to overcome their suffering and exhaustion in order to help their nearest and dearest."
"In this respect I utterly condemn those people traffickers who exploit vulnerable women and children like these."
"The second important aspect is the Internal Stability Pact."
"It is generally recognised that poverty is a real test for democratic systems."
"In spite of this, the European Union heads of state and their governments have refused to recognise the elimination of poverty as one of the aims of the European Union in the draft Constitutional Agreement."
"Many have already heard of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"On 17 October I would like to introduce another kind of stability pact, an internal stability pact, which would give women and impoverished families more self-esteem and dignity, a pact that would open the doors of society to women and the poor."
"We should support this pact for internal stability within an enlarged Europe and eliminate poverty, thereby promoting solidarity between generations, outlawing discrimination, and encouraging equality of opportunity and constructive dialogue, so that together we can build a genuine partnership with the weakest members of society."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Záborská and the members of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality for tackling this extremely important issue."
"Thank you also, Mrs Záborská, for your passionate speech."
"I cannot, however, go along with your general assertion that the European Union has failed to bring about equality."
"From the very beginning of the European Union, equality of opportunity has had a major role both in the Treaty and in legislation, and much has been achieved."
"It is true, though, that poverty, and consequently social exclusion, are more of a threat to women, including those in Europe’s Member States – whether in or out of work, whether young or old – than to men."
"Very many women have no secure income of their own and are financially dependent on their families or obliged to rely on minimal incomes."
"Many women of pensionable age have an inadequate pension or none at all, whether because they have never worked, have stopped working, have been obliged to stop working, or were employed part-time."
"What is especially alarming is that, where families are in poverty, the burden falls to a disproportionate extent on women."
"There are two causes underlying this: one is the gender-specific aspects of working life and the other is the gender-specific division of labour in families."
"Single-parent families, most of which, as you have said, consist of women with children, very often find themselves in financial need, and we should have particular respect for women bringing up children on their own."
"The adverse effects are compounded in the case of women belonging to at-risk or excluded groups such as immigrants, ethnic minorities or the disabled."
"Such women are very often the victims of multiple discrimination, something that has ceased to be acceptable, and this is where our campaign against poverty and social exclusion must start."
"The efforts of the actors at European and national level to combat poverty among women and what you have termed the feminisation of poverty may be observed in the context of the open method of coordination in the field of social inclusion."
"Even though primary responsibility for this still lies with the Member States, the European Commission and the Social Protection Committee have an important part to play in effectively implementing the principle of gender mainstreaming."
"Among the shared goals underpinning the process is gender balance, which is to be taken fully into account when drawing up action plans at national level."
"Such plans should also provide for measures geared to the specific needs of women, with the Member States being required to ensure the involvement of non-governmental organisations dealing with women’s specific needs in the development, follow-up and evaluation of the national action plans."
"Along with the open method of coordination in the spheres of poverty and exclusion, there is to be a Community action programme running until the end of 2006, and cooperation between the Member States in combating social exclusion is also to be supported."
"It is worth mentioning that one criterion for the granting of financial aid – in the Structural Funds, for example – is the promotion of gender equality."
"As has already been mentioned, the Commission is aware that it is women in particular who are at risk of poverty when they reach retirement age."
"It is in relation to this that the open coordination method has also been applied to such issues as the adequacy of pensions and the financial sustainability of pension systems."
"A series of initiatives taken at EU level over recent years have helped to give practical expression to the concerns raised by your House in its 1994 resolution on women’s poverty in Europe."
"These include, for example, not only the measures under the open method of coordination, but also the reversal of the burden of proof in legislation on gender equality and the latest directive based on Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the European Communities."
"Gender mainstreaming has been included in the European employment strategy, and reform of the Structural Funds involves giving them an even stronger gender equality dimension."
"I am sure we are all agreed that reliable and specific data are needed if strategies are to be effective and focussed."
"Data, broken down by gender, are of crucial importance in combating poverty and social exclusion; without them, indicators cannot be watertight."
"The open method of coordination in relation to social exclusion uses a number of common indicators, supplemented by national data, as a framework for exchange and analysis."
"The breakdown of all indicators by gender is standard; they must also be divided up by reference to age in order to take special account of children and child poverty."
"The Commission regularly publishes quantitative information on poverty and social exclusion, and this is broken down by gender and age."
"I can assure you that the Commission is aware of the problems of women in poverty."
"It is also aware that poverty is one of the principal reasons and causes underlying the trafficking in women and other forms of sexual exploitation."
"I would like to press home the point that none of us – the European institutions, the Member States or society – can tolerate women falling victim to exploitation, whether this be sexual or takes some other form."
"We must continue to act decisively and make further effort to combat the causes that exist."
"We must ensure that more economic possibilities are open to women, that they gain greater economic independence and full access to economic resources, to support and assistance and to education."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I was in Geneva, Switzerland, last Wednesday in order to attend an event, when I noticed a huge billboard advertising the fact that there is poverty in society."
"It particularly caught my attention and I automatically thought that such a billboard would not be out of place in our societies, in the European Union."
"Unfortunately, we all need to realise this, even we who are responsible for policy-making and come into daily contact with reality, because it is something which offends our democracy and brings the effectiveness of our policies into question."
"The statistics we have at our disposal are both revealing and worrying."
"An average of 15% in the European Union of the 15 at least, in the old European Union; anyway, the problem is chronic in most countries."
"Nor is the situation uniform and this is something which we should pay particular attention to, in order to find out why the situation is better in some places than others and what good results are being achieved."
"From Sweden to Ireland and from the countries of the south to the new Member States, the situation is very serious everywhere for certain groups, such as the unemployed, single parents, the elderly living alone and families with large numbers of children and women are in the majority in all these groups."
"The citizens of the European Union – and women especially – have extremely acute concerns and demands, as we all saw during the European elections."
"That time is still very close."
"The debate on the Constitution will focus on these issues, if my experience is anything to go by."
"Let us all be prepared for that; we need to prepare not only our responses to the dialogue, but also our policies, at both European and national level."
"The debate on the financial perspectives for 2007-2013, the new regulation on the Structural Funds and next year's budget give us ample opportunity to turn our attention to these matters."
"However, it is not only the financial resources which we provide for employment and social support policies that count."
"A better qualitative approach to the evaluation of our policies is needed."
"We need to see if the money we provide is having an effect, at least in accordance with our wishes and calculations."
"Are the European Commission and the Council (which is absent today, as usual during such debates) satisfied with the evaluation being made of the national action plans on employment, the national action plans for social integration, the results of coordination, to which you referred, Commissioner?"
"Are they getting to the root of the problems and the results?"
"Has the gender dimension been substantively integrated?"
"The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality has insisted many times and has made numerous recommendations on efficient and substantive gender integration."
"However, for this special studies and research are needed, statistics need to be collated by category and, as you mentioned Commissioner, indicators are needed. We also need, of course, to look at all the statistics we collate at a harmonised level, because the statistics of certain Member States of the European Union are not harmonised."
"Harmonisation is necessary if we are to be able to collate real data and have comparative tables which will allow us to make better use of our policies of exchanging best practices."
"I believe that this is vital, not only to our cohesion in the Europe of the 25, but also to preparations for a new enlargement and to the success of the objectives of development aid in our foreign relations."
"Mr President, Commissioner, you have depicted for us the situation ten years on from this House’s adoption of the report on combating poverty among women in Europe, and have taken stock of it; I have to say that we have achieved a fair bit, and a lot has happened in Europe."
"One might say that, at the Beijing World Conference on Women, Europe stood out as a beacon of women’s rights."
"We have always spearheaded them, and thus it is particularly painful that we have been unable to bring about any decisive reduction in the gap between the poor and the well-off in Europe."
"I see poverty as having a woman’s face, and the facts make it apparent to all that there is still much to do to change that situation."
"Women still make up the majority in the groups at risk: the long-term unemployed, the lone parents and the impoverished elderly."
"It is particularly painful and tragic that children are at particularly high risk of poverty in our prosperous society, and let me just say that I was therefore particularly outraged by Mr Buttiglione’s discriminatory remarks about mothers who bring up children on their own."
"That is something we must not put up with nor allow to go unchallenged."
"It is in education that the gender gap becomes glaringly apparent."
"A reading of UNESCO’s figures reveals that the lack of education is one of the key factors forcing women into poverty."
"Another factor in Europe is that we women are employed under insecure conditions; there is also the exceptionally high incidence of violence in these social groups."
"Maternal mortality is on the rise, and the lives of women living in poverty are at particular risk."
"Women are also especially hard hit by the epidemic of HIV and Aids, currently representing the majority of those newly infected worldwide."
"All these aspects we have to take into account and redouble our efforts to deal with them."
"The economic losses resulting from them are enormous, and so, when implementing the Lisbon strategy, and on the points to which the Commissioner referred, we should really press the point home that the key element underpinning the European social model is, in the final analysis, women’s development and support for them, and that we in Europe really do have the most generous resources for further empowering women and thereby making European society more human."
"We on the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality demand that these points be incorporated in future major projects on the European social model, in the Progress programme, in the Structural Funds and in the new employment guidelines."
"The Constitutional Treaty provides us with good instruments for this purpose; let us make it come alive and, by means of gender mainstreaming, give women pride of place in our deliberations."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Schreyer, we do not have to be told that there is a very great deal of poverty in the world."
"Nor do we have to be told that women are hit harder by poverty than men."
"For many years, we have talked about development, aid and solidarity, but in practice far too little money has been made available."
"We in the rich part of the world have, however, obtained large amounts of money at the expense of poor people far away."
"This applies above all to the EU, to which I am nonetheless thoroughly proud to belong."
"Poverty both within and outside the EU hits women harder than men."
"In and outside Europe, poverty is particularly widespread among women living in the countryside."
"When people can produce their own food, they have made at least a little progress in the fight against poverty."
"How can we in Europe help women in the very poorest countries?"
"For me, the answer is simple."
"A large proportion of the world’s farmers are, in actual fact, women, and the EU has a crucial role to play regarding the developing countries’ food supply."
"Our agricultural policy with its subsidies, including export subsidies, is a direct impediment to families in developing countries being able to produce food to sell and being able to export products to our part of the world."
"Through our policy, we are excluding them."
"By subsidising our own producers, we are dumping the prices on their market."
"Our agricultural policy is a disgrace to the EU."
"As you know, the responsibility does not lie with this House."
"It is no secret that Europe’s Heads of State or Government bear responsibility for the fact that approximately half of the EU budget helps make the world’s poor still poorer."
"This reverse aid policy must be brought to an end."
"Yesterday, Commission President-designate Barroso received a rebuff."
"The fact that, here in Parliament, we succeeded in getting our act together and clearly emphasising that we did not accept a Commission based on homophobia and misogyny is a great victory."
"We in Parliament have the opportunity to do much more."
"Hopefully, we shall also be able to do away with the shameful agricultural policy."
"Only then shall we be able to say that the European Union is doing something to combat poverty."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, poverty has a face; we have already seen that it is that of a woman."
"Poverty hits single parents, above all women with children, especially hard."
"Our society may well talk about children being its wealth, but the end result is poverty for the people who have many of them."
"This is indeed scandalous, and I believe that the Commission, in the Lisbon process and elsewhere, must do much more."
"There is a need for more employment for women, and it must be one of the EU’s most especial concerns to do more about childcare, in order to improve the situation as regards education and childcare."
"We know too that older women are particularly affected."
"The removal of discrimination against women in private pension provision represented one small step in the right direction, but, here too, there still remains much more to be done."
"There are far too few indicators at European level to facilitate progress in the battle against poverty among women, and too little account is taken of the issue when making policy."
"The Commission needs to take another great leap forward in order that more account may be taken of women’s issues, of equality for women, in the EU’s policy areas."
"There are too few statistics to really back that up."
"I hope that the Commission will keep to its timetable for the Gender Institute and that there will be no further delays."
"As the Council has emphasised, we need the Gender Institute, not only to collate these statistics, but also, perhaps, to derive conclusions from them."
"Let me finally mention one point that has not been made so far, namely women and the environment."
"We know that the destruction of the environment increases the risk of poverty, particularly in what we call the Third World."
"It follows that sustainable development must continue to be at the top of the list of priorities on the agenda."
"Mr President, as speakers in the debate in this House have pointed out, poverty is increasing within the EU."
"Is that not reason enough for abandoning the neo-liberal economic policy with its Stability and Growth Pact and convergence rules?"
"This policy has, of course, proved not to lead to equality or reduced poverty. On the contrary."
"Patriarchal power structures permeate the whole of our society, in both the Member States and, above all, in the European Union."
"Gender equality is definitely not a feature of the EU’s economic policy which is, in large part, designed by and for men."
"Gender equality is a feature neither of economics, politics, education nor health care."
"Nor is poverty characterised by gender equality."
"Women are hit hardest and are most exposed to poverty and to the consequences of living in poverty."
"I have to acknowledge that it is sometimes quite wearying year after year to hear people in power coming out with fine words about, for example, objectives in terms of gender equality and of reduced poverty for women and, at the same time, to know that extremely little is happening in terms of practical action."
"Female poverty is not a law of nature."
"Nor should it be."
"With the right political and economic decisions, this state of affairs can be changed."
"I also want to ask why the principle of ‘gender mainstreaming’ has still not been implemented."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the EU’s enlargement there was a significant rise in the number of people living in poverty."
"Statistics show that of the EU’s 450 million inhabitants, over 65 million suffer from poverty or even live in destitution that is an affront to their human dignity."
"In the countries that recently joined the European Union, the problem has been particularly exacerbated by a drop in production, an increase in the level of unemployment and the economic expansion of rich countries."
"This is especially true of my homeland, Poland."
"In my opinion, enlargement of the EU cannot be said to be a success if it is occurring at the cost of great suffering, distress and injustice, along with a widening of the gap between the rich and the poor."
"When poverty turns into destitution, it becomes a threat to peace."
"As the Holy Father John Paul II reminds us, ‘if you want peace, reach out to the poor’."
"Poor countries are not only up against the problem of debt."
"They have to face many other disturbing problems including lack of access to education and health care, mental disorders, depression, suicide, addiction, various diseases, the forced prostitution of women and children and even human trafficking."
"They also have to deal with the problem of migration and the threat it poses to the stability of the family, or in other words to that of the whole of society."
"Stressful working conditions and the exploitation of workers mean that the future appears ever more uncertain."
"The impact of poverty is felt most by those who live in rural areas, by the unemployed, disabled people and invalids, the majority of whom are children and women."
"These latter should be afforded special protection, as they are responsible for raising the next generation."
"It is women, weighed down not only by housework but also by paid employment, who shoulder the enormous burden imposed by the effects of the transformation process, and this holds true for my country as well."
"Ever-increasing numbers of people in Poland are affected by poverty."
"On a global scale, women carry out two thirds of all work, but are said to receive less than 5% of global income, and own less than 1% of global property."
"Thought should therefore be given to whether the illusory and superficial increase in the percentage of women in governing bodies can compensate for these injustices."
"It is important to consider whether the Community’s key watchwords of democracy, equal rights and equal opportunities should not be replaced by respect for moral principles and changes to economic mechanisms to guarantee a more equal division of property."
"Concrete measures to provide active help and care for those who need it are probably called for."
"Dealing with the issue in a mature way means adopting an in-depth approach."
"If this is not understood, the material poverty of millions will be as nothing in comparison to the spiritual destitution of the powerful and wealthy of this world."
"– Mr President, despite technical progress, despite social advances of all kinds and despite measures being put in place seeking to extend these benefits to all of the countries of the European Union, too many women are still living in extreme poverty and this phenomenon is even more pronounced in the candidate countries wishing to join the European Union."
"There is even evidence to suggest that poverty is becoming an increasingly feminine problem."
"This poverty is due to obvious social factors and, crucially, to inequalities between girls and boys in terms of access to schooling, university education and professional training."
"Without training, no job and no salary."
"Without a salary, no social security contributions and therefore no medical or social insurance, no unemployment benefit and no pension."
"It follows that poverty increases with illness and, when old age comes, the situation becomes desperate."
"Nevertheless, these women have undeniably made a significant contribution to society throughout their lives by raising their children and doing jobs that are menial, badly paid and, usually, undeclared."
"As you will be aware, this poverty is also the cause of discrimination against women and trafficking in women."
"I therefore believe that it is vital to tackle this evil at its roots, because scattering individual subsidies around will not solve the problem for good and will not eradicate poverty amongst women. We must do all we can to ensure that they have equal access to schooling and professional training."
"That is where we need to start in our fight against poverty which particularly affects women."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to add two observations to the question tabled by Mrs Záborská:"
"Firstly, a lot of research has shown that women have borne the main part of the burden of transition in the new Member States, both from the psychological point of view and the socio-economic point of view."
"This is also closely linked to the feminisation of poverty."
"Both unemployed and employed women run the risk of poverty."
"As far as employed women are concerned, this applies in particular to the lowest paid professions and is primarily the result of the fact that women’s pay has long been around 25% lower on average than men’s pay."
"This is not an exception but an average that applies to virtually the whole of Europe."
"In the case of unemployed women, it is the elderly in particular who find themselves in the most complex and difficult situations."
"In some countries, time spent raising children has not been taken into account and this particularly applies to single mothers."
"It has also been shown that the opportunity to get out of the poverty trap is reduced where there is little work and long-term unemployment, and that the opportunity is further reduced the longer a person has been unemployed."
"In my home country of Slovakia, according to the latest statistics issued by the Statistics Office and calculated according to Eurostat methods, up to 21% of the population is at risk of poverty or lives below the poverty line."
"My second observation is that one of the most important dimensions in sustainable development is the social dimension, and poverty in particular."
"The feminisation of poverty is not a problem restricted to the new Member States."
"Moreover, it is quite clear that poverty amongst women often results in the social exclusion of children, thereby impacting on the future prospects of the new generation."
"I also support the view that these questions are urgent, including the need to strengthen gender-specific statistics within the framework of building a knowledge-based society."
"I also agree that certain countries, and in particular the governments of certain countries, are attempting to make light of the problem of poverty, as if it were a symptom of personal failure."
"I expect the European Commission to take a more robust policy in this respect too."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the phenomenon of poverty has no gender."
"This is not exclusively a women’s problem, but it does particularly affect women."
"Women earn lower salaries and receive a lower level of social protection."
"They are the last to gain access to permanent work and the first to be laid off."
"Women’s economic dependency places constraints on their freedom."
"As for poor single mothers, how many of them have no means of feeding their children, no roof to shelter them and no government support on which to live with a minimum of dignity?"
"These single mothers, whom Mr Buttiglione chose to insult, are real heroines."
"Fortunately, Parliament gave him the response he deserved and I was delighted to hear Mrs Schreyer say that we must respect single mothers."
"I trust that Mr Barroso will also keep this in mind in the future."
"Everything is linked: poverty, disease, illiteracy, lack of academic success, infant and maternal mortality, urban and environmental decay, social discrimination, lack of professional qualifications, unemployment, promiscuity, domestic violence, trafficking in human beings."
"Around 700 000 women and children every year are seized by networks of human traffickers."
"The European Institutions cannot turn a blind eye to this shocking figure."
"It is because of poverty that more children than ever are abandoned, raped, trafficked, beaten up and even murdered by their own parents."
"Everything is linked, such as poverty and death due to backstreet abortion, as we showed recently in this House with regard to the case of the boat belonging to the ‘Women on Waves’ movement."
"We must not forget that those who suffer most from the consequences of criminalising the voluntary termination of pregnancy are women from the poorest sections of society."
"Poor women pay with their health and even with their lives for the monstrous laws that prevent them from gaining access to a safe and hygienic voluntary termination of pregnancy."
"Such is the case in Ireland, Poland and Portugal."
"The fight against the social exclusion of women requires practical measures, as, in fact, laid down in the Lisbon Strategy."
"What is needed is an updated reading of the Lisbon Strategy to include a gender perspective."
"The Europe that we want and deserve must show greater solidarity, fairness and humanity towards women too."
"Mr President, women constitute a good half of the earth’s population."
"Two thirds of all work is done by women, but only a tenth of all income is accrued by women."
"The Beijing Declaration concerning the targets in terms of gender equality, development and peace and an action plan for achieving these targets was unanimously adopted more than ten years ago by 189 countries at the UN Fourth World Conference on Women.The EU Member States were among these countries."
"The gap between words and action is still worryingly large when it comes to women’s rights and, as a result, poverty has been feminised in the world."
"We must put our faith in women in the poor countries and, in that way, also fulfil the UN’s Millennium Declaration, which states that extreme poverty must be halved by 2015."
"There is no simple solution."
"Poverty is solved not through money but through commitment to human rights and sustainable development."
"The award of the Nobel prize to Wangari Maathai is an example of what can be done."
"By guaranteeing women’s rights, land and water are also secured, as well as opportunities for self-provision and local development."
"We must dare to make demands of the surrounding world."
"That is why it is important for women to be accorded full status in aid policy, both as aid providers and as aid receivers."
"I want to know what work the Commissioner is doing in this area."
"To turn the argument around, men constitute almost half the earth’s population."
"A third of all work is done by men, but nine tenths of all income is accrued by men."
"This fact also applies within the European Union, and I do not agree with the Commissioner’s description."
"Wage discrimination is increasing, as is female unemployment."
"Women have worse health, and they are poorer than men within the European Union."
"Now that we are working on the Lisbon process, I wish to know what the Commission is doing to guarantee women’s rights, achieve sustainable economic development and enable women to appropriate the rights accorded to them."
"Mr President, although official figures by gender are hard to come by, subject to severe delays or non-existent, as regards the 70 million people at risk from relative poverty in the European Union of the 25, we all know that poverty and social exclusion affect women in particular, whether it be because they are old and receive the lowest pensions, because they are young or middle-aged and unemployed or have an unstable job that affords them no rights or is badly paid, because they are immigrants or because they are single mothers."
"The situation becomes worse still as the number of people thus affected increases."
"Some figures indicate the seriousness of the situation, which, incidentally, varies considerably from country to country."
"In the EU, for example, over 51% of the approximately 20 million unemployed are women. In other words, unemployment, just like poverty, has a female face and seriously affects the women who are victims of multinational companies restructuring and relocating, as happens in my country, Portugal."
"On the subject of unemployment, the latest Eurostat figures show that across the 25 Member States of the EU, only 38% of permanent posts are held by women, meaning that most work done by women is insecure."
"Even so, the overall employment rate among women is only 55%, whilst that of men is as high as 71%."
"It is therefore not enough to defend the principle of equality."
"What is needed is a root-and-branch review of Community policies, with priority given to jobs, social inclusion and the fight against discrimination. This would entail a change in the financial and monetary policies of the European Central Bank and the Stability and Growth Pact, which should be replaced by a development, jobs and social inclusion pact."
"Similarly, with regard to the Lisbon Strategy, the policy on competition and the internal market must be amended to guarantee access for all to high-quality public services in education, training, health care, social protection, public transport and housing, and to promote social inclusion and economic cohesion."
"Mr President, Commissioner, allow me to insist: in a developed part of the world like our own, with a market economy, the best explanation for the feminisation of poverty is the persistence of differing employment standards according to gender."
"If, on average – as has been said – women’s pay is much lower than men's pay, it is essential that we take effective measures to deal directly with the causes of this discrimination."
"It is true – as you have said, Commissioner – that the employment discrimination suffered by many women is a result of their having had fewer opportunities for access to education and training and also, in many cases, difficulties reconciling family life with working life."
"This unquestionably has an effect on the nature of their jobs and their salaries, but it is equally true that many women directly suffer hidden wage discrimination, either because many of them are employed in the lower paid posts, or because lower salaries are paid to categories largely made up of women or because reducing women’s rights increases the incentive to employ them."
"It is therefore urgent, Commissioner, that we prevent, detect and also eliminate these types of discrimination in order to achieve true equality of pay."
"I would also like to refer, although very briefly, to increasing female emigration."
"For years, men have made up the bulk of migratory flows, while women came to our territory solely for reasons of family regrouping."
"Nevertheless, the model is changing quickly and in recent years more and more women have been emigrating on an individual and direct basis with a view to joining the workforce."
"The high number of lone women immigrants, whose family burdens are not shared with anyone, who undoubtedly face two-fold discrimination on grounds of origin and on grounds of gender, oblige us, Commissioner, to pay much more specific attention to women immigrants."
"Commissioner, putting an end to the increasing feminisation of poverty is an issue we must all be fully committed to, because we must remember that we are talking about justice and well-being for everybody."
"– Commissioner, poverty and social exclusion which, proportionately, affect more women than men – 20% compared with 19% of households headed by a man – are the modern form of social impoverishment and of violation of human rights in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries."
"Unfortunately, no one has yet addressed this issue with efficient and radical reform."
"A new social map is needed, based on a specific and integrated strategy to combat poverty and social exclusion in all social classes, especially among women."
"At European level, the most basic policy for combating poverty is to determine the minimum guaranteed income, which is something which could start to be applied to the female population on the margins of poverty."
"Such a policy will ensure that the entire population receives a satisfactory income."
"The minimum income is the income that needs to be used as a transitional stage, for reintegrating women into employment, and combined with development policies inside and outside the Community, with social insurance and health policies, social welfare policies, housing and child support policies, education and training policies, rural development policies and employment policies."
"Cooperation between all the countries of the European Union, between local and regional authorities, is important and necessary in order to mitigate the new types of poverty among immigrants and the emergence of groups of ."
"Commissioner, as you well know, addressing poverty is not the priority of social policies, of Community policies and the Structural Funds."
"The Member States, like the Community, are strengthening the competitiveness of the European economy, rather than social issues, such as women's issues and poverty."
"The modern European model, Commissioner, cannot be put to shame by marginalised social classes such as women, with whom impoverishment begins."
"Mr President, I thought I would conclude with something to think about."
"Who cares?"
"Who cares that more than a billion people live in poverty in the world today, the large majority of whom are women and girls?"
"Who cares that women are the only providers in a third of households in the world?"
"Who cares that women’s sexual and economic subordination operates as an engine for the spread of the HIV and AIDS epidemic?"
"Who cares that 57% of all children who do not receive any basic schooling are girls?"
"Who cares that, every minute, a woman dies from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth?"
"Who cares that almost half of all births in the developing countries take place without a medically qualified person being present?"
"Who cares that 80% of all refugees around the world are now women and children?"
"Who cares that women and girls do two thirds of the world’s work for 5% of the income?"
"I just wonder when Europe and the world will begin to care seriously about these issues."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for this lively debate."
"While it would be worthwhile to consider many of the points made, I would like to highlight two of them, one being the connection between the European Budget, agricultural expenditure and poverty – including among women – in the developing world."
"The statement has been made that something like one half of the Budget would help to further aggravate the poverty of women in the developing world."
"I cannot allow that assertion to go unchallenged."
"You made, of course, specific reference to agricultural subsidies, at a time when the Commission, in negotiations within the World Trade Organisation, has made progress in reducing agricultural and export subsidies and opening up greater opportunities to the countries of the developing world."
"Secondly, agricultural expenditure does of course play an essential part in preventing poverty in rural areas and in the agricultural sector."
"We are all aware of how poverty, rural areas and women are interlinked, and so our European Budget’s programmes for fostering development in rural areas are of immense importance in keeping women out of poverty."
"My next point has to do with the Lisbon strategy."
"You asked about broad outlines and specific proposals."
"I would like to remind you that it was the Commission that devoted its efforts to formulating the objective, as part of the Lisbon strategy, of increasing the number of women in employment, and that in a relatively short time."
"Then it was the Commission, too, that pointed out that it was impossible to simply set an increase in the number of women in employment as a target without giving practical attention to childcare."
"Without that, the goal of getting more women into work is beyond reach, and, as a woman, I was very happy to learn that the Heads of State and Government, at a summit, had considered the issue of childcare facilities and had come up with a resolution to the effect that childcare needs to be more readily available."
"The fact is, of course, that you cannot make Europe more competitive without increasing women’s opportunities for employment."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is oral question B6-0018/04 by Karl-Heinz Florenz, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, to the Commission, on the environmental effects of high-intensity active naval sonars."
". Mr President, I am delighted that this is not the last time that we will have the Commissioner with us, as yesterday, in a roundabout way, we extended her contract of employment."
"As I understand it, this is an oral question rather than a speech, and so I will try to keep it very brief."
"As you know, this question deals with the environmental effects on whales of underwater sonar systems, military and civilian equipment that has quite considerable effects on the auditory system of whales."
"We have, most regrettably, had indications from experts that whales are dying in vast numbers, something that has not started only recently, but has been going on for some time."
"What we would like the Commission to tell us is whether it has been informed of new studies and whether these have been sufficiently publicised."
"We would very much like to know whether it is aware that the United States has already dismantled stationary sonar systems of this kind."
"Is it aware that new technologies capable of performing these functions have been in existence for some time?"
"We see here the potential for innovation under the Lisbon strategy."
"We do not want to scrap any ships, but we do want our friends in the defence sector to continue to be able to travel under water in an orderly fashion, rather than, as is unfortunately the present case, in some confusion and disarray."
"This is an opportunity for innovation; is the Commission willing to take action in this area even outside the European Union?"
". Mr President, Mr Florenz, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the opportunity given to it by Parliament to reiterate the importance of maintaining and protecting the marine environment."
"At the plenary session in March of this year, Commissioner Solbes made a statement on behalf of the Commission on the effects of low-frequency active sonar on the marine environment, in which it was pointed out that the EU’s Member States are required by Community law to set up stringent systems for protecting whales in European waters."
"The Commission did not, however, have at its disposal the information on high-intensity active sonar systems and their potential effects on whales that it would have needed in order to clarify outstanding scientific issues and adopt an unambiguous position."
"For that reason, the Commission asked the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea to examine this complex issue scientifically."
"This was to provide a basis for the description of measures that might prove necessary in the future in order to avoid disturbing whales and in order to guarantee adherence to the provisions of the Habitat Directive."
"The scientific study has since been set in motion, and the draft conclusions are expected at the beginning of 2005."
"The Commission will make the results of this study available to Parliament and to the public."
"We will consult the Member States, through the Habitat Committee, on the best possible options for protecting whales from sonar systems and other forms of noise pollution, and in these discussions all interested parties will be involved."
"Although the Commission is aware of the potential environmental effects of military activities, the fact that the EU possesses no competence in this area means that the Community cannot take any action to regulate the development of new defence technologies."
"If, in future, we become more involved in the field of defence research, this will of course have a major part to play."
"Let me reiterate that the study was commissioned in September 2003 and is expected to be available by the end of this year."
"As the study needs to collate all the available knowledge on the subject, it is a complex task, and, as it has to do with the military sector, this has often not been easy."
"We therefore ask you to note that the completion of the study will require some considerable time."
"I do hope, though – as I have said on behalf of my fellow Commissioners – that the results will be available at the beginning of the coming year and will then provide a sound basis for action."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to say thank you for allowing us the opportunity to remind everyone once again just how important this subject is, and of the many effects that high-intensity sonars have on our environment, and especially on marine fauna."
"We have already brought up the issue of whales twice, and we will do so again in the future, until we make clear progress in this matter."
"I wish to thank Commissioner Schreyer for her reply, which inspires hope."
"It is important that the Commission should do all it can within the limits of its powers."
"Two years ago, I personally collected the names for the first oral question, and it has to be said that research material on the subject has substantially increased in volume in the intervening period."
"Precise information on the effects of high-intensity sonars has been obtained from many reliable sources, including data published by 18 European researchers in the issue of Nature magazine dated 9 October 2003, which shows that high-intensity sonars pose a significant threat to marine mammals in particular, but also to fish and other marine fauna."
"There has been a considerable increase in the body of evidence showing a link between the death in large numbers of marine mammals and high-intensity sonars."
"A year ago, in October, researchers and our parliamentary delegation went to NATO headquarters to submit two petitions asking the member countries of NATO to restrict the use of LFAS systems until their environmental impact and link to recent whale deaths had been fully investigated."
"At that time, the petition had been signed by more than 85 000 people and 68 environmental organisations in Europe, the United States and Canada."
"While we agree that it is a totally legitimate exercise to try and develop this defence system, and to monitor submarines that use new technology, it is especially important to take the vulnerability of our environment into consideration."
"From the point of view of sustainable development, we should aim to develop alternative technologies which protect nature while at the same time achieving the objectives set for them."
"In military technology, as well as other fields, it is worth reminding ourselves of the ecological price we have to pay for the technology we choose to employ."
"With high-intensity sonars, the price is too high."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the devastating effects of global warming, noise and chemical pollution, overfishing and shipping accidents are dramatically degrading our oceans and, inevitably, the populations of cetaceans living there."
"We now have valid and sufficient scientific evidence demonstrating that high-intensity active naval sonars can be lethal for whales, dolphins and fish."
"All cetaceans are extremely dependent on hearing for their survival, and many species have an acute sense of hearing and use sound not only to locate their prey but also for navigation and communication, often over long distances."
"Noise pollution caused by sonar equipment thus not only causes physiological damage but also interferes with the natural behaviour of the animals and with normal communication."
"It drowns out calls and disorientates the animals, scaring them away from their usual habitats, where they feed and reproduce."
"Last year we adopted a resolution on the protection and conservation of the marine environment."
"This Parliament voted unanimously for the application of consistent, coordinated measures to halt the decline of biodiversity by 2010 and to promote the sustainable use of the seas, protecting and conserving marine ecosystems."
"I would not wish to remind you, Mr President, that these were political objectives to which we gave a binding commitment at the last world summit on sustainable development."
"I believe, therefore, that it is our duty to adopt provisions designed to preserve the marine world which surrounds us, and so I call on the Commission to abide by the deadlines which it announced in this Chamber for making the move from studies to concrete proposals."
"Mr President, high-intensity naval sonar is a form of under-water radar system used mainly for the detection of submarines."
"Instead of the electromagnetic energy waves used by surface radar, it employs acoustic energy waves with which it scans the water of the oceans."
"These acoustic waves are, in simple terms, very loud noises which travel over many hundreds of kilometres and, in the areas used, completely fill every cubic inch of ocean water without any geographical limitation."
"Sometimes they are so loud that they can even be heard outside the water by people standing at nearby shores."
"It is not surprising that such high-energy noise bombardment causes severe disruption to marine life."
"This disruption is especially extensive to animals that by nature have very sensitive acoustic capabilities, such as whales and dolphins."
"What a whale hears and feels when sonar is used is the equivalent of what we would hear and feel if four jumbo jet engines were operating at full blast in this room."
"The scientific evidence gathered mainly from necropsies on stranded whales is becoming increasingly stronger and more enlightening and it is convincing to most scientists, and it certainly satisfies our precautionary principle."
"Apart from direct injury to internal organs such as the inner ear apparatus, the sonar waves cause the animals to panic and in terror to move uncontrollably and haphazardly, trying desperately to escape from the painful and disorientating sonar noise."
"In so doing, they may rise very quickly from deep waters, thus suffering a form of fatal decompression sickness and/or they may be stranded on nearby beaches where they meet their demise."
"It should be noted that for every animal stranded, many hundreds more are killed or severely injured but we never get to know about them because they never reach the shores."
"It should also be noted that dying from the effects of sonar injury is an extremely painful, agonising and slow form of death."
"It is imperative that the motion for a resolution which has been submitted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety calling for the restriction of the use of these sonars be passed urgently and unchanged in substance."
"The amendment proposing the restriction of the use of sonars in geographically non-sensitive marine habitats, if accepted, will severely weaken this resolution and render it largely ineffective."
"Mr President, I am delighted we are having this debate, as it is a crucial environmental issue, which is already of great concern to many people."
"These new, much more powerful sonars – one of the loudest sound systems ever devised – have sparked an epidemic of strandings, internal bleeding, deafness and lung damage wherever they have been tested."
"A single blast of the new technology can affect animals across 3.8 million km2 of water."
"That is why it is simply not good enough that the Commission responded to a written question of mine last November, simply saying that this type of technology needs to be used with caution."
"This type of technology be used with caution because of the huge impact it has."
"At one hundred miles away from the source of the sound, the noise can still cause shearing of the tissues in the air sack behind whales' and dolphins brains."
"I listened with great interest to the Commissioner's introduction, and I heard a lot about more research but nothing about calling for a moratorium."
"In July, the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission unanimously issued a strong statement of concern about intense underwater noise, citing what calls compelling evidence that entire populations of whales and other marine mammals are potentially threatened by it."
"So do not tell us that we need more research before we call for a moratorium – we do not: there is plenty of evidence that we need to act."
"I would strongly urge Members to vote against the amendment tabled by the PPE Group, which seeks to weaken the resolution by calling upon Member States to adopt geographic restrictions in sensitive marine habitats."
"There is simply no scientific justification for this amendment."
"Mrs Korhola gave a very nice speech – it is a pity she has now left the Chamber – but she did not explain why she has put her name to this very same amendment, which would gut and weaken the very resolution which she claims to support."
"Given that a single blast of this low-frequency technology can affect animals across 3.8 million km2 of water and that little is known about their migratory patterns, geographic restrictions are not appropriate."
"They will not work."
"I urge colleagues to reject that amendment."
"Mr President, naturally, our group too supports this resolution and the demand for a moratorium on using this technique."
"We now have overwhelming proof that the technique is dangerous."
"For example, a number of links have been shown to exist between military exercises in which this technique is used and the high incidence of stranded whales."
"As mentioned earlier in this debate, there is only one amendment to this excellent resolution."
"It comes from the other side of this House and was tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"They wish to attenuate what is one of the absolutely key points by restricting the demand that this technique should not be used so that it only applies to certain geographical areas."
"That is something that would seriously damage the document."
"It is also a practical impossibility, since we are concerned here with species that travel over huge areas of sea and that cannot be confined to certain areas."
"We are also concerned with sound waves that, in themselves, can travel for hundreds of kilometres."
"We shall vote in favour of the resolution and against the amendment."
"In European policy, the precautionary principle has been an important guiding principle for years and before long, we will be discussing in this House extensive legislation, based on that principle, on chemical substances."
"In environmental policy too, we are trying to prevent new technical developments from damaging flora and fauna."
"As for the new sonars that are currently under discussion, I can be brief."
"We see cases of stranded sea mammals whose hearing has been damaged."
"Those animals are stranded in areas where ships sail that are equipped with a new kind of extra loud sonar."
"These factors, combined, lead us to believe that those sonars cause damage to sea mammals."
"I take the view that we should apply the precautionary principle in this instance too and should therefore temporarily ban the use of those types of sonar in European waters until such time as it has been proven that there is some other cause or – if the damage is indeed caused by these sonar devices – until a final ban is imposed."
"With regard to the amendment tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I understand that restrictions can be imposed on protected areas, but it seems wise to me to retain the current text of the resolution in order to send the strongest possible signal to the Council and the Commission."
"Mr President, I represent the south-west of England, where in recent years an increasing number of dead dolphins have been washed ashore."
"In 2002 and 2003, over 300 dolphins and porpoises were washed ashore and their carcasses could be seen on beaches."
"Because of recent research published in magazine in October, attention has focused on naval sonars."
"However, the absolute priority for groups concerned with such sea mammal deaths in the south-west of England and many other parts of the country is to put a stop to indiscriminate pair trawling in the English Channel as soon as possible."
"We are impatiently awaiting EU action on this. My constituents simply cannot understand why action has not already been taken on the basis of the precautionary principle, which the Commission so often cites in support of its initiatives."
"We want more research to be carried out on the effect of naval sonars."
"I note that the Verts/ALE Group is moving an amendment saying that it wants a moratorium because it has been proved that naval sonars are dangerous."
"That is not actually true."
"The research published in says: 'The incidence of such cases of dead mammals during a naval sonar exercise indicates that acoustic factors be important.' magazine says that further investigation is needed."
"We know that we have to be realistic."
"Green MEPs support the idea of an immediate restriction or ban on such sonars, but the British Navy, and no doubt others with less accessible websites, are about to conduct trials on a new low-frequency, high-intensity sonar S2087 from Type 23 frigates."
"The Ministry of Defence admits that there is an acoustic effect that might damage sea mammals."
"For that reason, it will introduce mitigating and monitoring measures to protect marine mammals."
"For example, we would prefer to see avoidance of the use of sonar in marine breeding grounds adopted as part of a common EU strategy."
"Blocking the use of such sonars in any EU waters would deprive those who defend us of a useful early-warning tool that we might well need in a dangerous world."
"It is a difficult balance, but we believe that our amendment to the text delivers the best possible solution."
"If it is not adopted many of us will, with great regret, have to abstain or vote against this motion."
"Mr President, this is the second debate we have held this year in Parliament on the issue of ziphii."
"During the previous debate, Commissioner Solbes announced to us that this study would be carried out, and I am pleased that Commissioner Schreyer has confirmed what Commissioner Solbes said and that the study will be finished before the end of the year."
"At the moment, the scientific evidence is clear."
"The University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria has carried out very detailed studies on the subject and it is clear that the low-frequency sonar used in naval military manoeuvres does harm to animals."
"What we need to do now, as Mr Sacconi has already said, is to move on from the study stage to concrete proposals."
"It falls to the Commission to present proposals to the Member States, concrete proposals, and I hope that those proposals will be on the table when we next hold the debate in Parliament."
"I will therefore end by calling on the Commission to present these proposals very soon, that is to say, immediately after it receives those studies, so that, next year, Parliament can study them and recommend to the Member States what decisions should be taken, without any excessive delay."
"Mr President, it must be made very clear that it is impossible to limit the effects of sonar on a geographical basis."
"I do not know what the PPE-DE Group wants to do: perhaps they should give out ear protectors to the dolphins and whales."
"A number of ziphii have died this summer in the Canary Islands, clearly due to the effects of sonar."
"The Verts/ALE Group has been condemning this for a long time."
"The Spanish Government and the Ministry of Defence have acknowledged the problem and the Canary Islands Government recently accepted that this type of harm is related to the use of medium-frequency active sonars."
"Last April, the Government and the Ministry of Defence signed a cooperation agreement to prevent the mass beaching of ziphii which is taking place in the Canary Islands area."
"This agreement is very significant, since it shows concern and demonstrates that ziphii are affected by sonar."
"What we find completely unacceptable is the amendment presented by the Group of the European Peoples’ Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats with a view to restricting the use of high-intensity naval radar/sonar only in areas defined as sensitive marine habitats, something which is absolutely impossible."
"We call on the House to reject this amendment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me say at the outset that I find it very regrettable that this House has not made use of one of the options available to us."
"It is a fact that the European Parliament is not just responsible for the protection of the environment, but also for security and defence matters, on the latter of which we have set up a sub-committee."
"I believe that any resolution adopted by us would carry much more weight if it took full account of these aspects."
"I would say that it is extraordinarily important that we should find a solution, and that whales and dolphins have to be protected."
"About this, I believe there is broad agreement in this House as a whole, but there is, on the other hand, the question of what is the best course of action."
"I do not know whether it is realistic to call for a moratorium, for the continued use of these devices to some extent will continue to be necessary for security and other reasons."
"For that reason, I believe it would be more realistic to seek first a suitable geographical limit and come to an agreement that these devices should no longer be used in places where whales and dolphins have died in particularly large numbers."
"For that reason, I very much commend the amendment tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party."
"There is yet another aspect to this, in that a preparatory programme for safety research is currently under discussion – it features in the Budget debates, Commissioner Schreyer – and it is to be introduced and funded by the European Union."
"As I see it, the issue of substitutes for sonars, or that of other methods for protecting whales, should be dealt with under the heading of this programme."
"Mr President, we clearly have a very serious problem with marine life and possible links with naval sonar."
"I therefore welcome the thrust of the resolution and the need to do something."
"However, I cannot accept the idea of a moratorium."
"There are security issues, as we have heard today."
"We need time to develop alternative technologies."
"I welcome what you said, Madam Commissioner."
"We should wait for the expert study and then see what action can be taken in January."
"In the meantime, we have to keep monitoring this serious issue, about which many citizens are concerned."
". Let me just briefly observe that the Commission supports this undertaking to stop the loss of biodiversity by 2010."
"The second thing I want to say is that, if the Commission is to make effective recommendations, it needs sound scientific results, and that is why the study is so very important."
"It will soon be available, and it goes without saying that you will have the results and proposals."
"My third point is that I will bring this resolution to the attention of my successor as the Commissioner responsible for safety research, as I believe it to be very important to make full use of the options available to us in this area of research."
"I would like to inform the House that I have received the motion for a resolution(1)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the vote on the"
". Mr President, before we begin the vote, I would like to say that we have travelled a long way in the Committee on Budgets."
"I would like to thank all the members of all the political groups for their valuable cooperation, remind you that we have dealt with more than 760 amendments in the Committee on Budgets and express our particular thanks to our chairman, Mr Lewandowski, who, having recently arrived in this Parliament and in the Committee on Budgets, has done an excellent job of coordination."
"Mr President, as is the case every year, in a budgetary exercise of this scale we always have to make certain technical corrections."
"I shall read out the technical corrections."
"Amendment No 592, in line 18 03 05, has been withdrawn."
"Amendment No 65, in line 04 02 12, is accepted with an increase of EUR 1 million."
"Amendment No 66, in line 04 12 15, is accepted with an increase of EUR 1 million."
"Amendment No 67, in line 04 03 03 01, is accepted with an increase of a further EUR 1 million."
"Amendment No 69, in line 04 03 03 03, is accepted with a sum of EUR 600 000."
"Amendment No 599, in line 18 06 04 02, is accepted with an increase of EUR 2 million, rather than EUR 1 million."
"An additional sum of EUR 1 million should be added to line 16 05 01 in addition to the result of the separate vote on this line."
"The comments on Amendment No 137 should be included."
"There has been a request for a separate vote for Amendment No 354, in line 18 03 04, which will be considered withdrawn if the technical corrections I mentioned earlier are adopted."
"This amendment will therefore be covered by the vote on block of Amendments No 4."
"Mr President, I propose that we proceed to the vote on these technical corrections."
"Mr President, my Group disagrees with this voting arrangement."
"We would like to state things in the most clear and transparent way, and therefore, in accordance with the Rules, we request a roll–call vote."
"We are aware that this may prolong voting time, so I would add that the IND/DEM Group does not intend to block the majority view in the House."
"We just want to make it clear to the citizens of our Member States."
"If you refuse our request for a roll–call vote, we will not insist this time."
"Thank you for not insisting on a vote by roll call, which would undoubtedly delay our work considerably."
"You have made your position very clear and it will be recorded in the Minutes."
"We shall therefore proceed to the vote on these technical amendments."
". Mr President, I thought we were going to vote for this amendment when the time came, in the corresponding line."
"But if you are asking me for a voting recommendation now, I recommend that we vote on it straight away and in favour."
"."
"Mr President, in connection with the vote on the other institutions, I have to say that there is an equalisation amendment, Amendment No 436, that has been tabled so that the expenditure might be balanced in the light of other amendments to Parliament’s Budget."
"The figures in Budget item 209, which constitute the provisional amount for covering the institution’s property investments, will therefore be adjusted so that they reflect the result of the vote we have today."
"If Parliament decides to follow my recommendations to amend the overall level of Parliament’s Budget – Amendment No 370 – which would reduce the Budget by EUR 40 million, the amount of budget item 209, which is the amount of the institution’s property investments, will be adjusted accordingly."
". Mr President, in brief, in line 04 03 03 02, we have Amendments Nos 495, 68 and 343."
"If Amendments Nos 68 and 343 are approved, I will propose an oral amendment which I will read in a moment if you like, because I need to change the text we will have approved in the comments."
"I am going to read it now so that we have a clear idea of what we will approve in the event that these amendments are accepted."
"This is the wording of the oral amendment I propose: ‘Part of this appropriation shall be used to fund the organisations mentioned in the amendment in accordance with the provisions of the financial regulation."
". Mr President, before proceeding to the vote on the next block, I must point out that the vote on Amendment No 68 has turned out to be different from what we had recommended in the Committee on Budgets and, in the absence of confirmation of the figures, we have a problem, a margin of EUR 1.5 million."
"We have exceeded the margin for Category 3."
"The figures will have to be verified and then we will see whether we can make some adjustment for the second reading."
"But I must point out that, as things stand at the moment, we have exceeded the margin for this category."
". It is a comment on the line, Mr President, and does not, therefore, require a qualified majority."
"In accordance with the information we have received from the services of the House, we shall apply a qualified majority, because that is what the amendment requires since it affects the whole of the line."
"Mr President, we may initially have voted on an amount, but, even if the amount was not adopted, we can still vote on the comment."
"That then has nothing to do with the amount, and so what Mr Garriga Polledo has said applies."
". Mr President, if the services of the House tell you in this case that the whole of the amendment should be voted on by qualified majority, then the services of the House must take responsibility for the vote."
"I would have preferred this part – as a comment – not to have been voted on by qualified majority, but by simple majority."
"If you are in agreement – since this issue perhaps requires rather more consideration – we shall postpone the vote on this issue until the end and in that way we will be able to reflect and the services of the House can consider it in more detail."
"Mr President, in that case, the second part of Amendment No 210 was also a comment and it seems to me that that also had a majority at that time."
"Yes, Mr President, returning to the irritating issue of our exceeding the margin for Category 3, it seems that we have finally identified that we have exceeded the margin for Category 3 by a sum of EUR 580 000."
"I would therefore request a meeting with the coordinators so that they may give me a mandate to reduce this EUR 580 000 in some line and thereby prevent the margin from being exceeded."
"This is what I propose: a mandate to allow me to cut EUR 580 000 from one of the lines on which we have voted for amendments."
"Your request is very reasonable."
"It is better to remove this small sum than to find ourselves in a situation which may cause difficulties."
"If nobody objects, therefore, you may adjust the sum together with the coordinators."
"Mr President, now that we have voted on the figures, I have a small amendment to the text on which we are to vote, namely to paragraph 20 in which the amounts are to be amended on the basis of the result of the vote concerning Euroscola."
"The following is to be added to paragraph 20:"
"'Has to decided to enter EUR 500 000 against item 2727, Organisation and reception of groups of visitors, Euroscola programme and invitations to opinion multipliers from third countries.'"
"Over and above this addition to paragraph 20, paragraph 18 is to be deleted from the text."
"These are the changes that result from our vote on the figures."
"– Well, since this is in fact simply a statement bringing the text technically into line with the figures that we have just adopted, I am sure that the House can support the rapporteur’s proposal."
"Are there any objections?"
". I would like to use my brief remarks to draw your attention, and the attention of the public, to the hearings procedure that took place before the current voting and proved to be a success not only for the Committee on Budgetary Control (COCOBU), of which I am chairman, but also for the entire European Parliament."
"The hearings procedure, the importance of which I do not believe I need to emphasise in the light of yesterday’s events, may also serve as a positive example to the Council and the Commission."
"What do I mean by this?"
"In the Treaty of Accession, the ten new Member States were granted the right to delegate one member each to, among other bodies, the European Court of Auditors."
"COCOBU held hearings for each of the candidates and delivered a favourable opinion on the appointment of eight candidates and a negative opinion in the case of two."
"One of these countries, Cyprus, withdrew its candidate because of the negative result of the relevant hearing and delegated Mr Kikis Kazamias instead."
"In the light of his Curriculum Vitae and the answers provided in the questionnaire and public hearing, our committee recommended the appointment of Mr Kazamias with 26 votes for and one against and expressed hope for the prospects of cooperation with the new candidate."
"The Council unfortunately ignored Parliament’s negative vote and approved the other, Slovakian, candidate."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control has therefore decided to request a written report from the Council by 15 December 2004 as to why it ignored Parliament’s recommendation."
"Members of the European Court of Auditors must have the trust of Parliament."
"Mr Kazamias had the trust of the Committee on Budgetary Control, and I am therefore asking you to accept the report we have presented to you."
"– I will therefore put Amendment No 3 to the vote as an addition which has the support of the rapporteur."
"(1)"
"(2)"
"The Moderate delegation has today abstained from voting in the final vote on the resolution."
"The resolution contains much that we consider laudable but, because we voted against quite a few of the proposed increases in expenditure in the vote on the figures in the Budget, it was impossible for us to support the resolution’s conclusions."
"We cannot support the general attempt to increase the Budget expenditure to the levels proposed by the Commission. Nor can we support the sweeping statements concerning more aid for agriculture, structural funds and information actions."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mr Garriga Polledo (A6-0021/2004) on the draft general budget for 2005 (Section III), with amendments, because I agree with the main thrust of the evaluations and proposals contained therein, particularly where it states that ‘Budget 2005 shall reflect the following political priorities and objectives: Lisbon Strategy: given the desire for the EU budget to become an effective means of fostering economic growth, sustainable development and job creation;"
"Cohesion policy: Budget 2005 must also continue to contribute to the cohesion as well as to the strengthening of the external role of the Union’."
"I also welcome, however, the criticism that ‘some Member States have not been able to use rural development funds… (and where the report) calls on the Commission to analyse carefully proposals that might be able to overcome such situations’."
"India has enormous geo-strategic importance in the world. The world’s largest democracy is the driving force of the sub-continent in which it is situated and, with its human and cultural wealth, it is of major interest to a European Union that seeks to be more open to the world."
"History has conferred on some Member States, such as Portugal, privileged ties and relations with India. I believe that this could be to everyone’s advantage, and clearly justifies the EU’s support for maintaining and strengthening those ties and relations."
"Indeed, I am convinced that, by strengthening and re-establishing the ties of the past, and by making the most of our mutual affection and of common languages and cultures, we will be able to derive the maximum benefit from the relationship between the peoples of Europe and the people of India."
"In this regard, I welcome both the establishment of an EU-India Centre for Indian Studies, and the fostering of European cultural initiatives in India, with particular emphasis on projects aimed at reviving and reinventing a joint past."
