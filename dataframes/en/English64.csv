"However, I have some comments."
"First, regarding the Stability and Growth Pact, Mr Bini Smaghi’s answers to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs revealed some inconsistencies in judgement, which I wish briefly to point out."
"While his commentary on the legal uncertainties of the old SGP is valid, his interpretation of the dynamic conditions leading to the reform of the pact is questionable."
"Mr Bini Smaghi seems to imply that the pact’s own rigidities led to certain Member States breaking its rules and that the politics of the SGP made sensible economics impossible."
"This is disappointing from someone about to be installed at the ECB."
"The truth is that the SGP was torn apart by the political inability of some Member States to conduct sensible economic policies on the basis of the rules agreed to by all, long after they came into effect."
"I would remind Mr Bini Smaghi that without effective rules that are equally applicable to all, the EU would be nothing but a loose grouping with weak powers of coordination."
"Surely, as a member of the ECB Board, he cannot favour development that would increase economic asymmetry between eurozone Member States."
"Secondly, regarding his nomination itself, the rules that govern which eurozone Member States obtain seats on the ECB Board need to be clarified."
"They should be based on genuinely open mechanisms of selecting nominees."
"The present system too often seems to favour automatic entry for candidates from big eurozone Member States at the direct expense of smaller ones."
"Smaller Member States are excluded from the backroom deals that decide the posts."
"This is truly regrettable and potentially damaging in the long run."
"With these qualifications in mind, I once again congratulate Mr Bini Smaghi on his nomination."
"I am not against his nomination but I am concerned about the more general circumstances surrounding it."
"Mr President, it is to be hoped Mr Smaghi will bring some semblance of financial discipline to the ECB."
"Recently, I questioned the fact that the ECB had decided to double its printing of EUR 500 banknotes this year – the highest value banknotes in the world and the Russian mafia’s currency of choice, each one worth seven times a USD 100 bill."
"Last year, counterfeit EUR 500 notes rose by over 160%, and that is only the ones we know about."
"The Commission’s reply to my questions would have stunned even a simpleton."
"It said, ‘a strong demand for high-value notes could be met only by lower denominations and increasing printing costs’."
"Can you imagine that as a serious answer from a central bank?"
"The reply went on, ‘EUR 500 banknotes are widely used for hoarding purposes’ – surprise, surprise!"
"And finally, ‘there are no indications that high-denomination banknotes encourage illegal transactions’."
"Which planet do they live on?"
"The ECB must be out of its tiny collective mind to encourage the wider circulation of such banknotes, and I believe Mr Smaghi has much work to do."
"Mr President, I would simply like to say a couple of words repeating what I said in my first speech and which coincide with the vast majority of the speeches by the honourable Members."
"We wish Mr Bini Smaghi every success, because success in his work as one of the members of the Executive Boards of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank will be a success for the single currency, it will be a success for the economic and monetary union and it will be a success for the progress, happiness and well-being of all the European citizens."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at noon."
"The next item is the Commission communication: Action Plan on the The Hague programme ‘Freedom, security and justice in the European Union’."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has today adopted a draft communication, drawn up by me, consisting of a plan of action to implement and put into practice the priorities of the Hague programme to make Europe an area of freedom, security and justice."
"The communication contains a first draft of the political objectives and an annex indicating the main practical measures, together with dates by which each initiative must be adopted."
"We have prepared a programme comprising 84 initiatives for the whole term of the Commission’s mandate: 32 of these 84 measures will be implemented by the end of 2005, which will be the most important year for the action plan to take off."
"We believe that with this programme we have launched a second stage in Europe’s freedom, security and justice policy."
"First of all, we shall be equipping ourselves with the means to organise and plan future actions more effectively."
"We are aware, of course, that there may always be some unpredictability in matters of security due to external events, but it is important to work to a strategic plan and to avoid emergency measures."
"These are areas – the security area as well as those of justice and freedom – where we should not be thinking in terms of individual, isolated measures, but instead we should be thinking in terms of a European approach that responds to the people’s demands and can make a difference, compared to the individual actions of Member States."
"Another aspect of our work will be to monitor the way the Member States implement individual initiatives."
"We have prepared a specific reference guide, a chapter of the communication concerning the preparation of a yearly report – a kind of management chart. It would, in fact, be a comparative outline of the measures that are adopted at national level to implement and comply with the orientations given in the document."
"I believe that such a report is important, and the first one will be issued in December this year, six months after the Commission’s adoption of the action plan."
"The three major objectives that the Commission intends to pursue are, first of all, the promotion and protection of people’s fundamental rights."
"We see that as a core aspect of European citizenship, one that we must fulfil organically but which requires that Europe should, both internally and externally in its international actions, be a promoter and not just a passive defender of people’s fundamental rights and freedoms."
"That aspect is clearly linked to the high-priority need for security, as the people of Europe are demanding."
"Security means decisive action against terrorism and organised crime, with particular regard for the victims of crime."
"We shall be giving this aspect special attention, but, as I have already pointed out, our measures to strengthen security must not come at the expense of everyone’s freedoms and fundamental rights."
"The guiding principles will be more security, more respect and more protection, as well as the promotion of individual freedoms."
"An important chapter is devoted to various aspects of solidarity."
"Solidarity means considering issues such as immigration at a European level and no longer at a national level. We have to separate the aspect of illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings, against which we must fight hard, from the aspect of admission rules for legal immigrants, those who are entitled to have proper access to social services – that means a policy of integration based on legality and obeying the law."
"In this area, solidarity clearly also means striking a balance between our fellow citizens’ right to be given guarantees against people traffickers and protecting the victims of people traffickers, in other words the immigrants or asylum seekers themselves."
"This point is linked to the one on the European area of justice."
"I am, of course, summarising these aspects as much as I can, but you will find the details in the communication: civil justice and criminal justice."
"We cannot just think about criminal justice, but rather we must emphasise the fact that civil justice and the harmonisation of rules, or at least the solution of common problems, can help the people of Europe with serious problems in their everyday lives."
"I am thinking of certain points of family law, such as inheritance among people of different nationalities, or the execution of orders for payment where the creditor is from one country and the debtor from another: in civil law, too, we can find solutions that improve or resolve certain problems in people’s everyday lives."
"All that certainly requires a commitment by the three European institutional players: Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"It is our intention to work hard to strengthen this action, to strengthen this interinstitutional partnership, and we shall make every effort to expand the areas of codecision with Parliament wherever possible."
"In this action plan we have taken account of many points that Parliament had highlighted, and I shall mention just one of them: the greater role of the European Union Court of Justice in certain areas."
"We found the Council’s reaction somewhat problematic at times, but equally we feel committed to continue working until all three institutional players agree on how to put this plan’s lines of action into practice."
"I am, of course, familiar with the report drawn up by the chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Mr Cavada, after a hearing and a thorough debate precisely on our priorities regarding security, justice and freedom."
"As you will see, the document takes up many of those recommendations and suggestions. I strongly hope and trust that on this occasion, in the course of Parliament’s work, you will be able to find some agreement with the Commission’s strategy in terms of lines of action."
"I shall conclude by saying that of course we are counting on Parliament’s support. We are counting on it because freedom, justice and security are among people’s fundamental needs, because they are pillars of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and of the Constitutional Treaty in the European Union, and also because they are subjects that have a strong political dimension rather than a bureaucratic one."
"That is why the European Parliament, as a political player, will be able to make contributions, proposals and suggestions for additions that we shall certainly take into account."
"Mr Vice-President, of course we agree with you, our top priority is to protect and promote fundamental rights."
"However, your action plan contains only one new programme for citizenship and fundamental rights; do you think that is enough?"
"We are also concerned about the growing number of measures provided for the repressive arsenal."
"Indeed, we fear an extension of the use of biometrics, we greatly fear an extension of the wide access to databases on visas and the Schengen system and we want to know the situation regarding the technical aspects of the use of biometrics in visas."
"Do you intend taking account of the European Parliament’s negative opinion in the new talks with the United States on the transfer of personal data?"
"Finally, we reiterate our concern to preserve a balance between the protection of privacy and security."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his presentation."
"I have a question about the ten priorities."
"Point 3 is devoted to migration management as a so-called new balanced approach to migration management."
"The problem, as mentioned, is that the decision as to how many migrants coming from third countries can be admitted to the European Union remains a national decision."
"The Commission suggested that an area of free movement demands a common immigration policy, and we agree with that."
"How will the Commission try to overcome the contradiction embedded in the fact that, on the one hand, the European Union is developing a common European asylum system, a common European visa system and common European border control, while, on the other hand, legal migration, which is a very important part of migration management, remains a strictly national question?"
"Mr President, firstly, I am very pleased to hear that the Commission will not only protect but also actively promote fundamental rights."
"That is a step forward."
"I have a precise question on passenger name records – they are also mentioned in the action plan – and more specifically in relation to the incident with the KLM plane one month ago."
"I have put a written question to the European Commission."
"I also raised the matter orally in the debate at the April part-session, but I have not received a reply to date."
"We may be looking at an infringement of the agreement between the European Union and the United States, so it is urgent that we receive a reply."
"I wonder whether Commissioner Frattini could give us some indications of the direction in which the reply may go."
". – Mr President, the subject of citizenship and fundamental rights is certainly one of those that concern us most in this context."
"European citizenship will, in my view, be the synthesis of all our common values, the European principles in which we believe and which we have set down in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"That is precisely why we are not aiming in the action plan at strengthening the arsenals of repression – that is to say, we want to avoid a merely repressive and punitive approach. Instead, we are attempting to strike a balance between the need for investigation – the need to identify the perpetrators of crimes, especially terrorists and members of organised criminal gangs – and the protection of individual rights and freedoms."
"That means, for example, strengthening legal and procedural rights, and an initial proposal is already before Parliament."
"It is not enough, as it is just an initial proposal for discussion, but others will follow to reinforce the concept of protecting people’s privileges, freedoms and rights."
"Of these, the topic of personal data protection is the one that stands out, of course, and we shall be giving it particular attention."
"In this respect, I recently had a meeting with the European Data Protection Supervisor."
"I assured him that it was my intention to consult him in advance before submitting proposals, precisely so as to ensure that the various concerns about personal data protection, including those of the so-called Article 29 Committee, could be taken into account."
"Such cooperation goes beyond the purely formal aspects, that is to say when the legal basis allows us to acknowledge him explicitly in the procedure, but extends to cases where we want to make sure in advance that the personal data protection rules are being observed."
"I have renewed an offer of informal collaboration with the Commission."
"That applies to many areas. It applies to the dossier on the agreement signed with the United States during the last session – by the way, as I mentioned earlier, we are waiting for a decision from the Court of Justice before making our assessment."
"It certainly applies to the matter of their complying fully with the existing agreements with the European Union – I am referring to the specific incident that was mentioned today of a KLM flight that was not authorised to cross US airspace."
"I shall give an answer precisely about that incident in a moment."
"The last subject to have been mentioned is immigration."
"The subject of immigration certainly has to be addressed as a whole: illegal immigration on the one hand, and Europe’s integration and legal immigration policy on the other."
"The honourable Member who spoke on this subject mentioned national competences."
"We all know that national competences only cover the number of people who can be allowed to enter a particular Member State, but there is a willingness among the Member States to agree on certain common rules, and that is the aim of the Green Paper that we issued in January."
"Action by the European Union – rather than by individual countries – is therefore needed with regard to legal immigration as well, and not just illegal immigration."
"Of course, the number of immigrants to be allowed in is still left to the Member States’ discretion, and the Constitutional Treaty itself confirms this principle, as you all know."
"Lastly, on the specific matter of the KLM flight, we have received some information which will be the subject of a written reply that will soon be arriving from the Commission, from Mrs Ferrero-Waldner’s office to be precise."
"As I have been asked, I can, however, reveal the gist of the information that we have received."
"It says that the passenger data for that flight had not been forwarded on a Passenger Name Record (PNR) basis – on which basis the Commission would have been able to intervene – but on the basis of a bilateral agreement between Mexico and the United States known as the APIS agreement."
"In such a case, therefore, the Commission cannot interfere in an agreement between the United States on the one hand and Mexico on the other, precisely because the PNR agreement was not invoked, on which basis we could, of course, have intervened."
"These are the initial points that I have been given, but the written reply will, of course, be much more detailed."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Vice-President Frattini for being here today."
"I feel that what he has told us reveals a number of good objectives, but all too often the means for achieving them are not the most appropriate."
"I refer in particular to the need to fight illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings."
"All too often the fight has been carried on by means of summary judgments and expulsions, at times violating the non-refoulement principle and even denying people the right to asylum."
"I am referring in particular to the fact that on 14 April this year Mr Frattini met the EU Home Affairs Ministers to strengthen cooperation with Libya for the purpose of fighting illegal immigration."
"I have personally witnessed the treatment to which illegal immigrants are subjected in Libya – including those who are sent back there from a European country – and I have witnessed blatant violations of human rights."
"I ask whether the European Union intends to make use of such measures to fight illegal immigration."
"Mr President, I thank Commissioner Frattini for his presentation."
"The problem is, Commissioner, that there is a gap between your personal good faith, which I recognise, not to undermine privacy and data protection – and, indeed, the good faith of the Commission that, in the search for security, you will not forego that – and the reality of what is happening on the ground."
"Your pledges are under great strain, not least from the culture in European law enforcement communities, which is, at times, somewhat cavalier about data protection."
"In the context of the implementation of the principle of availability, of interoperability, of databases, of transfers to third countries – which become transfers to fourth countries – I do not see how you are going to be able to hold the line, because it is not happening at the moment."
"We have been waiting for years for rules on data protection in the third pillar, which we were promised at the end of this year."
"What can you do to create a climate of truly reinforced respect for strict data protection observances in this context of a huge pressure to dilute it, as we have just heard with regard to the PNR case?"
"Commissioner, I would like to put the following question to you."
"Whenever a crime takes place, the victim and perpetrator are in an unequal position."
"The state provides for the perpetrator by affording him legal protection, while the victim must obtain help alone."
"I am therefore delighted that today you explicitly emphasised your intention to devote special attention to the victims of organised crime."
"I am also pleased since the political programme of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and Euroopean Democrats highlights this very issue."
"I would therefore be interested to hear how the Commission will ensure more appropriate treatment of victims in the Member States."
". – Mr President, the first question concerns Libya, and I can briefly say that the Commission’s first report on Libya, which I set out to the Home Affairs Ministers precisely on 14 April, as Mr Catania has mentioned, highlighted some worrying factors."
"That report is available – it is certainly not secret – but precisely because of the issues and questions that arose during the meeting with the Home Affairs Ministers we decided to send a second technical mission to Libya to visit places where there are people who have been repatriated or are waiting to be able to come to Europe."
"The results of this second mission are not yet available, but the mission has already completed its work and I shall be referring to it at the next Council of Home Affairs Ministers on 2 or 3 June – I do not remember exactly when. There I shall put forward practical measures which will certainly be based on the need to provide protection – therefore in Libya as well – for the fundamental rights of people who have entered either legally or illegally and who in any case are entitled to be treated with dignity as human beings."
"Parliament will, of course, be kept informed on an ongoing basis."
"Regarding data protection, Baroness Ludford, you are well aware of the extent to which this subject is a constant concern of mine."
"One way to point out the right road is to say that personal data cannot be accessed except for the specific purposes for which access is permitted by law."
"We must not allow extensions by analogy: as it is permitted for certain purposes, we can extend it to other purposes too."
"That cannot be allowed."
"If we start being specific about this and saying, for instance, that only certain authorities are allowed access to people’s private data and not others, we will be starting to set out some guidelines."
"I shall just give one example, of which you are aware: the Home Affairs Ministers have asked me to give the investigative authorities greater powers to access existing databases."
"My reply is that access rights may be extended if in parallel we increase protection for those data through a proposal under the third pillar, which, I assure you, we are going to submit by the end of this year."
"In my view, the answer is ‘we have to be clear’."
"There are purposes that must be interpreted strictly, as lawyers say, so that if access to the data is allowed for one purpose, it cannot be allowed for another."
"That is the initial basis on which I have begun to work."
"My final topic is the victims of crime: we shall also submit proposals for giving financial assistance, not directly to individual victims, but for instance to organisations and institutions concerned with providing care – including psychological care – for those escaping from violence or people trafficking or fleeing from traffickers."
"There are many forms of assistance, including practical assistance, for individuals who have been victims of crime; we cannot maintain individual financial relationships, but we can develop them through specific institutions and organisations."
"We shall concern ourselves precisely with alleviating the effects on those who have suffered the tragic consequences of crime."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0236/2005)."
"We will be taking a number of questions to the Commission."
"Since the international quota system on textiles came to an end on 1 January 2005, and as a result of its cheaper labour and manufacturing costs, exports of certain Chinese clothing items to Europe have increased by more than 500%."
"Does the Commission accept that excessive Chinese clothing imports are causing 'market disruption' and that thousands of textile jobs could be at risk unless China limits its exports?"
"Will the Commission now invoke WTO rules and introduce an annual 7.5% limit on Chinese imports until 2008?"
". I am taking over this question on behalf of my colleague, Mr Mandelson."
"As a member of the WTO, China has benefited from the elimination of textile quotas since 1 January 2005."
"Import figures for the first months of 2005 show that Chinese exporters have availed themselves of the opportunities offered by the elimination of quotas."
"Taking account of serious concerns voiced by European textile manufacturers, trade unions and some Member States, the Commission opened investigations on 29 April, covering a number of products, to determine whether market disruption and disorderly development of trade have taken place as defined under the relevant Community legislation in accordance with China’s protocol of accession to the WTO."
"Following these investigations, the Commission may decide to open formal consultations with China."
"In that case China will be under an obligation to limit exports to the Community to certain specific levels, with a growth rate of, in general, 7.5%."
"Such measures may be effective for a period ending on 31 December, or for one year, depending on when the consultations have been requested."
"They may be reapplied if need be."
"I thank the Commissioner for his answer."
"From numerous media reports, it appears that the Commissioner with responsibility for trade is calling for restraint in this affair and has made a plea to avoid what he calls protectionist thinking."
"On the other hand, the United States Government has accepted a request from its textile industry to investigate the sharp increase in the import of textiles from China."
"The US Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez has promised a swift and fair inquiry."
"He said: ‘We want to do it quickly and we want to do it right’."
"What is so very different about EU textiles as to lead to what appears to be a very prudent approach by the Commission, rather than the swift and fair approach of the US?"
". The Commission is actively defending the interests of the European textiles industry, but the Commission wants to base its actions on facts and the rules of the WTO."
"The guidelines that were adopted and published in early April provide for swift procedures for analysing the question of whether or not safeguard measures are warranted in response to a surge in Chinese textile and clothing imports."
"These guidelines stipulate that, if justified by the facts, the Commission may open an investigation with a view to analysing whether the conditions for imposing safeguard measures are fulfilled."
"On 29 April, the Commission opened an investigation of nine categories of textiles and clothing imports."
"The Commission has stated that it will do its utmost to complete this investigation earlier than the maximum period provided for by the guidelines."
"In parallel, the Commission will hold informal consultations with the Chinese authorities with a view to finding a mutually satisfactory solution that would provide relief to the European industry and avoid a resort to safety measures."
"If these talks are not successful, the Commission reserves its right to request formal consultations with China via the WTO and, possibly, impose safeguard measures, if warranted by the facts."
"There have been requests for the application of the emergency procedure provided for by the guidelines."
"This would mean going directly to formal consultations with China via the WTO without an investigation, if there is evidence of irreparable damage to the EU industry in the absence of such a course of action."
"The Commission’s services are analysing these requests."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one of our main problems with trade with China at present is the currency situation."
"Could you envisage the Commission carrying out a study of this or producing a Green Paper showing us what effect market mechanisms in the monetary and financial sphere might have on China?"
". The facts being taken on board by the Commission at present relate to the import data which became available after the first three months of this year."
"The Commission awaited the import data rather than relying on the licensing arrangements."
"The second question that the Member asks about the currency situation is something that is not being considered under the current WTO rules."
"The United States, in a different context, has being referring to the currency situation in China, namely the Chinese peg, which United States commentators are saying is compounding the situation regarding exports from China."
"The question of currencies is a totally unrelated matter to the investigation under WTO rules."
"There are different expert analyses regarding what should or should not be done about the Chinese currency."
"It is not currently being considered under the rules of the WTO and this particular question."
"– Madam President, no one doubts that China is an important factor in the world trade system."
"I too am one of those who believe that it is preferable for China to be integrated into the disciplines of the World Trade Organisation than to be a free and unruly system."
"However, I would like to make three comments:"
"First, customs cooperation needs to be established promptly."
"This would significantly limit imports of Chinese counterfeit products and, more generally, would safeguard compliance by China with the rules and disciplines of the WTO."
"Secondly, how efficient is the December 2004 regulation?"
"Thirdly, what progress has been made with the safeguarding investigation as regards imports of textiles of Chinese origin?"
". The European Union is abiding by the rules of the WTO, which set out quite clearly what should be done at this particular stage."
"That is why Commissioner Mandelson awaited factual information regarding exports from China into the European Union for the first three months of this year."
"The Commission has now initiated further action."
"As a result of this particular action, a number of categories are now being investigated."
"However, as my colleague Mr Mandelson has pointed out, under the agreement in the WTO, Member States throughout the Union have had ten years to prepare for this."
"Therefore, it should not have come as a great surprise – or any surprise at all – that the Chinese exporters would avail of the opportunity."
"Furthermore, irrespective of what action might result as a consequence of the investigation now taking place, it can only last until 31 December 2008 in any event."
"I am not anticipating what decision might be reached as a result of these investigations; however, whatever happens, this can only last until the end of 2008."
"Furthermore, the honourable Member raised the question of customs cooperation."
"The fact-gathering that the Commission’s services have done gives details from all the Member States as to what the volume of imports from China has been in the first few months of this year."
"There has been good customs cooperation between the authorities in the relevant Member States and the Commission in order to provide that particular precise information on the real data regarding imports."
"Many air passengers, who book separate flights and accommodation on the Internet rather than through travel packages, do not have adequate protection against being stranded in another country or losing their money in the event of airline insolvency."
"The European Commission on 29 March 2005 said it was studying the problem and would examine the necessity for new legislation."
"Could the Commission inform me when the study will be completed and when proposals to protect millions of EU citizens who book on-line will be ready?"
". I am taking this question on behalf of my colleague, Mr Barrot."
"The Commission is at present studying the issue of airline insolvency."
"It has launched a study on the functioning of the internal market for air transport, which covers as a distinct part the issue of bankruptcy."
"In addition to providing the Commission with a database containing important information on relevant insolvencies in the EU air industry as of 1 January 2000, the consultant has been asked to consider the issue of passengers stranded due to bankruptcy."
"It will conclude on the need or not for a protection mechanism for airline passengers and examine possible options."
"The study is expected to produce its findings by the end of August 2005."
"Based on these conclusions, and if it is effectively confirmed that a large number of citizens are faced with a lack of protection, the Commission will decide on possible future actions."
"Thank you for that response."
"You indicated that this might be ready by August, which misses this year’s summer holiday period."
"I think you will agree with me that most European people expect support if the airline goes bankrupt and they appear to be stranded."
"They imagine – or believe – that they will be supported and that the airlines will give them assistance."
"They think that they are supported by their travel insurance, when in fact most of them are not; they think that if they have used a credit card to book it or have done so on the Internet, they are covered, but, again, they are not."
"Do you feel that the Commission ought to do some sort of publicity drive in advance of this summer holiday period to encourage people to have proper insurance?"
"If they are not covered, and an airline goes bankrupt, they will be put in a dire situation."
"People expect more of the airlines than they are apparently getting at the moment."
". The honourable Member is right in highlighting this particular lacuna in the existing legislation."
"As he will know, the Package Travel Directive covers travel as part of the total package."
"However, as he has pointed out, in the specific instance where a consumer has purchased his or her flight separately from the package, it is not covered."
"That means that the difficulties mentioned can arise."
"That is why the Commission carried out a study in this particular area."
"The first part of the consultancy is being done by Commissioner Barrot, and will cover the general review of regulations in this regard."
"The second part will deal with the possibility of bankruptcies and what should be done when they occur."
"I should also point out that DG Sanco is carrying out an ongoing review of the Package Travel Directive, which will also deal with this issue."
"Since 2000 there have been 40 such bankruptcies, but the method of dealing with them varies between Member States."
"Some Member States take it upon themselves to look after their stranded nationals."
"Others have agreements with each other."
"Therefore, it is necessary that we review this in its entirety."
"Hopefully, we will have the consultancy study by this summer."
"Commissioner Barrot will then propose some amendments, if he thinks necessary, on the basis of the study."
"Madam President, does the Commissioner believe that this problem could be resolved if the companies involved were required to take out insurance?"
"Secondly the situation as regards the pricing structure for flights is currently very unclear, because airport charges and many other levies often have to be added to the prices charged on the Internet."
"Do you think that consideration might be given to how consumers might be given real, fixed prices for flights?"
". I should like to point out that, whether or not one has insurance, it does not necessarily mean the standard passenger involved would be flown back."
"He or she might have the insurance to get compensation later, but it would be no use to him or her when the actual event occurs."
"The study being done will look at all aspects and I am sure we will put forward proposals to address some of these problems."
"As you know, one of the great successes of opening up markets in Europe in recent years has been the airline industry."
"People can fly around Europe now for very little, compared to a short number of years ago, and that has been good for consumers in general."
"Of that there is no doubt."
"All these matters will be looked at in the consultancy study."
"Why has the Commission, in accordance with the spirit and purpose behind Article I-5 of the Constitution for Europe, not yet considered the possibility of holding technical discussions, along the lines of the established European ‘conciliation’ procedure, with a three-member delegation designated by the Greek Government, regarding those provisions of the ‘primary shareholder’ law with which it disagrees before sending off a reasoned opinion in reply to the letter from the Greek Government of 6 April 2005?"
". In line with established practice in similar cases, the Commission would like to underline that it has been in contact with the Greek Government before sending its letter of formal notice and its reasoned opinion."
"The national authorities, including members of the Greek Government, have thus had several opportunities to present their arguments in meetings with the Commission."
"Article 15 of the Constitutional Treaty establishes the principle of sincere cooperation between the Union and Member States."
"It requires the fulfilment on behalf of both parties of their task described in the Constitution in full mutual respect."
"A procedure involving technical discussions between the Commission and a three-member delegation of a Member State government, as suggested by the honourable Member, is not foreseen therein."
"I was surprised by the Commissioner’s reply just now."
"There is no Constitution to use, it has not been ratified by the people of Europe."
"Why is he quoting a constitution?"
"What is wrong with the Treaty?"
"– Madam President, I wish to thank Commissioner McCreevy for the answer which he has given me and also to thank his colleagues."
"I would like to say the following:"
"First, I conclude from his answer that Commissioner McCreevy and the Commission are always open to dialogue and that is a very, very positive point."
"Secondly, as far as my reference to Article 1.5 of the Constitution is concerned, of course I too recognise that the Constitution has not yet been ratified; however, the Constitution introduces the principle of dialogue and cooperation which, I note, is something accepted by Mr McCreevy."
". Of course, the Commission is still open to discussion on this matter with the Greek authorities."
"There have been some discussions at the level of my services and I have had meetings with members of the Greek Government."
"Of course we would like to bring this matter to a conclusion, but I must point out to the honourable Member and to the Greek authorities that we have been very specific in our request to the Greek authorities."
"They know what they are required to do."
"We have proceeded on that particular basis."
"– Commissioner, this issue of the basic shareholder is very dangerous."
"If this spreads throughout Europe, it will mean control of the press."
"Precisely, the government has problems with the press in Greece and wishes to control it."
"At present we have privileged conditions for foreign companies."
"The competent Minister said as much: 'Do not concern yourselves with what we are doing in Greece, foreign companies benefit'."
"We want Greek companies to have the same facilities as companies in the other states."
"If this continues, I think it will be circumventing the major element of justice."
"Therefore, protect Greek Companies from the government's position of wanting to control them."
". It has been pointed out to the Greek authorities that the Commission believes that this law infringes both the EU directives and the Treaty itself."
"We have pointed out to the Greek authorities that neither the article in the constitution nor the law are compatible with either the EU directive or with the Treaty provisions."
"We also pointed out that the same applied to the previous law, which was not implemented or executed."
"We sent a letter of formal notice to the Greek authorities on 23 March, they replied on the same date."
"From that, we saw the case they had put forward."
"Then, on 28 April, we sent our reasoned opinion."
"That is the situation."
"Of course, we need to have dialogue with the Greek authorities, but they know our position on this matter."
"Various opinion polls suggest that citizens do not feel themselves to be closely involved in the European Union or with its institutions."
"The information campaigns and the debate being held on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe in connection with the various referenda risk being obscured by other issues, including Turkey's potential accession and the question of whether or not to approve the directive on services."
"Does the Commission recognise that the debate on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe lacks the necessary clarity? What methods of communication does it intend to use to get across the message about the European Union and its benefits to citizens?"
". The Commission strongly supports the ratification of the Constitution and will play an active part in informing European citizens about its content, with the support of the European Parliament."
"The Commission is undertaking ten specific communication initiatives."
"They range from the wide distribution of the text of the Constitution for free; the Constitution website; training for national and regional journalists; round table discussions with civil society; information actions targeted at universities and schools, such as European Spring Day, and support for the production of radio and television programmes; to targeting the use of the Europe Direct call centre; mobilising our networks of multipliers in various policy areas; undertaking detailed opinion poll analyses and focus group research and, last but not least, supporting the information campaigns in the Member States."
"I fully understand the concern of the honourable Member that the debate on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe lacks the necessary clarity."
"Precisely because they have been well aware of this risk, the Commission, Parliament and the Heads of State and Government decided to get involved in the debate from the very beginning and to implement in good time information campaigns on the Constitution which, while respecting the national specificities of each Member State, would inform the citizens and encourage them to take part in the debate and the referendums."
"We must use every communication tool available to allow our citizens to make informed choices based on the content of the Constitution."
"I want the debate to be based on facts rather than the many myths that are circulating."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the Commissioner for her response."
"I do, of course, understand that you are stating how you are trying to explain to the public what this is really about, but what causes me concern is that information is readily interpreted as propaganda."
"If that is the case, you can end up with the opposite effect of what you were trying to achieve."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner what efforts are being made to prevent information from being turned into propaganda, in other words to include in the information both the positive and negative aspects of the present draft Constitution."
"I think that the public should be given both sides so that they can take the right decision."
". We are not involved in issuing propaganda."
"I have been very clear that the Commission as an institution should not be involved in issuing propaganda."
"That is why we are concentrating on making, for example, the full text of the Constitution, translated into the different languages, available and accessible to ordinary citizens to read for themselves."
"In some cases, our material may only be a summary of the text, or the full text."
"We make it clear that people can ask questions and that the services are available to citizens."
"The rest has to be part of, I hope, an informed debate in each and every Member State, where the ‘yes’ and ‘no’ sides will be fully represented."
"We have really made it clear that we should not be issuing propaganda."
"We have limited our work to ensure that we can contribute to this informed and factual debate on the Constitution."
"I wonder whether the Commissioner shares my frustration at the Janus face of Member States on this issue, where on the one hand they complain about lack of knowledge by their citizens of EU activity, and then on the other hand frustrate the European Commission in terms of distributing information."
"Now that the British general election is out of the way, will the Commissioner hold new talks with the British Government to discuss how factual information can be distributed in the UK about the work of the European Union, and in particular about the contents of the Constitution?"
". We have always tried to maintain an open and honest dialogue with the UK Government, not least on information, but we also respect the will and plans and strategies of each and every Member State."
"It would be very unfortunate if we were seen to be trying to force upon a Member State anything that would then be seen as propaganda or to be trying to interfere with a debate under way in a specific Member State."
"We instead offer our support, our help, the material and all the facts that we can make available to each and every Member State."
"I hope that we will continue these talks and see how best we can help the UK Government with information on the Constitution, but the strategy always has to be a national one."
"We can assist, help and back up the national strategies, and that is how it has been planned up until now."
"Madam President, Commissioner, in the Basque Country we have already voted on the Constitutional Treaty and we have voted in favour, but one of the things I have noticed is that those who opposed the Constitution argued that the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights reduced the rights already enjoyed by the citizens of the majority of the Member States, particularly in the field of housing, work, etc."
"I would like to ask you what we could do amongst all of us, including the Commission, to ensure that the citizens of Europe understand that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is an addition to the rights already guaranteed by the Constitutions of the States and that European citizenship is an addition to the citizenships of the Member States."
". Not only that, but by putting it in the Constitution, these rules and fundamental rights will be legally enforceable to European citizens."
"That is another argument that has to be put to our citizens. We try to do it in different ways."
"The best way is often to show the text as it is so that people can read for themselves what are actually set out as fundamental rights for European citizens and explain what that means."
"We can also do that through information on the web-page or other information materials that we have."
"There is a constant dialogue with citizens in trying to explain and discuss it with them."
"You did that successfully in Spain. We are grateful to Spain for that."
"You set an example."
"In many Member States they actually advertise the full text of the Constitution, including the fundamental rights."
"There is increasing criticism of the Commission’s public relations activities."
"What does it plan to do to improve relations with the media and to bring EU-related public relations activities closer to citizens?"
". The Barroso Commission has proposed a partnership for a renewed European order to tackle the complex challenges ahead, where vision, leadership and delivery are the key elements for building renewed trust and confidence."
"The only way to develop this partnership is by bringing in the European citizens and taking their interests into account."
"The first responsibility of the present Commission is, therefore, to connect with citizens."
"Let me add immediately that this is not just the Commission’s responsibility."
"In fact, it is very much the responsibility of all players: Parliament, the Council and the Member State governments."
"The Commission will, therefore, put forward a White Paper on communication, which will address the role of all involved and which will give the other institutions the possibility to define and organise their input."
"The Commission for its part will pursue a new approach on communication, which will focus on the need to interest Europeans in EU politics."
"This demand-driven communication approach has to involve a better understanding of target audiences and those who act as multipliers, a better use of modern and effective communication tools and techniques, and a more professional attitude to all our communication work."
"What the Commission will have to do first is to improve its listening process."
"The Commission needs to make better use of its polling and intelligence services – if I may call them that – in its consultation procedures and to use its communication tools according to the needs and interests of its audiences."
"In order to reach people, the communication of political priorities will be adapted to demographic and national specificities, instead of taking the classical one-size-fits-all approach."
"Our representation offices in the Member States will have a central role to play here."
"The Commission will explain its policies and their impact on EU citizens’ daily lives and communicate the tangible benefits of Europe rather than overload people with technical information."
"Last, but not least, the Commission will encourage and support efforts to establish and improve a dialogue with Europeans."
"The Commission will, therefore, need to professionalise its communication activities."
"That involves improving research, planning, coordination and evaluation of communication activities and making better use of the excellent communication tools the Commission has at its disposal and the representations in the 25 Member States."
"Communication will be integrated into the Commission’s working culture and into policy formulation from the very beginning, and this needs to be maintained throughout the whole political process."
"Since communication is an across-the-board challenge, all actors – from the European institutions and Member States to civil society and the media – have a role to play."
"Interinstitutional cooperation is a key element."
"The Commission has kept Parliament regularly informed on the development of the communication strategy, which was also discussed at the last meeting of the Interinstitutional Group on Information and in the Committee on Culture and Education during the discussion on the Herrero-Tejedor report."
"The Commission will invite the European Parliament and the Council to comment on its White Paper."
"The Commission will also continue to improve relations with the media, in particular regional and local media in the Member States, as a key element for ensuring that information reaches the citizens."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I think the Commission’s public information policy has two dangers to contend with: the first is that of excessive reliance on a few major languages, of which English is one, and the second is concentration on Brussels, or centralisation in it."
"What is the Commission planning to do to make information less centralised, and to make Commissioners more readily and directly available to the press in the Member States?"
"There is, of course the ‘Europe Direct’ network of information centres; only this last weekend, I was present at the opening of one in Furth im Wald, and it is splendid."
"There are, though, still too few of them, particularly in the new Member States."
"I would like to ask whether the network will cover the whole of Europe this year?"
". Mr Posselt is absolutely right about the risk of this becoming too narrow or too Brussels-centric, and that has been part of the problem until now."
"We face a huge challenge in dealing with 20 official languages, and this is something that will remain a huge challenge for us."
"In preparing this new communication strategy, we have been guided by the concept of ‘going local’, that is to say reaching out locally and regionally through our representation offices."
"We have to equip those offices in such a way – and work and plan in such a way – that they can ‘go local’ and communicate with local media."
"Our contacts with the national parliaments will also help."
"We have to make sure that European affairs are anchored in local and national political traditions and party systems."
"They will have to understand European affairs and how this affects the way they work and their tasks."
"I agree with you that these are challenges."
"We are already concentrating on trying to solve these two issues."
"Citizens of Member States have a tendency to view the EU as far removed and abstract, despite the fact that the European Union has substantial influence on many areas of their daily lives."
"According to the latest published Eurobarometer survey, which carried out its fieldwork in November 2004, approximately one third of Europeans have never even heard of the Constitution."
"There is also a huge problem of misinformation."
"As we have seen in France, discussions concerning the Constitution are often too closely associated with separate issues such as Turkey's accession to the EU."
"How is the Commission providing clear communication to citizens on the Constitution?"
"Will the Commission commit to doing more to dispel the myths currently circulating about the Constitution?"
". It is correct that Eurobarometer Special 214 ‘the future Constitutional Treaty’ reveals that 67% of citizens have already heard of the Constitution and that 33% have not."
"Furthermore, according to that Eurobarometer, 75% of those who know the Constitution well are in favour and even 60% of those who have only a modest knowledge are favourable."
"However, the support of those who have never heard about the Constitution so far is only 22%."
"The conclusion is clear."
"There is a vital need to communicate on this cornerstone project for the future of the European Union."
"As you know, the main responsibility for communicating about the Constitution lies with Member States."
"Nevertheless, the European Commission is determined to undertake all the actions necessary to inform citizens about the content of the Constitution, but also about its importance for the future of the Union."
"We have therefore developed this strategy that I have mentioned before, consisting of ten initiatives which form an integrated concept, and support and enhance each other."
"They are: the distribution of the text of the Constitution for free; a Constitution website; training for national and regional journalists; round table discussions with civil society; information to universities and schools; support for the production of radio and television programmes and targeting the use of the ‘Europe direct’ call centre."
"Our eighth action involves mobilising our networks of multipliers in various policy areas."
"The ninth consists in undertaking detailed opinion poll analysis and focus group research, and the tenth in supporting the information campaigns of the Member States."
"Through these initiatives, we are seeking to develop an informed debate based on the contents of the Constitution."
"Members of the European Parliament and individual Member States also have a crucial role to play."
"Thank you for that reply, Commissioner."
"In Ireland we are obliged to have a referendum."
"A former colleague of mine, a Minister, who was campaigning in a previous referendum was told: ‘If you don’t have those lorries moved from the end of the cul-de-sac, I am not voting.’"
"That is the extent of the engagement of some people in this campaign."
"The two biggest issues around the Constitutional Treaty are firstly, that 60 million Europeans died in the first half of the last century because we did not have an integrated Europe and secondly, not only governments and parliaments but civil society were involved in the formation of this Constitutional Treaty."
"The institutions of this Union have spoken."
"Never mind the cynics!"
"You have a job to do: go out and sell it and give Member States every assistance you can to sell it."
"I would ask you to get a task force together of top-drawer implementers of communications to assist you in that."
". You used your 30 seconds well, Mr Mitchell."
"I will do what is incumbent on us as a European institution to contribute and ensure that we assist Member States."
"The basic strategy has to be a national one."
"You in Ireland are best placed to know about the sensitivities and the kinds of questions and debates you can have with your citizens."
"But we will do our best, in a professional way, to contribute, to assist you and to give you the backing and the material you need, and we are fully involved in doing so."
"Your list of ten points of action in terms of promoting information about the Constitution are very welcome."
"It seems to me there is one omission: there is no provision for rebutting false information."
"It is absolutely urgent that we establish across the whole of the European Union, using the network of Commission offices, a system whereby we can respond immediately when myths and lies are told about the European Union, and particularly about the content of the Constitution."
"There is no point in responding 20 days or two months later, because then the myth has become stuck in reality."
"You need to respond instantly."
". We have started a rebuttal service."
"I agree with you that this is very important because sometimes pure lies are presented about the text of the Constitution."
"We are engaged in a rebuttal service."
"Perhaps we should make it more visible that we have started such a service."
"It is based very much around responding to statements that come up in the UK media."
"You can find it on the UK Representation’s website."
"I agree that it is very important."
"Has the Commission no shame in trying to ride to success in the referendum campaign on the back of emotion and sentiment, such as the Commissioner deployed in her speech at the commemoration ceremony for the liberation of the concentration camp of Terezin at the weekend?"
"Does the Commission not have any appreciation that the opponents of the Constitution are just as proud of the defeat of Nazism as anyone else and that we take great offence when she tries to hijack and monopolise that sentiment in order to advance the political agenda of seeking to promote this Constitution?"
". I am sorry, but do the UK media have no shame in publishing such absolutely desperate lies?"
"I never said such a thing, but it does not help if they have written it."
"They have lied; they have made things up."
"I just feel sorry for you because you have been misled by pure lies in the British media."
"I just want everybody here to know that this is a pure lie."
"They have made up some kind of title or headline in the newspapers that is totally wrong."
"A lot of people were there, so you will know exactly what I said."
"In a draft report on the EU's information and communication strategy (PE 355.447v01-00), the European Parliament has proposed that the Institutions 'should reach agreements with independent television producers able to devise drama series, competitions, films, news reports and in general all kinds of high-quality and accessible programmes which appeal to popular taste and serve to promote the idea and values of Europe' (Paragraph 11)."
"In COM(2004)0196 final, the Commission stated that there was a need to provide information about the EU's ideas and values."
"The Commission observed that the audiovisual sector plays an important role in this work and that cofinancing of audiovisual programmes on the EU should be continued (p. 18)."
"Does the Commission consider this to be the right time for cofinancing of TV programmes as part of the Commission's objective of informing citizens in the specific fields proposed by the Committee on Culture and Education, that is drama series, competitions, films and news reports?"
"What are the costs of the relevant budget items for the Commission's present information and communication strategy?"
"Madam President, the greatest challenge for the Commission in terms of communication is to reach out to 450 million people in the EU using limited resources."
"According to Eurobarometer’s latest full report, TV is far and away the most popular source of information for people in all 25 Member States when it comes to issues concerning the EU."
"Radio follows closely in third place, with higher percentages in the new Member States, making the audio-visual media the most effective channels for spreading information about the European Union."
"With a view to giving people factual and other information about the EU, its policy areas and the decisions and measures it adopts, the Commission has, every year since 2003, published an invitation to submit proposals for the cofinancing of high-quality and accessible programmes which appeal to popular taste and which at the same time serve to promote the EU’s ideas and values."
"The total budget for 2004 amounted to EUR 6.7 million."
"Of the project proposals submitted by radio and TV companies or producers, 79 projects were selected."
"For 2005, the invitation to submit proposals applies only to radio, and the budget for that activity amounts to EUR 3.9 million."
"Subsequently, agreements will be drafted, regulating the forms to be taken by this cooperation between radio and TV companies or producers and the Commission."
"In devising their projects, applicants are free to choose the type of programmes they prefer to produce and transmit."
"The formats can include not only drama series, game shows, films and news reports but also debates."
"So far, no candidates have chosen to develop projects for drama series, game shows or films."
"This is borne out by the results of the Commission’s latest quality studies and opinion polls carried out in the EU’s 25 Member States."
"The aim was to provide an overview of what Europeans want and expect in terms both of form and content."
"TV viewers do not actually regard films, drama series or game shows as the ideal way of supplying information about the EU. Instead, they turn out to prefer current affairs shows, live coverage, documentaries and, above all, factual and informative news items in more general news programmes."
"They may also be interested in historical documentaries, arts programmes and films, but to a significantly lesser degree."
"The applicants are always entirely free to choose what type of programme they want to produce, provided that it helps communicate the European message to people."
"Madam President, I wish to thank you for that extremely informative answer."
"I just have one more small question, and that is as to whether the Commission can guarantee that the information is objective."
"You say that it is entirely up to those who make the programmes to decide about the content."
"Is there no requirement of balance and objectivity?"
"Madam President, we proceed on the basis that the partners we cooperate with each abide by their Member State’s laws on balance or, rather, objectivity."
"We cannot impose further demands. All we can do is extend an invitation and solicit offers to make programmes, but programme-makers must of course comply with national laws concerning editorial freedom and, of course, objectivity."
"Commissioner, will the NGOs that misuse public funds – and I am thinking, in particular, of an NGO in Ireland whose job it is to work in the developing world, which put up ‘say no to NATO’ signs during the last Nice Treaty referendum – face any sort of sanctions or censure from the Commission, particularly if they are using public funds when they should be looking after Third World issues and development issues of that kind?"
". It is very difficult to comment on a specific case when I do not know the detailed circumstances, but I do not think we should be afraid of an open debate with those who disagree with us and we should welcome a lively debate on different issues."
"If we work with civil society, with NGOs, we will always also have them criticising us, but that is part of the democratic procedure."
"I am used to working, for example, with environmental NGOs and we give a lot of support to NGOs."
"I was constantly criticised by them, but this is actually their role."
"They should also keep up the pressure on us and they should keep an eye on what we are doing, and we have to accept that there is a debate."
"I do not know your specific case and why this is a problem at all."
"But if we give money or ask for calls for proposals, then we have to be very specific about what it is that we expect in return; and probably in this case there was something wrong in that respect."
"Madam President, it seems as if Commissioner Wallström and quite a number of those who have taken part in the debate in this House are of the view that the press in the European Union and perhaps also radio and television have a strong bias against the draft Constitution."
"I must ask whether that is Commissioner Wallström’s view, because my distinct impression is exactly the opposite, namely that there is a huge bias throughout Europe in favour of the ‘yes’ camp, which dominates the press."
"What is curious is that the opposite is presented as being the case."
"Madam President, Mr Lundgren, I do not think I stated anything at all about a bias towards one side or the other."
"We have of course talked about trying to extract facts and information about the Constitution and helping journalists understand better and obtain all the information they need to be able, as I see it, to conduct a debate that addresses both the ‘yes’ and ‘no’ arguments."
"The fact is that it is extremely important to have independent media and a lively debate on the issue."
"I have no view, then, as to whether there is bias in one direction or the other."
"What we are trying to help ensure is that there is access to information, as well as educational material if needed, for journalists too so that they can learn, for example, how the European institutions operate."
"I do not wish to express an opinion as to whether there is bias one way or the other. I just want to ensure I contribute to a well-informed debate."
"Does the Commission agree that greater and urgent emphasis needs to be placed on highlighting the benefits of a ‘yes’ vote to the Constitutional Treaty, rather than labouring the consequences of a ‘no’ vote; and will the Commission outline how it is communicating the positive message to the citizens of the EU?"
"Question No 36 will be answered in writing."
"On 22 March 2005 the Greek Minister for the Environment, Mr Souflias, stated that the former Hellinikon Airport in Athens would not be converted in its entirety into a park for the capital because – according to him – Greek taxpayers could not be asked to pay for the construction and maintenance of such a park; this meant that at least 100 hectares would be developed."
"The inhabitants of Athens have to contend with very poor air quality, since it is the EU capital with the lowest proportion of green space per inhabitant."
"Has the Greek Government asked the Commission to co-fund the construction of this park?"
"Do the other major cities of the European Union have parks?"
". Under the third Community support framework for Greece, there are two operational programmes – ‘Environment’ and ‘Attica’ – that include actions relating to the habitation of urban sites as well as support for leisure parks and green areas."
"According to the information currently available to the Commission, the Greek authorities have not proposed the cofinancing of a metropolitan park on the site of the old Hellinikon Airport, nor has such a project been approved under the two above-mentioned operational programmes."
"As you will know, the choice of project proposals is the responsibility of the Greek authorities."
"It is still possible, under the current financial perspective, for the Greek authorities to propose the above-mentioned projects if they considered that appropriate."
"With regard to the last part of the question: yes, there are metropolitan parks in many major cities of the European Union."
"– Commissioner, in our country you are known as the 'iron lady' who takes decisions on programmes and on suspending payments."
"Therefore you, the 'iron lady' should uphold your reputation by helping the Greek Government to see things as they really are."
"Athens, with the Parthenon, once the most beautiful city in the world, is today an endless concrete jungle."
"If you go up to the Parthenon, all you see is concrete."
"You should make the Greek Government understand that the area must not be developed."
"Apartment blocks must not be built; there is not a strip of green in the whole of Athens."
"Help Athens, help the mayors, you will be setting an example for Greece."
"We need that park."
". It was more a comment than a suggestion."
"Tomorrow, we are meeting with the representative of the Greek Government."
"On other occasions also, I will share your views with the Greek authorities."
"– Madam President, the project of the biggest metropolitan park in any city in Europe, bigger even than Hyde Park, is being implemented in agreement and cooperation with the mayors of the Hellenikon area in general."
"This is a sign of democratic morals, a participative perception and respect for local authorities on the part of the Greek minister with material jurisdiction, Mr Souflias."
"I have no wish to believe that Mr Karatzaferis would want, as far as the financing of the project is concerned, to transfer resources from the Greek regions to this specific area of Athens."
". That was not a question, but a comment, and I listened carefully to it."
"I want to say that one of the features of the structural funds is partnership."
"Certainly, any parks or any urban sites open to the general public usually require a lot of partnership, not only at the planning stage of such an investment but also on completion, in terms of the management and maintenance of such parks."
"I hope that this idea is an example of an opportunity for many representatives of different institutions in Greece to get together and really to think about whether this is entirely necessary."
"I listened carefully to your comments."
"A study carried out by the Kassel College of Higher Education in July 2004 on German regional aid (EU and German federal programmes) shows that up to 96% of the appropriations paid in subsidies have no lasting impact in economic terms owing to geographical relocations and the deadweight effect."
"The current proposal for a regulation laying down general provisions (COM(2004)0492 final) seeks to prevent subsidies being paid for business relocation during the new programming period."
"However, this scheme relates only to the 7-year period during which the subsidised investment has to remain in a given location."
"How will it be possible for the relocation of a business before that period to be taken into account under this scheme?"
"How would it be possible to prevent subsidies being used solely for relocation?"
". In the structural funds, in the regulations and also in practice, there are mechanisms in place that discourage the relocation of firms that have benefited from structural funds."
"Under current regulations there is a provision which clearly states that a firm which relocates within five years of using the funds must reimburse the aid it received."
"This mechanism will be maintained after 2006; however, we are proposing to lengthen that period from five to seven years."
"We are also adding a provision that any firm required to reimburse money will not be entitled to receive support from the funds in the future."
"This proposal is currently under negotiation and discussion in the Council."
"The regulation envisages the situation that when major project – above EUR 25 million in the case of the environment and EUR 50 million in the case of transport and substructure – are adopted, the Commission also asks the Member State, under cost-benefit analysis, to provide information about any jobs being created or lost in the regions concerned in the context of a given project."
"So we are taking this issue into account as well."
"With future regulations, the Commission intends to play a more active role in monitoring, which would mean we can gather information on any on-going relocation processes and deliver it to Member States."
"The latest information on this mechanism currently under consultation with the Member States involves the state aid rules for competition."
"DG Competition at the Commission has also sought comments from Member States on the issue of relocation."
"The Commission is currently analysing the Member States’ positions."
"Madam Commissioner, the mechanism you have described has to do with the permanence of the investment rather than with any relocation that may already have taken place."
"Decisions on where to base a business are always taken in response to market considerations – infrastructure, the market to which the firm intends to sell, the tax position in different places and the state of the labour market, but subsidies do not enter into it."
"This is something that European regional policy must take into account, as these subsidies are primarily windfall gains."
"In terms of getting the European ideal accepted, they are absolute poison, particularly in the regions affected by site closures, and their end product is in fact nothing whatever; they produce neither additional jobs nor added economic potential."
"Nevertheless, let me again ask the Commissioner: what additional mechanisms can we bolt on to exclude the possibility of subsidies being given to firms that have already relocated?"
". My responsibility covers the structural funds."
"I understood your question in terms of the contribution of structural funds, which implies investment with the use of funds."
"To the extent that we have authority over the use of funds, we include the challenge of relocation."
"However, I cannot act in the broader context of relocation processes in general."
"That is why I limited my answer to the link between the structural funds and potential relocation processes."
"The Commission is proposing, for regions that have exceeded the 75% GDP criteria because of economic development (the ‘natural effect’ regions), that they be subject to a ‘phasing-in’ process (into the Competitiveness strand) as opposed to a ‘phasing-out’ process (from the Convergence strand) as is the case for similar regions under the current programming period."
"The Commission's proposal is very restrictive for these regions, as their development needs are better addressed by the measures set out under the Convergence strand as opposed to the measures in the Competitiveness strand."
"Would the Commission accept the proposal from the natural effect regions that they should be subject to a ‘phasing-out’ process from Convergence, without any additional financial resources other than those already provided for these regions in the Commission's proposal?"
". As you know, the phasing-in regions are regions that would normally have benefited from the highest Community support, over many years, allowing them to finance all those investments which are necessary to enable them to participate fully in the single market and to create conditions in which companies can operate smoothly."
"Once those conditions are in place, priority should be given to other competitiveness factors, such as knowledge, innovation, research and development, and also the quality of human capital."
"These are in fact the key areas where we propose concentrating Community assistance, in line with the integrated guidelines on jobs and growth which the Commission proposed and the presidency concluded at the Spring European Council."
"So the natural logic is that we should move to different priorities."
"The second issue is, of course, limited resources."
"Under Objective 2 and the phasing-in transitional scheme, we will have very limited resources, requiring strong targeting of support."
"The critical mass for growth and competitiveness must be reached as soon as possible."
"But I must point out that the menu of priorities the Commission proposes under the regulations does not prevent regions from investing in infrastructure to strengthen the secondary networks."
"This could include improving links to trans-European networks – to regional railways, airports, ports and also multimodal platforms providing radial links to main railway lines – and promoting regional and local inland waterways."
"The Commission is, therefore, ready to examine the possibility of introducing a degree of flexibly in the definition of the scope of use of the funds in the phasing-in regions."
"Consequently, the compromise text of the presidency has already been modified on this point and would allow for a derogation."
"Such a derogation will have to be duly justified and could concern some priorities financed under the convergence objective."
"But that could also mean social infrastructure, such as education, health and, possibly, some missing links in the transeuropean networks."
"So this is all possible."
"It will have to be justified – most likely on a case-by-case basis – but we are opening up this possibility."
"Thank you for your answer, Commissioner."
"The natural effect regions will see some hope in the reply you have just given."
"It is important to stress that these regions, despite the progress, are still structurally and infrastructurally handicapped."
"It is illogical to use different strands of the cohesion policy to tackle their socio-economic problems."
"They are looking for exactly the same conditions as those regions that left Objective 1 in 2000."
"That is a just case, so I thank you for your answer and I see some flexibility there for the regions."
". In my travels through the regions of Europe I also visited regions that are victims of their own success."
"It would be natural to phase them in to Objective 2."
"I know that many of them continue to have problems."
"That is why we have tried to open up the possibility of broadening the scope of the type of investment."
"When it comes to eligibility for Objective 1 or Objective 2, I do not see any possibility at this stage of a shift from one group to the other."
"We discussed this many times."
"We also had many talks with many Member States."
"We consulted on those issues."
"I do not see the possibility of doing more for these regions today."
"However, there is still potential for Parliament; there are still ongoing negotiations in the Council."
"I cannot say that nothing is possible, but I am not very optimistic in this respect."
"Greece has stopped submitting applications for payments since the beginning of the year until negotiations with the Commission concerning the changes to the system of monitoring contracts and the irregularities identified in projects during the period 2000-2004 are completed."
"At the same time, articles in the Greek press report that the Greek Finance Ministry is to undertake another review of the 3rd CSF, which is to be approved by the Commission."
"What is the outcome of the negotiations between the Greek Government and the Commission concerning the irregularities which occurred during the four-year period from 2000 to 2004?"
"Will any resources be lost?"
"If so, how much and from which programmes?"
"Which programmes is the Greek Government proposing for cuts and which does the Commission consider should be cut because of a low take-up rate of funding? What percentage of their resources will be transferred to other programmes?"
". It is much broader than just a review of the Third Community Support Framework."
"I should like to tell Mr Papadimoulis what stage we are at."
"As you know, the Greek authorities provided at the due time a description of the entire management and control systems of the ERDF established in Greece."
"As a follow-up, in October 2003 an audit – carried out by the services of the Directorate-General for Regional Policy – confirmed the existence of serious deficiencies in the systems and the management process."
"We agreed an action plan with the Greek authorities; the final deadline for the implementation of the actions under the plan was the end of September 2004."
"The deliverables of the action plan have been analysed."
"The conclusion was that certain types of operations that were cofinanced and certain operations that were carried over from the Second to the Third Community Support Framework do not justify the contribution from the ERDF."
"We also confirmed the existence of serious failings in the management and control systems."
"As the Greek authorities did not investigate the irregularities and did not make the necessary financial corrections, the Directorate-General informed them of the possible suspension by the Commission of interim ERDF payments for specific measures of the operational programmes that were affected by the above-mentioned irregularities."
"Many meetings took place between January and May 2005 and, throughout this process, the Commission stressed the urgency of arriving at an overall solution that would allow payments to continue on a sound basis in the future."
"In response to your question, the amount of any correction will have to take full account of the audit findings, but the consequences in terms of loss of Community funds cannot be quantified at this stage."
"I can say that flat-rate corrections will be applied, in compliance with the regulations."
"Also, given that the discussions that have taken place have not led to an agreement so far, the Commission is currently proceeding with measures that may lead to suspension decisions."
"Nevertheless, we shall keep open the possibility of continued dialogue to find a solution."
"The next meeting with the Greek authorities will take place tomorrow."
"When the debate with the Greek authorities is closed I will be able to inform you in writing what programmes have been affected and to what extent."
"As far as the modification of the Third Community Support Framework is concerned, the Commission has been informed that the Greek Ministry of Finance intends to submit an application in the course of the year."
"So far, however, the Commission has received no proposals for transfers of funds between programmes."
"– Commissioner, I understand that negotiations are under way on the size of the cuts but have not been completed."
"Nonetheless, can the Commission give us an order of size based on its calculations – not a precise forecast – of the cuts under discussion, together with your forecast of when the talks in question with the Greek authorities will be completed?"
". I am sorry, but at this stage I am unable, in terms of the information available to me before tomorrow’s meeting, to say anything more concrete."
"However, I can repeat the promise that if we manage to find a solution by tomorrow - which is my dream - then I would inform you immediately."
"If not, you would of course be informed as to the size of the suspension, but at this stage I am unable to provide you with any data."
"– I should like to thank the Commissioner, Mrs Hübner, for remembering the informal agreement reached in the autumn of 2003 with the then Greek government on a legislative arrangement which would cover the problems presented by the law on public works."
"I also wish to thank her for the agreement, at the beginning of 2004, with the then Greek government, on the action plan to improve the Community Support Framework management system."
"However, I should like, with my thanks, to ask her a question: what happened next as regards the question of implementing the action plan with the new government after March 2004?"
"Can the Commissioner give me this information?"
". Perhaps I was not clear enough."
"There are two issues that were the subject of the audit and which were also presented as an outcome of the audit."
"There was not only the issue already mentioned; there were also serious failings in the management and control system, which led to the irregularities."
"Under the law on public works certain types of operations were cofinanced, and certain operations were carried from one Community support framework to another."
"These were not justified in terms of the eligibility to the contribution of the funds."
"The second issue was the failures in the management and control system which led to those systemic irregularities, particularly with regard to the ERDF."
"So we are moving on the change of the system of the loss so that we can have a sound system for the future."
"But we are also facing the challenge of what has happened so far under the existing system with failures."
"The past and the future are two different issues."
"What lessons does the Commission draw from the difficulties faced by MG Rover in the UK?"
". The question is very short but does not permit a very short answer."
"I think we should look at the issue from the short-term, medium-term and long-term perspective."
"In the short-term, as soon as the closure was announced, Commission officials reacted, and we were in close and frequent contact with our counterparts in the West Midlands."
"Our first priority was to identify the range of actions needed to alleviate the consequences of the closure."
"These actions are undertaken with a view to securing long-term growth prospects for the region."
"Let me stress very strongly that we have worked very closely over the last weeks with national and regional authorities, and this case demonstrates that we can cooperate if we want to help overcome this kind of tragic economic event."
"Working together, we can assist the regional efforts to regain economic strength."
"Then, in the medium term, the Commission decided to work with the European vehicle manufacturers and other stakeholders with a view to improving the competitiveness of the sector."
"To this end my colleague, Commissioner Verheugen, has set up a high-level group called ‘CARS 21’."
"The group is expected to present proposals on a competitive automotive regulatory system for the next ten years."
"In this group, we have industry representatives and also experts."
"For the long term, as you know, the issue of corporate restructuring and industrial policies is high on the European agenda these days, in line with the renewed Lisbon agenda."
"The Commission adopted, a few weeks ago, a communication on restructuring and employment, setting out measures to be developed or strengthened."
"It means that the European Union can mobilise as regards anticipating and managing corporate restructuring."
"Europe’s ministers for labour and employment and the European social partners have also met recently, again underlining the need to anticipate and work in partnership for successful corporate restructuring."
"I think it is important that they have concluded that successful restructuring requires a climate of trust."
"It requires good communication."
"By definition, this involves commitment from employers and employees in anticipating and managing change, seeking alternatives to lay-offs and exploring opportunities for training, out-placement and the creation of new activities."
"I think that the Rover case has also been a factor in demonstrating that we have to think seriously about restructuring in Europe."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your very comprehensive answer, particularly as I must confess that the question – I do not know if it was my office’s fault or that of someone else – was intended for Mr Verheugen and was aimed more at the industrial policy side of things."
"However, you very kindly covered a lot of these issues."
"In your own field, Commissioner, are you convinced that there is enough flexibility in the existing structural funds to provide regional aid, if appropriate, social fund monies for retraining and – slightly outside your area – research and development money, if a viable use can be found for the plant?"
". Frankly, we are not flexible enough."
"We have proposed in the future regulation, for example, setting up a kind of special reserve."
"I cannot remember how big it was supposed to be, but it would be a certain percentage of the funds."
"Then every Member State would have a reserve for cases like this and there would be no need to shift money between programmes or projects and become involved in a very complicated and bureaucratic process."
"Unfortunately, in spite of the Rover case, there is no support among the Member States for such a reserve."
"So we will be deprived of this kind of flexibility in the future."
"At the same time, not only through the funds but also in general, we have embarked on a process that would allow us to contribute to the European structure in such a way as to ensure that future structures, based on new factors of production and growth, would be more flexible."
"This would allow the industries to adjust in time and in an evolutionary manner, rather than leading to the kind of restructuring we are facing in the case of Rover."
"This is a question of flexible structures, which we can usually achieve if we base industrial development on modern factors, such as research and development, and modern technology."
"These structures are much more flexible than the old industry."
"Commissioner, I represent the West Midlands."
"I started my working life in the Longbridge plant that you have been talking about."
"I should first like to take the opportunity to thank you and your services very much for the prompt response that you referred to."
"It has been much appreciated by my region and the support that we have given to the people immediately affected."
"I should like to draw to your attention two points for you to reflect on."
"First, I am also privileged to be a member of the ‘CARS 21’ Group, to which you referred earlier."
"It is important that your services are also involved with Mr Verheugen in that. Important regional issues are involved."
"Secondly – and this is a lesson that I want to feed back to you from our experience in the West Midlands – restructuring the supply chain for industries, and particularly the SMEs, was something we started on."
"We did not necessarily get a lot of support from you in the beginning, but it is a lesson I hope you will take for other major industries later."
". I thank you very much for the ‘CARS 21’ Group."
"I understand I can go to Commissioner Verheugen and say that there is a request from the West Midlands that we should be there."
"I agree with you that we should be there to contribute and be aware of where we are going and to be able to contribute funds."
"Nobody is perfect, as we know."
"We all make mistakes."
"However, for the future, with the revitalised Lisbon approach, clearly we want to help, be innovative and contribute to the restructuring."
"I can tell you, using a Polish example, that restructuring in Poland came through SMEs, and the whole structural change in exports and imports also came through them."
"It is a good sector to support."
"Questions Nos 42 to 46 will be answered in writing."
"When will the Commission submit proposals to amend the Pharmaceuticals Regulation so as to facilitate the provision of reliable information to patients in an approved format that ensures high standards and avoids advertising?"
". The Commission considers the objective of providing patients with better information on medicinal products a high priority and is, therefore, working in different areas with a view to improving the situation."
"First of all, Article 88a of Directive 2001/83 calls upon the Commission to present to Parliament and the Council a report on current practice with regard to information provision – particularly on the Internet – and its risks and benefits for patients."
"The report will be prepared following consultations with patients' and consumers' organisations, doctors' and pharmacists' organisations, Member States and interested parties."
"It is due within three years of the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 2004/726/EC – which means by 2007 – but the Commission will do its best to present this report in advance of that deadline."
"In accordance with the results of the report, the Commission is to table proposals setting out an information strategy to ensure good-quality, objective, reliable and non-promotional information on medicinal products and other treatments and address the question of the information source's liability."
"Secondly, the G10 process: the report will also take into account experience from related activities in this area, such as the work of the European Medicines Agency with patient organisations, the public-private partnership under the G10 initiative and other relevant activities, such as the new European database on medicinal products."
"The Regulation I already mentioned calls upon the European Medicines Agency to set up a publicly accessible database, which will cover medicines authorised by the Community and by Member States."
"The database will facilitate the search for information already authorised for package leaflets and will contain a section on paediatric medicines."
"The final report will then need to address the question of whether, beyond the stocktaking of current practice, with its risks and benefits, an improved information strategy is needed and what elements could be included."
"The third matter is the European Union Public Health Programme running from 2003 until 2008, which has as its objective the creation of a comprehensive and reliable information and knowledge system."
"That is being created on the basis of a shortlist of agreed indicators for which data is collected mainly through Eurostat and ad hoc services and projects."
"Analysis of data is supported through the programme, leading to regular reporting on public health issues."
"All project reports are published on the Commission public health website."
"In addition, in order to improve the presentation and availability of information to the public, to specialised audiences and to patients, the Commission is at an advanced stage of preparing an EU public health portal, drawing together information at EU level, national and regional levels, and with resources from civil society."
"It is planned to launch this initiative before the end of this year."
"Commissioner Wallström is always welcome to the stage, but she may understand that we are a little disappointed that the Commissioner designated – to whom we tabled this question – is not here to answer it."
"Perhaps she could take a gentle message back asking him to turn up in future."
"I am grateful for the off-the-cuff response she has given me today: it is voluminous and helpful."
"However, she will understand – it is partly in the question – that patients feel the urgent need for more information about their condition, drugs and treatments."
"Too often they go to the Internet and get information that may be misleading or may be dangerous."
"Therefore, it is urgent that we have authorised and authenticated systems of information for patients."
"Perhaps the Commissioner could take back the message that the penalty for Commissioner Verheugen is to speed up the process even more."
". Mr Bowis, I will tell Mr Verheugen that you missed him."
"I can say also that I understand the question very well, because once upon a time I was a minister for health and social affairs; so I know that this issue is very important."
"I have only tried to put together the things that are now being prepared and in the pipeline."
"I understand that there will also be a continuous dialogue between Parliament and the Commission to ensure that we get a good and reliable information system in place."
"In connection with the employment and growth strategy, what legislative and non-legislative measures does the Commission plan to take to support small- and medium-sized undertakings?"
". As key drivers of innovation, job creation and competitiveness, small- and medium-sized enterprises have been firmly put centre stage in the recently adopted Growth and Employment Strategy."
"The Commission intends to present a new framework for SME policy in the second half of this year."
"Since the presentation of the Growth and Employment Strategy on 2 February, three initiatives of significant relevance to SMEs have already been taken."
"The first is better regulation."
"The Commission adopted, on 16 March, a communication on better regulation for growth and jobs in the European Union, one of its goals being to further reduce red tape."
"That is particularly relevant for SMEs because they have limited resources and suffer disproportionately from red tape."
"The Commission will refine the impact assessment tool, an important tool for considering the effect of EU legislation on SMEs."
"The economic analysis of these assessments will be improved, which will strengthen their quality and make a significant contribution to competitiveness."
"The Commission will also address regulatory excess in existing legislation."
"To get the best possible input to legislative simplification, we need to involve all stakeholders including SMEs."
"Based on their input we will draw up action plans for simplifying regulations per industrial sector."
"The Commission is initiating a test phase for a common approach to measuring administrative costs in the EU, an issue of particular importance to SMEs."
"Secondly, this is all about access to EU programmes for SMEs."
"On 6 April, the Commission adopted its remaining proposals for the new financial perspectives. They included two instruments of significance to SMEs: the EUR 4.2 billion Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP), and the EUR 70 billion Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development."
"The CIP is aimed fairly and squarely at SMEs."
"They will be the sole beneficiaries of the EUR 1 billion earmarked for the Community financial instruments and of the business and innovation support services, which will be provided through the European Union networks."
"SMEs will also be the primary beneficiaries of the entrepreneurial innovation activities."
"On the basis of experience of existing instruments, the Commission estimates that well over 70% of this competitiveness and innovation programme budget will be targeted to SMEs."
"To step up the involvement of SMEs in research and technological development, we will strive for increased SME participation also in the Seventh Framework Programme."
"Efforts are under way to simplify the programme's management, diminish the costs for submitting applications, reduce the delay to contract and secure more certainty for applicants."
"The proposed funds available for the programme, dedicated to SMEs, will be more than doubled in this framework programme, in comparison with the previous one."
"That will help SMEs with no or little research capacity to get input from research providers."
"Collaborative research remains the core and bulk of the framework programme."
"The choice of the nine themes will favour SME participation."
"On 16 April a new SME Envoy, Mrs Maive Ruth, was appointed."
"She is an official of the European Commission and will act as a contact point for SMEs, maintain a dialogue with SMEs and ensure that their interests are properly considered within all EU policies and programmes."
"– Thank you, Commissioner, for that exhaustive answer."
"The phenomenon against which we have to contend is the discrepancy between what happens, and what is felt by those to whom it happens, and so I would like you to tell us what measures are going to be taken as part of the information campaign in order to get the projects you have just described across to small and medium-sized businesses as quickly as possible, enabling them to prepare themselves for these projects?"
"Secondly, what, in practical terms, is going to be done about a timetable and a plan for implementing what is described under the headings ‘Reducing bureaucracy’, ‘Impact assessment’ and ‘Getting rid of over-regulation’?"
"We have heard the promise that there will be a new framework for SMEs, and I believe that there will be one; the only thing is that we are constantly being asked what is now actually happening in practical terms over and above what was decided on in the past, what the new framework that Commissioner Verheugen wants to bring in will be like, and what its actual priorities will be."
". I am sure Commissioner Verheugen would be better placed to give you exact dates."
"All this work has started."
"Recently I was in Prague and met with business representatives, who were really impressed."
"They said that for the first time they had heard some of the messages they wanted to hear about cutting red tape and understanding the conditions of small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"So at least they felt happy about what is coming out of the Commission so far."
"I know work on this has already started, for example, the inventory to look at access regulation that exists."
"Within the framework programme there are given dates for what you can apply, etc. The whole approach and the whole message on SMEs has really been absorbed by the Commission and the way we work."
"This is extremely important."
"This is where new jobs should be created in the future: in the small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"I can give you only a general answer."
"I will inform my colleague of your views."
"I was pleased that the Commissioner put emphasis on the whole question of better regulation because we know that regulation bears much more on small businesses than on larger ones."
"In connection with the SME envoy, could the Commissioner tell us whether the Commission plans to give the SME envoy a much more explicit remit within the better regulation programme, enabling the envoy to scrutinise legislative projects, specifically from the perspective of small enterprise, and publish a report that this Parliament can see, so that we know that the concerns of SMEs are being fully and properly reflected in the better regulation programme?"
". I am not sure that I can give a very precise answer to that question."
"I can tell you how this envoy’s tasks have been defined, and I guess that she will also see her role as a watchdog for SMEs."
"This will, no doubt, be a proper task on which to consider legislation."
"But there always has to be a balance between different interests."
"I know from discussing REACH, for example, how difficult this can be."
"But from the very beginning, when it came to regulating chemicals, we said that this should not hit small and medium-sized enterprises in an unbalanced way."
"We should make sure that it is not disproportionate for small and medium-sized enterprises, and do everything in a cost-effective way."
"I assume that the envoy will see and define her role as a watchdog also."
"As regards the concrete tasks and exactly how she might report and so on, I will have to refer back to Commissioner Verheugen for the details, and maybe come back and give you a specific answer."
"Thank you for creating such a friendly atmosphere, Madam President."
"Since being elected, this House has set up an Intergroup on SMEs, and I would like to invite the Commission to appoint the representative with responsibility for SMEs as a permanent member of it, in order to keep them up to date with what is going on."
"We meet in Strasbourg on a Wednesday every other month."
"I ask you to pass on this invitation to Commissioner Verheugen and to ask him, at the July part-session, to give us more concrete examples of what you have been saying today."
"He may then be able to put things rather more in context."
"Questions Nos 49 to 85 will be answered in writing."
"That concludes Question Time."
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A6-0119/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the recognition of professional qualifications (13781/2/2004 – C6-0008/2005 – 2002/0061(COD)) (Rapporteur: Stefano Zappalà)."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall try to summarise very briefly the content of a directive that is of particular importance to many tens of millions of European professionals, and above all to all EU citizens, who have to deal with professionals every day."
"This extremely important directive relates to a fundamental theme, namely the completion of the internal market."
"National autonomy means that each Member State lays down rules and procedures for the practice of the professions, whereas under the Treaties every EU citizen should be able to enjoy the right to work in any other Member State of the Union, either temporarily or permanently, on a par with any citizen of the host country."
"National autonomy means that each government decides on the minimum standards of education and training required for access to the individual professions and also establishes who shall authorise and control the practice of the professions."
"Within this context of respect for the Treaties, respect for national autonomy and the principle of subsidiarity, we need to harmonise the system."
"Countless directives have regulated this area over the past decades, but with this directive Parliament is unifying them into a single provision within the framework of an overall macrosystem – while respecting certain special features and certain professions."
"The points contained in the directive are fundamental."
"For the sake of brevity I shall highlight just a few of them."
"The Treaties mention liberal professionals but never define them."
"In this directive we define liberal professions for the first time, albeit within a recital."
"This is a remarkable step forwards, partly because, by referring to certain specific articles in the Treaty, Parliament is laying down a definitive framework to form the legal basis for future provisions."
"The directive introduces a fundamental definition – that of competent authority – meaning those national bodies and soon, we hope, according to the preamble to the directive, European ones too."
"Such a definition should put an end to the debate that dragged on during the last legislative term about orders, colleges and associations."
"All those bodies can at last be included either in the context of national legislations or within the framework of European law."
"The directive covers a raft of other fundamental new ideas: ‘qualifications shopping’ is avoided; those exercising public authority – notaries in particular – are excluded from the area of free movement; and the possibility of acting according to the country of origin principle is precluded – we shall try to delimit this point in another directive."
"In addition, it establishes that representatives of the individual professions shall be consulted in future at a European level in relation to any other innovation that concerns them."
"I still have two more points to mention."
"Some European professionals – German craftsmen and Italian engineers, for instance – feel that there is no room for them in this directive, but that is not the case."
"In conjunction with the Commission, we shall try in future to solve specific problems through common platforms and other instruments."
"Mr President, I shall conclude by thanking Parliament as a whole."
"Parliament is in perfect agreement on this directive, and I am also very pleased at the exceptionally good relationship that we have had with the Presidency and the Commission."
"That understanding has enabled us to reach a compromise on which everyone agrees, one that ennobles the work of the European Union, puts an end to daily bureaucracy and opens the door to a more certain and less bureaucratic future."
"The directive we shall be adopting tomorrow is certainly a major innovation for our Europe, for the Europe that we all want."
". Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Zappalà, for his draft recommendation, which usefully completes the Council common position in some aspects and fully supports the essential objectives of the Commission’s proposal."
"I also wish to thank the shadow rapporteurs, Mrs Weiler, Mrs Rühle and Mr Lambsdorff for their cooperation and constructive attitude in working towards an agreement with the Council on this vital piece of single market legislation."
"As you all know, this directive is an important practical contribution to skills mobility."
"It covers a large variety of issues of great interest to the professions and also to their clients."
"A reasonable compromise on the text provides us with a major success story in the field of the internal market."
"The final result strikes a balance between the right to free movement of fully qualified professionals and the need to protect consumers."
"In particular, I welcome the maintenance of the five levels of qualification, which have played a central role in the operation of professional recognition at EU level over the last 15 years."
"This solution ensures the transparency necessary for the application of the system and keeps existing guarantees for migrants."
"The directive improves conditions of free movement for professionals through simpler and clearer rules, in particular for the temporary provision of cross-border services."
"I am happy to acknowledge that Parliament has played a constructive role in achieving the right degree of flexibility for the provider of a professional service who wishes to exercise his activity elsewhere in the Union."
"In an enlarged Europe, more effective systems for managing our legislation have become an absolute necessity."
"The mechanisms and procedures provided for in the directive update the existing ones and should ensure its efficient implementation in the years to come."
"In particular, the new regime for the automatic recognition of medical specialities reconciles the need for simplification with the legitimate demands of the profession."
"For its part, the consultation of professional associations will provide the Commission with the technical advice necessary for the proper running of the system."
"Toine Manders’ suggestion, in this respect, at last week’s trialogue was particularly welcome."
"It enables us to ensure a proper and effective consultation of professional organisations and feed in the results of that consultation in the decisions to be taken through comitology."
"Professional associations will thus be closely involved in the implementation of the directive."
"Last, but not least, I appreciate the additions to the common position suggested by Parliament, such as those regarding: firstly, the possibility for professional associations to create professional cards; secondly, the possibility of further harmonisation for additional professions in the future; and, thirdly, the anti-abuse clause which will preclude so-called ‘qualifications shopping’."
"To conclude, I wish to pay tribute to the members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for their constructive approach that has enabled an agreement with the Council without the need for conciliation."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I may be stating the obvious when I say that this report is one of the most important to have been discussed in this House."
"I would thus very much like to congratulate the Commission on the initiative it has taken, and Mr Zappalà and the other groups’ shadow rapporteurs on the work they have done."
"Virtually on a daily basis, we have to explain to the people in our Member States that the free movement of goods has a concrete, positive benefit for many people. It takes even greater effort to emphasise to them the importance of a good services directive, but people come to us to complain about the excessive barriers to mobility that they – whether as students, workers, self-employed, or in some other category – have to negotiate if they wish to work or move across borders."
"It is therefore high time that we consolidate the fifteen directives on the recognition of professional qualifications which we have approved one by one over the years, and that we give this a cohesive legal framework with five levels, which moreover, should be easy to adapt."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats fully supports the result presented by the rapporteur today."
"We cannot address all its aspects, but are pleased with the content nevertheless."
"We are particularly pleased that an agreement has now been reached with the other institutions, at least that is what we hope, and that this issue can therefore be brought to a speedy conclusion."
"Our group has responded favourably to the recognition of the specificity of professions and the individual character of the notary’s office, of the role of professional organisations and to the way in which we are finally being allowed to know the content of this important directive and, on the basis of this, to deduce which areas are left over for the other important directive – that on the services market – with which we have yet to deal."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this compromise is, in part, the work of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and we will be voting in favour of it tomorrow."
"This new directive covers employed persons and self-employed professionals in what are termed the regulated professions, that is to say, those in which skills are attested by qualifications, ranging from architects to heating engineers by way of nurses and pharmacists."
"While incorporating ECJ rulings and making them permanent, it will also simplify matters, and that is precisely what we wanted – a balance between the right to free movement and settlement in Europe on the one hand and secured standards for professional qualifications and in consumers’ interests on the other."
"As the Commissioner has just said, this directive can be seen as one of the services directives, and it is indeed meant to make the internal market simpler."
"In terms of European internal market policy, then, it is the positive side of the coin, and my description of it as ‘positive’ is meant by way of comparison with the notorious services directive."
"For the benefit of those who do not yet believe me, let me quote: ‘Migrant professionals shall be made subject to the same conditions for exercising a profession as the nationals of the host Member State’, or, even more specifically: ‘The qualification requirements of the host country must continue to be met’."
"That shows how important it is to us that the rules and regulations of the destination country or host country should be taken seriously and should not be allowed to be devalued in other areas."
"We have achieved a great deal; among other things, we have managed, together with all our fellow Members, to get it stipulated that checks are carried out in the destination country, which may, if necessary, require guarantees, liability insurance, or even further training."
"The polemics of various newspapers provided for a regrettable interlude and resulted in some people being unsettled."
"Between first and second readings, there was division within the Council, which – and I stress that I am talking about the Council as a whole rather than about Luxembourg – showed itself somewhat hesitant."
"It is not true to say that three months of evening classes are enough to equip heating engineers to do the job."
"Nevertheless, despite the polemics of certain newspapers and certainly of certain trade associations, we have the result we wanted."
"It is practicable; it has a significant effect on our chances in the internal market and on the public’s opportunities."
"We should now do everything we can to make good use of them and to enable the members of the public to experience Europe as we always intended it to be."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by highlighting the laudable and tangible determination of everyone concerned to reach agreement in this problematic matter."
"Let me, then, take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur, Mr Zappalà, and the Members from the various groups – Mrs Weiler, Mr Wuermeling, and also Mr Manders from my own group."
"There really has been very constructive cooperation, including, in the final stage, on the part of the Commission and the Council."
"I think it should be stressed that this directive now enables us to achieve three essential things."
"The first is that we are closer to completing the internal market."
"Secondly, we are doing something to protect the consumer."
"Thirdly, we are helping to reduce bureaucracy."
"Let me start with the completion of the internal market."
"The directive on professional qualifications is a vital step towards overcoming the barriers that exist in practice to freedom of movement and the freedom to provide services on our common internal market, and, in consequence, quite crucial in terms of making the EU’s citizens more mobile."
"It must also be borne in mind, in connection with the freedom to provide services, that EU citizens will in future be acquiring a kind of driving licence, with which they can set off, with no fear of hindrance or discrimination, into the countries of the European Union, whether to settle down in one of them or to offer their services on a temporary basis."
"At the same time, everything that is subject to the special provisions of this directive is removed from the scope of the services directive, about which there has been much discussion."
"This leads me to hope that our agreement today will serve to objectify the debate on this important project."
"If I may turn, secondly, to consumer protection, let me say that, whereas the services directive will govern the conditions under which service providers may operate, this directive is intended to ensure the necessary standard of professional qualifications."
"This is in itself a significant achievement in terms of the protection of European consumers, in that they are given a guarantee that service providers do only those things that they are recognised as qualified to do."
"We have therefore managed, by doing away with ‘qualification shopping’, to build in a safety mechanism to obviate the obtaining of entitlements by false pretences and this, too, is important in terms of consumer protection."
"I might add that I am very pleased that it has been possible to bring the professional associations on board for the comitology procedure."
"Their expertise will be very valuable."
"It will, however, also be very important to include most of the artisanal crafts and trades in Annex II, enabling their particular qualifications to be given the recognition they deserve."
"My third point has to do with the cutting back of red tape."
"Over the past years, the existing rules on professional recognition became a rag rug of multifarious parallel regulations in different versions, all of which the public found complicated, baffling and, quite simply, scarcely manageable."
"What we see happening with this directive, the objective of which is to bring together these various pieces of legislation, is a necessary paradigm shift from a bewildering multiplicity of approaches to regulation to one single general approach, finally subjecting various professions to a single legal regime that, being anchored to certain standards of qualification, helps to promote deregulation."
"The adoption of the proposal for a directive, scheduled for tomorrow, is therefore a crucial step towards the completion of the European internal market, and one in favour of which my group will be voting."
"I would like to add that I believe we should be conducting this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is thanks to our rapporteur, Mr Zappalà, that the directive on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications will, tomorrow, by a large majority, pass through its second reading."
"The new directive replaces a hotch-potch of 15 old ones, thus ensuring greater transparency and legal security."
"This directive will make it easier for EU citizens to seize the opportunities they have to work in other European countries, something that the problematic state of the labour market in many Member States is making ever more important."
"Although it removes unjustified restrictions on mobility imposed by an excess of bureaucratic regulation in Member States, there is no reason to fear that there will be a rush to ‘dumb-down’ qualifications."
"Those who settle in a Member State on a permanent basis may be required to have passed an aptitude test or to have completed further training."
"They register in their new country, rather than – as originally planned – in the one that they left."
"This directive also stipulates that the right to monitor them remains with the country in which they have settled, and establishes minimum standards applicable across Europe for professions with which certain risks are associated, such as doctors, pharmacists, midwives and architects; the level of qualification is guaranteed by five levels dependent upon the length and standard of training."
"It also imposes the obligation on professionals of informing clients or consumers about their qualifications."
"We believe that this directive does a good job of striking a balance between the freedom of movement and quality protection, and I hope that the planned services directive will do nothing to interfere with this."
". Freedom of movement for workers is one of the fundamental principles upon which the functioning of the common market is based."
"Unfortunately, however, this principle is not always adhered to, as can be seen from the huge number of complaints received by both Parliament’s Committee on Petitions and the SOLVIT system."
"Many European countries have put in place various types of restrictions and deliberate obstacles that inhibit competition, hold back the development of the common market, prevent prices from falling and contribute to a reduction in the quality of labour."
"I am in favour of introducing the simplest and quickest possible system for recognising professional qualifications, in order to ensure that the citizens of our countries can move about as freely as possible."
"I am in no doubt that the compromise reached by the Council and Parliament will make it possible for this directive to be adopted, but it is a shame that Parliament appears once again to be putting the brakes on much-needed and courageous reforms proposed by the Commission."
"Amongst other things, I refer to Parliament’s proposals regarding the five levels of professional qualifications and the division into various professions that was mooted during the Commission’s deliberations."
"A system should be introduced for cases in which different rules are in force regarding the length of time it takes to gain a qualification in the country of origin and the country where the individual in question is working, so that either qualifications can be verified or any necessary and additional qualifications gained."
"I should like to emphasise that the directive on the recognition of professional qualifications dovetails with the proposal for a directive on services, and in my opinion it would be in the best interests of the European Community as a whole if these directives were to be adopted as quickly as possible."
"I find it regrettable that the Commission’s initial proposal to allow experts to provide services on a temporary basis without completing the necessary formalities, pursuant to the country of origin principle, did not find favour."
"I hope that the report that Parliament will adopt tomorrow will be another step on the road towards simplifying the provision of labour and services in different Member States, and that it will make it easier to move from one country to another."
"It is my belief that this directive, along with the services directive, will bring us another step closer to the completion of the common market and to creating economic growth and new jobs throughout Europe, provided that the country of origin rules are observed."
"Mr President, as coordinator for the PPE-DE Group on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I wish to pay special tribute to our rapporteur, Mr Zappalà, for piloting this very complex legislation safely through to a final conclusion."
"There are a number of colleagues here who worked in the last Parliament;"
"I see many familiar faces."
"Many colleagues have worked together on this and it is a tribute to Mr Zappalà’s persistence that we now have a very good result."
"I am delighted that we have managed to reach agreement without a need for conciliation."
"It is sometimes easy to forget that mutual recognition of professional qualifications within the European single market has been one of the foundation stones of the whole of the internal market project."
"This is a much-needed reform of the whole package."
"It has been necessary to deal with the frustrations that have been felt by many professionals about some of the difficulties in accessing their rights under internal market legislation."
"It is important we deal with those issues now, as part of our overall strategy to open up the internal market for services."
"These are part of the same proposals."
"There is no question, Mrs Rühle, of one frustrating another."
"They are all parts of a clearly integrated approach."
"If you look at the Danish economic study on the opening-up of the internal market for services, it identifies professional qualifications as the area with the most potential for growth."
"In terms of timing and linking these proposals together, I am really pleased that we now have this major reform, because it will be an indispensable building block of our overall approach."
"I am sure that by the end of this year, or early next year, we will also have agreed a substantive proposal to open up the market for services."
"This will allow qualified professionals to take advantage of the single market and use their skills to drive home the advantages for growth and jobs that an internal market for services must deliver."
"Mr President, many thanks are due to Mr Zappalà for the good work he has done, but, in my capacity as the senior representative of the German Social Democrats in this House, I extend particular thanks to Mrs Weiler, who has made a decisive contribution to the debate and played her part in helping us to conclude this important piece of legislative work at second reading stage, without having to take things further, to the Conciliation Committee."
"That is very important, and I am very glad of it."
"I am also very glad that both this House and the Council have managed – and who would have thought this possible? – by means of this legislative document, and with such overwhelming consensus, to bring to nought the Commission’s original approach, which relied on the country-of-origin principle."
"I have heard a lot of people today expressing approval of the way we did this, with this law making a very clear statement that it was not the country-of-origin principle that would apply, for it is un-European, but that we were working on the basis of mutual recognition and wanted to continue to do so."
"If we are to legislate with any consistency – just as the Commission was consistent in twice proposing the country-of-origin principle – it is now time for this House to be consistent and do the same thing with the services directive too."
"That would be a good job of work, and we should do it."
"I also saw it as significant that the new Commission, this time, accepted the proposal I had put forward at first reading for the adoption of European professional identity cards."
"That is the right way to really drive forward mobility, the opening-up of markets, the opening-up of the borders that still, alas, exist in the European Union and to ensure that this works."
"I wish us every success in the vote, which is to be held tomorrow."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on the recognition of professional qualifications could open up new opportunities."
"The purpose of the directive is to remove the factors restricting the free movement of people and services between the countries of the European Union."
"In practice, the aim is to make it possible for people to practise their profession in a country other than the one in which their professional qualifications were obtained."
"It is perfectly reasonable that the qualifications criteria that apply to a professional in the host country should be the same as those that apply to the nationals of that country."
"The professional needs to show that he or she has the adequate level of education."
"The host Member State, for its part, must be able to insist that the professional should have adequate language skills."
"Language proficiency is of particular importance in the healthcare professions, where serious health and safety problems can result if patients cannot communicate in their own language."
"We cannot promote the liberalisation of markets and free movement at the expense of patient safety and consumer protection."
"We have to focus attention on the quality of the education received, and not merely the length of time taken, when we are determining the levels of professional qualifications."
"The recognition of professional qualifications in another EU country cannot be allowed to hang on a matter of a few months if the education systems and quality of education are otherwise equivalent."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are very many examples – to be found not least in my own country – of the ways in which complicated and long drawn-out procedures are used to hinder the recognition of professional qualifications and hence to keep out competing outsiders, to the benefit of one’s own people."
"In Europe, it is often easier to get an American qualification recognised than one acquired in a neighbouring country."
"The compromise we now have is well thought-out and a significant success, introducing as it does minimum standards for vocational and professional qualifications at five different levels, while, at the same time, preventing any devaluation of standards."
"I will repeat what has already been said by previous speakers, that it is the host country principle rather than the country-of-origin principle that has been laid down as a minimum requirement for the various professions."
"It is intended to be the basis for unambiguous rules intended to facilitate, if at all possible, the automatic recognition, in all Member States, of the professional qualifications of all EU citizens, whether they be employed or self-employed."
"What has come out of the trialogue sessions is a comprehensive and good compromise, one that we Greens, too, are happy to recommend."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the question we must ask ourselves today is one that we should in fact never cease to ask ourselves, namely whether the European Union is a union of institutions, states, governments and parliaments, or whether it is a union of citizens, people and Europeans."
"Every time a qualification is not recognised, it is an individual who is left facing a problem and who suffers unfair treatment."
"Of course, each and every one of us suffers whenever this happens, as the assistance we give the trade associations, guilds, trade unions and institutions in protecting their selfish interests makes the EU institutions less competitive."
"It is the people whose qualifications are not recognised who suffer most, however, and who are prevented from taking up jobs for which they are qualified."
"As Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, I am well aware of the extent of this problem in Europe."
"We only see the tip of the iceberg, but it is the tip of a very large iceberg."
"A great many people out there have been treated unfairly, including doctors, veterinarians, nurses and even lawyers and butchers, as the interests of these professions are being protected by professional associations."
"The aim of the Commission directive was to remedy this state of affairs, and it did in fact largely succeed in doing so."
"I should like to congratulate Commissioner McCreevy on this score."
"It is an unfortunate fact, however, that this directive has been ruined by Parliament."
"Although we will vote in favour of it, as it is still better than nothing, we regard it as a failure."
"I must add that I found the comments by Mrs Weiler, who said that the directive does not lay down European standards for recognising qualifications gained in the country of origin, quite unacceptable."
"I have absolutely no idea how she came up with her ideas of what is and what is not European."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in the interests of Europe, and in order to ensure that Europe can really compete with the United States and the Far East, we must make it possible for people and institutions to be competitive."
"There is an urgent need for this directive, and I find it regrettable that the version with which we have been left has so many shortcomings."
"I should like to thank Commissioner McCreevy for all he has done."
"Mr Chairman, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the elimination of obstacles to the free movement of persons and services between Member States is one of the objectives of the Community."
"Following the Lisbon European Council of 23-24 March 2000 the Commission presented its Internal Market Strategy for Services, aimed mainly at making the free provision of services within the Community as simple as it is in the individual Member States."
"One of the key directives, closely linked to the Service Directive, is the directive on mutual recognition of professional qualifications."
"It was drafted by means of a complicated inter-institutional legislative procedure that the Commission launched as early as the beginning of 2002."
"It is encouraging to note that after sustained efforts of Member States extending over several years, this directive will finally establish a system of mutual recognition of professional qualifications that will enable the citizens of one Member State to look for employment in another Member State under the same conditions as the nationals of the host state."
"The directive will establish rules for the performance of all professions, except for civil service positions in Member States and the positions of public notaries, that will be as broad as possible and that will facilitate the use of one’s qualifications in a much broader space in the European labour market."
"At present, the Union applies uniform rules to diploma recognition of only eight professions, including medical doctors, nurses, lawyers and architects."
"There has been a notable omission of the profession of civil engineers, which has not been recognised with the relevant status at the European level."
"This directive should remedy the situation."
"As a result of adjustments introduced by the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, five reference levels have been established, corresponding to a certain level of education and enabling comparisons between qualification requirements of individual Member States; they are welcome by such professional associations as the Chamber of Civil Engineers and the Chamber of Architects."
"The procedure also should be simplified by the committee composed of the representatives of various professions that will deal with the recognition of professional qualifications."
"To conclude, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Zappala, for his dedication and endurance in writing this report, and to congratulate him on its unanimous adoption by the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"Mr President, we are all grateful to Mr Zappalà who has been our very own service provider on this important measure."
"It has made more progress in the last three months than in the previous three years."
"That is, I believe, a happy augury."
"The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection is now seeing the fourth successful conclusion, at second reading, of an important piece of consumer protection."
"I hope our fellow Members will recognise that."
"The free movement of professionals is an important step in achieving the Lisbon Agenda."
"It opens up opportunities in other Member States for dentists, doctors, construction workers and gas engineers that were often closed as a result of an effective ‘closed shop’ among the professions."
"I am very grateful that our three German colleagues directly address the reservations in their own Member State on this issue."
"This is in unmistakable terms in the light of the progress we should make."
"This is an advance to balance free movement and competition, and ensure health and safety and consumer protection at one and the same time."
"I commend it, and I hope the Commissioner will give it speedy effect."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am delighted that you called my name, but an entire party was involved in the trilogue which reached agreement."
"The Commission listened carefully to what the options were and eventually adopted a few elements, without holding onto the rigid principles on which the Commission usually insists, for which I am grateful."
"Mr Whitehead, our chairman, has already indicated that Mr Zappalà has been a true strategist."
"At times, I saw a likeness to Caesar who was equally capable of delaying battles."
"I was convinced that this directive would never see the light of day, but we have only worked on it for the past three years and have already finished it."
"I would therefore like to congratulate Mr Zappalà for the strategic approach which I had failed to see in the first three years."
"My apologies for this."
"I have nothing but congratulations and praise."
"The definition is clear."
"I think that the professional card proposed in the first round by Mrs Gebhardt is an excellent addition to clarify qualifications using modern technology."
"What I considered crucial, and that has also been adopted by the Commission and the Council, is that a liability scheme will in any case be put in place, particularly for the medical professions, because it is unacceptable for people employed in that sector on a temporary basis to be able to escape all disciplinary provisions and liability because of the temporary nature of the job."
"I would therefore like to congratulate all those who have worked on what is – to my mind – a fantastic directive. It is a cornerstone of the internal market which offers young people, in particular, scope for the future and by means of which, something which I also consider to be important, particularly women are still given the chance, even if they have started a family, to cash in on their professional training on the market by finding a good job."
"I am pleased that mutual recognition has been mentioned, and in connection with the principle of the country of origin, I think that, if we do not stipulate any criteria, we are talking about the same definition."
"After all, no conditions are prescribed in this directive, because training is provided in the country of origin."
"Call it a licence: people with certain qualifications can work in other countries."
"I consider this worth a debate."
"It is very important to my mind that the Commission has adopted this and that there is now a duty to justify one’s actions. It is essential to obtain a legally sound Europe, but above all in order to obtain a democratically strengthened Europe."
"I hope that with this directive today, we have demonstrated, and have given a very clear message, that we are all prepared to work on a stronger and prosperous Europe."
"I should also like to thank our chairmen, Mr Gargani, the previous chairman, and Mr Whitehead, for their patience in this connection, and extend special thanks also to Mr Zappalà."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Zappalà, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is very clear evidence of the good work done by everyone concerned."
"Achieving a result like this in such a problematic subject area is something to which one must draw attention."
"Our task is to make the four freedoms a reality in the European Union; our objective, to build the internal market, making it a domestic market for all – employers, workers and consumers alike."
"This is a directive in the service of the Lisbon strategy, in the service of the internal market and in the service of the Constitution, and it is a directive in the service of ‘unity in diversity’."
"The directive also testifies to the European Union’s desire that quality standards should be maintained rather than downgraded, and to our recognition of specific professional criteria."
"For the first time, this directive modernises the Community’s system for recognising professional qualifications."
"It demonstrates the respect we have for what the liberal professions do for the common good; by it, we are visibly simplifying regulations and making them more transparent rather than adopting new ones, and demonstrably promoting the free movement of skilled workers, while affirming the bodies – such as professional associations – that represent their interests, rather than simply suffocating them in European red tape."
"This directive is also, of course, evidence that, even now, the services directive’s country-of-origin principle applies to none of the provisions of the directive on professional qualifications that apply in the destination country."
"This means that this directive complements the services directive."
"As they complement each other, I believe that the work we have done on this directive should be a good example for future work on the services directive."
"Let us hope that our success will be just as evident when this debate is over."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too am delighted that we managed to approve this important directive this week, after a period of 40 years during which the situation was made very much more complex by the general sectoral directives, to the extent that one could, as the saying goes no longer see the wood for the trees."
"I consider this to be an important step in terms of simplification and an important step forward."
"You yourself, Commissioner, stressed that it is an honourable compromise in which we have struck a balance between the operation of the internal market with the highest possible level of free movement of professionals on the one hand, and quality training and respect for consumer interests on the other."
"I think that with this debate, we have shown that these can be reconciled."
"An example of this is in paragraph 3 of Article 5, where we replaced disciplinary provisions with rules of conduct."
"The fact that a destination Member State can continue to impose national rules in this respect is not a protectionist measure at all, but no more and no less than proof of this balance."
"I should like to echo the hope Mrs Gebhardt expressed, that we may follow the same path for the services directive where we also need to find this desperately needed balance."
". Mr President, I thank the honourable Members for their contributions."
"This debate has shown that it is possible to find a broad consensus on an issue that provoked a good deal of controversy at first reading."
"This makes me optimistic for other initiatives before this Parliament."
"Some Members raised the question of the craftsmen or ."
"Let me clarify that."
"The new directive in no way affects the national regulations on qualifications in the craft sector, nor does it entail any levelling down of national quality standards."
"Two existing regimes for the recognition of professional qualifications in this sector are maintained: fully qualified craftsmen can apply either for recognition of their professional experience or for recognition of their formal qualifications, where appropriate, subject to an aptitude test or a supervised traineeship."
"Moreover, the special structure of certain courses, amongst them the German qualification, is fully acknowledged."
"I confirm that this special status can be extended to further courses through the adoption of implementing measures within the framework of the committee set up by this directive."
"I wish to underline again that the valuable efforts made by the European Parliament and in particular by the rapporteur, Mr Zappalà, and the shadow rapporteurs have been essential for the successful outcome of this negotiation and the final adoption of this important proposal."
"The Commission will hand over a detailed overview of the amendments that the Commission can accept for inclusion in the record of this part-session(1)."
"This overview confirms that the Commission fully endorses the agreement reached by the co-legislators."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m."
"34 amendments can be accepted in their entirety."
"These are Amendments 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 13, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54 and 55."
"21 amendments must be rejected."
"These are Amendments 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 30 and 32."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0121/2005) by Mrs Herranz García on the simplification of the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables (2004/2193(INI))."
". Mr President, I am extremely pleased with the draft report to be put to the vote tomorrow in this Parliament, because it takes up — with some amendments, it is true — each and every measure I proposed in the initial draft."
"In view of the broad support achieved in the Committee on Agricultural and Rural Development, I hope that this report will now receive the support of the immense majority of Members of this Parliament."
"Nevertheless, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has presented an amendment to the report urging the European Commission to present a legislative proposal as soon as possible."
"The announcement by Commissioner Fischer Boel, who is here with us, that the reform of the sector would be postponed has caused great malaise amongst producers, a malaise which I would like this European Parliament to reflect."
"The Commissioner’s announcement is a symptom of the lack of importance attached to such a significant sector as fruits and vegetables, and I would remind you once again that the fruit and vegetables sector represents 17% of the European Union's final agricultural production, a fact that the Commission has apparently not taken into account at this crucial time when the financial perspectives are being negotiated for a period of seven years."
"I believe that the Commission's attitude leaves much to be desired and if I have understood the messages communicated recently by the Commissioner properly, the Community executive may include the reform as a section of a general proposal for the implementation of a single common organisation of the market for all agricultural products."
"I believe that, if we do this, we will not be mixing like with like, since, until now, the fruit and vegetables sector has been given special treatment, which generally speaking has been positive, although it is occasionally necessary to introduce important changes."
"Producers of fruits and vegetables originally experienced a degree of frustration as a result of being considered as a separate sector, with no right to direct aid."
"Today, however, the special system, based on the existence of operational funds, co-funded by the growers, has provided them with a means for better adapting their production to the needs of the market."
"Although the system has certain failings — which system does not? — and although it needs certain modifications aimed, in particular, at increasing the competitiveness of producers, it would be a mistake to include fruits and vegetables amongst all the other agricultural sectors."
"This would mean dismantling the whole philosophy upon which the progress made so far in the sector has been based."
"I would insist that I wish to reflect the discontent communicated to me by certain professional organisations at the postponement of these legislative proposals."
"It is urgent that we carry out a reform in order to introduce new mechanisms, mechanisms for managing the market in order to deal with the difficulties being faced by certain parts of the sector and which will be accentuated following the negotiations in the World Trade Organisation."
"A swift system for dealing with crises, controlled by the producers’ organisations, would enhance their role as managers of the market, which furthermore should serve as a draw for individual producers which have not so far found it beneficial to join these groupings."
"60% of these producers do not belong to these groupings."
"The draft report that I have presented to the European Parliament in fact proposes an alternative to the crisis management system in force, which would consist of the introduction of so-called ‘safety funds’, managed by the groupings themselves, intended to finance withdrawals at times of serious crisis, reductions of production in the event of market saturation, and also the implementation of a system of insurance for incomes."
"If properly organised, this ‘box’ should become the instrument that the producers’ organisations currently lack for dealing with the ups and downs of the market."
"The report also contains certain measures which are urgently required in order to respond to certain problematic situations, such as, for example, low membership of associations in the new Member States, and it also provides responses to the particular problem of soft fruits, for which a whole series of measures are proposed with a view to improving both a system for fresh fruits and vegetables and the system for processed fruits and vegetables, without forgetting the need to extend the campaigns promoting production, placing emphasis on Community origin."
". I should like to start by thanking Mrs Herranz García and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for all the work they have done on this report."
"The Commission communication on the common market organisation in fruit and vegetables had three aims. The first was to describe how the Commission had started the simplification process; the second, to present a Commission working document analysing the principal figures of the sector, the implementation of the producer organisations and the related operational funds and budgetary aspects; and the third, to stimulate a debate in the Council, the European Parliament and within the sector."
"Turning to the content of your report, let me begin with the role of the producer organisations."
"They are and will continue to be the key element in the common market organisation."
"I welcome your suggestions aimed at strengthening their role in the management of markets and the concentration of supply, notably concerning mergers, transnational producer organisations and specific measures focusing on the new Member States."
"We should also consider the possibility of introducing new products and new categories of producer organisations."
"Turning to crisis management, I should like to draw your attention to the communication on risk and crisis management in agriculture of February 2005."
"In addition to the horizontal measures for crisis management proposed in this context, we will evaluate the need to provide specific tools in the fruit and vegetable sector."
"We will specially consider the proposal for creating mutual funds."
"Concerning processed products, the Dutch presidency conclusions stated that the Commission should carry out an impact analysis."
"That was to include a possible shift from the current regimes to an approach based on objectives and instruments already used in the CAP reform."
"The Commission will, therefore, wait for the outcome of the impact analysis before proposing any alternative for processed products."
"Following enlargement of the European Union, the Community is studying the situation concerning red fruits."
"Once the studies are finished, we will consider the appropriate measures, both in the framework of the common market organisation and vis-à-vis imports from third countries."
"I fully agree with you about the necessity of promoting fruit and vegetable consumption, taking into account the positive effects on public health."
"I would also like to mention our horizontal instruments in the CAP for promoting these products."
"The fruit and vegetable sector is one which has benefited from this."
"As regards the increase in imports of fruit and vegetables from third countries, as WTO members, we cannot adopt measures inconsistent with our international obligations."
"The most effective way to respond to market signals is to focus on quality."
"We will carefully consider the possibility of introducing special labels of origin for processed products made exclusively from European raw materials."
"With regard the compatibility of rural development instruments and the CMO operational funds, I can assure you that we will provide for measures which allow producers to benefit from both instruments, but avoid the possibility of double financing."
"."
"Mr President, whatever else I have to say, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Herranz García, for her clear position, and I should also like to congratulate our Commissioner for Agriculture, because in all the discussions about what we want, I have to say that she remains steadfast in the discussion about the financial perspectives and the question of cofinancing agricultural policy, which is in itself worthy of congratulation, as well as meaning that she, in any event, is standing up for a sector in Europe, and wants to maintain it."
"I also welcome her remarks with regard to good impact studies into the fruit and vegetable sector in order to be able to choose a sound approach which will enable us to work in a more market-oriented manner, and also her remarks with regard to the requirement that it should be possible to label products from Europe effectively so that there is no doubt as to their origin."
"That, in itself, is a sound approach."
"I should also add a small critical note, because impact studies lead me to the conclusion that, in Europe, certainly after the EU’s enlargement, it has become more difficult for European fruit and vegetable growers – who generally work without subsides and in a market-oriented manner – to keep their heads above water."
"The extensive concentration on the demand side in the form of supermarkets is not backed by reinforced producer organisations in the sector itself."
"If the sector wishes to survive in Europe, it has to be able to work under the conditions that apply to import products."
"Labelling is crucial in this respect, and the Commission should devote more attention to this aspect in future plans."
"Secondly, there is no denying that a huge number of growers in the ten new Member States have problems integrating in the European market."
"It is vital that this problem be addressed more forcefully by setting up producer organisations and by ensuring that the growers in the new countries are also able to gain a foothold in the market compared to huge supermarket chains."
"Thirdly, if there is less bureaucracy, it is more likely that the money for these funds will be spent wisely."
"It is unacceptable that, as is at present the case, 25% of the money should go unspent."
"It is crucial that the Commission should look into this without delay in order to ensure that the money can be spent as yet."
"If it cannot be channelled directly to producer organisations, then the budget that is left over, in the light of major frost damage in large parts of Europe and other natural disasters, including drought, can still be spent in the sector in order to ensure that it survives these difficult times."
"In any event, I should like to thank the rapporteur and the Commissioner for a reasonably constructive attitude."
". Mr President, Commissioner, we all agree on the need expressed here to make certain adjustments to the current COM with a view to confronting the new challenges facing the sector, but nobody wants a reform that goes any further than those needs, and this is expressed in the report."
"The initiative report we are debating today has broad support, majority support in fact, not just in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, but also, I hope, in this Parliament and, above all, in the sector itself — which is not easy — and it takes up many of the points that my group, the Socialist Group, advocates and has introduced in the form of amendments: greater flexibility for the OPCHs, the need to clarify access to operative funds and to make it less bureaucratic, to promote associations and to work on the concentration of supply and the need to protect our producers from third countries, management of crisis situations, etc."
"The Commission asked this Parliament for its opinion on the form the coming reform of the fruit and vegetables sector should take."
"Here are our responses, the responses agreed by Parliament and by the parties in question."
"We now hope that they will be taken into account both in terms of time and in terms of substance."
"I would like to remind the Commission that the report calls clearly for a legislative proposal to be presented before this summer with a view to enhancing and improving the role of producers’ organisations fundamentally in the management of the market; the future of this sector lies in the market, and the market is the future."
"We must not forget that the fruit and vegetables sector is dynamic, but at the same time very fragile, and there is great instability in the markets."
"For these reasons, we want a reform that takes account both of Parliament's report and of the demands of farmers themselves and, above all, that it be maintained and serve to improve agricultural income."
"Finally, we are following the Doha Round negotiations very closely, with a view to introducing these agricultural products as sensitive products."
"Furthermore, it appears that the Commissioner has put forward the idea of replacing numerous COMs with a single COM or a single legal text."
"It goes without saying that we disagree with this, given the risk this decision poses to the sector, and given the insecurity that this announcement alone has created right away."
"I would like to end by thanking the rapporteur for her willingness to reach this consensus, not just in the committee, but also here in Parliament, and I hope that the Commission will show goodwill in terms of the future, since that is what the sector is impatiently awaiting."
". – Mr President, the fruit and vegetable sector is one of the most dynamic and that is why it is rightly being debated."
"It accounts for 17% of agricultural products and only receives 4% of agricultural resources."
"At the same time, it employs a sizeable section of the agricultural and manual workforce."
"We already have the draft proposal to revise the common market organisation from the Commission which, I think, benefits processors, but not small and medium-sized farms."
"However, I think that today's proposals do not help either; they do not improve the situation, given that the assessments contradict what is being proposed."
"For example, the decoupling of aid from production for fruit and vegetables is being proposed, while agreement is being expressed with the mid-term review of the CAP, the core of which is the decoupling of aid from production."
"Furthermore, agreement is being expressed with the WTO and, at the same time, it is being proposed that fruit and vegetables be kept out of WTO negotiations."
"Producer groups are being extolled but, at the same time, it is estimated that they do not function well, it having been found that only 40% of production passes through them and that they only take up 25% of resources."
"Basically, I would say, the fact is being concealed that producer groups function as intermediaries between farmers and wholesalers and industry, giving the latter benefits such as cheap raw materials."
"Nor is the proposal for a cofinanced fund a solution, given that farmers will be left to pick up the bill for the various crises and the repercussions from the WTO."
"On balance, we believe that both the review of the CAP and the negotiations with the WTO will be at the expense of the income of small and medium-sized fruit and vegetable farms, while wholesalers and industry will benefit, securing fruit and vegetables at even lower prices and reaping huge profits."
"That is why it is unfair and we cannot vote for it."
"Mr President, I would like to voice my immense concern about possible imports of red fruit from Asia in 2005."
"Poland has 450 000 farms producing red fruit."
"Last year, red fruit imports from Asia caused a disaster."
"Prices fell to a point where fruit was no longer even picked."
"Another year like that will spell the end for 200 000 farms."
"At five persons a family, that will mean a million people with no income this autumn: an unjustifiable social disaster."
"A farmer who loses his land and therefore his work also loses his home because he sells the land on which his house is built."
"He also loses his roots because he has to move far away to the town to look for work."
"However, there are no jobs to be had in the towns in Poland."
"Officially, 20% of the population are unemployed."
"Driven from their homes by an irresponsible economic policy, the sad truth is that farmers are highly likely to turn to crime."
"Another consequence will be massive emigration to the west and a realisation that the idea that the European Union was based on the principle of Community preference was a colossal lie."
"If you want the Poles to reject the European Constitution, carry on importing red fruit from Asia, but have the honesty to tell the Polish farmers that no one is interested in their fate."
"At least that will be clear."
"Mr President, Mrs Herranz García, I very much welcome this motion for a resolution, and I should like to thank the rapporteur for having ensured that it also covers the situation in the new Member States."
"Polish farmers have voiced objections to production quotas, and complained that they are finding it difficult to sell their products."
"In the limited time available to me, I should like to touch upon an issue which may be minor, but is nevertheless of great importance."
"Fruit and vegetables in the EU are over-priced."
"In addition, fruit is overripe and tasteless."
"We should improve the quality of our products and ensure that there continues to be a rich diversity of varieties, especially as far as seasonal fruit is concerned."
"In Poland it is still possible to buy extremely flavoursome varieties of apple that I have never seen, and undoubtedly never will see, in Brussels."
"I only ever eat tomatoes and cucumbers in Poland, because they lack any taste in the old EU."
"We should offer cheaper and fresher fruit and vegetables to our citizens, whilst ensuring that fruit and vegetable growers are paid a decent wage."
"We should not allow the abundance of local fruit varieties to be diminished."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the major EU enlargement in 2004 presented us with new challenges and new problems."
"Although we have already spent a year working together, we have unfortunately not succeeded in putting right the mistakes made during the negotiations on the accession of the new Member States."
"We all appreciate that decisions require time and thought, but we are also aware of a great many urgent matters that will brook no delay."
"One such matter is the much-needed regulation of the fruit and vegetable market."
"It is a matter of great importance to the new Member States that protective measures are put in place on the markets for soft fruit and apples."
"European producers are facing enormous problems and suffering tragic consequences as a result of the influx of soft fruit such as strawberries, currants, raspberries and cherries, from China, Morocco and Serbia."
"Polish producers and processors have been particularly hard hit, as Poland produces around 50% of all soft fruit in the European Union, as well as being a major apple producer."
"Following a number of interventions on the matter by myself and other Members, I am delighted that the President of Parliament and Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture have turned their attention to this issue, with the latter having taken a very professional approach to the problem."
"The end result of this has been that the Commission has also taken the matter seriously, and has sent a delegation to Poland to carry out on-the-spot investigations."
"I hope this delegation will complete its work before the fruit-buying season starts, and that we will manage to provide the necessary assistance and take the necessary measures before it is too late."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the report Mrs Herranz García has presented to the House merits particular attention, and the Commission should therefore draw the right conclusions from it and get down to work without delay."
"If we were to put off dealing with this problem, we would merely be running away from much-needed solutions and making matters even worse for many farmers and European producers, as well as giving rise to misunderstanding and disquiet among the public."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I was concerned and troubled to learn that you will be postponing the submission of legislative proposals for fruit and vegetables over the next two years."
"If this statement or intention of yours is true, then I believe that you are consciously leaving the CMO in fruit and vegetables out of the revised common agricultural policy and exposing these products and producers to numerous financial and international risks."
"The report by Mrs Garcia, whom I have to congratulate, constitutes a correct basis for you to submit your proposals by the autumn at the latest."
"I should also emphasise certain particularly important issues, such as:"
"Firstly, the Commission must immediately propose realistic proposals for producer groups within the framework of a simplified system and regime, so that they include the characteristics of each region and there is balanced use of the resources available in the sector."
"Secondly, there is room to improve the threshold system for processed products, although any changes here must not affect the existing balances between the Member States."
"I believe, Commissioner, that your proposals for fruit and vegetables will not be confined solely to making arrangements for or changes to processed products."
"Thirdly, special attention must be paid within the framework of your international negotiations."
"Low outside protection for fruit and vegetables already needs to be taken into account under the special arrangements for which provision is made for sensitive products and when regulating a methodology for equivalents for duties."
"The CMO in fruit and vegetables, with the operational programmes, the existence of a fund and the mandatory formation of producer groups, constitutes an operating standard for the markets in agricultural products."
"Do not disappoint the producers who have made sacrifices in order to adjust and adapt to this model."
"You should wipe out unfair competition, help them to win new markets and help them to improve the production of quality products."
"You can do it."
"Mr President, I must congratulate the rapporteur for producing what, even by general standards of EU documentation, is 19 pages of the most unreadable, bureaucratic gobbledy-gook, all of which comes under the laughable heading of ‘simplification’ of the market in fruit and vegetables!"
"Never in the field of vegetable and fruit cultivation has so much been said to so little purpose."
"However, I would draw Members’ attention to paragraph 46, which reminds the Commission that imports from third countries do not always provide the levels of safety and quality that the European consumer has grown accustomed to: hence the need to guarantee that third country products meet the same safety and quality requirements as European Union products."
"Roughly translated that means that non-EU countries can produce their goods cheaper, and this must be stopped at all costs."
"That is crude protectionism and seeks to preserve the EU fruit and vegetable market as a cocooned environment, controlled by suffocating bureaucracy which outside competition must never be allowed to penetrate."
"However, it is regulations that Mrs Herranz García wants, even on pot herbs and parsley!"
"Rhubarb gets a mention as well, but I shall resist the obvious joke, except to say that unlike the EU, the industry does not want to talk rhubarb, it only wants to grow it!"
"I urge Members to reject this report or, at the very least, require it to be translated from the original bureaucracy into plain language, so that we can all understand."
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for being here with us this evening."
"I hope that you will communicate to the Commission the clear and firm message that this Parliament is against the postponement of the reform of the fruit and vegetables sector, announced by yourself a short time ago."
"The fruit and vegetables sector is active in practically every country of the European Union and it suffers from the same problems everywhere."
"The current COM has proven to be effective, but it needs to be improved and a new system must be introduced that is more effective at managing crises and specific measures must be implemented for products that are subject to strong import pressures."
"That is not protectionism."
"I am from Castilla-La Mancha, which is a great garlic-producing region."
"Garlic is an example of a product that has to deal with ferocious imports, mainly from China, which threaten the survival of many farms."
"I am delighted that the report takes up measures in favour of this category of products and at the same time advocates a simplification of the import system in force, in order to prevent the irregularities we are witnessing as a result of the existence of three different formulae that operators may employ, as they wish, thus promoting fraudulent practices about which the sector has on occasions complained to the European Commission."
"I also agree with the raft of proposals included in the report to improve the competitiveness of the sector and to take the best possible advantage of the budget available, which is underused year after year as a result of the lack of flexibility of the current COM."
"The failings of the system, such as a large amount of bureaucracy, the legal insecurity of the producers’ associations and the Community's lack of generosity in terms of incentivising the concentration of supply, are the main reasons why the system implemented in 1996 has become inefficient."
"This means that funds are not being used properly, and I hope that this problem will be resolved by means of the new proposal."
"Mr President, fruit and vegetable cultivation carry significant weight within agriculture."
"In this sector, it is especially important that producers act jointly, as it is an essential condition for market success, but it requires the development of organised cooperation."
"However, the degree of organisation is very low in the ten new Member States, and forming producer organisations (hereafter PO’s) is a long and tedious process."
"It is therefore vital to support PO subsidy, and especially to encourage the formation of PO’s and provide additional support for newly-formed PO’s."
"For this reason it would be necessary to increase the current ceiling of contributions in proportion to sales revenue from 4.1% to 6%."
"It is of crucial importance to coordinate market measures (first pillar) with rural development (second pillar)."
"The European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund allocations would not sufficiently finance infrastructure and investment development, therefore, rural development funding should be made available to PO’s."
"The fruit and vegetable sector in the new Member States requires restructuring."
"There are many old orchards, especially apple orchards, which have an impact on the EU market by driving the prices down as a result of poor quality produce, creating a crisis situation on the European fruit and vegetable market."
"Therefore, it is important that the EU gives support to clear and restructure old plantations."
"Just like the case of the school milk programme, subsidised by EU funds, a scheme promoting fruit consumption in schools should be introduced in order to stabilise the fruit and vegetable market."
"There are many strategically important products that are not able to receive market support within today’s framework."
"In the case of berries, sour cherry and mushrooms, stronger crisis management measures are warranted."
"They need to be included among processed products, and we must also appeal for the protection of sweet corn against Chinese imports."
"I thank Commissioner Boel for her letter, and I hope a solution has been found."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the EU’s most recent enlargement brought a number of changes to the fruit and vegetable market."
"The EU studies of the candidate countries in its annual reports."
"Yet although the Commission noted in its studies that the EU would gain as many as 19 new varieties of fruit and vegetables with the accession of the new Member States, and that this would increase the EU’s self-sufficiency in food and please consumers, no changes were made to the organisation of the market on the basis of these facts."
"This means that we are faced with a bizarre situation whereby a special support mechanism exists for a variety of plum, whilst nothing of the sort exists for apples, despite the fact that the latter account for 32% of all fruit picked, which makes them the most popular type of fruit."
"Support mechanisms are in place for nuts and bananas, but there is not a single one for any of the huge variety of soft fruits, which by their very nature have an extremely short shelf life, and are therefore subject to price fluctuations."
"I should like to remind the Commissioner that yet another season is passing us by without any sensible solutions having been found."
"The policy applied to the 15 old Member States remains more advantageous than that applied to the 10 new Member States, and it would appear that the Commission is merely pretending to take action, rather than coming up with practical solutions."
"In a bid to win time, a special team of inspectors has been sent to Poland."
"This is an unfortunate game to play in view of the urgent need to stabilise the fruit and vegetable market and to secure the existence of thousands of producers and their families, in particular in the new Member States."
"What is more, it is a risky game to play in view of the fact that consumers are the ones who have to suffer the effects of price fluctuations, and put up with poor-quality fruit that has had to be imported from third countries and poses a health risk."
"There is, however, a very simple solution."
"The new Member States can provide a guaranteed supply of high-quality soft fruit and apples."
"Supporting the former should therefore be made a matter of priority, by placing restrictions on imports, unless, of course, people wish to take an entirely different approach to European solidarity, and use the common agricultural policy to cover additional quotas."
"– Mr President, Mrs Fischer Boel, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament resolution on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables addresses a serious situation in European agriculture, which calls for rapid and effective responses."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on having confronted the difficulties in this sector and for having put forward some suitable solutions."
"I am sure that the Commissioner will take the concerns expressed by Parliament into consideration."
"The fact that the amendment that I tabled for introducing labels of origin for processed products has been accepted is a step forwards."
"Indeed, it is not only the textile industry that is suffering from Asian competition: the origin of processed agricultural products needs to be made transparent so that consumers can find out from the label where the products they buy come from."
"This proposal is particularly important for the processed tomato sector, which is a leading sector of the Italian economy in terms of both domestic production and exports."
"In 2004, a large proportion of the tomatoes in our fields were left unharvested: the huge amounts of processed tomatoes arriving from China at rock-bottom prices and without any health guarantees have thrown the sector into crisis."
"Chinese preserves are reprocessed in Italy, often mixed with Italian products and then resold as if made in Italy, so that the consumer cannot recognise their true origin."
"Labelling will be an essential guarantee of quality and transparency."
"Secondly, the Committee on Agriculture adopted the proposal on the need for immediate reform to address the recurrent market crises in the fresh fruit sector."
"Several parties are calling for reform to strike a balance between supply and demand and to manage surpluses."
"I hope the Commissioner will consider the need to shorten the time frame: the two-year period she has mentioned is too long."
"I should like to conclude by recalling that the fruit and vegetable sector is heavily penalised compared with other areas of agriculture: it receives only 4% of Community resources and requires cofinancing contributions that are too onerous for producers."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating our rapporteur on the quality of her work."
"I would also like to stress the importance of revising the common market organisation (CMO) in fruit and vegetables as soon as possible, as the European Commission promised to do in its communication of 10 August last."
"There is in fact a consensus for keeping the common market organisation in its present form."
"It is not therefore necessary to overhaul it completely."
"However, the crises that occurred during the last marketing years, in south-west France for example, showed the urgent need to adapt the CMO mechanisms."
"In the matter of crisis management, first of all, we need to be able to respond quickly and effectively to overproduction crises."
"A surplus of 5 to 10% in supply brings a 30 to 50% slump in prices."
"It seems to me, therefore, that the ceiling for authorised withdrawals should be raised to 20% of production."
"So far as the budget is concerned, I would point out that producers are making great efforts."
"They produce 15% of the value of European agricultural output but receive only 3.5% of aids."
"For my part, I believe the budget made available to producer organisations must be increased from 4.1% to 6% of the value of production marketed."
"The quality of local produce is essential and it must be respected."
"Finally, regarding the relationship between producers and the distribution sector, I propose that the European Union should encourage the joint trade organisations recognised in each Member State to devise codes of good conduct to avoid sudden collapses in prices paid to producers."
"I will close on the external dimension of this matter, which is crucial."
"It is essential that the level of market opening should be controlled and regulated: Community preference must be maintained, fruit and vegetables must be included in the list of sensitive products and there must be reciprocity in the opening of agricultural trade, including plant health aspects; these, finally, must be the European Union’s demands at the Hong Kong ministerial meeting in December 2005 and in bilateral trade agreements."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the market in fruit and vegetables has been subject to wide fluctuations in price since time began; it is something to which producers have – more or less – grown accustomed."
"In the past, intervention by way of market withdrawals failed to improve the sector’s stability, and so, in 1996, the reform of the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables introduced a new instrument in the shape of what was termed the operational funds, thus transferring resources from intervention to a modern and forward-looking instrument."
"It is now for us to come up with progressive instruments for the fruit and vegetables sector."
"We cannot work on the basis of a ‘return to old-style intervention’, still less to developing and extending it, or of a crisis management system existing to deal only with crises in the market."
"As I understand it, a modern crisis management system should also bear the brunt of crises brought on by the weather, for example, by supporting multi-risk insurance."
"This is something we should think about."
"It is not enough, where processed products are concerned, simply to plead the cause of production thresholds, which are antiquated and obsolete, and of processing aid."
"Why do we not also give thought to decoupling aid in the fruit and vegetable processing sector?"
"Now that decoupling characterises the whole of the reform of the common agricultural policy, it ought also, for the sake of consistency, to apply here."
"The Commission has decided to proceed with the simplification of the common organisation of the market in fresh fruit and vegetables and with the revision of the COM in processed fruit and vegetables, both in 2006."
"As regards fresh fruit and vegetables, the requirements of a modern market organisation are, today, largely met."
"I am persuaded that the common organisation of the market in processed fruit and vegetables is in need of fundamental reform."
"More good approaches are required."
"Here in Europe, there is a need for a fundamental debate on this, and a market-oriented sector needs indications as to the way it should go in future."
"The accession of 10 new Member States to the European Union meant that changes had to be made to the instruments establishing the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables, in order both to speed up the rate at which producer groups and organisations were set up and began to function effectively, and to prevent a disaster occurring on the market."
"There are very few producer organisations in the new Member States, with the figure in Poland currently standing at around 1.5% of the market."
"The new Member States should receive more assistance to ensure producer groups that have been provisionally recognised remain in existence and are properly managed."
"There is also a need for specific financial support instruments."
"Furthermore, permission should be granted for the setting up of organisations of various groups of producers, such as producers of fruit for processing or of vegetables for processing."
"At this point, it should also be pointed out that a characteristic feature of the soft fruit market is its high price sensitivity, due to fluctuations in production and the growing volume of imports from non-EU third countries."
"Uncontrolled imports mean that European farmers, including Polish soft fruit producers, are currently facing disaster."
"What are needed are measures to ensure long-term stability in this market."
"These should include an increase in the number of checks carried out on imported goods, which would also prevent any influx of low-quality products into the EU."
"The issuing of certificates of origin should form a mandatory part of these inspections, and the Commission should consider introducing import quotas for these sensitive products."
"All that the Commission is proposing, however, is to carry out studies and to take other measures that it has not explained in any detail."
"In other words, it is proposing to sit back and wait."
"Today’s debate on measures to simplify the fruit and vegetable market has prompted me to voice more general considerations on the nature of changes to the common agricultural policy."
"As an MEP from Poland, a new Member State, both I and many of my colleagues have been taken aback by the sudden change that has become apparent in the EU’s overall approach to the economy, and in particular to agriculture."
"Before we joined the EU, we regarded it as a closed structure and a closed market, to which we could only gain access with great difficulty."
"Now that we are in the EU, we hear of nothing but liberalisation."
"We are supposed to liberalise our markets in fruit and vegetables, sugar and milk and everything else under the sun, and open them up to the rest of the world."
"We joined a different EU to the one we are in now."
"Poland produces half of all soft fruit in the EU, including cherries, currants and raspberries, and Polish Members of this House have called on the Commission on several occasions and via a number of channels to put protective measures in place for the soft fruit market."
"Each and every time we were told that this would not happen, because the market needed to be liberalised, and that we must open up our market in order to show solidarity with poor countries wishing to export goods onto our markets."
"Solidarity is a fine word, and we Poles are particularly aware of its value."
"Yet solidarity must not mean inflicting other people’s poverty upon us."
"We cannot allow our farmers to go bankrupt and fall into poverty so that other people can sell their products in the EU."
"A particularly good reason why this must not be allowed is that there are serious concerns that liberalisation is of greater benefit to speculators than to farmers from poor countries."
"I continue to believe that it would be a good idea to put protective measures in place and to impose restrictions on imports of fruit onto the EU market."
"I support Mrs Herranz García’s report in full, and I very much appreciate the work she has put into drafting it."
". Once again I should like to thank the committee for its own-initiative report on the simplification of the common market organisation for fruit and vegetables."
"I have listened carefully and I can assure you that the Commission will analyse this final report very closely before presenting proposals for the fruit and vegetable sector."
"The presidency’s conclusions of November 2004 recognised that the path undertaken with the 1996 reform should be continued in the fresh fruit sector also."
"However, the Commission was also asked to carry out an impact analysis on all aspects of processed fruit and citrus."
"That analysis will be available at the beginning of 2006."
"For the sake of coherence, the Commission decided to present a global proposal covering both fresh and processed fruits."
"On crisis management, in the framework of the communication on risk and crisis management in agriculture, as well as the horizontal options identified in this context, the Commission considers that specific needs should be looked at on a case-by-case basis in the context of the CMO reviews, even for the fruit and vegetable sector."
"Accordingly, the Commission will consider carefully the creation of a mutual stabilisation fund based on public and private co-financing."
"With regard to soft fruit, the Council has also requested that the Commission carry out the appropriate analysis of the new situation in the European market resulting from enlargement and, if necessary, bring forward proposals specifically to address these issues."
"The Commission has already started the analysis of the soft fruit sector in the new Member States."
"Officials from the agriculture and trade directorates have just come back from a visit to Poland."
"When this study is finished, we will analyse the results and, if necessary, appropriate measures will be taken in due course."
"As a member of the WTO, we cannot adopt protectionist measures considered obstacles to imports."
"The most effective and efficient way to respond to market signals is to focus on the quality of our products and improve the competitiveness of our sector."
"We could do that using two different tools."
"As I have already said, one involves strengthening producers’ organisations, so that we prevent producers from competing against one another; and the second, the possibility of strengthening our promotional initiatives, which could be helpful."
"Some of you raised the issue of the import of fruit and vegetables from third countries, in particular red fruits."
"Third country imports have to meet the standards that we apply in the Community."
"Member States must check products entering into the Community and should notify the interception of non-compliant products to the Commission through our rapid alert system."
"Based on the information that we have, provided by that system, only three interceptions of fresh and frozen fruit, which did not meet our standards, took place in the period from January 2002 to April 2005."
"Given the large quantity that is imported, it is my opinion that this is a very small amount."
"As regards the introduction of special labelling of origin, I can assure you that I will be positive in my approach to that."
"I can only stress the great importance of this specific sector to the Member States, both from an economic and a job-creation point of view."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the report (A6-0096/2005) by Mr Wojciechowski, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 establishing a quota system in relation to the production of potato starch (COM(2004) 772 – C6-0014/2005 – 2004/0269(CNS))."
". Mr President, I shall start by thanking Mr Wojciechowski and the Members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for all the work they have carried out on this report."
"I would like to place this proposal in its context."
"On 26 June 2003, the Council adopted a fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy which significantly changes the way that the European Union supports the agricultural sector."
"As far as potato starch is concerned, 40% of the aid paid to the producer has been decoupled and included in the single farm payment scheme."
"After enlargement, six of the ten new Member States have been involved in the potato starch quota system for the first time in 2004-2005 marketing year."
"Since the potato starch production quotas were introduced in 1995, we have been trying to define a strategy to secure, enhance and promote the development of this very important sector."
"I return to the proposal discussed today."
"It is of vital importance to preserve the stability of this fragile sector, while at the same time taking into account the fundamental changes due to the reform of the CAP and enlargement."
"Firstly, to roll over the quotas for two years instead of the three years foreseen in Regulation (EC) No 1868/94."
"This time-frame should allow us to analyse the initial effects of the CAP reform and enlargement on the potato starch sector and enable us to act quickly should the need arise."
"Secondly, to roll over the existing quotas which have provided a stable market in the eight old Member States taking part in this regime."
"I am well aware of the fears in certain new Member States that their quotas negotiated in their accession treaties and based on a historical reference period might be too small."
"As usual, the development of the potato starch sector in all Member States will be closely monitored in the years to come."
"The Commission appreciates the contribution of the Agriculture Committee to the development of this area."
"Several of the proposed amendments, however, go beyond the scope of the Commission’s proposal, especially as far as the time-frame for the proposal is concerned."
"Because a prolongation of four years would not allow us to react quickly to possible imbalances in the European starch market, the Commission cannot accept this amendment in the context of the proposal at hand."
"The amendment concerning the transfer of quotas to new Member States certainly raises issues of great importance to the countries concerned."
"However, experience has shown that the starch potato yield fluctuates a lot, depending on climatic conditions."
"Allowing for the possibility of transnational balancing-out, with priority given to the new Member States, might incite starch producers in these Member States to increase the areas under contract, hoping for a transfer of unused quotas from other Member States, which could lead to a significant overshoot of their quotas in years when the climatic conditions in the European Union are favourable for potato growing, thus aggravating their situation."
"In conclusion, the Commission cannot accept the amendments proposed in the report."
". Ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Agriculture was confronted with two problems whilst drafting this report."
"The first was the question of how long, or in other words how much longer the present quota system should remain in force, and the second was the question of how much, or in other words whether the quota levels should be changed."
"With regard to the first of these questions, the Committee on Agriculture decided that the quota system should remain in place for the next four marketing years, rather than for the two proposed by the Commission."
"The Committee was swayed by the argument that this should be a long enough period to enable potato and starch producers to prepare production plans well in advance."
"The two years suggested in the proposal would be too short a period for such plans, and it was for this reason that the Committee on Agriculture adopted an amendment proposing a longer period of four years."
"A heated debate ensued on the second question, however, regarding whether or not changes should be made to quota levels."
"Much of the debate focused on the question of whether the new Member State had been treated unfairly, since the quotas they were allocated during the accession negotiations did not correspond to their production potential."
"Whilst the quotas for the 15 old Member States account for 89% of the total EU quota of 1 947 000 tonnes, those for the 10 new Member States amount to only 11% of this figure."
"I would remind the Commissioner and the House that the figures show clearly that the 10 new Member States produced more potatoes that the 15 old Member States as recently as 1999, with around 1 400 000 hectares of potatoes grown in the old Member States as opposed to 1 600 000 hectares in the new Member States."
"The situation has altered somewhat in the meantime, as a result of a sudden drop in the quantity of potatoes grown in the 10 new Member States, but production levels remain very high."
"Poland, the EU’s largest potato producer, was given as an example during the debate."
"Although large swathes of Poland’s potato-growing areas have been abandoned, the country remains the leading potato producer."
"In spite of this, however, its production quotas are several times lower than those allocated to Germany, The Netherlands, or France."
"This reduced quota means that Poland, a potato giant, does not produce enough starch to meet domestic demand, and has to import large quantities of this product."
"The other new Member States, in particular Lithuania, are facing similar problems."
"Conversely, it was pointed out that although the 15 old Member States have been allocated high starch production quotas, these quotas have not been filled for many years."
"Over the course of the past six years, for example, the quotas were only filled in 2001, and the shortfall in the remaining years ranged from 3% to 17%."
"As was noted, it is extremely unfair that certain countries fail to fill their quotas whilst others are struggling to survive because their quotas are too low."
"The Committee on Agriculture decided that both an increase in the overall quota and changes to the quotas allocated to individual countries would be out of the question."
"This decision was mainly motivated by a concern that the market would collapse if production increased."
"A broad compromise was reached within the Committee, however, which led to an alternative idea of a ‘balancing-out’, whereby countries would be provided with the opportunity to transfer any unfilled quotas."
"In view of the problems faced by the new Member States, the Committee on Agriculture has proposed a solution that will allow any quotas that have not been filled, as has frequently been the case in recent years, to be transferred."
"The new Member States would be the first to benefit."
"I should point out to the Commissioner and the House that this is an extremely good solution, as it does not involve increasing the total production quota, placing the market at risk or disrupting the delicate balance of the system."
"It would, however, provide us with an opportunity to redress the unfair allocation of quotas, at least in instances where quotas are not filled by certain countries."
"I should like to extend my very warm thanks to the members of the Committee on Agriculture, whatever their political persuasion, for having unanimously adopted this compromise proposal."
"I commend this compromise to the House and to the Commission, in the sincere hope that the proposal for a balancing-out will find its way into the new proposal for a regulation."
"I would also reiterate that this is an extremely ingenious and much-needed compromise, and one that demonstrates the solidarity between the old and the new Member States that we must aspire to."
", . – The issue of the production quotas of potato starch is very important for some of the new Member States of the EU, primarily for Lithuania and Poland."
"The problem is that the Agreement on the Accession to the European Union has established a very small quota for Lithuania for the production of the potato starch – 1 211 tonnes per year, which constitutes only 0.06% of the quota of the European Union."
"The quota for Lithuania, as you know, was established according to the reference period of the years 1998-2000, the period of the lowest production of potato starch in Lithuania, and it does not comply at all with the present requirements."
"I would like to draw the attention of colleagues and members of the European Commission to the fact that this quota does not even ensure the minimal economically justified utilisation of the capacity of the factories of this industry in Lithuania."
"The industry of the production of potato starch in Lithuania is composed of only two factories."
"The total technological capacity of those two factories is 13 000 tonnes of potato starch per year."
"Thus at present the Lithuanian factories operate using only 9% of their capacity."
"If today’s quota remains the same for the next several years, that will mean the disruption of the industry of the production of potato starch in Lithuania."
"The minimal, economically justified utilisation of the capacities of the factories would only be 4-5 thousand tonnes of potato starch per year; therefore, Lithuania requests increasing its quota to at least 4 855 tonnes per year, and that would comprise 0.25% of the quota for the European Union."
"In this context I would like to emphasise that during recent years the potato starch production quota for the European Union has not been exhausted, and therefore Lithuania’s request to increase the quota from 0.06 to 0.25% of the general level of the potato starch production quota for the European Union definitely will not have an essential effect on the indicators of the internal market of the European Union."
"However, the most important thing is that if the potato starch production quota for Lithuania is increased, that would secure social stability, workplaces and the infrastructure of two regions of the country that are closely related with the operation of those factories."
"Of course, to destroy something is much easier than to build it, and the problem is that, upon disrupting this sector of industry in Lithuania, the after-effects would have to be compensated, including the financial ones, and all this is happening at a time when the forecast says that the consumption and demand of potato starch in Lithuania is growing and will continue to grow, and that within the cellulose and food industries it will increase up to 8 000 tonnes per year."
"Hence, there is no doubt that the potato starch production quota for Lithuania should be increased."
". Mr President, Commissioner, the reform of the market in starch is only a very small part of the reform of the common agricultural policy."
"Even though they are concerned with such a minor aspect of this policy, however, the report and its explanatory statement serve as an excellent example of the way in which individual countries are treated differently and incorrectly."
"Unfortunately, the candidate countries agreed to such treatment in their accession treaties."
"Poland was a leading European potato producer for many years, taking second place only to Germany and France, and indeed this continues to be the case today."
"This is due both to agricultural traditions and consumer habits that go back many generations, and to Poland’s poor and sandy soil, in which farmers can grow only rye and potatoes."
"Poland’s starch production quota of 144 000 tonnes bears absolutely no relation to either the production potential of its 13 potato-processing plants, which is currently estimated at 220 000 tonnes, or to the amount of potatoes it grows."
"After all, more land is given over to growing potatoes in Poland than in any other country in Europe."
"This figure also bears no relation to the number of people either living in rural areas or working in agriculture."
"Even though Poland is the third largest producer of potatoes, the limits imposed on it have meant that it has become a starch importer."
"The Polish Government therefore regarded it as only natural to submit justified proposals anticipating that the quotas, which had been underestimated and poorly negotiated, would be increased."
"In my opinion, no one should be ashamed of admitting a mistake."
"What is shameful, however, is to refuse to correct the mistake."
"The changes proposed amounted to a quota increase of only 40 000 for Lithuania and Poland together, even though 20% of the EU’s total quota, or in other words 200 000 tonnes, has not been filled in recent years."
"Although the amendments originally tabled by the rapporteur for the Committee on Agriculture reiterated the changes that had previously been proposed by the Lithuanian and Polish governments, however, they caused quite a stir."
"The Commission protested violently, and a long and heated debate was held in the Committee on Agriculture."
"At times I felt as though I was at a football match in which Poland and Lithuania, who have made the proposal, were on one side, along with the other new Member States, and the rest of Europe on the other."
"Today we are debating the final version of this new report, which is the result of an ingenious compromise."
"My reason for dwelling on its history was to alert the House to an underlying problem that has now blown up in our faces, revealing the unequal treatment meted out to individual countries under the common agricultural policy."
"This inequality is a result of the mistakes made by those who negotiated the accession treaties, but it is also due to the changing face of agriculture and rural areas in Europe following enlargement and CAP reform."
"My comments were also motivated by a desire to emphasise that the Wojciechowski report is both well thought-out and a good compromise, and that the rapporteur has managed to reconcile all the parties in this unnecessary conflict."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament, which I am representing, also lent its support to this compromise, which involves extending quotas for a further two years, or in other words until 2009, and sharing out the four-year quotas between Member States on the basis of the 2004-2005 quotas."
"In common with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I do not believe that two years is long enough to allow us to assess the developments that have taken place in the market for starch following enlargement, and it is my opinion that unfilled quotas, which currently stand at 19% of the total, should be shared out between the new Member States."
"I must also thank the rapporteur, and emphasise that this is an example of a good compromise and an excellently drafted report."
". Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of quotas for the production of potato starch seems at first glance a simple and straightforward one."
"It seems that we are discussing here only numbers, percentage or ratios."
"However, behind those numbers there are real people, members of their families and their lives."
"I will try to give a short explanation."
"Lithuania, the country where I have been elected, has a quota that is ten times less than the country is capable of producing."
"As has been mentioned, there are two factories producing potato starch in Lithuania – both in rural areas."
"I would emphasise – in rural areas."
"Lithuania has an old tradition in the cultivation of potatoes; this culture yields well in our country."
"The capacity of the factories amounts to 13 000 tonnes per year."
"The economy of Lithuania, the fastest growing economy in the European Union, demands more and more of this product, that is, this product is necessary for Lithuania for its own needs; however, the production quota, which is only 1 200 tonnes per year, does not allow for Lithuanian factories to employ their capacity in at least a minimal, economically justified regime."
"Perhaps you fully understand what effectiveness of production this means, when factories are forced to use only 9% of their capacity."
"The present situation, that is, the production quota, forces businessmen to close those factories in rural areas."
"The people working and living there will lose their jobs."
"Moreover, the infrastructure of those two towns is related to the aforementioned factories – heating, water supply, etc. Thus, the closure of the factories will have very serious social consequences."
"The situation is even more irregular, since other Member States have much larger production quotas than they are capable of producing or consuming."
"So we get to the point that Lithuania is capable of producing, capable of consuming its own production, but the country is not allowed to produce; it is forced to close the factories."
"I think this is not fair and not in any way relevant to the main principles of the European Union."
"I understand that the issue of quotas is a very sensitive one; however, I am talking not about additional benefit, but only about the possibility to survive."
"The Ministry of Agriculture of Lithuania presented its arguments in detail to the Commission, but the Commission did not see the necessity to take them into account."
"Well, perhaps one can understand the Commission – the issue of quotas is really awkward."
"Maybe the Commission can behave that way since it is more distant from the people."
"But the European Parliament and the Members of the European Parliament must treat the peoples´ problems in a more sensitive and deep way, and not turn away from them, but take real decisions."
"One may say that these quotas have been agreed to."
"Yes, but this is bad, and they are not a ‘sacred cow’ that cannot be touched."
"If we see the problem, we have to take responsibility to solve it."
"We talk a lot and seriously about rural development and support to rural areas."
"We accommodate large funds for that; therefore, it will look unjustifiable if we destroy something that can effectively work, but then create something that would require more funds."
"Is this an effective and rational way?"
"So, I think that the suggested compromise to allow redestribution of the unused quotas is a positive step, and it will enable the Member States and the Commission to find the solution concerning this matter."
"I would like to thank the speaker, Mr Wojciechowski, for his determination and the work done."
"I hope that the colleagues will support the report prepared by Mr Wojciechowski and approved and revised by the Committee on Agriculture."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, I want to recommend and urge your support in the vote for the proposal of the Committee on Agriculture submitted by the rapporteur, Mr Jánusz Wojciechowski."
"I would also like to thank him for his qualified and hard work in preparing this document."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the adoption of this compromise proposal would demonstrate our readiness to at least partly eliminate the unjust redistribution of land for the production of potato starch between old and new Member States of the EU."
"This is clearly evident from the example of Poland."
"When the Committee on Agriculture discussed this issue, it also addressed a broader problem of the discrimination of farmers from new Member States of the EU."
"After all, it has already been said in this meeting room that European Union farmers from an old Member State on the left bank of a river, farming under identical climatic and soil conditions, receive direct payments at the level of 400 euro, compared with only 50 euro received by farmers in a new Member State on the opposite bank of the same river."
"In an open discussion about this topic, the Committee on Agriculture pointed to an urgent need to exchange opinions concerning the implementation of common agricultural policy and to speak about the problem without prejudice."
"I am very pleased to use this opportunity to note that the discussions that took place in the Committee on Agriculture clearly demonstrated the readiness – and not only the readiness, also the interest – to organise such an open exchange of opinions."
"Farmers in my country, the Slovak Republic, also hope that such discussions could lead to eliminating the tensions arising from the unequal implementation of agricultural policy in different parts of the united European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for many years Poland shared the distinction of being a leading producer of starch, with countries such as Germany, The Netherlands, France and Denmark."
"At present, however, starch-production facilities in Poland operate at only around 60% of their production capacity, because the production quota for the country is set at 145 000 tonnes. This means that starch is one of the products we have to import, because we do not produce enough of it, even though we do not lack raw materials or processing capacity."
"Poland needs a production quota of at least 180 000 tonnes, and this was the figure it proposed during negotiations."
"Powerful producer organisations have been in existence in Western Europe for over 30 years."
"Such organisations have only recently come into being in Poland, and they have suffered severe teething problems."
"In contrast, the starch-production facilities have adapted well."
"Producers invested a great deal of money in 2003 in order to meet EU environmental standards, and this is a further argument for increasing Poland’s quota."
"It should be added that the businesses concerned employ several thousand people, and they are mainly located in the areas of the country that have been particularly hard hit by structural unemployment."
"I do not believe that the amendments tabled will solve all our problems, but they are a step in the right direction."
"Even though half of all potatoes grown in Europe come from Poland, we will still be forced to import starch."
"How are we supposed to explain this to those involved in potato production and processing, and to consumers?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to draw the attention of the House to three issues I believe to be important with regard to the quota system for the production of potato starch."
"Firstly, debates on agriculture frequently leave one with the impression that by accident or by design, Commission representatives have large gaps in their knowledge of the new Member States’ production potential."
"The new Member States account for 30% of the EU’s total production potential for potato starch, which is the subject of our debate today."
"At the same time, however, the starch production quotas set for these countries amount to only around 10% of the production quota for the European Union as a whole."
"There is therefore no denying that the way in which these quotas have been shared out between the old and the new Member States is blatantly unfair."
"Secondly, it is frequently stated during debates that it would be impossible to change anything agreed on during the accession negotiations."
"The justification for this is that if a country were to benefit from a change of this kind, the other countries would also want things to be changed to their advantage."
"This kind of attitude is unacceptable."
"Thirdly and finally, the Commission takes an extremely long time to respond to speeches and motions by Members of this House."
"We often have to wait weeks for a response, and the actual implementation of measures can take months."
"This state of affairs is also intolerable."
"These reservations notwithstanding, I hope that the Commission, the Council and Parliament will succeed in reaching a compromise, if only on the issue of starch production quotas."
"Mr Wojciechowski has proposed such a compromise, which was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture, and he deserves every credit for having done so."
"Admittedly, this solution does not provide the new Member States with any guarantee that their starch production quotas will be increased, but it does at least make it an option."
"This is particularly true in view of the fact that starch production in the European Union has fallen short of current production limits by an average of 7% for each of the past six years."
"The same is therefore likely to be the case in future."
"The new regulation will make it possible for unused quotas to be transferred to the new Member States, and this will provide farmers growing starch potatoes in these countries, and in particular in Poland, with an opportunity to earn more money from their holdings."
"It will also enable the starch industry to improve its utilisation of production capacity."
". Thank you for your contributions to this important debate."
"One of the points raised by several Members concerned the question as to why the new Member States did not get a higher quota from the very beginning."
"The potato starch quotas for the new Member States were negotiated in Copenhagen in 2002 and agreed by the candidate countries and the EU-25."
"They were calculated in exactly the same way as quotas for other Member States, taking an average of the production during a three-year reference period."
"As regards the example of Poland that was mentioned, let me offer a few figures."
"Average production in Poland from 1999 until 2001 was 107 317 tonnes; nevertheless, a quota of 144 985 tonnes was granted to Poland. Therefore, to talk of unjust quota does not seem entirely justified."
"I fully recognise the importance of Poland as a producer of potatoes, but let me remind you that starch quotas are based on historical production and not on the potential of the different Member States."
"The other issues concern the extension of the time frame to four years and the possibility of quota transfer to the new Member States."
"In my opening statement I made it clear that I cannot accept the amendments proposed in the report."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission (O-0045/2005 – B6-0231/2005) by Mr Pistelli, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, on the situation in Sudan."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am frankly unhappy about beginning my speech, as we would have preferred to have Commissioner Michel answer, because he is an attentive observer who has a thorough understanding of the situation."
"I am not detracting in any way from the presence of Commissioner Fischer Boel, however."
"The last time that Parliament addressed this issue was last September, at the time of the visit by the delegation headed by Mrs Morgantini."
"Much has happened in Sudan since then, however: above all, there has been a successful conclusion to the negotiations which led to the signing of the comprehensive peace agreement on 25 January, putting an end to 21 years of civil war between the north and the south of the country, even though the set of protocols included in the agreement is very demanding and requires good will on both sides."
"At the same time, international attention has mounted over the ongoing tragedy in Darfur."
"It is a complex tragedy with many implications, and one that is difficult to summarise in a few minutes."
"Apart from the considerable attention it has received from the international community, it has also seen a remarkable humanitarian effort, particularly from the European Union, and recently also some significant pronouncements from the United Nations Security Council."
"What in our opinion lies at the heart of the problem, and therefore needs to be examined by this House, is understanding whether the positive agreement between the north and the south of the country, between Ali Osman Taha and John Garang, can be a good omen and thus have a positive influence on the Darfur conflict, or whether in fact the international community is running the risk that the unresolved problem in Darfur may instead destabilise the north-south peace agreement."
"The two issues are thus separate but closely connected, because they are occurring in the same country."
"The European Union is deeply committed because, on the one hand, it has contributed about EUR 400 million in humanitarian aid and, on the other, it is directly paying part of the costs of the AMIS mission, which is aimed at somehow maintaining relative stability in Darfur."
"In addition, there have been strong calls for the mission’s mandate to be considerably expanded and its strength greatly increased."
"It is worth remembering that Darfur covers a vast area about the size of France: it is particularly difficult to imagine that a military mission can carry out the important tasks assigned to it with a little under 3 000 men until recently, and now with 7 000 to 8 000 men."
"Even so, we are aware that the situation in Darfur remains complex; there is not the violence of a year and a half ago, but abuses are still happening."
"If we cannot stop the violence, we cannot return the displaced people and refugees to their villages."
"Paradoxically, though, we are achieving the effect that the humanitarian machinery is working, the camps are working, but they are attracting new refugees, even from Chad, because they are oases of relative peace in a country which in contrast remains highly unstable and very violent."
"With this oral question, which will also be followed up during this part session by a compromise resolution by the main political groups, we want to ask the Commission how much humanitarian aid there is and what it intends to do with it over the course of this year, and what schedule of commitments the Commission intends to promote for Darfur and for Sudan in general."
"We should also like to know whether we can work in conjunction with the Organisation for African Unity to set up a no-fly zone in Darfur, which will be the only way to stop the violence to any serious and credible degree."
"Even though there was no room for my next point in the compromise resolution, I also want to ask whether the Commission considers it worthwhile to try to raise Europe’s level of political involvement by appointing a special representative for Darfur and Sudan – as we did for the Great Lakes and for Kosovo."
"Essentially, if the European Union is investing such great political and material resources to solve the problems in that area – it is the largest donor – it seems fair to ask whether it now intends to raise its presence politically."
". The Commission is closely following the general situation in Sudan, particularly in Darfur."
"In conjunction with the Member States, it has promoted intensive diplomatic activity in Sudan and international fora with a view to fostering tangible progress in the North-South peace negotiations that led to the signing of the overall peace agreement on 9 January, and to finding a solution to the Darfur crisis."
"The Commission is determined to support the implementation of the January peace agreement and to back the reforms planned for the six-year transitional period."
"In line with the international community, the European Union feels that these agreements offer an initial platform for tackling the various crises besetting Sudan, thereby providing a comprehensive and lasting solution to Sudan’s various crises, Darfur among them."
"The Commission and the Member States therefore provided political and financial support for the negotiations that led to the ceasefire agreement of April 2004 between the Sudanese Government and the rebel movements."
"The EU has also been the main contributor, especially in financial terms, to the two African Union operations to monitor the ceasefire in Darfur."
"Though it recognises the benefits of the African Union’s operations in Darfur and the need to reinforce its mission, the Commission sees the immediate priority as being to make the African Union mission fully operational."
"At present it is operating at only 50% of its capacity."
"That calls for increased cooperation between the African Union, the European Union and other organisations, in particular those of the United Nations."
"The European Union has repeatedly shown its support for the African Union’s efforts to find a political solution in Darfur and is attending the Abudja negotiations as an observer."
"The presidency has sent a special envoy to monitor the negotiations closely."
"The parties could also be offered technical support to facilitate the progress of the negotiations."
"As for humanitarian aid, the European Union, through its Member States and the Commission, is one of Sudan’s biggest donors."
"The European Union has earmarked more than EUR 370 million in humanitarian aid for 2005, more than EUR 120 million of it in the form of food aid."
"The Commission has also earmarked EUR 60 million to support the African Union mission in Darfur."
"Since the Darfur crisis figures among the international community’s main concerns, the European Union has targeted a substantial share of its humanitarian aid into that region."
"Since 1994, the Commission has granted Sudan approximately EUR 700 million in humanitarian aid."
"."
"Mr President, there has for decades been no shortage of hotspots in Sudan; the fact is that, outside Khartoum and Omdurman, the whole country has been systematically neglected by central government, and so it is hardly surprising that crises can break out all over the place."
"Nevertheless, we are glad when things go in the right direction, and the conclusion of the peace treaty with the south in January is one example of this."
"All the parties to it must implement it without delay, and the 10 000 UNMIS soldiers deployed by the UN Security Council will help them do this."
"We thank those in Darfur who are helping the displaced persons, the injured and the victims of rape in their hour of need, and welcome the African Union’s reinforced presence there."
"Nor should we forget to mention the support we have given, enabling them to receive logistical help and other facilities from the European Union and individual Member States."
"I am glad that the Security Council has brought the situation in Darfur to the attention of the International Criminal Court."
"I see this as sending a clear message to everyone in Sudan, and also to those beyond its borders, that they cannot – contrary to what they evidently believe – go about doing the things that they are doing in Darfur without being punished for them."
"The Commission has – as the Commissioner has just said – earmarked some EUR 400 million in resources for Sudan, and I do hope that this will be paid out only when the peace treaty is implemented in the south and when there have been objective improvements in the situation in Darfur."
"I have to say that I still regard the Sudanese Government as part of the problem rather than part of the solution."
"For example, we heard yesterday that a human rights activist had been arrested shortly before he was due to travel to Dublin in order to receive a human rights prize."
"I therefore call for him, and the other persons arrested with him, to be released without delay."
"It is with this sort of contradictory behaviour on the part of the Sudanese Government in mind that I ask the Commission whether there are safeguards to ensure that none of the EUR 400 million can under any circumstances be paid out as budget support and that the resources are not, in so far as possible, distributed through governmental structures or taking them as a basis; instead, the attempt should, if at all possible, make use of the aid organisations from abroad that are present in Darfur and elsewhere."
"Mr President, I also support the questions that my colleagues have asked the Commission, which are extremely important in terms of how we deal with the continuing crisis in Sudan, in the North-South negotiations as well as in Darfur."
"As Mr Gahler said, Dr Mudawi, a brave defender of human rights in Sudan was once again arrested by the Sudanese Government, by its National Security and Intelligence Agency."
"He was about to board a plane, ready to go to be presented with an award by the President of Ireland."
"That is continuing evidence – as if we needed it – of the determination of the Sudanese Government to harass human rights defenders and arbitrarily arrest, without trial, people who have the audacity to speak out."
"That evidence needs to be taken into account in the attitudes we take in terms of the EUR 4 billion of budgetary spending that has been allocated."
"We need to be absolutely clear that we reject and are prepared to speak out about the attitude of the Sudanese Government to anyone who wishes to fight against oppression and for rights and freedoms."
"The suffering and agony of the Sudanese people demands a renewed and much more determined international effort on their behalf."
"What we are talking about in Sudan is the real tragedy of our time."
"It is the failure of the international community to deal with ethnic cleansing, with mass rape and killings in that country."
"I was looking only this morning at recent reports by NGOs about how banditry continues and how the difficulties of delivering humanitarian aid are exacerbated by this situation."
"The IDPs in Sudan are reporting very clearly to NGOs – and British NGOs are reporting to me – that they are identifying Arab militias that are now being absorbed into the army of the Government of Sudan and trained as soldiers."
"The NGOs have reported continuing attacks, again this week, on women collecting firewood."
"Those women are now so desperate that they are selling part of their food rations in order to buy wood in the markets to try to avoid the attacks they experience as they leave the camps to get firewood."
"We understand that ethnic cleansing has virtually now stopped."
"However, if you ask the African Union, they will tell you that it has largely stopped because ethnic cleansing is largely complete in Darfur."
"Two million people are homeless, and they are still being terrorised by the Janjaweed militias."
"It is estimated that 197 000 people are seeking refuge in the inhospitable deserts of Chad, which we visited last December."
"Those people have lost everything but are still prepared, in desperation, to leave their country to go to Chad."
"The desperation of those people in Sudan puts into perspective some of the debates that we have in our countries in Europe about asylum and immigration."
"Peacekeeping remains the key issue."
"The African Union is hopelessly stretched at this time and cannot fulfil its mandate unless we see much more concerted efforts to beef up the military support that they need in that country."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree wholeheartedly with the assessment and the proposals made by Mr Pistelli."
"Much has been said about the tragedy, horror and suffering of the Sudanese people because of the war in Darfur."
"The United Nations commission of inquiry was rigorous in detailing the crimes committed and the responsibility of the various actors in the conflict, who must be judged by the International Criminal Court."
"Such crimes, and the criminals who perpetrated them, must not go unpunished."
"I should like, however, to talk about the positive things that I saw during the visit by the European Parliament-ACP delegation in March."
"Aniala Fatima, a displaced person, still frightened, who had been driven out of her ruined village, was waiting with thousands of other displaced people for her turn to tell the commission set up by the government what she had lost so she could receive compensation."
"In Fashr, during the meeting with the heads of families and tribes who together were deciding on a reconciliation pact, there were the fathers of the controlling militia and the fathers of rebel sons who were saying: ‘They are our sons; we have to make peace!’"
"In Juba, in the south ravaged by war, which is, however, experiencing hope because of that amazing, vital agreement, members of parliament and NGOs told us of the need to work fast, to clear the roads of landmines, to reunite divided families and to open the university under the watchful eye of UNMIS."
"In Khartoum, the SPLM, which is no longer in hiding or is trying to develop a political movement and no longer a military one, has its offices open, and they told us that it was not a problem for them to be in Khartoum, and the African Union is also there, talking to both the rebels and the army and learning what to do to resolve the situation."
"I cannot say any more because I only have two minutes, but I think it is essential that the role of our Parliament and of the European Union should be not to condemn, but to seek solutions to the conflict, poverty, injustice and lack of democracy that are still ravaging that country."
"In that respect, the financial aid promised at the Oslo conference of donor countries is decisive, as is the aid from the European Union."
"We need to work fast because peace needs to be nurtured and, in Darfur, in addition to the desertification and poverty, thousands and thousands of people are waiting to be able to return home in safety."
"I therefore believe that we must act as I have suggested and work for peace."
"Mr President, the Government of Sudan and the Janjaweed leaders, like Musa Hilal, seem singularly immune to Western criticism."
"Having burned the people of the Darfur region of Sudan into graves and refugee camps, they have created a militarised zone – a terror zone – that separates Sudan, north and south."
"In all our peace initiatives, we must be constantly aware that, for the perpetrators of terror, peace is a threat that they will resist with all their might because peace will mean eventual conviction in the war crimes courts."
"Agreements are for the honourable; the Janjaweed are not honourable."
"They will not cooperate."
"People are suffering."
"We cannot wait for a cooperation that will not come."
"We will have to supervent Hilal and those like him."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, EUR 400 million is a lot of money. It will allow the EU to do a great deal to stabilise the situation in Sudan, but Mr Pistelli is right to ask how humanitarian aid for Sudan is actually being distributed."
"The EU must not dole out money indiscriminately, without asking whether the authorities in Khartoum are ensuring that basic standards are met."
"We are still waiting for a clear answer to the question of whether the rights of religious minorities in the country are observed."
"The concern is that Christians are being persecuted, as they previously were in a number of other African countries."
"This issue was raised by the European Union and by the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries during the Parliamentary Assembly."
"Neither Sudan nor Africa said anything in reply, but I hope that the EU will not follow their example."
"It would be a mistake for us to donate money without investigating the situation regarding human rights, and in particular that regarding the rights of religious minorities."
"This issue should be and needs to be considered as part of the equation."
"Present and future relations between the European Union and the African Union must be built on the basis of respect for human rights standards."
"In my opinion, this is the main point to emerge from the current debate."
"I share the reservations voiced earlier in this Chamber by Mrs Kinnock."
"Mr President, no sooner had Sudan emerged from 21 years of bloody civil war between the Islamist Government of Sudan and the Christian/Animist south, finally ended by the comprehensive peace agreement signed in Nairobi this January, than another appalling humanitarian situation emerged in Darfur in February 2003, whose importance internationally must be reinforced now that attention may be drifting away following the tsunami in South-East Asia."
"A recent estimate by the British House of Commons Select Committee put the casualty figures as high as 300 000, with 10 000 people dying each month from disease, starvation and atrocities, and two million people homeless and displaced, destabilising neighbouring Chad."
"Whether one calls it genocide or not, it still amounts to the most serious systematic violation of fundamental rights probably anywhere on the globe."
"The African Union urgently needs to help stop the killing in Darfur, where whole villages have been bombed and torched, where mass executions and rape are common and where an Aids crisis is now looming."
"Millions have fallen victim to a scorched earth struggle between Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir’s Arab-dominated regime, and its Janjaweed militias, and ethnic African secessionists in Darfur."
"At last, the United Nations is acting, under Security Council Resolution 1593, with a referral of those accused of war crimes to the ICC."
"China, a traditional ally of Sudan because it has oil investments there, and the United States, which opposes the ICC, have both acquiesced and abstained in the Security Council."
"While the fighting has cooled off, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan this week appealed for an African force of 12 000 troops, up from the 7 500 expected by August and the 2 500 African Union troops who are already in the region."
"Kofi Annan also wants non-African states to supply more troops, and Canada has been one of the first to agree."
"Representatives from the two groups – the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement – declared on Monday their commitment to a ceasefire and to unconditionally resuming talks with the Sudanese Government."
"I welcome the release of the EUR 450 million of EU humanitarian aid, and do not accept the pleas of innocence and, to date, impunity of the brutal regime in Khartoum, which must be held to account for its brutal crimes."
"Mr President, the author of the oral questions, Mr Pistelli, has described the problems in Sudan very well: for a very long time, the problematic North versus South situation in Sudan led the international community to turn a blind eye to the problems in Darfur."
"As has already been said, this House exists not only to analyse and criticise – very important though I believe these things are in this case – but also to supply answers and to help secure justice."
"It is for this reason that I echo our motion for a resolution in saying that I welcome the UN Security Council’s decision to mandate the International Criminal Court to examine the situation in Darfur."
"The conflict in Darfur has made refugees of over a million men, women and children."
"The UNHCR is working on the assumption that there are over 200 000 refugees from Darfur in Sudan’s neighbour, Chad."
"While there are frequent reports of attacks on refugees, the UNHCR is also very concerned about those on internally displaced persons in Darfur, where women tell how they are raped when they go in search of firewood or water."
"This makes it important that those traumatised by being displaced within their own country should be spared the further trauma of being forced to return to their homes."
"Any movement on the part of persons displaced within their own country must be purely of their own free will."
"That, too, is something for which we call in our motion for a resolution."
"We also call on the Sudanese Government to cooperate with the International Criminal Court, ensuring that those charged with crimes against humanity are brought before it."
"Only when these people stop getting off scot-free will there be a chance of stability and peace."
"The culture of impunity must be brought to an end; that will do a great deal to help establish justice."
"We have also been told that, following the signature of the peace treaty, the Commission and the Sudanese Government together hammered out a country strategy paper."
"As the object of such country strategy papers is the promotion of peace, democracy and human rights, the recent arrest of the human rights activist Dr Mudawi is more than disturbing, and gives cause to question the willingness of the Sudanese Government to pursue these goals."
"This House must send out a clear message by demanding that Dr Mudawi be released without delay."
"Mr President, the UN is the international organisation best placed to bring about a lasting solution to the conflicts in Darfur."
"It is important for the EU’s actions to take place within the framework of UN cooperation and for the EU’s efforts to be made in cooperation with institutions that have extensive experience and legitimacy such as the WHO or the UN World Food Programme."
"I welcome the UN’s efforts in the Sudan conflict, such as the recent creation of the 10 000-man strong UN mission, UMIS."
"I am also well disposed towards the proposal to increase the African Union’s presence in Darfur."
"For my part, it has always been important that it should be the UN that, in the first place, acts in this conflict."
"The UN should act in cooperation with the African Union. Possible EU actions need to be focused upon humanitarian aid following consultation with the UN."
"The UN plans to contribute aid totalling USD 1.5 billion during 2005. That is the single largest UN appeal of this year."
"It is important that the EU’s aid efforts be coordinated with those of the UN and that they take place in consultation with the UN. In that way, the world’s total efforts in Sudan will achieve their maximum effect."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I made my first statement on the situation in Darfur on 14 September 2004, since when – as you said – there have been some crucial changes."
"After 21 years of civil war and raging ethnic conflicts between north and south, a peace treaty has been signed between the government and the Sudan People’s Liberation Army."
"For this country – the largest in Africa – this is a great opportunity."
"What is vital now is that millions of refugees should be helped to return to living conditions worthy of human beings, to provide themselves with the basic necessities of life, which means not just food and drinking water, demining and the return of land to its owners, but most of all ensuring their physical security."
"Although the European Union’s strategy, which involves supporting the Sudan to the tune of EUR 400 million, is the right response, it is necessary, above all, that the release of these resources be made conditional upon the implementation of the peace treaty and, in particular, on the improvement of the situation in the south-western province of Darfur."
"A number of things have been happening in this province since our debate last September."
"The UN Security Council has handed over the grave violations of human rights in Darfur to the International Criminal Court."
"The UN’s commission of inquiry into the war crimes in this province has unequivocally described them as no less serious in their cruelty than genocide."
"The fly in the ointment, in terms of what is happening in Sudan, is that the situation in Darfur remains extremely precarious and is capable of dragging Sudan as a whole headlong into the abyss again."
"It is alarming that the human rights activist Dr Mudawi has been arrested along with a colleague and his driver, and I can do no other than endorse the call for his immediate release."
"A third element that is having a positive impact is the role played by the African Union, which has built up its forces to a significant degree, although the size of Darfur makes its 7 700 men no more than a drop in the ocean."
"Both the EU and Nato should, though, be cautious about committing themselves militarily to peacemaking operations."
"The European strategy, which is founded upon the secure supply of food and education, repatriation and the building-up of administrative and governmental capacities, whilst also planning demobilisation, disarmament and the training of security forces, is surely the right way to stabilise the situation in the long term."
". Mr President, on the specific question of Darfur, the Commission has repeatedly called on the two warring parties to put an immediate end to the violence and the suffering inflicted on the civil population and to the inexcusable acts committed in clear breach of international law and conventions."
"We believe, however, that even if desirable in absolute terms, peace in Darfur alone would not be sustainable and that it should be part and parcel of a political solution for the entire country."
"It should be stressed that nothing short of full compliance with the ceasefire agreement by all the warring parties will facilitate resumption of the political dialogue between the Sudanese Government and the rebels in Abuja."
"It is important that these negotiations resume as soon as possible and that all the parties stop insisting on unrealistic preconditions that block the whole process."
"The Commission also considers that the post-Naivasha political agenda is the right framework for reaching a lasting political solution for the whole region."
"The Commission favours a balanced approach towards the Sudanese Government and the main political actors in Sudan."
"This balanced approach consists of positive and negative measures, depending on the course of action taken by the government and the other main political actors."
"Following the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, the Commission has decided gradually to resume its development cooperation with a contribution of EUR 400 million."
"The Commission is also ready to support the parties seeking a peaceful solution for Darfur and other regions of Sudan through the political framework of the Naivasha process."
"However, as the Commission stated at the recent Oslo Donors’ Conference on Sudan, the speed at which it resumes its cooperation will depend largely on the degree of progress in effective CPA implementation and a real improvement in the situation in Darfur."
"At the same time, the Commission supports the recent UN resolutions, including the threat of sanctions and the referral of cases of perpetrators of crimes against humanity to the International Criminal Court as a necessary means of putting an end to impunity and to violence in Darfur."
"An AU evaluation mission carried out from 10 to 22 March, with the participation of the United Nations and the European Union, assessed the need for enhancing peace-support efforts in Darfur, including exploring ways of strengthening AMIS 2."
"The mission’s findings acknowledged the positive role of AMIS in the areas where it has been deployed."
"However, as I mentioned previously, it estimates that AMIS is currently operating at only about 50% of its operational capacity."
"It is important to bring AMIS up to full operational capacity before deciding on its reinforcement."
"The Commission is ready to contribute to meeting the challenges in Darfur, together with the AU and its partners."
"The sustainable reinforcement of African capabilities could be fast-tracked if the lessons learned from this operation were applied to the security sector as well."
"I have received six motions for resolutions to wind up the debate, from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament (B6-0300/2005), the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance (B6-0301/2005), the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left (B6-302/2005), the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats (B6-0303/2005), the Union for Europe of the Nations Group (B6-0304/2005) and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (B6-305/2005)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the World Bank."
". Mr President, I can indeed confirm, in the context of this Council statement on the World Bank, that the World Bank plays a very significant role at global level in the field of development financing."
"It is clear that the political and administrative management of the World Bank is thus an extremely important subject."
"However, as a representative of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, I am unfortunately not able to set out a position on behalf of the Council, or to report on the work carried out by the Council on this matter."
"Indeed, the EU itself and I would say that this, too, is unfortunate  has no part in the policy-making or operation of the World Bank."
"It is therefore down to the Member States of the EU that are also members of the bodies of the World Bank to set out their position with regard to the Bank."
"For this reason, the Council has not taken a position on the matters in question, because it has no authority to do so."
"None of the bodies of the Council have discussed a strategy for the World Bank, or the coordination of a possible common European position in this regard, or the decision-making procedures within that institution."
"I would also like to add that the Member States are working to coordinate their positions in order to have greater weight within the international institutions, including the international financial institutions such as the World Bank; this exercise does not, however, involve the Council as an institution since, as I said, the Community has no competence in this field."
"It is also true that Mr Wolfowitz, who has been nominated for the post of President of the World Bank, came to Brussels, where he met the President of the Ecofin Council, Mr Juncker, and the representatives of the other European governors of the Bank."
"At this purely informal meeting, the future strategy of the World Bank in relation to development financing was indeed discussed with the president nominated by the US Government, as is customary."
"I can therefore only regret that the Council has no competence in this matter."
"Maybe one day we should consider improving coordination between Member States of the EU within these international institutions where they actually represent, thanks to their collective weight, a greater number even than the United States."
". Mr President, as Commissioner responsible for relations with international financial institutions, I am grateful for this opportunity to explain to Parliament the Commission’s views on our institution’s relations with the World Bank."
"The World Bank and the European Union are the two main world players in the fight against poverty and in the funding of development aid."
"This Parliament is well aware that the Union provides around half of the total public aid to the developing countries, and that, furthermore, in the majority of cases, the Union is their main trading partner, which reflects the emphasis placed on solidarity within our international policy."
"The main objective of the Community’s development policy is to reduce, and ultimately to eliminate, poverty."
"This means supporting sustainable economic, social and environmental development, promoting the gradual integration of the developing countries into the world economy and combating inequality."
"As the honourable Members are aware, the Union has made a firm commitment to contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Objectives, by means of more and better funding of development aid, greater coherence amongst development policies and, in particular, greater attention to Africa."
"In relation to each of these issues, on the proposal of my colleague Mr Michel, the Commission has recently proposed specific actions, which I believe Louis Michel has had the opportunity to debate in this Parliament."
"I would like to comment briefly on the first two issues: levels of funding and the need to improve coherence amongst our development policies."
"In relation to funding, at the Monterey Summit, the Union announced its commitment to increasing official development aid from the level we were at in 2002, 0.33% of GDP, to 0.39% in 2006, as a first step towards compliance with the objective of 0.7% in 2015."
"Last month the Commission proposed two additional and interrelated objectives for 2010: an intermediate objective, for the whole of the Union, of 0.56% of GDP in development aid, and an individual objective in official development aid for each of the Member States, which would be a minimum of 0.51% for the Member States which belonged to the Union before enlargement and 0.17% in 2010 for the new Member States."
"Nevertheless, however important it may be to make this effort, it is not enough."
"Apart from aid, the policies of the developed countries have an enormous influence on the possibility of the developing countries achieving the Millennium Objectives and, in this regard, the Commission is stressing the importance of the coherence of development policies and for the first time is making commitments in this regard in these communications."
"With regard to relations with the World Bank, I would like to refer to two issues: operational cooperation between the Commission and the Bank, and the European Union's representation in the governing of the World Bank."
"Relations between the Commission and the World Bank are long-standing."
"We share the same agenda in terms of reducing poverty and, of course, we share the same Millennium Objectives."
"The World Bank is working to achieve these objectives, by means of its principal operational lines and by assessing the progress made towards achieving these objectives within the context of the Global Monitoring Report."
"The Commission and the Bank cooperate closely in the provision of aid, by means of the Trust Fund Agreement, signed in 2001 and amended in 2003."
"This cooperation led to the Union's participation in various trust funds, with a total contribution of more than EUR 1 500 million since 2000."
"Other examples include the funds for combating AIDS and specific funds, such as the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC)."
"Furthermore, both the Commission and the Bank increasingly work on the basis of national poverty reduction strategies defined by the developing countries themselves."
"In addition to these global objectives, cooperation with the World Bank also focuses on certain priority geographical areas, with regard to which we carry out joint analyses, hold joint dialogues on policies and work to coordinate financial programming for the countries closest to the Union’s borders."
"We are not, therefore, just talking about coordinated action between the World Bank and the European institutions in countries that already belong to the Union, but also, of course, the candidate countries and the neighbourhood policy countries, such as the Western Balkans, North Africa and the Middle East, and countries belonging to the Community of Independent States."
"With regard to these countries, the Union’s cooperation, by means of the Commission and the World Bank, is aimed at ensuring that the policies applied are complementary and contribute to the incorporation of the , and places particular emphasis on institutional development, the environment and its infrastructures, economic reform and development of the private sector."
"To this end, over the last five years, the Commission and, sometimes, the European Investment Bank have signed three memorandums of understanding with the World Bank."
"These memorandums serve as a practical framework for enhanced cooperation in terms of economic dialogue and technical and financial assistance."
"They cover the coordination of our activities in the fields covered by the Union’s neighbourhood policy and over the coming months the memorandum of understanding is going to be extended to the new Member States and the candidate countries, with a view to including the Western Balkans."
"I would like, finally, to comment on the Union’s representation in the governing bodies of the World Bank."
"184 States currently belong to the bank, including the 25 Member States of the European Union."
"In the Bank, the percentage of votes for these Member States of the Union is 28%, whilst the United States have 16%."
"Nevertheless, that 28% does not in practice reflect the Union’s real weight."
"The European Union’s contribution to funding granted is even greater than that 28%."
"In this regard, the example provided by the latest review of the International Development Association (IDA) is revealing."
"On this occasion, there has been a spectacular change in the contributions of the donors, with the European share increasing from 48 to 60%, while that of the United States has dropped to 13.8%, the lowest in the history of the organisation."
"Despite these figures demonstrating the Union’s participation, both in the Bank's capital and in its funding, we are not taking full advantage of that weight as a result of the lack of unified Union representation in the Bank's governing bodies."
"And thus, despite the fact that, numerically, the Member States of the Union dominate the Bank’s governing council, overall they have less influence than the United States."
"The Commission currently participates solely as an observer in the meetings of the Bank’s Development Committee, the main decision-making body of that institution."
"This situation is the same as the situation in the International Monetary and Financial Committee of the International Monetary Fund and is in clear contrast with the European Union’s influence on development cooperation compared to its effective influence in the World Bank or in the life of the international monetary system, by means of our single currency, in the case of the International Monetary Fund."
"The Commission has been insisting that, if the Union wishes to put an end to the disparity between its influence and its contributions and aspires to a greater presence on the international stage, it must speak with a single voice."
"If it is able to present a single European position, the Union will increase its visibility and its influence."
"In this regard, it should be noted that there has been a little progress in the Union’s coordination with the Bank’s governing bodies."
"For example, since last year, the executive directors in the World Bank from the European Union have been holding annual meetings with Members of this Parliament, with the Commission and with representatives of non-governmental organisations."
"The Union’s executive directors in the World Bank have agreed to meet on a weekly basis to exchange opinions and a Commission official from our delegation in Washington participates regularly in these meetings."
"The Commission is working to improve the coordination of the European executive directors in Washington, but the ultimate objective must be unified representation of the Union within the governing bodies of the World Bank."
"Before taking that decision, of course, it will be necessary carefully to examine its legal and budgetary implications, but this must not prevent us from seriously analysing how to make progress towards this objective."
"In conclusion, our cooperation with the World Bank is long-standing and intense, particularly in terms of supporting the developing countries."
"The Commission wishes to maintain and enhance these excellent working relations and to improve coordination, both with the World Bank at operational level and amongst the representatives of the Member States in the Bank's governing bodies."
"In this way, the Union would be speaking with a single voice and would have the influence it deserves within the Bank."
"Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Schmit and Mr Almunia for their contributions."
"There is a lot that can be said about the World Bank, its governance and, in particular, how its managers are appointed."
"The recent election of Mr Wolfowitz shows that qualifications for the specific task have played a smaller role than political merits."
"It shows that the appointment of senior managers in the international system still leaves a lot to be desired."
"I have little time, however, so I shall focus specifically on relations between the EU and the World Bank."
"Both Mr Schmit and Mr Almunia indicate the current weakness that lies in our not acting in unison and not speaking with one voice."
"In the case of Parliament, we recently had a meeting with the European directors of the World Bank, and they were completely united in calling emphatically for a higher degree of unified action from the EU on development issues, both across the board and specifically when it came to work in the World Bank."
"About a month ago, we also had a meeting with Jeffrey Sachs in the Committee on Development, and he asked why, given that the flow of money by way of aid from the EU is hugely greater than that from the rest of the world, the EU does not take more concerted action. In that way, he said, our work would be more effective and produce better results, and we would also have greater influence in every dimension of this important context."
"The fact is that both Mr Schmit and Mr Almunia emphasised in their contributions that something is missing at present."
"How are we to take more concerted and unified action in foreign policy if we continue to act in such a divided way in these international institutions?"
"It is also typical that, in the talks now being conducted on the future composition of the Security Council, we have no discussion at all about whether the EU, as a unified body, should have a place on the Security Council and about the fact that what still counts is, instead, the Member States acting on a national basis."
"I can only emphasise, on the basis of where I stand, that we must bring about change at this level."
"We need to cooperate in a more concerted manner and we must harmonise our efforts in a quite different way in order genuinely to obtain the results we want from action taken by the EU and to be able to accept greater responsibility in the global arena."
"Mr President, Mr Schmit and Mr Almunia, may I thank those last two gentlemen for their contributions today concerning the World Bank."
"I really feel that they focused upon what is fundamentally needed."
"There is no doubt that, five years after we signed the Millennium Declaration in 2000 concerning the developing countries’ basic needs up until 2015 – I was myself one of the signatories – we now have to note that matters have not moved in the right direction. Instead, they have unfortunately moved in the wrong direction in most areas."
"Nor is there any doubt that, over the last 15 years, 54 countries have become poorer and one billion people now live on less than two euros per day."
"The World Bank does not operate as well as it could."
"It has a series of important reforms under way, but we are still not tackling a number of problems."
"I completely support Mr Almunia’s emphasis on the fact that Europe can speak with one voice, and I would propose four tasks for consideration that I believe are urgent."
"The first task proceeds from the real need we now have in Europe to find a way of taking concerted action in the World Bank."
"If we do so, we shall have 27.98% of the votes, compared with the United States with 16.39%."
"At present, the European country with the most substantial share of the votes after the United States is Germany, with 4.49%."
"I am not talking about a new conflict of interests; I am talking about a far better balance in the World Bank and about our needing, as the second task, to ask for a reform of its lending rules and conditions and, indeed, to insist that this takes place."
"We must ensure coordination between the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and UN aid to the developing countries. In that way, our efforts will be along the same lines, rather than overlap."
"The third task relates to the need we have for reform of the Washington consensus."
"We need now really to stop making the same demands of poor countries as we make of rich ones and to help construct healthy and strong states in the developing countries which can then embrace the right to share the ownership of development policy."
"Our fourth and final task, Mr President, is genuinely to take the ILO’s report on world poverty seriously, something that the World Bank too should do."
"‘Decent jobs for all’ is the crucial tool for eradicating poverty."
"May I conclude by concurring with Mr Almunia and Mr Schmit in saying how important I believe it is for Europe now also to assume the genuine responsibility stemming from the fact that we are the world’s largest organisation providing aid to developing countries."
"We should share responsibility for ensuring that the World Bank too acts accordingly."
". Mr President, when the World Bank was set up in 1944, the seven richest countries, the G7, produced the lion’s share of all goods in the world by far; nowadays, they produce barely half of them."
"At the time of the World Bank’s formation, the United States was the biggest lender of money; today, it is the biggest debtor."
"Sixty years ago, the developing countries were still incapable of standing up for themselves, today, their influence in multilateral negotiations, for example those in the context of the World Trade Organisation, can no longer be ignored."
"All this indicates that the World Bank is in urgent need ofdrastic reforms."
"As long as the developing countries have no real say in its policy and decision-making, the World Bank will continue to be perceived as a control instrument in the hands of the so-called rich, instead of an international institution that is geared towards stability and development, in a spirit of mutual respect and solid partnership."
"The World Bank now has an external relations department, which employs more than 300 people, and which is described by the Bank itself as one of the most important departments for brushing up its image, but the question remains whether this cannot be done in a different way, namely by involving the developing countries in its operations more effectively, by finally making decision-making more transparent and by better monitoring spending."
"In short, I am among those who believe that the World Bank is in urgent need of ‘resourcing’ – not financially, but internally."
"Indeed, within this international organisation, which is considered one of the biggest and most authoritative, time appears to have stood still for more than 50 years in terms of structure, operation and mentality."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am most grateful to the members of the other groups who have given their support to our proposal to debate the issue of the World Bank, even though I was perfectly aware, like the majority of us, that the Council could not say anything very different from what Mr Schmit has declared this morning."
"We must, however, be aware of the fact that an unsatisfactory situation can and must be changed, moreover because this seems to me to be a sector in which political will can assist us."
"We do not have to resort to major articles of the Treaty in order to ensure that the Council and the Commission, together with Parliament – and that is absolutely crucial – can work to improve the question of European coordination, or at least to put it on the agenda."
"European coordination should not, however, be confined solely to the perfectly worthwhile work of technical and financial cooperation, but it must also be focused on the policies of the World Bank – policies precisely on which we have no say at all – on appointment procedures and on the criteria for granting funding."
"I believe that those are the three points on which the actions of the European Parliament should be better focused: we can do so if we want to."
"I believe, Mr President-in-Office – and you can correct me if you should choose to respond – that this is not an issue of competence, but of political will: if the Council so chooses, it can act, as can the Commission, and the same holds for Parliament."
"With regard to the appointments procedure, we very well know that directives were issued between 2000 and 2001 to make it more transparent and acceptable."
"Those directives have been ignored and that has a powerful political significance: once again it is not an issue of a procedural or institutional nature."
"The United States turned down the first candidate proposed by the Europeans to head the International Monetary Fund; the countries of Europe did not do the same when Mr Wolfowitz was presented as the candidate to direct the World Bank."
"They could have done so."
"Two telephone calls were enough to convince a couple of European prime ministers or Heads of Government, and the executive directors were completely bypassed: I believe that that would have been perfectly preventable if we had so desired."
"As regards the quality of World Bank policies, today we have no particular guarantees that certain small breakthroughs initiated by Mr Wolfersohn will be continued: I am referring to governance and to the issue of corruption."
"I believe that we should also seek to make an impression in this area."
"There is a series of extremely controversial projects, such as the large dam on the Nam Theun river in Laos or the mining project in Guatemala, that stir up opposition right across the board, and yet our executive directors have given them the green light."
"If this Parliament and public opinion had been aware of these issues, they would in all likelihood have acted differently."
"In addition to claims of powerlessness, I would also like to hear some evidence of a willingness to act."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank Mrs Frassoni for having clarified in such a direct manner the issues brought to the table."
"I believe that the appointment of Mr Wolfowitz as head of the World Bank has once again highlighted the lack of democracy and transparency that characterises the process of selecting and appointing the head of the world’s most important financial institution for development."
"It has also put the Committee on Development of this Parliament under the spotlight."
"We would like to think that the President of the World Bank had a positive approach to resolving intercultural conflicts, in addition to an unquestionable commitment in support of multilateralism, together, of course, with a personal involvement in ensuring social equality and in the fight against poverty."
"Aside from passing judgment on the person, however, who is well-known in any case for being one of the most effective proponents of the doctrine of preventative war, not to mention exporting democracy through weapons – one never knows, even Saint Paul converted on the road to Damascus – it would seem that the World Bank has not evolved much from the framework established at Bretton Woods, now more than 60 years ago."
"That is also the case as regards the system of votes and seats, which needs to be reviewed, partly in response to requests from countries of the South and movements that have been calling in recent years for a different South and for involvement."
"The European Union has pledged to guarantee and to facilitate a greater level of co-partnership from developing countries in global economic decision-making processes, including international financial institutions."
"Leaving aside those agreements and the commitments undertaken by the EU – in Monterey, Barcelona and Johannesburg – however, it would be correct and logical to ensure good governance in the running of an institution that requires co-partnership as a foremost condition for gaining access to financing."
"The lack of compliance with the criteria of democracy and transparency undermines the foundations, the legitimacy and the credibility of international institutions, in a world in which we feel the need for strong and legitimate international institutions that promote involvement: one only has to read Aminata Toure’s book, which uncovers her tragic experience of the conduct of the World Bank in Mali."
"The European Union can play a fundamental role in ensuring this legitimacy; indeed, the European Union must carry out this very role, but in order to do so, it must speak with one voice: greater coordination among the European directors must be developed, given that Europe holds 30% of the votes on the Boards of the World Bank and of the International Monetary Fund."
"The European Union, let us repeat, is the largest donor in the world, and yet it often forgets to supplement the donations with effective political action."
"A significant role can be carried out by Members of the European Parliament, and in a meeting held in New York that has already happened."
"Clear responses are needed: democratic reform of the processes must, however, also aim at overturning the asymmetry between the economies of North and South."
"I believe that we must bring about development; in contrast, the policies of the World Bank have very often had devastating effects on populations."
"This refers in particular to privatisation and basic needs, given that it would appear futile, as Mr Watson said, for the markets of developing countries to be full of goods that the people cannot buy because they have no jobs or money with which to buy them."
". Mr President, in the European Union, we are very good at sanctimonious rhetoric about the need for poverty reduction in poor countries."
"But whatever the appearances, this is not what today’s discussion is about."
"As Mr Almunia has made clear, it is about influence."
"I will not comment on Mr Wolfowitz’s suitability to lead the World Bank, but the European Union’s initial hostility to him has softened."
"The EU needs support for Pascal Leumi to head up the World Trade Organization and for its candidate – perhaps Baroness Amos? – to lead the United Nations Development Programme."
"Hence the comment of Action Aid that EU support for Mr Wolfowitz is a stitch-up, and similar remarks from other NGOs."
"Whilst I will not diminish the value to poor nations of assistance from the World Bank and the European Union, fair trading conditions would be of far greater value to them than any amount of aid or debt relief."
"Trade, rather than hand-outs, allows poor nations to help themselves, as the Indonesians were pleading after the tsunami."
"Unfortunately, the EU seems to excel in poverty creation in pursuit of its own agenda: for example, paying cash to Mauritania, Angola and Mozambique for the right to fish out their coastal waters and impoverish their fishermen; or economic partnership agreements under which the European Union tries to buy poor nations’ acquiescence to its protectionist policies."
"No doubt the rhetoric will continue."
"The reality is that self-interest rather than philanthropy drives the EU’s actions, and this self-interest is best served by the EU having its own people in the top jobs."
"Mr President, if I may, I should like to use the short time available to me to make a suggestion."
"On 18 May, the Commission will turn its attention to the European Transparency Initiative."
"A great variety of ideas are on the table, one of which is to redesign the EU’s websites."
"Might it not be possible for the Council and the Commission, and by all means Parliament too, to take the very practical step of launching an improved website setting out in very clear terms what the World Bank actually does and what progress we Europeans have achieved so far within this institution, as well as the representatives we have within the Bank, the specific projects that are involved and the opportunities that are available to us to make our voice heard?"
"Why am I saying all this?"
"Having followed the debate on screen, I was forced to draw the regrettable conclusion that nearly everything that was said had already been said 20 years ago."
"In my opinion, it will only be possible to bring about the necessary reforms – and the majority of Members believe that the World Bank urgently needs them – if transparent procedures are used to bring matters out into the open."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what has been said so far in this debate has proved once again quite clearly that we are a big payer in global terms, but not yet a big player in political terms."
"It is not enough for us to merely offer explanations as to why this is so, and to express our regret; we are called upon to take action, and we must do everything in our power to ensure that this happens without delay, in order to close the gap between what we are and what we would like to be. Unless this happens, we will be unable to honour our commitments, both within the EU and outside of it."
"Both the Council report and the Commission report were not so much reports on the World Bank as a thorough analysis of our shortcomings. The two reports make it quite clear that the problem does not lie with the World Bank, but with us."
"As the President-in-Office of the Council has already said, our problem is that it is the Member States that bear responsibility for this issue, rather than the Council, even though one could be forgiven for thinking that the two are one and the same."
"In their capacity as Council members, the Member States should do everything in their power to ensure that the Council initiates measures to remedy this shortcoming."
"A comment was made to the effect that we should start this process at some point in the future."
"Rather than leaving it until some point in the future, however, we must start it now, and without delay."
"The Constitution provides us with an opportunity to do so, as it grants legal status to the European Union."
"We must take advantage of this status in order to address the failings of our external representation."
"As I see it, the policies we pursue within the IMF, the World Bank, the WTO, the UN and the EIB are interconnected."
"All of our representatives in these institutions must speak with one voice and be coordinated by one person if we are to be able to perform the duties incumbent upon us throughout the world. The increasing influence of globalisation on our actions means that there is a growing need for a global order, for a social and economic order and for an order of principles."
"We will be unable to play our role properly within these organisations if we do not start by establishing an order of this kind in the EU."
"It is up to us to act, not the World Bank."
"Mr President, Mr Wolfowitz, in a past life, adopted a rather unilateral stance and was known to us as a hardliner; he has now become the Chairman of the World Bank, a multilateral development institute."
"This is surely – to put it in money terms – a remarkable example of laundering."
"This has also been embarrassing for Europe; as someone said a moment ago, there are new procedures in which we have a say, but all it took was a few phone calls from the US to get him in the chair."
"We had not agreed beforehand on a joint candidate, unlike in the case of Mr Lami for the WTO."
"As far as the World Bank was concerned, we came too late and were not united."
"I think that that was our failing, and a report by the Council and the Commission has been honest enough to say so."
"Needless to say, it is not just about a joint candidate, but also about policy."
"Everyone knows that, where Washington consensus is concerned, the international, multilateral financial institutions have lines and priorities that are often at odds with development and poverty policy which we in Europe would like to adopt at international level."
"It is not necessarily about having it all one way or the other. What we need is a balance."
"In order to strike this balance and to be able to place social objectives, poverty reduction and millennium objectives on the centre stage in the World Bank, it is necessary to speak with one voice."
"This requires joint action."
"I agree with what was said a moment ago: the new Constitution may give us more scope and a duty, in a way, to act in those institutions as Europe and to speak with one voice."
"It is quite something: we provide 60% of the loans under favourable conditions and have a much greater share of the votes, but are, to all intents and purposes, absent at the same time."
"We would never tolerate this in the area of trade."
"I think that this is at the heart of the matter."
"We also need coherence."
"In Africa, for example, the World Bank has been involved in the priority initiative on education."
"The Commission does not want to have any part in this, though, because the national strategy documents for that area provide for roads and infrastructure and not for education."
"We are therefore not delivering, while in this House, we are crying out for coherent, joint action."
"There is therefore a problem on both sides."
"Can the Council and Commission not reconsider whether, on the basis of the new Constitution, an initiative could be taken, at least in political-economic terms, on behalf of the World Bank?"
"We must also occupy a stronger position than is currently the case in terms of the way we cooperate."
"The position at the moment is very depressing indeed."
"Neither the Council nor the Commission is prepared to occupy it."
"After all, both have spoken very convincingly and sounded pessimistic at the same time."
"Let us head for the future ."
"Mr President, it is clear that the World Bank is an effective instrument, and could be even more so, and I do not believe that the new leadership is the problem."
"I have no particular fear that the new leadership of the World Bank may redirect energies, which to date have been directed towards other areas, in order to make the World Bank operate better."
"The problem is with us, the hypocrisy of European discourse, in which we spend our time explaining to our citizens that Europe wants to carry influence in the world, how we want to contribute to peace in the world."
"And the governments say this to their own voters and then do not make the least effort to turn these words and promises into real actions."
"The European Union as such carries no weight in the World Bank."
"We do not need a new Constitution for that; it is a problem of political will and coherence."
"Commissioner Almunia has described this perfectly."
"We have 25 Member States that do not talk to each other in the World Bank, and that is something we must condemn here."
"It is very easy to protest against the appointment of Mr Wolfowitz, and perhaps we should do so, but it should be much easier for all of us to condemn our governments’ inability to coordinate themselves in relation to policies, appointments and criteria for granting funding."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the most pressing problem we face with regard to the World Bank’s policies is its policy on structural adjustment."
"The World Bank has supported structural adjustment programmes for many decades, and yet these have often had grotesque results, for example in the case of the privatisation of services."
"A good example of this is water supplies, in that, even though these have been privatised and infrastructure put in place, the price of water has risen so rapidly that the poorest groups in society can no longer afford it."
"Another example is trade policy, as making the granting of loans conditional upon forced liberalisation and the opening up of markets means that the negotiating position of developing countries in the WTO rounds is weakened."
"All this stands in stark contrast to the EU’s development policy goals, which, for example, give water supplies a key role in the fight against poverty and strengthen the negotiating capacity of developing countries in WTO rounds."
"This is therefore a key line of attack to take in changing the World Bank’s policies."
"The reform that is now in its initial stages will change absolutely nothing."
"What is termed the new selection policy for loans, which is meant to be about to be introduced, is essentially an admission of defeat for over 30 years of World Bank policies; it means, in short, that those countries that have participated in the World Bank’s structural adjustment programmes over recent years or decades without having achieved good results and without having gained anything will now get money to tackle their most urgent social problems."
"Those countries that did not participate properly will receive less money."
"This distinction between good performers and bad performers is extremely questionable, and in my opinion the Commission and the Council have a duty to insist that it is made according to clear, transparent and easy-to-understand criteria, if nothing else. I believe that they also have a duty to urge the World Bank to make far-reaching changes to its poverty reduction strategy, in the framework of UN reform and the Millennium Development Goals."
"Mr President, I have to say that I am shocked by the Council statement here today that not a single body of the Council has made any effort whatsoever to reach a common position in relation to our stance in the World Bank, or indeed to use the clout we clearly have financially and in voting terms on the World Bank; despite the fact that every Head of State recently signed up solemnly to the European Constitution, which declares that we want to end world poverty, and despite the fact that each Member State has signed up to the Millennium Development Goals."
"We still have states that welsh on their commitments to reach the development aid target of 0.7% of GDP, which has been in place for decades."
"My own Member State solemnly declared last year at the United Nations General Assembly that it would reach the 0.7% of GDP by the year 2010."
"This year, it has announced that it will not reach that figure, not because we do not have the money, but because the Government wants to spend the money on winning the next election!"
"It is clear that the governments of the Member States of the European Union are more interested in trade than they are in eliminating poverty."
"They are more interested in securing their position in the World Trade Organization than they are in securing the position in the World Bank to pursue the objectives of the Union."
"Could I ask that this House move from making declarations to establishing an ad hoc committee so that we can prepare a common position for the European Union and the World Bank and then drive the Council and the Commission to adopt Parliament’s position on this issue?"
". Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the honourable Members for this extremely interesting debate and for the very useful messages that they have given not only to the Council but also to the Commission."
"I would like to single out two or three issues, and I will start with the influence of the EU in the financial institutions, and particularly within the World Bank."
"Let me speak for a moment on behalf of the Presidency and not as a representative of the Council."
"It is true that, if we were share-holders in a private company, we would be managing our share in that company’s capital very badly."
"However, as you know, it is a bit more complicated than that, and we are not in that situation."
"We are in a different situation, which is political in nature. Nevertheless, I must say that the message that the European Union must improve coordination of its positions within those organisations, and particularly within the World Bank, is based on absolute necessity since, as several of you have said, we are far from exercising our full influence, not only in financial terms, but also politically."
"On that subject, I would like to point out that there may be an article in the Treaty that we should take a second look at and possibly take advantage of to follow up this morning’s debate."
"I am referring to Article 99 of the Treaty – which is also included in the draft Constitution – and which provides that Member States may, on the basis of a proposal, improve coordination of their positions within financial institutions and international financial conferences."
"I therefore think that the question of representation of the EU in international circles – and especially in international financial circles – remains to be answered."
"I do not need to return to the difficulties associated with it."
"The second issue that you raised, which is perhaps linked somewhat to the first, is the reform of the international financial institutions, and in particular the World Bank."
"I think that, on this point, the European Union’s role is extremely important."
"We do need – and this was, in part, the aim of the informal meeting with Mr Wolfowitz – to urge the new President of the World Bank to pursue reform, not only of the operation of the World Bank, but also of its policies."
"I think that, here too, the European Union could have an even greater role if it spoke with one voice."
"This brings us back somewhat to the issue of the influence of the EU in the international institutions."
"It is certain that, within those institutions, it is necessary to take better account of new balances of power in the world, and to integrate better a number of new international players, new economic powers, without forgetting the developing countries."
"The final point relates to development aid policy."
"The Commissioner also provided a certain amount of information in that regard."
"The European Union is the biggest donor, giving more than 50% of development aid."
"I must say that we have started to look into new forms of development aid financing."
"The most recent Ecofin Council worked on these methods of financing."
"You are all aware of the idea that was put forward of creating certain taxes specifically in order to meet, or increase, levels of development aid, and I can tell you that, during its informal meeting that will take place on 13 and 14 May in Luxembourg, Ecofin expects to return to these new methods of financing development aid, particularly with a view to ensuring compliance with the objectives of the Millennium Summit which will be held in September."
". Mr President, I would firstly like to express my agreement with all the speeches that have referred to the need for closer coordination of the Member States of the European Union in the activities, in the decision-making, in the orientation of the policies and in the strategy of the World Bank."
"By means of the instruments available to it, the Commission tries to influence and guide the policies of the World Bank in line with our objectives in terms of development policy and official development aid."
"In my initial speech I spoke about those memorandums of understanding, those trust funds, by means of which we take action, combining the resources of the World Bank with the budgetary resources of the European Union in a whole series of activities and regions of the world, whenever we consider that those actions are in line with the objectives set by the European Union and with our priorities in the field of development aid and our policies for supporting development in the poorest countries of the world."
"Secondly, I will repeat what I said in my initial speech and something that has also been taken up by many of you: the need to make progress towards creating a single voice for the European Union in the World Bank and in other international institutions."
"Some of you have said that the entry into force of the Constitution will act as a lever for moving towards that objective, and it is true that the entry into force of the Constitution, the single personality for the Union and the political impetus represented by the implementation of the Constitution must help us to progress towards that goal."
"But it is also the case, as the Presidency-in-Office of the Council has just pointed out, that, under the current Treaty, with the provisions currently in force, the Union should already be speaking with one voice in many bodies, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, at least in relation to the Eurozone."
"There is, however, another element that will help us. I do not know if it is in line with the will of all the Member States, but I do believe that it is in line with the collective will of the Union, of this House, of the Commission and of the Council."
"Europe wants to be a global player, as Mr Karas has said, but there are certain countries which are going to be global players and which are demanding reforms within the governing bodies of the way in which the different countries and regions of the world are represented in the international financial institutions and, in particular, in the World Bank."
"Faced with this pressure, the European Union cannot respond in a divided manner, it must respond in a united fashion, moving towards that single voice."
"I would like to make a comment on the appointment of the new President of the World Bank."
"As you know, the European Commission does not participate in any way in that procedure, but Mr Wolfowitz will become President of the World Bank on 1 June."
"From that date, we want the World Bank to continue working on the positive aspects that have characterised the presidency of Mr James D. Wolfensohn over the last 10 years."
"And on the two occasions I have been able, as a member of the Commission, to speak personally with Mr Wolfowitz over recent weeks, that is what I have said to him: from 1 June, the European Commission and the whole of the Union wants the World Bank to continue in the positive direction taken during the years of the Mr Wolfensohn’s leadership."
"And I must tell you that, so far, Mr Wolfowitz’s response indicates that he is committed to continuing to work on these positive aspects."
"I hope that, after 1 June, we will see that that is the case."
"That concludes the debate on this item."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Kyrgyzstan and Central Asia."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am particularly pleased to have been given the opportunity to speak on behalf of the Council about these important matters with regard to the vital region of Central Asia."
"That region is important for the European Union from several points of view: geopolitically, geostrategically and also economically."
"Despite a certain degree of improvement recently, the situation in Kyrgyzstan remains critical."
"The new political dynamic is structured according to personal and regional allegiances and the political parties have a purely nominal role."
"The presidential election is scheduled for 10 July, and the second round could take place on 24 July."
"The risks connected with security and the uncertain economic situation could complicate the presidential campaign."
"Indeed, the presidential election campaign is increasingly turning into a competition between the two main candidates on the political scene in the country, namely Mr Kulov and Mr Akaev."
"Because of this, the stability of the country depends to a considerable extent on a possible rapprochement between these two political leaders."
"A compromise between them could include a commitment to respect the election result, which should be the usual case in a democracy, on the condition that the losing candidate can take the position of Prime Minister."
"However, at the moment, informal contacts between the two camps have not yet produced tangible results."
"On this matter, the main message from the international community, including the OSCE and the European Union, during this presidential campaign should stress the importance of holding free and fair elections."
"Nevertheless, the holding of democratic elections will not automatically guarantee that the democratisation process is completely successful."
"Many political issues will remain on the agenda, in particular constitutional reform, the expected parliamentary elections, the independence of the media and the development of a political system based on the natural development of political parties."
"The issue of constitutional reform has already been mentioned in the electoral debate."
"The parliament has set up a constitutional council, which is to set out the principles for constitutional reform to be implemented following the election results."
"Nevertheless, various political players are taking completely opposing positions in this regard."
"The economic climate is not improving significantly and public order is still precarious."
"The seizure of land around Bishkek increases the risk of disorder."
"Ethnic issues are at the heart of political debate."
"In general, the situation for ethnic minorities remains a cause for concern."
"All the most important international players, including Russia, favour the maintenance of internal security and stability in Kyrgyzstan."
"The new leaders of the country have successfully maintained good relations with all their neighbouring countries, particularly with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan."
"The OSCE’s work for Kyrgyzstan will soon be finalised and the Kyrgyz Government will need to approve it in the coming days."
"The European Commission recently announced its intention to allocate EUR 25 million to Kyrgyzstan in 2005."
"As you know, the general situation in Central Asia remains a matter of concern."
"A number of factors are creating an atmosphere of uncertainty around the countries in that region."
"First of all, the most serious threats to regional stability in Central Asia are a lack of economic reform, the continuance of authoritarian regimes and the widespread phenomena of corruption, organised crime and drug trafficking."
"We spoke yesterday about the problem of drugs in Afghanistan."
"Well, these countries are on the drug-trafficking route."
"The political rights of the people are being eroded in the majority of these countries."
"Regional cooperation has not reached an adequate level due to the lack of trust and of political will among the states in the region."
"Poverty and lack of growth in the countries of Central Asia have exacerbated socio-economic tensions."
"The geopolitical proximity of Afghanistan and certain domestic factors have allowed Islamic extremism to spread and, as I have just stated, have increased drug trafficking."
"Potential conflicts on the doorstep of the States in the region and between them could be stirred up by the mixing of ethnic minorities on the territory of these countries."
"Various specific issues need to be raised with regard to the situation in certain countries in the region."
"I will summarise them briefly."
"In Kazakhstan, the parliamentary elections which took place in September 2004 did not meet normally accepted international criteria."
"The opposition, in spite of growing support among the people, gained only one seat."
"The current President is inclined to call a presidential election before the end of his presidential term in January 2006."
"The government’s interference in the legislative process, the opposition, the media, civil society and the financial systems is worrying."
"The human rights situation is getting worse."
"In Uzbekistan, the legal opposition was unable to participate in the parliamentary elections on 26 December 2004."
"The programme of reform in the country has not moved forward and poverty has increased further."
"There is a real risk in that country that Islamic fundamentalism will spread further and further within the population."
"In Turkmenistan, the lack of freedom of expression and of democratic debate, the impossibility of maintaining an effective opposition to the government and the non-existence of any programme of structural reform are major causes for concern."
"Finally, the situation in Tajikistan is characterised by two main problems: endemic squabbles between provinces and a prolonged economic crisis."
"In spite of the problems and difficulties in the region, as I have just detailed, the European Union believes that relations with the region are of vital importance and is prepared to support the transition of these countries to effective market economies and also to functioning democracies."
"The Deputy Director-General for external relations of the European Commission recently visited four republics in Central Asia."
"On 12 May, the EU-Turkmenistan Joint Committee will meet in Ashgabat."
"In connection with the joint committee, an meeting will be held with the aim of advancing the dialogue on the issue of human rights."
"A European Union troika will meet the representatives of five countries in the region in Tashkent at the end of the month."
"In Brussels, the EU-Kyrgyzstan Cooperation Council will take place in June and the EU-Kazakhstan and EU-Kyrgyzstan Cooperation Councils will take place in July."
"Mr President, before the Commissioner takes the floor, I think some more clarity is what is needed, because I have heard two dates for presidential elections in Kyrgyzstan, namely 10 and 18 June. These are, as far as I am aware, obsolete."
"As far as I know, the presidential elections will be held on 10 July."
"Before the parliamentary debate starts, I think it would be useful, if the Council or the Commission …"
"Mr Maat, that is not a point of order."
". Mr President, it is an honour for me to be here at this plenary sitting to discuss with you the situation in a region of great strategic importance: Central Asia and, in particular, the situation in the Republic of Kyrgyzstan."
"Following the overthrow of President Akaev, as a result of the mass protests of 24 March, which were caused by the violation of international and OSCE standards in the parliamentary elections of February and March, both the EU’s High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Mr Solana, and the Commissioner for Foreign Relations, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, who is unfortunately unable to attend this debate, have urged the Republic of Kyrgyzstan to seek a path towards national reconciliation based on the construction of a dialogue and a consensus allowing progress in the process of political reform."
"The Republic of Kyrgyzstan has a unique opportunity to establish a genuine multi-party democracy in Central Asia and to eliminate the corruption that contributed so much to the recent crisis."
"This opportunity is in the hands of the political leaders of that country, who must demonstrate their firm commitment to true progress in the field of political reforms."
"The best way to achieve this is to take measures to guarantee the establishment of a multi-party democracy, respect for human rights and the existence of the rule of law, in accordance with the international commitments made by Kyrgyzstan."
"I would like to emphasise that political liberalisation and the preparation and holding of free, fair and transparent elections must be applied to the coming presidential vote; according to our information they are going to take place on 10 July."
"These elections will be closely observed by the Union and by the whole of the international community."
"The democratic credentials of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan will improve if the interim government applies the recommendations of the final mission report of the OSCE’s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, published in March of this year."
"Under the umbrella of the OSCE, the Union is preparing, by means of its rapid reaction mechanism, a range of measures for assisting in the elections and in legislative reforms in the electoral field."
"The Union is urging Kyrgyzstan to create an environment in which the media and journalists of that country can exercise their rights and freedoms fully, in accordance with international commitments."
"I believe that the OSCE is in a position to provide the authorities with advice in this field."
"It is important to fight more effectively against corruption in all the countries of Central Asia, since this has been identified as one of the main causes of the events in Kyrgyzstan."
"I would now like to talk to you about cooperation between the Union and all the countries of Central Asia."
"At the end of last year, the Union launched an initiative intended to improve political dialogue with the region."
"To this end, the of the Union’s Regional Directors met with their Central Asian counterparts last December in Bishkek."
"This political dialogue between the European Union and Central Asia can undoubtedly help to change the future of the relations between the two regions, provided that it takes place in a constructive manner."
"The Commission takes a positive view of the interest demonstrated by the five countries of Central Asia in this process."
"The success of the dialogue depends on the extent to which both parties are involved in it."
"In this regard, the Union will always be in favour of economic liberalisation and, of course, of political democratisation in Central Asia."
"The process of dialogue could focus on concerns that are common to both regions: the fight against terrorism, trafficking in drugs and people, money-laundering, illegal immigration, energy, transport and increasing economic cooperation."
"The political dialogue between the Union and Central Asia would facilitate regional integration in the area and would provide a political orientation for the cooperation between the two regions."
"The Union is studying which steps to take next."
"The meeting between the Union's and the Foreign Affairs Ministers of Central Asia that will take place at the end of June in Tashkent will be a good opportunity to continue discussing the process of dialogue."
"The Union is urging the five countries of Central Asia to persevere in the process of political liberalisation."
"The only way for a country to prosper to the benefit of its citizens, to enjoy stability and security, and to significantly promote regional integration, is to ensure that economic development goes hand-in-hand with political liberalisation, the rule of law and the development of an active civil society, one of the essential components of which is freedom of the press."
"I am convinced that that is the best way to strengthen the links between Central Asia and the Union."
"The Commission is expecting an improvement in cooperation between the European Union and the countries of the Caspian Sea region, as agreed at the ministerial conference on energy and transport that took place in Baku in November of last year."
"From a political point of view, energy has become a security issue."
"It is in the interests of both regions to cooperate in order to achieve more effective and in-depth integration of our systems and our energy markets."
"The intensification of cooperation between the Union and Central Asia depends on both political and economic aspects and, within this context, the Union remains willing to assist in this important region."
". Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we often overlook this region because it was formerly hidden in the shadows of the Soviet Union, and did not therefore develop in any independent way."
"Today, however, the region is of enormous strategic importance due to its reserves of gas and oil, and its significance in terms of energy supplies and so on. This strategic importance is also a result of China’s increasing interest in the region, the rise of Muslim fundamentalism and the fact that a number of these countries are getting caught up in the drug trade."
"We must face up to the fact that this erosion of democracy, of the rule of law and of human rights is making it increasingly difficult to cooperate with the region, to honour existing partnership and cooperation agreements and to conclude or ratify new agreements. We must also realise that regimes of this kind are turning into islands of instability rather than stability, as we have seen from the elections in Kyrgyzstan and the earlier events in Ukraine."
"The more unstable the situation in a region of such critical geographical importance, the greater the impact will be on our interests."
"It is for this reason that I should like to invite the House to think much more along the lines of a common strategy on this matter rather than tackling individual issues, and I would emphasise how important it is that genuine support be provided for the democratic process in these countries."
"My next comments are intended for the Council and the Commission. As I see it, it is in everyone’s interest for us to reach an agreement with the United States, which no longer merely views the country as a short-term base camp for Afghanistan, and with Russia, whose attitude towards developments of this kind is often influenced by old beliefs."
"It is in the interests of all three partners that the region should be stabilised, but we will be able to achieve this only if we work together to establish democracy and the rule of law."
"We should make this a new priority."
". Mr President, I think that we are all readily agreed that we are obliged, in view of what is happening in Kyrgyzstan, to face facts with regard to the entire region and to have a debate on what should be done about Central Asia, what the EU’s interests are and what we can do to improve the situation and make the region more stable."
"The developments in Kyrgyzstan are, in themselves, memorable; there is a striking resemblance to what we saw in Ukraine."
"At the same time, we have to remember that what happened in Kyrgyzstan, was, of course, not an orange revolution and we have to wait and see how the developments in that country will pan out, particularly in the light of the fair and free elections that are due to be held there."
"While I am on the subject of the elections, the European Union and the OSCE must play a central role in observing them, thereby giving the people of Kyrgyzstan the subsequent certainty that the elections were fair and that the government in power is legitimate and capable of contributing to that country’s development."
"Should all of this go to plan, we think that the European Union should also give some thought to how it can help Kyrgyzstan in its new circumstances, for this will have a positive effect on other countries in the region."
"Without entering into a long analysis of how Uzbekistan and other countries in Central Asia are doing, I would like to mention the fact that Kyrgyzstan’s neighbouring countries also have major problems about which the European Union should be concerned."
"This is, indeed, our key question to the Commission: we have a strategy for Russia and we have the new Neighbourhood Policy for many countries, but what to do about Central Asia?"
"To what initiatives, partly geared towards supporting the developments in Kyrgyzstan, can we look forward in the next few years?"
"As we see it, this is not just about safeguarding the energy supply, but also about whether we can strengthen ties with those countries and how we can, to some degree, Europeanise Central Asia, by which I mean spreading and anchoring values that we in the European Union, the Council of Europe and the OSCE share."
"We hope that the Commission and the Council will table further initiatives in this respect."
"I am the head of the delegation to the republics of Central Asia and Mongolia, and shortly we will be going to this region, to Central Asia and, namely, to Kirghizstan."
"Most of the representatives of Parliament believe the news that has spread over the world about a tulip revolution in Kirghizia."
"I would like to express my opinion on this matter, maybe from a slightly different perspective."
"I think that indeed a movement took place in this country, a movement of people; however, to name that a revolution, which has happened in the Ukraine or Georgia, would be hasty, to my mind, and I would invite Parliament to be more careful by choosing such words."
"Why do I say so?"
"Because the role of the people is not clear enough."
"What does the nation want and what do the leaders want?"
"This is the point where a difference should be seen."
"However, this region is particularly important to the European Parliament and to the European Union for two reasons."
"Firstly, some countries in Central Asia, namely, Kazakhstan, is one of the biggest trading partners with the European Union in the field of energy resources."
"As you might know, the neighbouring countries of this region, such as China, are also very interested in attracting them to their side."
"Therefore, we have to pay particular attention to our regular cooperation, purposeful cooperation in helping those countries to create democracy."
"We have to learn from the United States of America in respect to active participation in this region, and it is a pity to say that the European Union is not really very active, is not really effective with its programmes; we have to admit that."
"Although the Commission states that we are one of the main financial supporters in this region, that is, we accomodate large financial funds, from the point of view of effectiveness those funds are not appropriately used."
"What is our objective?"
"What objective should the European Union pursue in Central Asia, in all countries and in particular today in Kirghizstan?"
"That is ensuring democracy, stability and order. That is close cooperation between those countries."
"As I have already mentioned before, the visit of the delegation will take place on 14 - 20 May."
"After the visit we will be able to inform the Members of Parliament of the real situation in Kirghizstan and in the region."
"I would also like to mention that on the 2 June a meeting with the US representatives on coordination of activities in this region will take place."
"I invite all the Members of Parliament to participate."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, as I have only one minute in which to speak, I should like to focus on just one aspect of this issue. I would endorse the comments made by the previous speakers, as I too believe that our primary concern should be to acknowledge the key role played by the OSCE in Central Asia."
"This holds particularly true for conflict prevention, but it also applies in the case of crisis management and enforcement of the rule of law, human rights and democratic standards. We should not forget that the OSCE also does a great deal in other fields, such as support for civil society or measures to protect minorities."
"We should particularly welcome the OSCE’s activities in this region, especially those relating to election observation and preparations for the forthcoming elections, due to be held in Kyrgyzstan in June 2005. The aim of these activities is to ensure that the elections can be held in accordance with international and European standards."
"The issue of police training also plays a key role in this connection, particularly in Kyrgyzstan."
"In conclusion, I would ask the Council, and the Commission too, to ensure that we cooperate closely with the OSCE."
"In particular, we should put to good use the experience gained in this field by Mr Peterle, who is the OSCE special envoy for the region."
". Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his introductory remarks."
"I should also like to say how much I welcome the political changes that have taken place in Kyrgyzstan, as they will also provide us with an opportunity to clarify our foreign policy goals."
"At first glance, everything would appear to be quite straightforward."
"Elections held in Kyrgyzstan were rigged, following which the president was forced from power by popular protests, with Bishkek the next to be hit by the domino effect that had already seen the governments in Tbilisi and Kiev overthrown."
"Moscow backed an undemocratic president, and suffered defeat."
"Yet at the same time, it is also becoming apparent that there was a strong social dimension to the revolution in Kyrgyzstan, which was very much an uprising against the rule of an oligarchy that had come into being during privatisation."
"This has in fact been a common phenomenon in all post-socialist countries, where groups have existed that were or are at the centre of political power, whether as a result of their past contacts, or their ethnic or party-political ties to those currently in power."
"The members of these groups made undreamt-of fortunes from privatisation, which not only caused major rifts in society, but also gave them the necessary means and the desire to enter into politics."
"There are however further aspects of the uprising in Kyrgyzstan that distinguish it from others of its kind."
"This uprising took place in the country with the most liberal regime in Central Asia."
"The conclusion that any oligarchy would draw from this would be that the more restrictions are imposed on a society’s freedom, the greater the chances it has of remaining in power."
"Furthermore, the situation in Kyrgyzstan differs from that in Ukraine, for example, because Russophobia played no part in the Kyrgyz uprising."
"In this connection, I should like to reiterate my call for us to ensure that EU policy reflects the fact that the European Union is an institution that upholds the ideals of the rule of law and social justice."
"We should therefore support those forces that wish to strengthen constitutional order and social justice, both in Kyrgyzstan and elsewhere."
"Mr President, at a time like the present, when we are celebrating the Allied Forces liberation of Europe from Nazi Germany, many Europeans will do so with mixed feelings."
"After all, throwing off the German yoke cleared the way for decades of oppression by the Soviet Union, which was endured also by Central Asia."
"Last month, Kyrgyzstan disposed of an authoritarian leader following unfair elections."
"Both those in government and the people of that country are fearful of the possibility that Muslim extremists will take advantage of the politically unstable situation."
"Islamic terrorist organisations in particular, Hizb ut-Tahrir among them, which pursue Islamic domination worldwide, constitute a threat to the whole of the Central Asian region."
"It is therefore to be welcomed that the region, in the fight against international terrorism, combats this Islamic radicalisation."
"Unfortunately, the authoritarian regimes in the region are not addressing this issue appropriately, with the consequence, among others, that they face many problems in the area of religious freedom."
"It is right that the Central Asian governments should try to keep a grip on radicalising developments within Islam, but to require Christian churches to register with the government is, in my view, excessive."
"There should not be any fear of attacks from that quarter."
"On a regular basis, we receive reports that both registered and non-registered Christian communities are faced with major problems, including persecution."
"Allow me to quote just one example."
"In Kazakhstan, Valery Pak of the non-registered Baptist community of Kyzyl-Orda has been threatened and persecuted for years."
"This must end, for indeed, all Central Asian countries make provision in their constitutions for religious freedom."
"I would urge the Council and Commission to support those countries in their fight against Muslim fundamentalism, while also calling them to account about the problems related to religious freedom, the requirement that churches be registered, and particularly the situation of the non-registered Baptist communities, as well as the wrongs committed against Valery Pak and others."
". I should like to start by congratulating the presidency on its excellent work drawing up a detailed analysis of the situation in Central Asia, and in particular in Kyrgyzstan."
"If I may, I should like to make a number of additional comments regarding the situation in that country."
"Although over one and a half months have passed since the coup in Kyrgyzstan, the situation there is still far from stable, and this is a source of much unrest in neighbouring countries."
"We have noted a number of encouraging signs that things are returning to normal, and I believe that one such sign is the fact that a diarchy has not been established at either parliamentary or Head of State level."
"Here I refer primarily to President Akayev’s resignation in April."
"Yet events have also taken place that could cause a great deal of disquiet."
"These include a number of incidents surrounding a mysterious and politically motivated death, which have meant that an increased number of questions have been asked about the real nature of the changes that have taken place."
"In my opinion, the way in which the forthcoming presidential elections are conducted will serve as a litmus test for these changes."
"At this point, I should like to highlight the key role that the OSCE has played, is playing and undoubtedly will continue to play with regard to Kyrgyzstan."
"Monitoring of the pre-election situation and of the elections themselves should be particularly focused on those aspects of the electoral process which were a direct cause of the protests in Kyrgyzstan and which led to the coup, such as the exclusion of candidates and vote buying."
"The Kyrgyz authorities’ attitude towards the calling of early parliamentary elections will also be a key yardstick."
"If I may, I should like to make one further comment on the basis of my own experience of public life in Poland."
"Once a society begins to fight for its inalienable rights, this becomes an irreversible and inevitable process, no matter how long the struggle lasts."
"The support provided by the EU for these changes should therefore make allowance for this fact, and it should be focused on civil society."
"I am in favour of the EU providing financial support, but this should be conditional on compliance with criteria relating to human rights and the rule of law."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I still have vivid memories of the visit I made to Kyrgyzstan a few years ago."
"It is a country of great natural beauty and boasts an abundance of water, which is a great natural resource in that part of the world."
"The eyes of the world were recently drawn again to Kyrgyzstan when its long-time leader, President Akayev, was overthrown."
"Some people, including some of those present in this Chamber, have rather naively interpreted this as an event similar to those that had previously taken place in Georgia and Ukraine."
"The truth is rather different, however."
"The new Georgian and Ukrainian governments are going to great lengths to ensure that their countries pursue policies of independence from Moscow."
"In Kyrgyzstan, however, the new political set-up is just as pro-Russian as its predecessor, if not more so."
"The situation in the country remains far from stable, as evidenced by the recent assassination attempt on Mr Erkinbayev, who is running for president."
"Current events in Kyrgyzstan cannot be viewed in black and white terms, even though some Western observers appear to wish that this were the case."
"It is essential for the EU to play a more active role in this part of the world, and it must not leave the peoples involved to the mercy of the Russians and the Americans."
"That said, we should of course cooperate with both of the latter on this issue."
"Mr President, I am pleased that the Commission has cleared up the misunderstanding about the Council’s communication with regard to the election date: it is 10 July."
"All credit to the Commission, therefore, which was better informed."
"I should like to echo the words by the chairman of the Delegation for Central Asia who has already indicated that we should be careful not to compare the situation in Kyrgyzstan with that in Ukraine."
"Time will tell whether the revolution is the same, or whether a number of leaders have brought another process in motion."
"The situation in Kyrgyzstan is significantly different: its democracy is divided along ethnic and regional lines, which does not, in itself, make matters worse, nor does it alter the fact that the European Union would do well to invest in Central Asia."
"At the moment, too little is being invested and the striking thing is that until recently, the two poorest countries, Mongolia –a country deserving credit for the absence of any problems in the areas of democracy and human rights – and Kyrgyzstan, were doing best of all."
"Now that a revolution in Kyrgyzstan is underway, we should capitalise on it."
"I am pleased with the 25 million from the Commission, but it does seem to be a pittance."
"In the short term, the European Union should do as follows. I call upon the Council and the Commission, together with Parliament, to invest in the elections by sending a solid observation delegation on 10 July and by supporting the OSCE, to ensure that the elections go well."
"Indeed, elections that go well will instil trust in the people, also for subsequent parliamentary elections."
"In addition, it is important for the European Union to invest more in education and economic cooperation, because it is too crazy for words that the lion’s share of foreign investments in education are currently being made by fundamentalist Islamic groupings."
"That situation must end."
"It is a challenge for Europe to invest more in Kyrgyzstan, particularly in the areas of education and economic cooperation."
"The country also requires sound free trade agreements to this end."
"I would like to add another critical note about that region."
"I should like to find out from the Commission what it intends to do about increasing repression in Kazakhstan, including the recent closure of the biggest opposition newspaper and the imprisonment of its journalist Irina Petrusheva in Russia at the request of the authorities in Kazakhstan."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many things have been said in the previous speeches to which I will not return."
"Overall, I agree with the content of the draft common resolution that has been proposed."
"Nevertheless, I would like to stress the importance of three points."
"First, economic and social difficulties were a major trigger for the events in Kyrgyzstan."
"This is because the situation of considerable uncertainty and poverty formed fertile ground, favourable to the spread of demonstrations and to the overthrow of the government of Mr Akaev, who had been making himself rich off the Kyrgyz economy since 1991."
"Unacceptable practices, including corruption and nepotism, increased the silent but legitimate discontent of the people, who aspire to an improvement in their situation, and we must pay attention to these aspirations."
"Thus, if we are going to support the ongoing process of transition to democracy, we must pay particular attention to the honesty and transparency of the elections, and to the implementation of a policy of dialogue and national reconciliation."
"Only a stable, legitimate government will be able to successfully complete the reforms that are necessary to improve the situation of Kyrgyz citizens."
"Next, the stakes in relation to human rights and fundamental freedoms constitute another crucial aspect of the current situation."
"The European Union must satisfy itself that the democratisation process is based on true political pluralism and also allows the media and NGOs to operate freely and independently."
"The cooperation projects launched by the OSCE and as part of the TACIS programme must be supported and encouraged."
"Finally, I think we need to broaden our thinking in relation to the events in Kyrgyzstan to a regional perspective encompassing the whole of Central Asia."
"The democratisation of Kyrgyzstan could thus be seen as a hope, an example that the other countries of Central Asia, suffering from violations of human rights, can follow."
"The recent toughening of legislation aimed at NGOs and opposition groups calls for an attitude of attentiveness and of particular vigilance by the European Union faced with the changing political situation in the region."
"Mr President, Kyrgyzstan is a small, central Asian Muslim republic of incredible natural beauty and proud nomadic traditions."
"Kyrgyzstan was annexed by Russia in 1864, but it achieved independence from the Soviet Union in 1991."
"It has recently been in the news, following the 27 February parliamentary elections, when election irregularities caused widespread protest, starting in the south of the country."
"The president was forced to flee, accused of corruption and stealing the election."
"Yesterday, on a state visit to Georgia, President Bush called for freedom and democracy everywhere in the Communist world."
"Kyrgyzstan is a poor, mountainous country with a predominantly agricultural economy, but it has carried out significant market reforms under ex-President Akaev."
"He has distinguished himself by adopting relatively liberal economic policies, and has introduced an improved regulatory system and land reform."
"Kyrgyzstan was the first CIS country to be accepted into the WTO, and most state companies have been sold off, although, regrettably, cronyism and corruption have been rife."
"It is hoped that its revolution – if it is a revolution – will place it on a firm path to democracy, respect for human rights and good governance."
"It could be a model for surrounding states like Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Tajikistan which maintain authoritarian systems that are only in partial transition."
"But border disputes between Kyrgyzstan and its neighbours are delaying the process of frontier delimitation with Tajikistan in particular, but also with Uzbekistan."
"There is also the problem of the illicit cultivation of cannabis and opium poppies for the CIS markets and limited government eradication of illicit narcotic crops."
"Kyrgyzstan also serves as a transit point to south-west Asian narcotic markets and narcotics bound for Russia and the rest of Europe."
"Presidential elections are scheduled for July: I have confirmed this from the Internet."
"The European Parliament should definitely send observers to watch Kyrgyzstan’s transition to democracy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is plain to see that the European Parliament is very keen to cooperate with Kyrgyzstan, as well as with the other Central Asian countries."
"Evidence of this can be found in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement concluded in 1995."
"Issues of interest to Parliament include human rights, the democratisation of everyday life, environmental protection and energy, and these should be the focus of particular attention."
"A great many hopes were pinned upon the Kyrgyz Constitution when it was adopted in 1993."
"Even though it has since been amended four times, it would still appear to be a potentially good basis for further democratic changes in the country."
"Yet although according to the Constitution the judicial system is officially independent and responsible for ensuring that human rights are observed in the country, observers have made it clear that not enough reforms have taken place within it, that corruption is still endemic and that judges are not paid enough."
"According to these observers, the appointment by the president of the members of the Constitutional Court, the judges of the Supreme Court and the arbitrators of the Arbitration Court violates democratic principles."
"They have warned that human rights must not be curtailed on the pretext of combating terrorism."
"The European Union can and should provide the financial support it always does in order to reverse these negative trends."
"Furthermore, it can and should provide its customary moral support by being present wherever it is needed and wherever democracy must be supported and the rule of law reestablished."
"Mr President, the new millennium appears to have ushered in a wave of change, particularly in the successor states of the former Soviet Union."
"Outside factors, such as the struggle for power and for control over oil pipelines, were not the main cause of the ‘coloured revolutions’ in Central Asia, even though covert attempts were undoubtedly made by the USA and Russia to exert influence; instead, it is much more likely that these revolutions were a result of the gradual modernisation of the former Soviet republics."
"The peoples of Central Asia have grown frustrated with the old and rigid structures, and they want rapid change without bloodshed."
"Of course, the public also hopes that such change will result in an economic upturn and bring prosperity."
"In principle, reforms of this kind can bring about positive changes."
"It would appear, however, that a partial power vacuum has now emerged in Kyrgyzstan, and this brings with it the risk that the mood will change and that the country will descend into chaos and civil war."
"It is in the EU’s interests to lend a helping hand and to offer advice in order to stabilise the political situation, but excessive interference on our part could have the opposite effect, by upsetting the balance that is gradually being established in the country."
"After all, Kyrgyzstan wants to prove that it is capable of pressing ahead with reconstruction measures under its own steam."
"The fact that a wave of revolution of this kind could spill over at any time should also give us pause for thought, as it would come as no surprise if this trend were to continue in other countries with similar conditions, such as Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan."
"The EU should start preparing immediately for such an eventuality."
"I would also endorse the comment made by one of the previous speakers to the effect that this area must not be left to the sole care of the USA and Russia."
"Following the political upheaval in Kyrgyzstan, which is not entirely comparable with the developments in Ukraine and Georgia, the key causes of instability in the economic, social and other areas are still in place."
"Of course the new government cannot resolve the accumulated problems by the presidential elections on 10 July, nor indeed for several months after that."
"I myself experienced the revolution as a special envoy of the chairman-in-office of the OSCE, which in my opinion is working there quite successfully with the support of the European Union and the United Nations."
"I am grateful to you for the attentive words in connection with the work of the OSCE, which is currently striving primarily for fair elections, improvement of security and political dialogue between the presidential candidates."
"We know that there exist major differences between the north and south, and on this basis, although not only on this basis, political instability could arise before the actual elections."
"And after 10 July there will of course be an urgent need for long-term assistance from the international community to implement reform in the political, economic and social spheres."
"I am very pleased that today Commissioner Almunia has already pointed out the strategic aspect, followed by Mr Brok and other speakers."
"I myself have advised several times of the need for the European Union to re-think its relationship with that area, which is not a part of the wider Europe but is closer to us than it might seem."
"I think that in this relationship, as Mr Brok already stated, we also need to take into consideration the trans-Atlantic and Russian dimension."
"In any case I am in favour of Parliament demonstrating its attention to Kyrgyzstan with a strong team of observers, and I would also like to assure you that the Kyrgyz parliament is eagerly anticipating the arrival of our parliamentary delegation."
"– Mr President, the announcement of presidential elections next July does not constitute, for the time being at least, the to the establishment of political stability and the democratisation of the country."
"All the members spoke earlier of the serious problems faced by Kyrgyzstan."
"However, the European Union should work closely with the OSCE to organise and supervise the elections and increase humanitarian aid and financial support through the TACIS programme and the system of generalised preferences."
"The region of Central Asia must not constitute new ground for conflict between the major powers – the United States, Russia and China – for strategic control of energy resources."
"Within the framework of combating terrorism, Central Asia has become the host area for new military bases and its militarisation is being dangerously reinforced."
"The European Union has an interest in being the stabilising force in the area."
"The strategy report adopted by the European Union in 2002, for the period from 2002 to 2006, for the countries in the area needs revising and enhancing, taking account of the new situation which is arising."
"I believe and I call on the Commission to start preparing a new strategy report for the area right now, without waiting for 2006."
"Democratisation, regional cooperation, combating drug trafficking and rising religious fanaticism are important challenges which will need to be met over coming years."
"More active involvement on the part of the UN is considered important in this direction."
"Mr President, the positive domino effect that began with the democratic awakening in Ukraine and Georgia has now spread to a third country. What has happened in Kyrgyzstan is another good example of the way in which the post-Soviet is falling from power, even though the events in these three countries are not necessarily comparable."
"The Akayev regime collapsed without any outside intervention, as a result of a spontaneous popular uprising."
"The public’s patience had quite simply been stretched too far by such things as electoral fraud and the enormous fortunes amassed by a nepotistic political family that treated the country as though it were its own private property."
"The Soviet Union collapsed almost 15 years ago, yet this was not a geopolitical disaster, as the Russian President, Mr Putin, would have us believe, but a geopolitical opportunity."
"The much-needed action taken by the OSCE and the ODIHR, an OSCE agency currently headed by an Austrian, is the only external factor that can be said to have had any influence on events."
"Putin would appear to have learned from the mistakes he made in Ukraine, and the Kyrgyz opposition also acted shrewdly by giving him advance notice of the then Head of Government’s imminent overthrow."
"It was for this reason that Putin neither intervened as a supporter of the system, nor backed the wrong horse, as he had done in Ukraine, even though President Akayev sought refuge in Moscow after he was toppled from power, and was in fact smuggled out of the country in a rolled-up carpet."
"Stable and non-corrupt democracies can only be good news for Russia."
"What lessons should the EU learn from all of this?"
"The first is that we must support democratisation in this area, and the second is that we should ensure that democracy is strengthened and civil society supported, particularly in Kazakhstan, so that financial assistance does not fall into the wrong hands. Kazakhstan is much larger, richer and a great deal more important in geopolitical terms than Kyrgyzstan, which, although scenic, is only a small country."
"As has already become apparent from this debate, there are two trends that can be observed in Kyrgyzstan, and indeed throughout Central Asia."
"The first of these is a deterioration in the political situation and an erosion of human rights and civil liberties."
"The second is the growing strategic importance of the area as a whole, a far from negligible cause of which is the energy resources located in countries such as Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan."
"As I only have one minute to speak, I should like to focus briefly on two areas where assistance should be provided by the European Union."
"There can be no question that the first of these is support for human rights, civil liberties, the electoral process in Kyrgyzstan and civil society."
"The second area, and one that has not attracted so much attention in this House, is support for regional cooperation, or in other words for the Central Asian states in their fight against terrorism and drug smuggling, and in energy cooperation and water resource use, for example."
"Both Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan possess energy resources, and there are considerable water resources in Kyrgyzstan."
"To put it another way, I should like to know in what way the Commission believes that it and the European Union can support this regional cooperation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we must also discuss the resolution before us, and since I believe that no one has done so up to now, it would seem to me that the resolution is realistic and objective."
"I am pleased that it has been endorsed by nearly all of the political groups; that demonstrates the unity of the European Parliament and increases its credibility."
"First and foremost, however, Europe’s decision to turn its attention to Kyrgyzstan is to be welcomed since, the European Union has been absent for far too long, as Mr Brok has just pointed out, and it has a certain share of responsibility for having tolerated the Akayev regime and other similar regimes in the area."
"It is also true that, when we met with Askar Akayev in Bishkek two years ago with the European Union delegation, he appeared sincere and convincing in asserting that his objective was a more democratic and transparent State."
"We perhaps believed him back then, but that is certainly no longer the case."
"The resolution refers to the fragile situation in Kyrgyzstan and that is only right since, unlike the Ukraine and Georgia – as Mrs Stenzel has pointed out – the final outcome has by no means been achieved."
"At this moment in time, there is a dangerous power vacuum."
"A further issue pointed out in the resolution concerns the in-fighting within the opposition that would currently appear to hold power, united solely in its fight against the Akayev regime, whilst its democratic credentials are tainted by its former collaboration with the Akayev dictatorship."
"For this reason, point 4 of the resolution is extremely significant, as by hoping for a substantial reform of the constitution, it warns against the dangers of a system of power taking over that is similar to its forerunner, differing only by way of the political figures involved."
"This danger exists; for many years the United States has provided financial and moral support for the democratic forces in Kyrgyzstan, and we must also begin to do the same."
"Mr President, the changes the NIS region has undergone during the past year indicate that the post-Soviet systems are facing a crisis and they have not met the expectations as far as economic, political and social reform are concerned."
"The most conspicuous example of this in Central Asia is Kyrgyzstan."
"Unfortunately, we are obliged to observe that some leaders have drawn the wrong conclusions from the colourful revolutions again, and instead of trying to mend their mistakes made apparent by the events, they have barricaded the possible roads leading out of crisis for themselves, their countries and their people."
"We were sad to learn that the Kyrgyz developments forced the leader of neighbouring Kazakhstan to introduce certain rigorous measures."
"It seems that motions for a resolution amending the electoral process and the work of the media are leading in the wrong direction and that the draft bill on national security has been criticised by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe at an open forum."
"This is especially regrettable, as the international community has gladly acknowledged Kazakhstan’s progress in social and economic restructuring and in ensuring peace and harmony between different nationalities and denominations so far."
"We were filled with hope to see Kazakhstan be the first country from the NIS region to deserve the honourable and responsible appointment of Presidency."
"This is, perhaps, what makes it even more regrettable that the opposition paper, , has been shut down for a bogus reason, and the potential opposition candidate, Zharmakhan Tuyakbai, has suffered brutal physical attacks twice within less than a month."
"The fact that the police have done absolutely nothing while dozens of young musclemen have carried out assaults cannot be accidental."
"We can only hope that the Head of State has serious intentions to find and punish the perpetrators."
"Democracy means honest competition between political opponents and such attacks are incompatible with it."
"We must declare that an authority is always responsible to provide the conditions for equal opportunities and honest means in political battles in its own country."
". Mr President, I would first of all like to correct a mistake that I made with regard to the date of the elections in Kyrgyzstan."
"Mr Maat has said that these elections are scheduled for 10 July."
"This information was provided on 6 May; please therefore accept my apologies for this error."
"I would also like to thank the honourable Members who spoke for all the analyses they put forward, which were very useful and completely appropriate to the importance of the region."
"The geopolitical and geostrategic importance of this region for the European Union has been clearly expressed; this means that the European Union must have a greater presence in the region."
"We all have an interest in seeing greater stability in this region, which first of all means that the aspirations of these countries to consolidate their fairly recent independence must be supported."
"I think that, in this context, the European Union can play an important part in maintaining the necessary balance between Russia, on the one hand, and the United States, and possibly China, on the other."
"As several speakers have stressed, stability is all the more vital because these States are still internally fragile and are consequently particularly prone to the threats of terrorism and fundamentalism."
"We therefore need to work with these States so that they can evolve into democracies where human rights are respected to a greater extent and where the democratic system becomes stronger."
"This will only be possible if we help these States to promote economic growth."
"These countries are very diverse; the economic situation in a country like Kyrgyzstan is very different from that in a country like Kazakhstan, which could potentially be one of the richer States."
"In this regard, too, the European Union can play an extremely important role."
"We have had cooperation agreements with these countries since the 1990s and, within the framework of those cooperation agreements, we regularly hold meetings both with regard to the cooperation that we are in the process of building and with regard to a form of political dialogue."
"The message that also came out in your resolution, which I welcome, is that the European Union has a very important political role."
"We can play this role in close cooperation, in particular concerning issues to do with human rights and democratic transition, with the OSCE."
". Mr President, I too would like to thank all the honourable Members for their contributions to this debate, by means of their speeches, with a view to identifying the most accurate possible view, shared by all of the Union’s institutions, of the real situation, of the challenges and of the strategies and instruments available to us in order to bring freedom, a guarantee of human rights and a democratic process to the countries of Central Asia."
"For that, of course, will not only be crucial in terms of the aspirations of the citizens of that region; the stability, prosperity and democratisation of the States of that region will also undoubtedly be a very important element of our own security."
"Firstly, the elections of 10 July are very important."
"It is vital that those elections take place in an atmosphere of tranquillity, with the guarantee that the will of the citizens casting their votes will be respected."
"From that point of view, as I said in my initial speech, which many of you agree with, intervention by the OSCE is crucial, and the Commission believes that the role it must play in terms of the good conduct of those elections must be coordinated with the leading role played by the OSCE."
"In any event — as I also mentioned in my initial speech — the mechanisms available to us have been used and EUR 1.3 million has been allocated to ensuring that the electoral process takes place properly."
"It would also be desirable, if there is not yet any decision in this regard, for a delegation from this Parliament to attend those elections as observers and to provide a guarantee, or try to improve the conditions, for the popular elections to be carried out with every democratic safeguard."
"I would also like to make a second comment on the need for a regional strategy, a regional approach."
"Many of you have mentioned this and the Commission agrees and, since 2002, there has been a strategy drawn up following the visit of the former Commissioner responsible for foreign affairs adopted at the end of 2002."
"Its main objectives are to promote stability and security in the region, sustainable economic development, prioritising in particular the reduction of poverty and the defence of human rights."
"In implementing that strategy, given that one of the European Union's main interests in the region, from an economic point of view, involves energy resources, the meeting of energy ministers that took place in November last year is very important, and we believe that we must continue to progress in that direction."
"Next June, the and the foreign ministers of that region will hold another important meeting to assess the situation and to continue moving forward with the implementation of that strategy."
"Anything, therefore, that means making progress on shaping the elements of our strategy, of a common regional approach for the region, with all its dimensions of democratisation, combating poverty, defence, guaranteeing our economic interests, the protection of human rights, will have the support of the Commission, of course, and all the contents of this Parliament's resolution will be welcome in this regard."
"Finally, with regard to the particular case mentioned by Mr Maat in his speech — the case of violation of human rights — we do not currently have precise information about the case he has referred to."
"I would ask Mr Maat — although I know he is not present in the Chamber at the moment — to let us know so that our representatives in the area can gather all the necessary information, which we will then make available to this Parliament."
"I have received six motions for resolutions(1) to wind up the debate, tabled pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"The next item is the vote."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Amendment 54, which is part of Block 1, provides for the insertion into Annex 5 of additional tables, to be considered supplemental to table 22 in the Council’s common position: not alternative, but supplemental!"
"I have made this clarification because as it stands it is not clear, and so that it can be placed on record that it is an agreed position."
"Your comments will be recorded in the Minutes, and the language services will be asked to carry out detailed examinations of the various language versions and their contents."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I take the floor to table an oral amendment."
"I am calling for two adjectives, ‘public and private’ to be added to the term ‘security’ in order to further extend this fitting safeguard to employees in the private security sector, who are often penalised and inadequately protected at trade union level."
"Your Royal Highnesses: It is a great honour for me, as President of the European Parliament, to receive here today the Head of the State currently holding the Presidency of the European Union."
", on behalf of my fellow Members and on my own behalf, I welcome you most warmly."
"Your presence here in our House is evidence of your interest in European integration and the important role being played by your country in this process."
"Your visit has an historical link to the visit of your father, Grand Duke Jean, on 22 November 1990, almost fifteen years ago now."
"The European Union then had twelve Member States and the European Union had 340 million citizens."
"Today we have more than doubled, 25 countries and 455 million Europeans."
"These figures demonstrate how long a road we have travelled, and during this time we have managed to reunify a continent and share the same values."
"Your country, Luxembourg, has always been a loyal and committed advocate of European integration, and your Presidency has demonstrated once again that the so-called ‘small’ countries, small in size but great in history, are able to hold great presidencies and provide additional for Community integration, thanks to the work of intelligent politicians who have made themselves constantly available to this Parliament."
"Looking back to the past, we must remember that the name of your country, Luxembourg, is associated with important moments in European history, such as the Luxembourg Compromise of 1966, which managed to bring France back to the Community table."
"This is a magnificent moment in the history of Europe and it carries the name of your country."
"And today, with three quarters of your mandate complete, the Luxembourg Presidency has already been a great success, and I am sure this will become even more the case over the rest of your Presidency."
"your country’s government has achieved an agreement on the Stability Pact during its Presidency of the Union, respecting its fundamental principles; it has redirected the Lisbon Strategy and we have just signed the Accession Treaties with Romania and Bulgaria in Luxembourg, although there is no hiding the fact that the most difficult issue, that of the financial perspectives for 2007-2013, has yet to be concluded."
"Let us have faith in the efforts of the Luxembourg Presidency to conclude it well."
",since you were proclaimed Grand Duke in October 2000, you have always expressed your concern for all the inhabitants of your country, in particular by ensuring the proper integration of the different nationalities living there and preventing any form of social exclusion, and we know that you are joined in this task by your wife, the Grand Duchess María Teresa, and it is our honour to receive her here today as well."
"Together you are perpetuating the links uniting your family with your people and continuing along the path opened up by your father, reconciling tradition and modernity."
"That is perhaps the best summary of what Luxembourg represents today: the best combination of tradition and modernity that human beings have ever been able to create."
", you have the floor."
"On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to thank you, , for your words, which have demonstrated your profound knowledge of our political integration, in which your country has been a privileged player and witness."
"Your words have also served to encourage the work of all the days celebrated by this Institution, and it only remains for me to wish you and your wife a happy stay in Strasbourg during the rest of your visit with us."
". I voted in favour of this report, firstly because all of the rules in force ensuring that the Member States will duly be taking part in this process were complied with, and secondly because Parliament has made a favourable assessment of the approved candidate."
"We are opposed to the common agricultural policy as it stands and object to changes that, in terms of principle, are of trifling significance within the prevailing system."
"We demand a comprehensive review and overhaul of the common agricultural policy in its entirety, hence the difficulty of removing individual areas such as the subject that is now to be voted on."
"Our view is that the quota system for potato starch, which is now to be voted on, should definitely not be extended. Instead, the EU must abolish quota systems of all kinds within agriculture."
". Today Parliament adopted the common position on the proposal for a directive tabled by the Commission in 2002."
"A great deal of water has passed under the bridge in that time, and a number of aspects not contained in the original proposal have now been introduced."
"In the current version, a number of situations – salaried and liberal professions, temporary provision of services and the so-called ‘regulated’ professions, such as doctors, nurses and architects – are covered, albeit from different perspectives."
"There is also a series of amendments aimed at defining the role of the professional associations dealing with the recognition of qualifications and at setting up a single committee for this purpose."
"The amendments also advocate that the professions should be represented in the new body, and that an individual professional card should be introduced containing information on the person’s career development."
"We support structures and rules that prevent discrimination in the labour market against people from other countries."
"We are sincere supporters of a flexible and open internal market in the EU."
"We believe, however, that individual Member States should judge which professional qualifications are to be mutually recognised."
"Unfortunately, the directive takes insufficient account of national needs and basic conditions."
"Education systems vary from one Member State to another, and, in practical terms, it is thus difficult mutually to recognise all professional qualifications."
"We support the amendment recommending that the directive should not apply to notaries exercising official authority."
". This directive does not, as yet, provide a satisfactory solution to a problem that exists with regard to German professional qualifications."
"Following amendments to German legislation, the directive will mean that the German qualifications of journeyman (‘’) and master craftsman (‘’) will be placed in the same category, even though master craftsmen are required to complete a demanding additional training course that lasts many years."
"It would still be possible to add the qualification of master craftsman to a higher-ranking category, however, by including it in Annex II of the directive."
"We have voted in favour of the compromise in the hope that the ‘Committee on the Recognition of Professional Qualifications’, which will be responsible for such matters according to Article 58 of the directive, will comply with this request before the deadline for transposition."
". The recognition of professional qualifications within the EU would constitute real progress if it did not form part of a wider strategy aiming to eliminate national borders, which are seen as nothing more than barriers to the free movement of goods and persons."
"Nomadism has now been given the status of a Community virtue, making geographical and professional mobility the be-all and end-all for the New European."
"The system for recognising qualifications will have to adapt to changes that may occur in the world of work or in education systems, in accordance with the ultraliberal philosophy that drives the European institutions."
"In this spirit, the Commission has defined a very peculiar social policy which encourages the training and mobility of workers under minimal training conditions that are supposed to ensure greater adaptability to labour markets."
"On the other hand, the regulatory and professional bodies have expressed a number of concerns regarding the future of certain occupations and the quality of training given in some countries, in particular with regard to public health."
"Finally, the directive on the recognition of professional qualifications is the consequence of the directive on the liberalisation of services."
"That is to say, the Bolkestein directive is topical now more than ever!"
". We need a directive on the recognition of professional qualifications in order to guarantee the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services in the single market without discrimination concerning the level of professional qualifications."
"This principle is not disputed."
"We must avoid mixing it up with the infamous ‘Bolkestein’ proposal for a directive, the aim of which is to create a true single market in services and which we will discuss here in the coming months to amend it where necessary."
"With regard to the amendments submitted to us in the context of the draft recommendation for second reading, I share the concerns of the craftsmen in my country, who are worried that the professional qualifications required for establishment will be devalued, which is incompatible with the Lisbon Strategy and the importance of training stressed therein."
"The legitimate concern to create a true functioning single market must not lead to levelling down."
"It is in the interests of both companies and consumers to provide qualified services and products."
"That is why I voted in favour of the amendments that, quite rightly, aim to strengthen the legal security of people involved in business activity."
". We voted in favour of this report, because it proposes to improve the running of producer organisations by introducing a crisis management system and by promoting fruit and vegetables, and local varieties thereof, given that eating fruit and vegetables makes a positive contribution to public health."
"I agree with the rapporteur that we must foster the setting up of producer organisations in regions where such activity is very low, as in the case of Portugal."
"I also wish to highlight the importance attached to assuring the producer organisations legal certainty and to simplifying their control procedures, with the establishment of uniform criteria for the implementation of the checks conducted on the operational programmes by the various national and Community authorities."
"We also welcome ‘the introduction of an effective system for managing market crises in order to prevent abandonment of the sector in the face of major price collapses’."
"As for its practical implementation and the ‘safety fund’ mentioned in the report, this should be made up entirely of Community funds, given that this would be the fairest way of resolving the situation."
"The report is aimed at simplifying the EU’s organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables."
"It retains the common agricultural policy’s existing structures, however."
"We cannot, therefore, support the report."
"It is well known that agriculture is of major importance to Portugal. In this context, my country should seek to protect an area that is beyond the interests of one specific professional class; it is of interest to the nation as a whole."
"In this context, I voted in favour of this report, because I feel that this proposal meets the expectations of the producer organisations, and because I advocate a suitable model for the support scheme for processed products."
"– I voted against the removal of the opt-out possibility so that an individual worker may work more than eight hours overtime a week because of practical reasons according to the needs of the workers and the Maltese industry."
"On this there is a consensus between all social partners in our country."
"I am in favour that we limit working time and that a better balance be created between working time and the family."
"However you have to understand that in our country there exists no renting market, while land is scarce and very expensive."
"Each family nucleus, especially young people, borrow thousands of pounds so that they may have a place where to live."
"They commit themselves for a long number of years where they pay huge sums of money, and a large part of all their income including overtime, to pay the apartment or house where they live."
"A great number of these families are in a situation where it is not because they want to, but because the market so dictates, where they depend in a substantial way on the income derived from their overtime not for capricious spending but to satisfy these commitments."
"The most vulnerable families are those with a low income."
"If we limit their overtime we would not be helping them but we would be further nailing them to a cross."
"And who is going to give them the money they need?"
"The European Union?"
"The Labour Party had warned about this problem and we are here to try and solve it."
"I am much afraid though that the road is uphill."
"Mr President, I wish to explain why I did not vote in accordance with the party line on most of the amendments to the Cercas report."
"The reason was that, after taking into account informal meetings with the largest trade unions in my country, it emerged that, at present, Malta is not in an economic position to be able to implement the directive on working time."
"As explained by my colleague who has just addressed this House, the lower-income social classes would be unable to honour their commitments unless their incomes were supplemented through overtime and other allowances."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I asked a representative sample of the 20 million senior citizens from Italy, a large number of whom voted for me to be here as a Member of the European Parliament to represent them, how I should vote on the reduction in working time."
"The sample replied: ‘Some people want to make us work all our lives, every year of our working lives, plus as many months, weeks, days and hours in the day as are possible and imaginable, and as if that were not enough, they also want us to collect our pensions for as few years and months as possible, and to collect the minimum amount possible."
"The only thing we can hope for is at least to be able to work as little as possible during the working day.’"
"I have therefore voted in favour of the Cercas report and of the amendments reducing working time."
". I voted against the report on the Working Time Directive because individual workers should lose their right to opt out of the maximum 48 hour working week."
"This proposal is an intolerable interference with personal freedom of choice and liberty and typifies Brussels' mindset of wishing to dictate every facet of our socio-economic life."
"Unfortunately, the amendment to preserve the opt-out clause was defeated and thus the rest of Europe is lining up to foist upon us a Working Time Directive which is largely unsupported within the United Kingdom."
"This is one of the insufferable burdens of EU membership and a salutary warning against the increasing Brussels' control which the new Constitution would bring upon us, given the socio-economic dogma which it contains in Part III."
". UKIP MEPs voted AGAINST Amendment 37 because the Working Time Directive is already operating and will continue."
"We therefore aim to mitigate its worst aspects."
"Currently it is possible to opt-out of the 48-hour week by way of either an individual, or a group, signing an agreement with the employer."
"The European Commission wishes to retain the opt-outs, the CERCAS report eliminates them."
"Amendment 37 was listed as, ‘Proposal to reject the Commission proposal’."
"By voting against this amendment UKIP was seeking to restore the commission position, hence retaining opt-outs."
". At a time when the Constitutional Treaty requires the left to fight for a ‘yes’ vote, I believe that the amendments that the Cercas report has been able to impose on the Working Time Directive constitute a victory, given how strong the pressure from the right has been."
"However, this victory cannot disguise the social backward step that remains in the text voted on today. In particular:"
"1) the opt-out will stay in place for three years"
"2) the annualisation of working time will no longer be negotiated by the social partners."
"This is therefore a backward step in a vital area, that of monitoring flexibility."
"3) although periods of ‘non-productivity’ – for example, being on call – are still accounted for in the working time, exceptions could make it possible to calculate them specifically."
"The Constitutional Treaty aims to introduce more social dialogue, but the current directive reduces it."
"In addition, this directive affects one of the fundamental achievements of the battles of the last century: the reduction in working time, and the regulation of the working day."
"That is why, while welcoming the efforts of Mr Cercas and of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to push back the ultraliberalism with which the directive is stamped, I have abstained."
". I fully support the CERCAS report as a meaningful step towards a 48-hour working week in all 25 member states, from 2010."
"It will eliminate the current opt-out, and introduce strict new conditions on how ‘on call’ time can be counted towards the 48-hour week."
"Working time will still be calculated over a 4 month period, with exemptions available to calculate over 12-months – subject to stronger control through collective bargaining."
"Proper regulation of working time is a cornerstone for social Europe."
"It reconciles work and family life and addresses an important health and safety issue."
"It is totally wrong that an opt-out is available on health and safety law, and important that it is ended as soon as possible."
"The greatest risk is that this opt-out is extended to all Member States which would render regulation of Working Time redundant, resulting in a race to the bottom."
"The implementation date of 2010 gives both sides of industry time to negotiate new agreements that take account of the 48-hour week."
"The European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) fully supports the Report as offering a fair deal to workers across the EU."
". I abstained during the vote on the Cercas report on the revision of the Working Time Directive."
"The approved compromise text cannot be considered as progress for social Europe."
"We will need to remain very vigilant about holding onto social achievements."
"Firstly, the directive’s guiding principle is flexibility, not workers’ health and safety."
"Secondly, even if the opt-out which allows Member States to deviate from the working time provisions will lapse in time (three years), this does not prevent Member States, at their request, from having working time stipulated on the basis of individual contracts and thus from by-passing social guarantees of negotiated agreements for three years."
"Thirdly, the possibility of annualising working time also by means of legislation is the undoing of an exclusive right for social consultation."
"Although Parliament describes stand-by time (on-call duty) as working time, the inactive part of stand-by time can be calculated in a ‘specific way’ (via a collective agreement or statutory arrangement), without there being guarantees for the workers involved."
"Moreover, the division between active and inactive stand-by time is also threatening to extend to other sectors."
"We welcome the fact that Parliament has not adopted a large number of the proposals contained in the Commission’s position on the new directive on working time. This is one of the most dangerous aspects of the attacks on workers’ rights and jeopardises the gains made in a struggle that has lasted over 100 years, affecting millions of workers and their families."
"We welcome the scrapping of the opt-out, three years after a new directive, to which we contributed, was adopted."
"We are very disappointed that a classification of inactive time has been accepted, and that the rulings of the Court of Justice are to be disregarded."
"This gives rise to the possibility of the work place being subject to still further deregulation, leading to even greater difficulty in reconciling working life and family life and in protecting workers’ health and safety."
"There is also the possibility of working hours being annualised."
"Hence our vote against."
"We believe, fully on grounds of principle, that the EU should not make decisions concerning the Member States’ working times."
"That is an issue for the parliaments and both sides of industry in each Member State to decide about."
"We have chosen to support those amendments that open the way for increased national self-determination, but are voting against the resolution as a whole."
". In principle I do agree with the majority of views and arguments expressed in this report."
"However in Malta many workers work long hours because they need to do so either to make financial ends meet or to fulfil other commitments."
"In certain areas the Directive is inflexible and would have adverse repercussions on our small Island economy and to all its stakeholders."
"The implementation of this report could damage our attempts to try to retain and possible create jobs without eroding the social model."
"Workers choice and competitiveness, on the one hand, and the effective delivery of public health care and safety on the other, are both vital for the wellbeing of the Maltese people and it is not possible to trade one of against the other."
"Its crucial for Malta therefore, to retain the individual's right to choose to opt out."
"This position enjoys broad consensus in Malta, including the trade unions."
"A wide spectrum of our population do not see the report as being beneficial for Malta."
"For these reasons I feel therefore, that is not yet opportune for me to vote in favour of this report."
"My own region – the East of England – suffers the longest working hours in the U.K., with one-in-ten of people in transport working over 60 hours per week; the same numbers of machine operatives working more than 56 hours per week, of skilled tradespeople more than 53 hours per week; and of construction and storage workers more than 50 hours per week."
"Just as it was right to bring in the minimum wage to combat the problem of poverty pay, it is now time to call time on excessive working hours, which see workers bullied and exploited, fuel stress and other health problems, and which damage family life."
"That is why I fully support the end, with necessary safeguards, to the British opt-out from EU Working Time rules."
". The Cercas report, which the MEPs have approved despite numerous gaps, calls for the deletion of the ‘opt-out’ clause that the Commission proposed to keep."
"This clause, allowing certain Member States to push the legal working week beyond 48 hours, worsened social dumping in Europe."
"In a Europe without borders, French companies bound to the 35-hour week will not be able to compete with their competitors based in European countries that make use of the opt-out clause."
"However, we do not have any illusions."
"Adoption of Mr Cercas’s report is just a first step."
"At first reading today, the European Parliament has forced back the European Commission because many MEPs are afraid of the French electorate expressing their displeasure on 29 May."
". I voted for Amendment 37 calling for the rejection of this draft directive, which retains the negative points of the previous legislation such as the opt-out and begins the process of dismantling the working time rules."
"The rapporteur, Mr Cercas, however, is attempting to demonstrate the European Parliament’s intention to secure abandonment of the opt-out, a real poison for the future of European social law, within three years."
"I think we need to support him in this aim."
"Nevertheless, I cannot accept that, in return, he is allowing the 48-hour maximum to be calculated over a 12-month period and is allowing working time to be calculated and annualised as employers have demanded, as well as reducing the extent to which time on call is taken into account."
"This compromise is not satisfactory and is in no way a step forward as we have the right to expect in the European Union."
"It even includes some backward steps."
"We are in the early stages of the legislative procedure, and a vote in favour of the Cercas report is nothing more than support for the approach taken towards abandoning the opt-out."
"Nonetheless, at the end of the codecision stage, I will not approve a working text based on 48 hours."
". The Commission’s proposal to amend the Working Time Directive is, in practical terms, detrimental to millions of workers in Europe."
"The opt-out remains in place, although it is proven that it leads to longer working weeks and affects workers’ health; it should be repealed as soon as possible, preferably in 2008, and I support Mr Cercas’ compromise to that end."
"We regarded the extension of the reference period from four months to a year, with peaks of 65-hour weeks, as a feudal 19th century phenomenon, and that is why we must hold onto the four-month reference period."
"Finally, the ruling by the European Court of Justice in respect of on-call duty must be adhered to."
"The Commission is accommodating the wish of companies to become more flexible in a unilateral manner."
"The maximum 48-hour working week as we know it is, in fact, already archaic."
"The current working week is around 40 hours, with the large majority of workers wanting an even shorter working week."
"That is why I would argue in favour of a European Working Times Standard to further redistribute the work and better reconcile work, family, care and education."
". I believe that we must amend the 1993 working time directive so that it may better fulfil the realities of today’s world."
"It will, however, have to ensure a high level of health and safety protection for workers, offer businesses greater flexibility in how they manage working time, and allow greater reconciliation of work and family life."
"That sounds as though we want to put a square peg in a round hole."
"I feel that our contribution should allow the reference periods to be lengthened."
"I am in favour of annualisation, which can also affect workers and which will enable us to accommodate fluctuations in demand, particularly seasonal fluctuations."
"With regard to on-call time, I could have lived with the Commission’s proposal respecting the subsidiarity principle, because it stipulates that the inactive part of on-call time is not considered working time, unless national law or a collective convention insists otherwise."
"Finally, I believe that keeping the opt-out is at odds with the aim of the directive."
"Working time is something that lends itself to national legislation and that the EU should not regulate."
"There is, however, now already a directive at EU level that regulates working time, and the present directive is designed to update the existing directive."
"The Liberal Party has therefore voted in favour of ensuring that individual rules in the working time directive are as constructive as possible."
"We have defended the principle of subsidiarity and a flexible labour market in which employees’ health is simultaneously protected."
"Unfortunately, a host of detailed regulation, which we believe may damage small enterprises in Europe, was voted through."
"We therefore voted against the proposal as a whole."
". Further to the adoption of Amendment 10, the Dutch delegation of the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy thought it wise to vote against the amended Commission proposal on the organisation of working time."
"According to the VVD delegation, the fact that Europe prescribes that the total on-call duty, including stand-by and rest times, should be considered working time, is an example of interference from Brussels which will only lose Europe even more support, at the very time when it needs even more of it."
". I congratulate my colleague Mr Cercas on his excellent report."
"He has struck an admirable compromise between the needs of a flexible labour market and the protection of individual workers from the damage long hours can do to their health and safety and work-life balance."
"Annualisation of the 48 hour week will allow businesses to cope with seasonal fluctuations, sudden increases in demand or crisis situations."
"The employee will be guaranteed reasonable hours over the whole of the year."
"Ending the individual opt-out will give protection to those workers who under the present Directive face pressure to sign away their rights."
". The solutions we applied successfully in the past are no longer enough to overcome the problems we are currently experiencing in the shape of rising unemployment and a shaky economy."
"The ‘standard’ employment relationship is becoming less and less the norm, and the society in which we live is becoming ever more flexible. This fact is reflected in new ways of organising working time, such as part-time work or working time accounts."
"Anyone who wishes to progress up the career ladder has no choice but to be flexible."
"At the same time, however, we are also faced with the problem of decreasing birth rates in Europe, and it would be a disastrous mistake to attempt to reverse this trend by means of immigration."
"Work-family balance will play an ever more crucial role in this respect."
"Parents are often pushed to their limits by the task of reconciling work and family duties."
"Flexitime will only benefit businesses and families if we make the necessary changes to support structures such as childcare facilities, in order to ensure that allowance is made for such changes."
"If it is the case that some fathers and mothers of young children have to stop working, then Europe may well already have missed the boat."
". Today the European Parliamentary Labour Party voted in favour of a compromise package on working time proposed by the PES the EPP groups in the European Parliament."
"It will now be put to the governments in the EU Council for consideration."
"It is in line with our vote in 2004 and supports the principle at the heart of this directive, the health and safety of workers and the aim to reconcile work and family life and increase productivity."
"The EPLP understands the adjustment difficulties faced by the United Kingdom and others, but thanks to certain flexible provisions in the report, such as the extended reference period of 12 months, these difficulties are overcome."
"We recognise that on call time is the same as working time, as ruled by the ECJ in the SIMAP and JAEGER cases."
"These landmark rulings have implications for the NHS and member states' health care systems, but by allowing member states themselves to calculate this part of working time, the compromise package we have achieved is sufficiently flexible."
"The EPLP hopes a positive vote at the first stage of the process will ensure the adoption of a report on working time that safeguards workers' health and safety, makes work-life balance a reality whilst containing the requisite degree of flexibility."
". The fact that there was a clear discrepancy between the majority vote in the committee responsible for employment-related matters and the committee responsible for industry-related matters is, in itself, symptomatic of the imbalance to be found in the version put to the vote and in many of the amendments put forward."
"I personally have confidence in a model that, first and foremost, upholds the subsidiarity principle, giving the Member States sufficient leeway to adapt the rules on working time to their own economic situation."
"The priority is to be able to adapt to each country’s economic reality and specific needs, in all circumstances, provided that core values are adhered to, because this is one of the main guiding principles of national legislation, and is certainly true in Portugal’s case."
"In any event, excessive rigidity in any regulation in this area is damaging to the economy, to industry and to the service industry, and consequently affects both workers and people seeking work."
". In the Working Time Report and every work related report, I look to see if the largest work force in Europe, home carers are included."
"They aren't."
"This is particularly sad because a document that deals with the amount of hours someone works in a week applies to them more than any other group of workers in the EU."
"We could and should have looked at issues like ‘on call time’ in relation to home carers."
"This is more than a missed opportunity."
"It is discrimination and exclusion of people who work long, long hours, people who are always on call."
"Can we resolve that we will examine the situation of carers and that we will include them in our recommendations on work in future, and that we will no longer discriminate against this important workforce which is already discriminated in the area of pay."
". My position on this issue is inspired by the belief that weekly working time, a key aspect of social and economic life in EU Member States, should not be regulated at European level."
"Working time comes under the heading of employment law, which is adopted in every democratic country by a parliament that represents all parties involved in the employment process."
"This provides a sufficient guarantee that employees’ and employers’ rights will be respected."
"Today’s vote is a black day for European entrepreneurship and prosperity."
"The ‘yes’ votes cast by the Left and the Liberals meant that the proposal to tighten up the Working Time Directive was adopted by the House."
"The latter will now become one of the most damaging pieces of European legislation, as it amounts to nothing less than a decision to transfer the problems experienced by the French and German economies to all the other countries."
"This includes those countries opposed to such measures, such as Poland, Great Britain and Ireland."
"Doctors, nurses and some journalists will be hit hardest by restrictions on weekly working time and the inclusion of on-call time in working time, and the end result will be that the competitiveness of the European economy as a whole will be reduced even further."
"In this instance, Parliament’s attempts at justification through references to the Lisbon Strategy are the height of hypocrisy."
".– The parliamentary group of the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against the 'organisation of working time' directive, because it is a vengeful attack by the EU, the urban governments and big business on the rights of the working class."
"The aim of the proposals by the Commission and the rapporteur is to undermine working time by introducing two new terms – active on-call time and inactive on-call time – and more flexible working time in order to increase the profits of big business."
"The time referred to as inactive on-call time does not count as working time, despite the fact that the employee is at the employer's disposal."
"Thus, Pandora's Box has been opened and employment law has been blown sky high."
"The definition of working time and the length of the working day are matters which have been the subject of class-based conflict between the working class and big business for many years."
"The consequences for the working class are painful: more unpaid work, whenever and however the needs of capitalist production dictate, thereby undermining collective labour agreements, the intensification of slavery, more accidents at work, worsening insurance and pension terms, drastic reductions in free time for social activity and the breakdown of family life."
"The Communist Party of Greece is helping to reconfigure and reinforce the class-based orientation of the working-class movement, in order to bring about radical changes and satisfy the contemporary needs of the working and grass-roots classes."
"The issue of regulating working time is complicated."
"The main thrust of my thinking in connection with this directive is that issues of this type should in the first place be dealt with at Member State level."
"When, therefore, the proposal concerning the opt-out – a rule, moreover, that is not applied in Sweden - was voted down and the proposal to calculate average working time over a period longer than four months was rejected, I thought it right to vote against the proposal as a whole."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"The sitting will resume at 3 p.m. with the statements on the future of Europe sixty years after the Second World War."
"The next item is the statements on the future of Europe sixty years after the Second World War."
"You will recall that I made a statement on the end of World War II in Europe last Monday, a day that coincided with Europe Day, in a month of May in which, furthermore, a year has passed since the accession of ten new countries."
"In view of this triple coincidence, the Conference of Presidents decided to hold a debate today on the future of Europe 60 years after World War II, which would be more than a mere commemoration, more than a look backwards: it would be a look at our future on the basis of the memory of our past."
"Mr Juncker and Mr Barroso are here to introduce it ..."
"who have recently been in Moscow attending the events held there to commemorate the end of the war and who are now joining us for this debate which, as I have said — and I would like to insist on this — will try to look forward to our future and not just remember the past."
"We are grateful for the efforts both of you have made to be here amongst us."
"Your presence here undoubtedly enhances our debate."
"I shall firstly give them the floor, as is customary."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, 60 years have passed since the end of the Second World War."
"Remembering 8 May 1945, the date that marked the surrender of the Third Reich, is a profound duty, and I should like to congratulate the European Parliament on not failing to remember 8 May 1945 here today."
"The duty of remembrance is a profound duty, and I believe that it is particularly profound for those who were born after the Second World War, the men and women of my generation."
"When we set about remembering 8 May 1945, the surrender of German democracy in 1933 and the dreadful period separating those two dates, as the younger generation, we must remember with a great deal of restraint, at least as regards the generation of men and women involved."
"People who, like me, were born after the Second World War – in 1954, 1955 and later – must remember with restraint because we were not witness first-hand to the tragedy that descended upon the European continent."
"We did not see, as those before us saw, the concentration camps and the prisons where people were killed, tortured and humiliated, to the point of complete debasement."
"Unlike them, we did not see the battlefields, because we did not have to cross them with our souls, and very often our bodies, carrying the weight of death."
"We could not, nor had to, observe, like those who could and had to do so, the long processions of prisoners who crossed Europe from every country, in fact forming a single European funeral cortege."
"Those of us who were born after the Second World War have not been confronted with tragic choices, whether individual or collective."
"We did not have to say either yes or no; we were able to bask in the glow of the post-war, having been spared such tragic choices."
"Remembering 8 May 1945 is an act that stimulates our collective memory."
"It is extremely significant when first-hand memories and first-hand experience of the war and its immediate aftermath – real-life knowledge with a host of personal experiences and noble feelings – are about to become part of history, with all that history entails in terms of distance and supposedly objective interpretations with regard to memories."
"Today, the first-hand witnesses of this dreadful period of European history are leaving this world behind."
"It is moving to witness Russian war veterans on their lorries in Red Square and the long procession of people who went to war for themselves and for us, and whom today can no longer walk. We, on the other hand, all know what they are walking towards."
"The duty of remembrance is a profound duty."
"For the men and women of my generation, the act of remembering not only means remembering with restraint but also with a great deal of gratitude."
"Above all, gratitude must be shown to our fathers’ and grandfathers’ generation who, upon returning from the battlefields and concentration camps, and once freed from the prisons, had every reason to give in and do nothing but bemoan their fate."
"Instead, they rebuilt Europe and made Europe the finest continent in existence."
"Let us show our gratitude for the extraordinary achievements of a generation of men and women who had no choice but to go to war, and who wanted to make peace!"
"In remembering and in feeling this profound duty of remembrance, we must also speak the truth."
"For Europe, 8 May 1945 was a day of liberation."
"8 May 1945 was also a day of defeat."
"By this, though, I mean the defeat of fascism and of National Socialism, as well as the end of democratic capitulation in the face of the terrible events that had taken place since 1933."
"Above all, however, it was also a day of liberation for Germany."
"I should like to tell the elected representatives of the German people present in this Chamber that the Germans are better neighbours to us now than they have ever been."
"In truth, in remembering 8 May, 9 May and 10 May we are also showing our gratitude to the people who combined their strength and energy with that of Europe to liberate the European continent."
"With 60 years having passed, rather than 60 years late, I should like to state the extent to which we, as Europeans, must show our gratitude to the young US and Canadian soldiers who came from the other side of the ocean to Europe in order to liberate it, and we do not even know the number of other countries they helped to liberate."
"We ought never to forget."
"I am also thinking of the soldiers of the Red Army."
"What losses!"
"What an excessive number of interrupted life stories amongst the Russians, who contributed 27 million lives to the liberation of Europe!"
"No one needs to harbour a great love – although I do – for the profound and eternal Russian State to acknowledge the fact that Russia deserves well of Europe."
"I should like to pay particular tribute to the people of Europe who were able to say no whilst others were all too often tempted to give a faint yes."
"I should like to pay tribute here today to the people of Great Britain who were able to say no, and without whose contribution nothing would have been possible."
"The restored freedom at the start of May 1945, however, was not enjoyed in equal measure throughout Europe."
"Comfortably installed in our old democracies, we were able to live in freedom in Western Europe after the Second World War, and in a state of restored freedom whose price we well know."
"Those who lived in Central and Eastern Europe, however, did not experience the same level of freedom that we have experienced for 50 years."
"They were subjected to the law of someone else."
"The Baltic States, whose arrival into Europe I should like to welcome and to whom I should like to point out how proud we are to have them amongst us, were forcibly integrated into a group that was not their own."
"They were subjected not to the but to the that was not their own."
"Those people and nations that underwent one misfortune after another suffered more than any other European."
"The other countries of Central and Eastern Europe did not experience that extraordinary capacity for self-determination that we were able to experience in our part of Europe."
"They were not liberated."
"They had to evolve under the regime of principle imposed on them."
"It is with great sadness in my heart that I mention the harsh words said today on the subject of enlargement."
"With the Second World War finally coming to an end, however, I say today, long live enlargement!"
"This post-war Europe which, without the War, would never have become the Europe that we know today; this Europe, risen from the ashes of the War, would never have come into existence if it had not been for the so-called founding fathers of Europe – people such as Schuman, Bech, Adenauer, de Gasperi and others – who, from the post-war phrase ‘war, never again’ gave birth to hope, prayer and a programme for the first time in the history of the continent."
"Today, we must remember with emotion and gratitude those people who had the courage to say yes after having first said no."
"They could not have done so if they had not felt overjoyed by the noble and profound feelings of their people."
"We say nothing against the will of the people."
"We have been able to build Europe as we have done after the Second World War because the people of Europe wished never again to relive the tragedy experienced by the European continent twice over during the 20th century."
"There are the founding fathers of Europe who are well-known; there are the peoples who evolved in the shadows and who shared these noble feelings, and then there are the philosophers, the thinkers and the politicians whom we all too often forget: Leon Blum, who dreamt of Europe from inside a French prison, the great Spinelli who was incarcerated on an Italian island by the Italian Fascists, and others who are nameless but to whom we owe a great deal."
"I should like to pay tribute to those people, whether forgotten or anonymous, who made it possible to create what was created after the Second World War."
"There was the free part of Europe and the part of Europe that was paralysed by the disastrous historical decree, the Yalta Agreement, which sought to divide Europe into two forever. It sought to divide it into two parts which very often stood glaring at each other and between which we have all too often been unable to build bridges."
"The Cold War – the term lovingly used to describe the other tragic period of European history – paralysed Europe’s greatest powers and prevented its foremost talents from expressing anything of benefit that they might have expressed if given the opportunity."
"Personally speaking, I was born in December 1954, but I prefer to say that I was born in 1955."
"First and foremost – if I may digress – I grew up respecting the achievements of my father’s generation, which experienced an awful two-fold fate. Firstly, because the people of Luxembourg born between 1920 and 1927 were forcibly enlisted into the German Wehrmacht, and secondly, because they wore a uniform that was not their own, and which served ambitions other than theirs."
"It is an awful fate to have to wear the uniform of your enemy."
"The same comments apply, moreover, to the people of Alsace and Lorraine, to whom I pay homage."
"I grew up in the Cold War environment in which the world, it seems, was easier to understand."
"There were those who were with us and those who were against us."
"We did not know why we liked those who were with us, but we knew that we had to bear hatred towards the others."
"We knew that the threat was coming from the other side, and those on the other side believed that the threat was coming from our side."
"How many lost opportunities!"
"How much time was lost in Europe as a result of those foolish analyses during the immediate post-war era."
"Let us rejoice, today, at no longer having to refer to the uncompromising logic of the Cold War and at being able to make peace between the two halves of Europe."
"I often think about the wise men of Europe, such as Churchill – doubtless because I myself am not one of them."
"In 1947, when the first congress of the European Movement met at the Hague, giving birth to the idea of creating the Council of Europe in the face of the refusal by the Soviet Union to allow the other countries of Central and Eastern Europe to take part either in the Marshall Plan or in the creation of the Council of Europe, the great Churchill declared with his own prophetic offering: ‘We are beginning in the West a job which we will complete in the East.’"
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us take pride in having achieved that."
"I recall the words of Victor Hugo who, in 1949, wrote: ‘A day will come in Europe when the only field of battle will be minds opening up to ideas; a day will come in Europe when the bullets and the bombs will be replaced by votes.’"
"Let us take pride in having achieved that today."
"Let us take pride in being able to say this to the European Parliament, the elected representative of the people of Europe, whose Members are the heirs of those who were able to say no when no needed to be said, and of those who were able to say yes when yes was the only remaining option."
"Let us show our gratitude towards those who said no when no needed to be said and let us take pride in all those who, today, are saying yes to a great Europe, and to a Europe that has seen its history and its geography reconciled."
"Let us take pride in those who do not wish for Europe to become a free trade area, and let us take pride in those who, like us and like millions of others, believe that Europe is a complex continent that deserves more than a free trade area."
"Let us take pride in the Europe built by those who were there before us, and let us conduct ourselves in a manner becoming of their heirs."
". Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, honourable Members, dear friends, it is a great honour for me to represent the Commission in this ceremony in this Parliament that represents Europeans."
"Today we are looking back at the past and looking forward to the future."
"We are here to remember, to acknowledge and to build."
"Let us first look at the past."
"The greatest worldwide conflict was the source of mixed feelings among all those who survived it; a source of relief for many, a source of emptiness, for sure, and often a source of fear of the future, fear that the post-war world might not be better – and might in fact be worse – than what went before."
"We therefore remember."
"We remember the scale of destruction that particularly ravaged Europe."
"Hardly any country emerged unscathed."
"What some have referred to as the ‘European civil war’ was witness to the inhumanity that man is capable of visiting on man."
"We Europeans often feel proud of the great achievements of our civilisation and our culture, of the great triumphs of the European spirit, yet we must humbly acknowledge that some of the worst horrors that the human race has ever perpetrated took place in Europe during the 20th century."
"However, we should also remember the great stories of triumph over adversity, the personal journeys which so many Europeans made to find a better life, some crossing mountains and seas to reach their goal of a happy, peaceful existence."
"Some found it simply by returning home."
"We remember those who did not have that chance, those for whom the light of freedom went out almost as soon as they saw it; those for whom one nightmare was replaced by another."
"Let us recognise that something remarkable came out of the ruins of Europe in 1945."
"Let me give you a quote from one of the visionaries of that time, speaking in Zurich in 1946."
"He said: ‘I am now going to say something that will astonish you."
"The first step in the recreation of the European family must be a partnership between France and Germany."
"In this way only can France recover the moral and cultural leadership of Europe."
"There can be no revival of Europe without [...] a spiritually great Germany’."
"Churchill was right."
"It is easy to forget now the courage it took to say those words at that time."
"What he said was astonishing."
"Even more astonishing were the deeds that turned those words into reality."
"We should remember the extraordinary determination shown by Robert Schuman, Jean Monnet, Konrad Adenauer, Alcide de Gasperi and others and what they achieved, reconstructing rather than retreating into retribution."
"We should also remember and recognise the vision of transatlantic leaders who helped shoulder the burden of reconstruction rather than turning their backs on it."
"Before we get too carried away, let us pause, because what the founding fathers started was remarkable but incomplete."
"As the Commission said in its declaration of 9 May: for millions, true freedom was only to come with the fall of the Berlin Wall, not the end of the Second World War."
"After 1945 they lost their liberties and opportunities almost as soon as they had regained them."
"In some cases they lost political control of their countries; in others, they lost their independence."
"For many people in Europe the end of the war meant peace and freedom; but for some it meant only peace, not yet freedom."
"We should not forget what Europe was."
"Sixty years ago here on this continent we experienced the Holocaust."
"About 30 years ago several countries in southern Europe, including my own, were still living under dictatorships."
"Until about 15 years ago half of Europe did not enjoy freedom and democracy."
"That is why I have difficulty in understanding how we can fail to be optimistic about the future of Europe when we see where Europe is now compared to where it was only a few years ago."
"However, that, luckily, was not the end of the story."
"What European leaders of the 1940s and 1950s constructed was a light and a magnet: a light through dark years for those who had no prospect of the peace, prosperity and stability that other Europeans enjoyed, and an extraordinary, powerful force of attraction for those peoples and countries that were breaking free and saw the European Community – as it was called then – as a catalyst for the transformation of their countries."
"For my generation, Europe was always synonymous with democracy."
"As an 18-year-old, I, with others, was determined to set my own country free from a deadening, authoritarian, backward regime."
"That is why I and many people of my generation especially admire the extraordinary efforts of the peoples of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Romania and Bulgaria to fight for democracy, and how they relate the very idea of Europe to that of democracy."
"It should be, and is, with enormous pride that the European Union and its institutions embrace those new Members and peoples, as well as those of Malta and Cyprus."
"So this transformation is worthy of recognition and commemoration."
"Why?"
"Because it appears at times to be almost forgotten."
"Today it is too easy to take for granted the firm foundations of the new Europe in which we live, a Europe of freedom and shared values."
"That is why we must state: the European Union cannot be the victim of its own success."
"Integrating such a variety of Members, which are united by a common project, is a truly extraordinary achievement."
"The challenge that we are all facing is an extraordinary one."
"I am convinced that implementing this tremendous project, which will soon incorporate 27 countries and 500 million people, will take place in spite of the stormy periods that will inevitably occur from time to time."
"This implementation sometimes takes place so peacefully, however, that we run the risk of forgetting what preceded it."
"From now on, the accounts of murderous conflicts ravaging Europe appear to be confined to the history books."
"They were making the headlines as recently as 10 years ago, however, when massacres were taking place in certain Balkan countries."
"We can say ‘never again!’ on our continent."
"It is easy to say, but the history of Europe proves that we have to work towards peace and not take it for granted."
"This is without doubt hardly a cheerful outlook, as today in Europe, problems and fears exist."
"In Berlin, in the large building that once housed what the Democratic Republic of Germany called its Parliament, is inscribed the word , which means doubts."
"Doubts and fears exist, particularly amongst young people."
"Their fears are serious: the fear of finding or not finding a job, and the fear of a more competitive world that is sometimes perceived as a challenge."
"The fear, however, is that of finding or not finding a job, and not the fear of finding or not finding one’s own country."
"At present, it is sensible to find an effective means of solving the difficulties linked to the integration of markets, whether the difficulties are real or only perceived as such."
"It is not a question of armed conflicts between competitors who become adversaries or enemies."
"That is why in confronting these fears, we have to follow the example of the generations before us; we have to show the same imagination and the same courage."
"Let us recall that the ambitious partnership that we concluded in Europe has been the source of peaceful revolutions, which have brought freedom and democracy to millions of Europeans!"
"The European example – the Europe of the Six, of the Ten, of the Twelve, of the Fifteen and now of the Twenty-five – has been the true driving force behind democratisation in Southern Europe, in Latin America and later in Central and Eastern Europe."
"Let us remember that liberty is the driving force which stimulates growth, employment and investment, and which offers a greater number of Europeans the chance of a better life."
"The spirit of democracy and modernity in our societies is testament to our capacity to reinvent our continent."
"From its internal market to its external borders, from the promotion of internal cohesion to the protection of sustainable development and the environment, from the solidarity dimension to that of justice in all four corners of the globe – as we are not seeking a Europe that is closed in on itself – the European Union is constantly building Europe."
"It does so in concrete stages that improve the everyday lives of our people."
"Ratifying the Constitution will strengthen these undertakings and will lay the foundations for ever more significant advances in the future."
"Let us therefore remember today that appalling war and its consequences."
"In our work focused on the future, let us take our inspiration from the visionary ambition and the determination of the leaders and the citizens who preceded us, from reconciliation to cooperation and from cooperation to the European Union!"
". Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the European Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, in 1945 – 60 years ago – Europe was a ruined battlefield."
"A barbaric war had claimed the lives of over 55 million people, millions more – untold millions – were uprooted, millions were made refugees or driven away from their homes; parents lost sons, wives lost husbands, children lost fathers."
"By the end of March 1945, my own father, a private in the Army, was missing."
"It was only a very long time later that we learned that he was among the dead."
"I never saw him."
"In 1945, many of Europe’s cities were laid waste; its economy was in ruins."
"In the world at large, the mention of the name of Europe brought fear and dread."
"Where responsibility for the outbreak of the Second World War lay is not a matter of doubt: the illicit National Socialist regime in Germany whipped up its racial delusions and claims to power into an inferno of aggression against all the other peoples of Europe."
"The attempted extermination of the Jews was to be the worst of its crimes."
"National Socialist totalitarianism led the whole of Europe into ruination."
"When the end came in 1945, the German people themselves were among its victims, at a time when victors were thin on the ground."
"Instead of victors, there were survivors, some fortunate, some unfortunate; the former in the West, the latter in Central and Eastern Europe."
"Far-sighted American support made it possible for new life to resume in the west of the continent, enjoying freedom, respect for human dignity, democracy and a market economy founded upon the law."
"It was Winston Churchill, as we have just been reminded, who sketched out the vision of a United States of Europe – and let me add that Europe could never be complete without Great Britain."
"After 1945, starting with its Atlantic coast, Europe was resurrected; its peoples, exhausted but rejoicing that they could start again in freedom, drew together."
"Robert Schuman will always be remembered and honoured for reaching out to the Germans and inviting them to join in this new beginning."
"Without French magnanimity, Europe would again have remained no more than an insubstantial idea – and let me add that, now that the European Union is making another new beginning with a single constitution, Europe in future, too, will need France, more than ever, to be constructively involved."
"In 1945 the peoples of Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe, too, were filled with the hope of a new beginning, of having, as those who belonged to the same European culture in which we all share, a new chance of life in freedom and peace."
"They had to learn from bitter experience that peace without freedom amounts to only partial liberation from the yoke of totalitarian injustice."
"Their hopes were crushed by the Soviet seizure of power."
"Although National Socialist totalitarianism was vanquished in 1945, Stalinist totalitarianism divided Europe and imposed its unjust rule on the peoples of Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe."
"Hope, though, did not desert the less happy survivors of the Second World War – the hope of a shared Europe, intellectually, morally and politically renewed, with the prospect of prosperity for all its citizens."
"To this hope they eventually gave shape in a peaceful revolution, the watchword for which was ."
"It would take decades for the wall to be broken down."
"Having been a member of this House ever since the first direct elections to it in 1979, I see our debate today – a debate that we are holding together in a dignified fashion, and with the gravity it deserves – as a time to rejoice that Europe is now united, a time of rejoicing, too, in the presence among us of Members from eight Central European countries, who enjoy the same rights as we do."
"It was in 1989 that the double burden of totalitarianism was lifted from Europe."
"What 1989 taught us was what power Europe’s values have for all of us and how much, if we want to retain our freedom, we rely upon the example of courageous men and women."
"After 1989, Europe could again begin to breathe with both lungs, to quote the words used by that great Pope of immortal memory, John Paul II."
"The peoples of Western Europe had done valuable, indispensable, work in preparation for that day, and what they did will last."
"The establishment of the European Union with common values centred upon human dignity, the supranational union in a free community with its own binding laws were the consequent response to the opportunity presented by the end of the war."
"European unification is a project of peace and freedom."
"All Europeans now have the chance, and the duty, to go down the road presented by a reunited Europe."
"We are now, together, engaged in building a Europe that defends its values for the sake of all its citizens."
"Europe can now give one single response to warfare and totalitarianism, by pressing on along the road of the one European Union of peoples and states, with perseverance, inner conviction and an acceptance of the diversity that is Europe’s strength and splendour."
"The current debate on the European Constitution is a great opportunity for us to remind ourselves of these fundamental things, because, for the first time in European history, our values and ideals are set down in a constitution."
"Europa is not merely a political construction, but an intellectual living space."
"It is for that reason that the response to the terrible war, whose end we today commemorate with gratitude, had to be a moral one, a ‘never again’ to the unfreedom that leads to war, a ‘never again’ to the war that robs men of their freedom."
"That sums up the motivation behind building a new Europe, a Europe that repudiates totalitarianism, nationalist arrogance, and egalitarian inhumanity, a Europe that refuses to allow any one of its state to dominate the others, a Europe that affirms the unmistakeable dignity of every individual human being, the balancing of the interests of social groups and peoples, a Europe of respect and diversity, from which diversity, indeed, it derives its strength, a Europe of democracy and law."
"A great deal of progress has been made in terms of internal reconciliation – reconciling the peoples and states of Europe with one another."
"We want – as we must – to complete this work of internal reconciliation, as we also wish to be reconciled with the people of Russia and the peoples in the Russian Federation."
"In the period of our history that is now beginning, Europe, though, will have to seek reconciliation in the world and with the world around us to a greater extent than ever before."
"Europe’s wars became world wars."
"Europe’s unification must benefit the world."
"We can be grateful to the Members of this House – and I wish to thank my colleague Elmar Brok in particular – who have drafted a resolution that will, tomorrow, express our values."
"In this hour, we remember all the victims of the Second World War, and all the suffering and destruction."
"We recall how much peace and freedom belong together and the need for our work to serve mankind, not least in promoting dialogue between cultures."
"Where this dialogue with the world bears fruit, we will defend the values that sustain us on our way into the future."
"It is thus that this day of remembrance can give us a new mission, bidding us work together to build a better world – a world more at peace, and a freer world."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when thinking of 8 May 1945, and remembering what happened on it, we think of the period that preceded it, and also of the period thereafter."
"It is impossible for any German Member of this House to think of that date without at the same time recalling his or her own nationality."
"The group on whose behalf I speak includes MEPs from Germany, representing the country that wanted this war, that prepared for this war, that waged it and was merciless in organising it."
"I also speak, though, on behalf of Members from Poland, the country that was the first to be overrun by the German army, as well as of Members from the countries – the United Kingdom and France – that were foremost among the Allies, without whose combined might Hitler could not have been brought down."
"Next to me sits Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, for many years Prime Minister of Denmark, a country that Hitler’s Germany overran and occupied overnight – one of the occupying soldiers being my own father."
"I also speak on behalf of Members from countries that suffered under dictatorship long after the Second World War was over."
"My group includes a lawyer who defended victims of the Franco regime, and another Member who was a victim himself, having been tortured in the dungeons of the secret police."
"Some of my group colleagues are from Portugal and Greece, men and women who – like you, Mr President of the Commission – in their younger days rejoiced to see the dictators driven from their countries."
"My group includes my friend Józef Pinior, who will be the next to speak for the group, and who spent time being tortured in Communist jails for being a trade unionist and a social democrat."
"For me to be able to speak on behalf of all these people is a privilege, a privilege I owe to the European Union."
"It is something for which we can all be grateful to the men and women who had to take on responsibility, after 8 May 1945, for the work of unification that they achieved."
"As the President-in-Office of the Council said, on that day, 8 May 1945, lessons had to be learned, and the right ones were."
"The history of the European Union, the post-8 May 1945 history of Europe, is a success story."
"It is the history of the firm determination that grew out of the ruins, the history of a ‘never again!’"
"This ‘never again!’ was not said to the empty air."
"It took on shape and form, forms in which we work today, from which we benefit today, forms that enable me to represent Members of the Jewish faith, that make it possible for my group to include Muslim MEPs, for there to be in my group Members who have suffered, and those who have learned from those who suffered."
"They make it possible for us to find common ground by affirming one thing: the lesson of 8 May must be that, if this ‘never again!’ is to be permanent, it must be fought for anew every day."
"For our democracy, for our Europe, our fight goes on day by day."
"Let us, today, remember the causes, the period that went before, marked as it was by one insight."
"It is unique in the history of the human race for a state to define itself and its purpose in terms of the extermination of other peoples and races."
"Neither before nor since has there been a state that justified its own existence by saying that it existed as a state in order that the Jews, the Slavs, the Roma, the Sinti and the handicapped might be wiped out."
"Such a thing is unique in the history of the human race."
"That is the extraordinary thing about the Third Reich; the Nazis wanted not a trace to remain behind of the Jews of Europe."
"A few weeks ago, I was at Yad Vashem, the memorial site in Jerusalem."
"I descended into the corridors and hallways below ground in which the fates of the millions of victims are depicted."
"The Director of Yad Vashem, who guided me around, said to me: ‘Every day, I descend into this hell and see them – the pictures, them alone."
"It is a hell.’"
"Then I went up the steps and through a corridor into the new museum, which has a wide glass frontage, and there, in the sunlight, is the city of Jerusalem."
"‘Every day,’ said the director of Yad Vashem, ‘when I come out of that hell and see that sight, I know that they did not succeed."
"We are alive."
"We made it; the Nazis did not.’"
"Every memory, every day of remembrance, every name that we read out, is a victory over the criminals who wanted nothing to remain."
"If we remember them, the Jewish people remain, as do the Roma and the Sinti, as do those who were murdered for political reasons, as do also the people with disabilities."
"They remain in our recollection, and hence they live."
"So many victims, so many names!"
"Anne Frank was a little Jewish girl, whose only crime was to be a little Jewish girl in Amsterdam."
"On such a day, let us remember Anne Frank."
"Sophie Scholl was a young German student, whose only crime was to be an upright person, and who was beheaded at the age of 18 for distributing leaflets denouncing the Nazi regime."
"I also think of Krzysztof Baczynski, a young Polish poet, shot dead in Warsaw by a German marksman."
"Three names out of 55 million victims!"
"Three names, yet enumerated to represent all the other victims."
"Let me repeat: three names which we call to mind, and which stand as representing all those whom we should remember."
"Over past weeks, we have often asked about the point of this European Union of ours, and we have been asked what it is for."
"What this Union is for is described in our speeches today."
"The continuance to this very day of this work of unification, which is still overcoming division, still holding racism in contempt, still excluding from the community of democrats all anti-Semites, racists and Nazis, still holding these criminals up to scorn, still enumerating their deeds, and still remembering them – that is the basis, the moral and intellectual foundation of our European Union, the Union built up by our fathers and our fathers’ fathers."
"In the meantime, Europe has a heritage; the EU is no longer a novelty."
"It is now 60 years old, having, in principle, been born on 8 May 1945."
"Right now, we have a heritage to manage if we are to pass it on."
"If we care for this heritage, knowing ourselves duty bound to remember that the Third Reich represented the moral nadir of the human race, from which we have drawn the right conclusions by creating this Union, then we European politicians will enable the young men and women who sit in this Chamber’s galleries to have a brighter future to look forward to than did their fathers and grandfathers in the past."
". Mr President, the British poet John Donne observed: ‘No man is an island, entire of itself, but a piece of the continent, a part of the main."
"If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less’."
"That was in 1624, yet for over 300 years peoples and states continued to wage war across our continent."
"Tribalism and hatred are Europe’s ugly legacy."
"If we had not learned it earlier, the ‘war to end all wars’ should have shown us the futility and the trauma of organised warfare."
"Our awakening from that nightmare led to the League of Nations, yet we continued to distil the fruits of scientific advance into the firewater of the weapons of mass destruction."
"By the time World War II ended in Europe, on 8 May 1945, more than 40 million people had lost their lives."
"A cynic might say that 20th century Europeans were slow learners."
"It took two bloody wars and a continent in ruins to teach us that a united Europe is worth more than the sum of its parts."
"Not all of us were able even then to realise our aspirations for peace and freedom."
"While for most Europeans May 1945 marked the liberation of their countries from Nazi tyranny and the beginning of a new path to freedom and reconstruction, for those who found themselves on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain, one tyranny was quickly replaced by another."
"A further two generations were denied the liberty we now enjoy."
"As a student at the Karl Marx University in Leipzig in 1976, I saw this at first hand."
"Our historical perspectives are inevitably different."
"But this must be a debate about the future, not the past."
"Let us rejoice that Europe is united in peace and that we can sit together in the same debating chamber with a set of common supranational institutions of government deciding on matters of mutual concern."
"It was the imperative of dependence that brought the European Union into being and saw the Soviet bloc finally crumble."
"We started with coal and steel, the building blocks of post-war Europe; we built the common market, the basis of prosperity undreamt of by my parents; we made the single currency a reality for 300 million Europeans at the dawn of this new century."
"As we mark the 60th anniversary of a lasting peace, we see that Europe has come a long way, through gradual steps to build solidarity between our peoples."
"There is no doubt that the European Union has been a success: have become part of our common legislative and social fabric."
"But there is no guarantee it will always be that way, and we stand now at a watershed, represented by the constitutional treaty."
"Can we move forward and consolidate this unprecedented era of peace, stability and prosperity, or will it melt before our eyes and be replaced by a new national rivalry and brinkmanship?"
"A columnist reminded us last week how thin is the veneer of civilisation, how weak the voice of human conscience when tempted away from the rule of law and respect for our fellow human beings."
"This is the challenge before our Member States as they are called upon to ratify the Constitution."
"A peaceful and prosperous Europe was always based on the premise that strength lay in convergence and shared mandates."
"Cooperation has grown from trade to encompass social policy, employment, immigration, justice, policing and foreign policy."
"The revolutions in central and eastern Europe have lifted from our shoulders the yoke of Yalta, but we are confronted with new challenges."
"The challenge, for example, of feeding, clothing and housing a growing world population, while more and more are pushed into migration by war or hunger or sheer desperation."
"The challenge of dealing with a hole in the ozone layer, melting ice caps, rising sea levels and climate change. Or the threat of internationally organised crime, where some criminal gangs are now more powerful than some national governments, bringing misery to many though the trade in drugs and small arms and the trafficking of people, and working hand-in-hand with terrorists."
"None of these challenges can be faced by our countries acting alone."
"To provide the security, prosperity and opportunity which our fellow citizens expect government to deliver, we have to work together."
"And work together, too, with the United States and Canada, to whose people we owe so much and whose values by and large we share, not only to confront with them common challenges but to make them feel more comfortable with a new and more powerful Europe."
"Europe has the potential to be a beacon of hope, a model of tolerance, diversity and stability, in a world where these attributes are still rare."
"We can insist on a bill of rights, or we can see our rights eroded."
"We can ratify the European Constitution and put our faith in democracy and accountable government, or we can continue to leave too much power in unelected hands."
"We can hold out the hand of friendship to the dispossessed, or cocoon ourselves in an illusory haven of prosperity."
"We can welcome Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey and the western Balkans and accept that Europe should be plural and diverse, or continue to treat each other with hostility and suspicion."
"Convergence is not just an ideal, it is an economic and political necessity."
"It is time to move beyond national self-interest towards greater convergence."
"Cooperation is the way forward, enabling us to face global challenges together."
"Europe has a leading role to play in the era of global governance."
"It is a stabilising force and a benchmark for other countries and peoples."
"Trade and cooperation can bring to others the fruits it has brought to us, and for that reason my Group welcomes greater contact with Russia and the People’s Republic of China."
"But history should teach us not to be an instrument in supporting authoritarian regimes."
"Liberals and Democrats view with concern the direction of some of the Council’s policies: to undercut the Americans in some downward Dutch auction of human rights standards would be an affront to the dignity for which Europe’s people have fought so hard."
"Just as no man is an island, no country is an island either."
"We are joined together in our custody of a fragile world and our stewardship of its inhabitants."
"Let Europe exemplify the dignity of difference and grasp the challenge."
". Mr President, I was born one month before 1945."
"My parents left Germany 72 years ago."
"In 1933, my father was a lawyer; he defended the Red Assistance and he should have been arrested."
"I was born exactly nine months after the allied landings in Normandy."
"I am a child of the liberation, of a military invasion that liberated European soil and allowed my parents to have a child, a ‘child of liberty’."
"That is why our remembrance – my remembrance – is paved with horrors."
"The horror of Auschwitz, the that demonstrated the worst that mankind is capable of."
"Kolima, the that demonstrated what the most barbaric political ideology is capable of doing."
"Oradour-sur-Glane, which demonstrated what a military occupation can give rise to."
"Katyn, which demonstrated that liberation and destruction can take place at the same time."
"The entire Polish elite was massacred by the Red Army in order to prevent the Polish people from joining together and creating their own independent State."
"We then continued to commit massacres which were beyond compare, but which were nonetheless comparably lethal and cruel."
"There were the massacres of the colonial wars, and Srebrenica, which took place 10 years ago now, to the very day."
"It is as a result of these massacres that men and women, who do not belong to my political party, but whose importance I acknowledge for having succeeded – because they did succeed – in building this Europe, be they De Gaulle or Adenauer, Willy Brandt or Helmut Kohl, François Mitterrand – little does it matter – did something extraordinary."
"For our part, those of us born after 1945 are the children of Europe, but we are also the children of anti-totalitarianism."
"This Europe was created to prevent totalitarianism from ever resurging, whether from the left or the right."
"To quote a song familiar to some: there is no supreme saviour, neither god nor king nor leader nor Communism nor Neo-liberalism."
"There is no liberating ideology of mankind."
"There is only one small and very fragile thing that many people mock and which is simply called ‘democracy’."
"My dear friends, ladies and gentlemen, it is always either easy or difficult for a German to talk about ‘the war, 60 years on’."
"Germany, though, experienced both National Socialism, with all its barbarity, and Communist totalitarianism."
"Germany, then, is also a symbol of Europe, and if there is any obligation incumbent on our generation, then it is the obligation to speak the truth."
"My concern is not to set out to the House what Europe’s political tasks are, for we can do that day in and day out."
"My concern is solely with how seriously we take this anti-totalitarian obligation."
"If we really do act upon it, we may not, we cannot, disregard human rights and respect for human dignity for the sake of of any kind."
"We have to talk to the Russians, but we also have to talk about Chechnya."
"We have to talk about crimes."
"We have to talk to the Chinese, but we have to talk about the way in which the Chinese people are oppressed."
"We cannot simply say ‘so let’s just lift the embargo’, and pass on to the next item on the agenda."
"So the Chinese get a few weapons."
"So they are sold a few Transrapids."
"With a history like Europe’s behind us, we simply cannot do that!"
"It is because we are obligated to truth, because we believe in Europe, that we all, when shaping and organising the Europe of the future, have to remember what Europe once was and what it must not be allowed to be again."
"It is in times such as these that I – as one of those who think of Europe’s history in those terms – am proud to campaign for a constitution that embodies the heritage of the anti-totalitarian Europe."
"I am convinced that we will win; this constitution will become real in Europe."
"That is what I believe; it is an obligation upon us for the sake of our children, who will inherit what our parents gave us for safe keeping."
". Mr President, the fine speech delivered by Mr Junker together with the particular emphasis of subsequent speeches are in stark contrast to the extremely disappointing and worrying content of the draft resolution submitted to us on behalf of the majority of groups on the 60th anniversary of the Nazi surrender."
"I am convinced that in the majority of political groups represented within our Assembly, men and women will feel a sense of unease when faced with this text, which is more or less a revision of history."
"When an institution such as ours evokes that founding event of Europe and the world today that was the victory of all the allies – US, British and Soviet of the anti-Hitler coalition, every word counts."
"Let us wager that in a declaration of this type, many men and women expected to read lines such as the following: ‘8 May 1945 was a day of liberation for Europe’."
"Why not, since it is the truth; it was a day when the Soviet army contributed in a decisive manner."
"Without choosing to overlook Stalinist oppression in any way, a number of Europeans, when confronted with various demonstrations of nostalgia for the Third Reich, would without doubt have also hoped to hear us say that excusing the Nazi atrocities by pointing the finger at Stalinist crimes is unacceptable from an intellectual and moral viewpoint, and indeed that – in view of the war of remembrance that is currently bringing the Baltic republics and Russia into conflict – we should keep in mind Nazi Germany’s share of the responsibility in the tragedy of the Baltic States."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I will clarify a point: all the arguments that I have just put forward were in fact taken from an article published the day before yesterday in the French daily , under the name of Michael Mertes, a former adviser to the ex-Chancellor, Helmut Kohl."
"That is your political family, members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats!"
"Thank God!"
"We lost that war, it concludes, adding a line which I suggest you contemplate: the way we envisage the past teaches us more about our current attitudes than about the past itself."
"At a time when the European Union is consulting its citizens on a draft Constitution, how will these citizens interpret the concept of an enlarged Europe that starts by questioning the cornerstone of the vision of Europe and the world, born on 8 May 1945, namely that Nazism was neither a dictatorship nor a tyranny like any other, but rather the complete break with society as a whole?"
"As far as we are concerned, we are ready for a debate that leaves no stone unturned, whether it focuses on the crimes of Stalinism, on the German-Soviet Pact of bleak memory, or further still on the history of the Baltic States."
"Nothing, absolutely nothing, however, should allow us to trivialise Nazism, the intended aim of which – should we need reminding – was to exterminate sub-humans and to enlarge the essential space of the superior race through mass warfare."
"That is the reason why we had a right to expect a text on 8 May 1945 from the European Parliament with a completely different focus."
"Might it not even have been too much, furthermore, to pay tribute to the anonymous soldiers on this occasion, who, with no other ambition but to live and act as upstanding men and women, became involved in the resistance at risk of their lives, which so many of them sacrificed for our freedom."
"One word – just one word – on the horror of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and their tens of thousands of dead in a defeated country would likewise not have been too much."
"The European Parliament has truly failed to reconcile itself with history on this occasion."
"In addition, my group unanimously refuses to back this resolution, which is far removed from our concept of the Europe of 25, 27 or 30."
"I shall leave the final word to a European leader who, 20 years ago, found the appropriate words to speak about 8 May 1945, and in a country where it was most difficult to speak them openly."
"I am talking about the former German President, Richard von Weizsaecker."
"If I may quote him."
"‘We have the strength to look the truth in the face as best we can, without embellishment and without distortion."
"With every day, something became clearer, and this must be stated today on behalf of us all: 8 May was a day of liberation."
"It liberated us all from the inhumanity and tyranny of the Nazis.’"
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Second World War began in September 1939 when my country, Poland, was invaded and occupied by Germany and the Soviet Union."
"This partition of Poland came about as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which had been signed a week earlier in Moscow."
"Poland was not conquered by the fighting squads of the Nazi or Communist parties, but by the regular armed forces of its neighbours, or in other words by the German , and and by the Red Army."
"It should be added that the National Socialist Party, with Chancellor Hitler at its head, ruled over Germany at the time, having come to power on the basis of a democratic decision by the German electorate."
"Stalin and the Communist Party governed Russia, having been swept to power by the revolution."
"We are currently celebrating the 60th anniversary of Germany’s capitulation, which took place on 8 May 1945 and has come to symbolise the end of the wrongful acts committed by Nazi Germany in the occupied countries."
"Yet it did not mean the end of the wrongdoing that began with the Soviet Union’s invasion of Poland in 1939."
"We won the war against Germany, but we lost the war against Russia."
"This meant that a foreign power, a foreign economic system and a foreign ideology were forced upon us."
"We fought on all fronts in the Second World War, and we were there when the first and last shots were fired."
"As of 1941, our allies in the war against Germany included the Soviet Union."
"We acknowledge the role played by Russia in defeating Nazi Germany and the huge loss of life the country suffered in the process."
"Yet this does not alter the fact that Russia acted as though it had conquered Poland."
"What is more, our Western allies in the fight against Germany were also allies of the Soviet Union, and gave their consent to our enslavement in Yalta."
"We were forced to liberate ourselves little by little, firstly by decollectivising agriculture, then by setting free the Church, then by gaining acceptance for small and private businesses and finally by achieving the freedom to form trade unions, as well as freedom of speech and political freedom."
"The only help we received from the rest of the world in this process came by way of the arms race, which was won over time by the USA, and, in particular, through the success of Reagan’s ‘Star Wars’ programme, which weakened the Soviet Union."
"The presence of American troops in Europe and the existence of NATO meant that Western Europe has been able to enjoy peace for the past 60 years."
"Now the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, which are either members of NATO or have formed partnerships for peace, are also reaping the benefits."
"Each and every one of us shares a desire for peace and freedom, and for a future shaped according to our wishes."
"The members of my generation, who experienced the Second World War at first hand, will not be with us for much longer, and we must ensure that future generations remember the truth about this war."
"We Poles find it a source of great distress that so many Western media outlets continue to use phrases that we find insulting, such as ‘Polish concentration camps’, or even ‘Polish gas chambers and crematoria’, which was how the British had the temerity to refer to them in print."
"It is the case that some of these factories of death were located on Polish territory, but the fact remains that they were German, not Polish."
"Not all Germans bear the responsibility for such things, and we acknowledge that the German nation has distanced itself from its shameful Nazi legacy, but we are keen to ensure that future generations do not associate Poland with the crimes committed by the Nazis, as Poland was not responsible for them."
"Similarly, the Russian people are not responsible for the crimes committed during the Stalin era, or in other words for the deportations, the gulags, the genocide that was committed in Katyn and the subjugation of Central and Eastern Europe."
"It was the Communist leaders of the Soviet state that were responsible for these crimes, and the Russians themselves also suffered enslavement."
"We wish to be reconciled with the Russian people and state, but we expect them to distance themselves unequivocally from their Communist legacy."
"The current leaders of Germany and Russia, or in other words the countries that started the Second World War, however, have given a joint interview to the German newspaper in which they attempt to divert attention away from anything other than their mutual relations and the losses they suffered."
"We are currently seeking to establish neighbourly relations with both Germany and Russia."
"As long ago as 1961, the Polish bishops sent a famous letter to the German bishops, which included the phrase; ‘we forgive and ask forgiveness’."
"We take the same approach to our current relations with Russia, yet forgiveness and reconciliation do not mean that we should forget."
"We would therefore call for there never again to be a repeat of such things as genocide, the subjugation of one nation by another, aggression and war."
". Mr President, individual nations had very different experiences of the Second World War, and so the debate we are holding today is perhaps the most important debate on European identity that has been held for years."
"If we genuinely wish to join together to form a single European spiritual community, we must all endeavour to gain a full understanding of the historical experiences of Europe’s nations."
"In order to do so, there are certain issues about which we must speak quite frankly."
"The resolution to mark the 60th anniversary of the end of the war has come about as a result of a hard-won compromise, and on the whole it is an accurate portrayal of the consequences of the war."
"What is missing, however, is any reference to the link that exists between the start and the end of the war, or to the views on the war that are currently being touted in Russia."
"Munich and the partition of Czechoslovakia were Hitler’s first acts of aggression, but there is no denying that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was the real call to war."
"Poland fell victim to the cooperation between the Third Reich and the USSR in September 1939, and this was followed by Germany’s invasions of Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, Luxembourg, France, Yugoslavia and Greece, as well as by the Soviet invasions of Finland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia."
"Stalin did not join the Allies in their fight against Germany of his own free will."
"In fact, quite the opposite is true, as he refused to cooperate with France and Great Britain."
"It was only after Hitler’s attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941 that he secured the assistance of the British and the Americans by entering into a new coalition, which was ultimately to defeat the Third Reich."
"Yet even though it was the Red Army which bore the main brunt of the war, no changes were made to the Soviet system."
"The Gulag Archipelago continued to expand, and the number of lives it claimed can be compared to the number of Soviet citizens that fell in the war."
"The cooperation between the Big Three was therefore based on a mere semblance of common values, which was why it proved impossible to maintain after the end of the war."
"Just before his death, Roosevelt admitted that America could not do business with Stalin, as the latter had broken every one of the promises he had made."
"Yet this admission came too late."
"Europe was divided, and Eastern Europe was driven into the arms of Stalinist totalitarianism."
"The countries affected included Poland, which was the first to put up any resistance to Hitler, even at a time when his ally was Stalin."
"The Polish armed forces constituted a quarter of the Allied forces, and in relative terms the country suffered the greatest loss of lives during the war."
"Unfortunately, Russia is reluctant nowadays to acknowledge the ambiguous role played by the USSR during the war."
"President Putin has reverted to a Stalinist interpretation of the Second World War and its aftermath, and claimed that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was a normal international treaty."
"Russia has officially denied that Stalin attacked Poland in 1939, that genocide was committed in Katyn and that the USSR occupied the Baltic states."
"It has even said that the Yalta Conference brought democracy to Poland."
"Viktor Yerofeyev, a well-known Russian writer, recently wrote that Russia is enlightened enough to make no distinction between Stalin’s totalitarianism and Hitler’s regime."
"If Russia were indeed enlightened, there would be every reason to hope that it could be reconciled with Europe."
"Any signs of a rehabilitation of Stalin should serve as a warning to all of us, however."
"Why is this so important right now?"
"President Putin has said that reconciliation between Russia and Germany could set an example to Europe."
"Unfortunately, any reconciliation that is based on a Stalinist interpretation of history sets the warning bells ringing, and they are ringing particularly loudly in Warsaw, Vilnius, Riga and Tallinn."
"Both the Polish people and the other nations of Central Europe believe that it will be impossible to achieve peace and reconciliation in Europe if the nations situated between Germany and Russia are left out of the equation in this fashion."
"What the House needs to understand is that we in Poland and Central Europe feel too cramped for comfort whenever the superpowers of Western Europe and Russia shake hands over our heads."
"Mr President, it is of great importance that we should at this moment commemorate the end of the Second World War 60 years ago."
"It is also a good thing that on this occasion, it is underlined once again that freedom and democracy should not be taken for granted, and have to be actively upheld."
"The atrocities of National Socialism are a black page in Europe’s history and the previous speakers were right to point out that there is little, if anything, that can be added to that."
"It is regrettable, though, that Western Europe is devoting so little attention to the historical fact that 60 years ago, the official go-ahead was given for handing over the Eastern European peoples to Soviet occupation, to dictatorial Communist regimes that were certainly a match for the Nazis in terms of horror and crime."
"The Red Army was already at Warsaw in 1944, simply waiting until the Nazis had suppressed the uprising."
"Sixty years ago, there was praise and honour everywhere in the West for Joseph Stalin, a tyrant who had by then already killed millions of people and who, with the connivance of the liberated West, would go on to kill many more millions, in and outside of Russia."
"It is, in fact, high time that Russia should follow Germany in putting the past to rights."
"Officially, countries such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were liberated by the Red Army."
"Vaira Vike-Freiberga, Latvia’s President, pointed out that 1945 did not bring the Baltic States liberation of any kind, quite the contrary."
"Let me quote her: ‘It meant slavery, it meant occupation, it meant submission and Stalinist terror’."
"The European leaders who were in Moscow a few days ago hardly took the trouble to broach that reality, and what meant liberation for the Western Europeans 60 years ago, was another calvary for Eastern Europe, the difference being that the new dictatorships could count on the active support and sympathy of so many Western European politicians, media, intellectuals and many others, some of whom, in fact, appeared to be on the payroll of the Soviet secret services."
"It is perhaps apt, 60 years down the line, to look at those issues."
"Maybe Europe will not be able to fully put the past to rest unless a kind of Nuremberg Trial of Communism is held, not in an attempt to open up old wounds but with the intention never to forget, with the future of our children and grandchildren in mind."
"I am shocked when a European Commissioner includes photos on his website on which he demonstrates his admiration for one such as Fidel Castro."
"I am shocked when intellectuals and policy-makers continue to deny or play down the advent of Islamic extremism."
"Jean-François Revel already spoke of – the totalitarian temptation."
"If there is one lesson to be learnt from the atrocities of the Second World War, it is that totalitarianism should not be given another chance, wherever it may appear."
"The great Hungarian poet born a century ago, Attila József, reminds us that we, the European nations, who have fought many wars between ourselves, have a lot of common matters to put in order."
"In his letter to Vytautas Landsbergis and me, Mr Frattini has written recently that your history is our history too."
"When we celebrate the end of the World War in Europe, we must not forget that the end of the war brought something different for each of the European nations."
"In the case of more fortunate nations, it marked the end of long suffering and immeasurable destruction sixty years ago."
"We bow our head before all who made a sacrifice for peace."
"Another evil dictatorship, however, awaited the other half of Europe with no less suffering and destruction."
"Night after night without daylight, occupation after occupation without independence, inhumane dictatorship after inhumane dictatorship without freedom."
"Slovakian representative, Zita Pleštinská, sits here behind me among us, whose Hungarian father, István Kányai, was equally hunted by Nazis and Fascists, and then later suffered nine years in the hells of Soviet concentration camps."
"The one, who frees the innocent captive from one prison and locks him up in another, is a prison guard, not a liberator."
"And the prisoner will not see him as someone who granted his freedom, but one who took it."
"For many European nations, their much-coveted freedom came fifty years after May 8, 1945."
"And the last step was taken May 1, 2004, marking the ending of the Yalta world order."
"In reality, the Second World War ended on May 1, 2004."
"Therefore, the end of the war should more appropriately be celebrated here, in the capital of reunified Europe instead of Moscow."
"The nations of Europe looked at two sides of the same wall: the barbed wire divided us in two for half a century."
"We bore the unbearable, endured the system established by the Soviet Red Army, who stayed after the liberation, genocide, class and ethnic-based cleansing, the killing, torturing, deportation and disenfranchisement of innocent people committed in the name of the progressive socialist idea."
"The system forced upon Central European nations by Soviet Communism was a direct consequence of the plan that Stalin spoke about on August 19, 1939 before the Politbüro, when giving an explanation for the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact."
"I quote:"
"Our nations rose up against such dictatorship from the Bolshevik Parties many times: 1956 in Berlin, October 1956 in Hungary and Poznañ, 1968 in Czechoslovakia and 1980 in Poland."
"The West welcomed our revolutions, sympathised with us, then tolerated it when the Soviet Union quashed and bloodily stamped out these expressions of desire for freedom."
"Dear colleagues, our history is your history too."
"Nevertheless, we, the nations freed from Soviet occupation a decade ago, find no compassion when it comes to our recent history."
"After the war, Western Europe proudly straightened itself up and started to prosper in peace."
"Although it was not our fault, we got left out of this process."
"This gives ground to the current situation, in which there are people on the luckier side of Europe and even here in Parliament, who want to generate capital for themselves by frightening their own population with the cheap citizens of the new Member States, with people, whose country fell into an economic crisis because of the ineffectual socialist economy forced on them."
"But many people in Western Europe do not understand either why the five-pointed red star, like the swastika, has become the symbol for hatred and oppression."
"Our history is your history too."
"Sixty years ago, Nazi powers were jointly defeated by nations of Europe."
"The discredited political class disappeared."
"There are no squares named after Hitler, and no statues erected to commemorate Nazi killers."
"Half a century later, the Soviet Union and the Communist regime also collapsed."
"Similarly, Yugoslavian Communism that went on its separate way without Soviet occupation suffered a disgraceful defeat."
"The successors of the fallen Communist system are eloquent business people demanding respect, responsible politicians, so to say."
"In Russia, statues of Stalin have been erected again, and the Soviet occupation, once again, is referred to as liberation."
"It seems that they wanted to hear less and less about the atrocities of the Communist dictatorship."
"Dear Parliament, we must not think with a double standard."
"Auschwitz, the Katyn forest massacre, the Nazi and the two-time Soviet occupation of the Baltic States, unjust dictatorships dismembering Europe’s spheres of interest, borders drawn by force and pacts, deportation of whole nations, murdering, torturing, crippling of people, disenfranchising population exchanges, walls dividing nations, trampling on human and minority rights, these are all gross injustices, regardless of who committed them."
"Sixty years after the military end of the war, it is time to face these issues."
"The enormous sacrifice of the Soviet army demands respect and honour."
"The occupying army, however, does not deserve our respect; it forced its own oppressing dictatorship on one part of the European nations."
"As long as we are unable to call an atrocity an atrocity, adjudge murder as murder, as long as we measure one sin with another, war will continue to rage in our head and wounds will not heal."
"Jesus says that the truth makes us free."
"The reuniting of Europe gives opportunity for a new beginning."
"Once winners and losers, oppressors and oppressed, we can build a joint, democratic Europe together based on the virtue of human dignity rooted in the Christian tradition, with hope for a brighter future and happier generations to come."
"Let us listen to Attila József, let us listen to the poet, and create order in our common matters!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, today this House is commemorating the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, which was the most terrible war in history."
"It claimed the lives of millions of people and led to the annihilation of the Jews, as well as plunging Europe into the depths of savagery, economic devastation and moral decay."
"We should bow our heads in memory of this time and commemorate the victims of this war."
"Ladies and gentlemen, even though there are certain key moments in our collective memory that allow us to join together in building a political community, each of the European nations remembers the 20th century in its own way."
"The reason for this is that our states and our peoples have experienced different historical and political events."
"There is, however, one thing that unites us, as we all remember the victims claimed by the war and the struggle for freedom and democracy."
"It is the memory of these things that provides a basis for our common European identity."
"Today we are commemorating the victims of the Nazi terror in the countries occupied by the Third Reich."
"We are also honouring the victims of the Holocaust, or in other words the genocide committed against the Jews in Europe during the Second World War, which was a crime that has no parallel in human history."
"We are commemorating the victory of the Allied nations over the Third Reich, and in particular the part played by the United States of America in liberating Europe."
"We are remembering all the soldiers who died in order to rid the world of Nazism, and the 14 million soldiers who fought in the Red Army."
"We are commemorating the losses suffered by all sides in the Second World War, as well as those who fell victim to Stalin during the war."
"The massacre of around 22 000 Polish citizens and prisoners of war in Katyn, and in other camps and prisons in the Soviet Union in the spring of 1940, has become a symbol of the latter."
"We are paying homage to those who fought for freedom, democracy and human rights, and we are particularly remembering the heroic resistance movement, which fought against fascism and occupation in the various countries."
"The ideals of this movement, and the willingness of its members to sacrifice themselves in a one-sided war, are now a true legacy to us, as well as something of which we can all be proud and a fine example for Europe’s young people."
"Today I should like to commemorate the resistance movement in the Warsaw ghetto, and those who belonged to the Jewish Military Organisation and who took up arms on 19 April 1943 to defend the Jewish ghetto that had been created in Warsaw by the occupying powers."
"Although in military terms they had no chance of winning, fighting as they did in the midst of the war and in the heart of a Europe ruled by the Nazis, their fight did in fact have a deeper meaning."
"Nowadays we regard their heroism as the most powerful testimony to human spirit ever seen, and one of the moral foundations of the Europe that we have built."
"To echo the sentiments found in a manifesto of the Jewish Military Organisation, we are fighting for your and our freedom, and for your and our human, social and national honour and dignity."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are remembering that the end of the war did not bring true liberation, independence and democracy to all the nations of Europe."
"The end of the war meant new forms of oppression and a lack of sovereignty and democracy for Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic states."
"It also meant violations of fundamental human rights under the totalitarian that was imposed on this part of Europe by the Soviet Union, the loss of independence for Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, and their incorporation into the Soviet Union."
"Throughout the 20th century, the Socialists, the Social Democrats and the Democratic Left adopted a stance of opposition to all forms of dictatorship and to all non-democratic regimes."
"We are a political movement that has always been on the side of democracy and human rights, whether in the Baltic states, in Central and Eastern Europe or in the countries of Southern Europe in which dictators came to power after the Second World War, namely Portugal, Spain and Greece."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking today in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, on ground that bears the scars of wars and the downfall of Europe."
"Our forefathers met on this ground as soldiers on opposing sides."
"We now meet each other as citizens and as MEPs representing a uniting Europe."
"Since the 1950s, European integration and the construction of a European Community have been our response to the war."
"The conflicts between Europe’s nations were overcome in the process of setting up the European institutions, and this continues to be the case today."
"The European Union we have today is the product of three major democratic processes, namely the defeat of fascism in the war, the fall of the dictatorships in Southern Europe in the late 1970s and the victory of democracy in Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic states."
"A model of international order is being established in Europe on the basis of peace and cooperation, and a community is being set up in accordance with the principle of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and human rights, including the rights of minorities."
"The various peoples that go to make up the European Union, which now has 25 Member States, have a variety of historical experiences behind them."
"Ratification of the Constitution for Europe will mean that a united Europe can be established, the goals of which are peace, justice and solidarity throughout the world."
"This Europe can also become a special area of human hope, to borrow the phrase used in the preamble to the Constitutional Treaty."
"Together we have travelled a long road, from a Europe overwhelmed by war, totalitarian regimes and human misery, to a democratic Europe in which free nations within the EU are jointly creating a European future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 60 years after the end of the Second World War, Europe’s future depends to a great extent on whether two basic conditions are met."
"The first of these is that the history of the events that occurred during the Second World War be generally acknowledged, and the second is that a common vision of European integration be brought about on the basis of this history."
"The way in which people remember history can differ according to whether or not the end of the war amounted to genuine liberation for them."
"Poles remember a number of key dates that sealed the fate of the Second World War as a tragic event."
"The first of these is 1 September 1939, when Hitler attacked Poland."
"This date marked the beginning of a nightmarish time of occupation, repression and concentration camps, when the occupying forces did their best to annihilate the Polish nation and people."
"It was, however, also a time of heroic deeds by the underground state and society. Another date Poles remember is 17 September 1939."
"Although this date unfortunately has less resonance in Western Europe, we find it both distressing and highly significant, as it is the date when the Soviet Union attacked Poland."
"This attack took place following the conclusion of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between Hitler and Stalin, which provided for another partition of Poland."
"Other dates include 1943, when the crimes committed in Katyn in 1940 were uncovered, or in other words the slaughter of tens of thousands of Polish officers and officials on Stalin’s orders, merely because they served the Polish state, and 1943 and 1944, when two heroic uprisings took place."
"The first of these was Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, which ended in bloody defeat, or rather extermination, and the second was the Warsaw Uprising, which Soviet troops watched from the right bank of the Vistula without taking any action."
"The final date that Poles remember is 1945, as this is when the Yalta Conference took place."
"The latter led to the creation of the Iron Curtain, which divided Europe for 44 years, cutting off my country, Poland, from European democracy and integration."
"That is all I wish to say about how we remember history."
"Turning to the matter of a common vision of European integration, I should like to highlight a fundamental point."
"What we remember are the crimes that were committed by systems, and the victims these systems claimed."
"These memories should not and must not under any circumstances divide nations and peoples."
"This is the message behind Solidarity, the Polish social movement which triggered the liberation of Eastern Europe and which is also celebrating its 25th anniversary this year."
"This movement was the driving force behind the resumption of relations between the two parts of Europe that had been divided by the decisions made in Yalta."
"Taking my cue from it, I should like to state quite categorically that solidarity must be the guiding principle of our common future."
"I should like to finish by calling upon all Members to vote in favour of this resolution."
"Mr President, I believe that a peaceful and prosperous Europe must be based on the respect for human rights."
"For this reason, I cannot vote for Mr Brok’s resolution."
"A number of its assertions would create a legal basis for the violation of human rights and lead to huge injustices in my country, Latvia, as well as in neighbouring Estonia."
"The motion for a resolution states that the countries of Eastern Europe were under Soviet occupation for many decades."
"In the case of Latvia and Estonia, such an approach would have dangerous consequences for the more than half a million people who settled there during those decades."
"Mr Toomas Ilves from Estonia recently explained in the what this assertion would mean: ‘hence, the protection of minorities in the Baltic states will become senseless’."
"Moreover, two weeks ago, the Latvian Parliament approved further consideration of the declaration asking the European Parliament for exemption from the obligation to accept foreign citizens and their descendants who were moved to Latvia during the time of occupation."
"My father was a naval officer in the Soviet army and participated in the defeat of Hitler’s army and of his local allies, Arājs, Cukurs and others, responsible for the liquidation of 80 000 Latvian Jews, including my father’s grandparents."
"Moreover, my father was thrown out of the army, in accordance with Stalin’s orders, for being Jewish."
"I will never accept that my father was an occupier, nor will I ever agree that my mother, a Russian Orthodox, who came to Riga from St Petersburg in 1950, should be subject to repatriation, as the draft Latvian declaration says."
"The assertion made in this European Parliament resolution will encourage Latvian law-makers to accept this declaration in the very near future."
"I do not want the Baltic states to become a second Balkans."
"We parliamentarians are fully responsible for the words we are saying."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 8 May 1945 was the date that heralded the end of the Second World War, but it was also the date that sealed the end of the Fascist and Nazi dictatorships in Europe."
"On that day, Europe liberated itself from the spectre of authoritarianism, and that date also heralded the beginning of a Europe aspiring towards peace and social justice."
"Europe was liberated by the resistance of men and women, partisans who built the institutional and moral foundations of this Europe."
"Europe was liberated by those who fought at Stalingrad; it was liberated by American and Canadian Allied troops, and equally by the Soviet army."
"That date can be regarded as the foundation stone upon which a new Europe was built."
"That page of history is, unfortunately, all too often subjected to revisionist plunder and attacks, and even this debate is marred by an unmistakeable revisionist impetus."
"By indistinctly muddling 8 May 1945 with the crimes of Stalinism, we do a disservice to the commemoration of the Liberation of Europe."
"I should like to be clear on that point: in terms of political beliefs, personal data and cultural development,myself and my group have no problem in firmly condemning the horrors of Stalinism; however, in this debate, people are seeking to surreptitiously bring to life the theories of Nolte, which equate Nazism with Communism, and not only with Stalinism."
"In truth, the values of peace and social justice were, in that short century, threatened not only by Stalinism, but equally by colonialism, by imperialism, and by neo-liberalism: from Algeria to Vietnam, from the shelling of Belgrade to the massacres of Sabra and Shatila, up to the events of 11 September 1973 in Santiago del Chile."
"We must do right by history: the memory of the past is a crucial gift in enabling us to contend with the future and to build the horizons of this Europe."
"There is only one way to strengthen Europe: we must ban the term war from our vocabulary."
"Europe must play an active role in building a peaceful world, stretching from Iraq to Afghanistan, and to Palestine."
"To conclude, Europe has to be more courageous and authoritative; we must reverse the famous Latin saying and forcefully assert or ‘if you want peace, prepare for peace’."
"That must be our guiding light."
"Mr President, I sometimes wonder what the arguments are for the European Union."
"They certainly cannot be economic, because we do not live in a world of huge trade tariffs and certainly there is now a global economy."
"They certainly cannot be democratic, because this Parliament is the only democratic element within the European Union and it is almost as good as useless."
"However, if there were one argument for the European Union that would make me change my mind, it would be the argument that the European Union would give us, and would guarantee, peace."
"However, all of this is based on a series of false assumptions."
"It was not democratic nation-states that caused the First and Second World Wars."
"If you look back through history, you find that mature democracies do not go to war with each other."
"It is also wrong and quite false to claim that the EU has kept the peace in Europe for the last 50 years."
"What war has it stopped?"
"Was Portugal going to fight Italy in the mid-1970s?"
"What possible war could it have stopped?"
"If there has been a guarantor of peace over the last 50 years, surely it must be NATO, an example of intergovernmental cooperation."
"President Borrell goes on about the reunification of Europe."
"I wonder sometimes what he is even talking about."
"The important thing is: will the EU guarantee peace?"
"Does federation guarantee peace?"
"It did not in Yugoslavia or in the USSR and it did not in the United States of America, which, you remember, had one of the bitterest and bloodiest civil wars in the history of mankind."
"If we go on selling this project to the peoples of Europe on a lie, we are more likely than not to stoke up and cause bitter resentments and extreme nationalism."
"What we must do is tell the peoples of Europe the truth about our ambitions and give them free and fair referendums, otherwise we are heading for disaster."
"Ladies and gentlemen, sixty years after the Second World War I can say with conviction that the European Union is the best model of cooperation between countries that has so far been experienced in the old continent."
"In Europe, dialogue has replaced wars, and yet reconciliation, deep understanding of historical truth and the mutual intertwining of the interests of states and politicians has still not been achieved."
"Yes, at this time we commemorate together one of humanity’s greatest victories over Nazi ideology."
"We remember the victims of fascism and bow our heads in memory of the combatants who died."
"Yes, it is satisfying that the whole political spectrum of the European Parliament has been able to unite on the resolution about the end of the Second World War and for the first time is simultaneously assessing and condemning the crimes of both the Nazi and the Communist regimes."
"Ladies and gentlemen, our joint declaration stated unambiguously that there can be no reconciliation without historical truth; that only a strong Europe can provide solutions on how to overcome the legacy of the past, at the foundation of which lies injustice and the 50-year long social, political and economic degradation of nations that were kept imprisoned."
"Unfortunately, our declaration did not say everything."
"Neither is what Jean-Claude Juncker said in Moscow yesterday acceptable."
"He said that the resolution of these problems is a question for future generations."
"Only the powerful call things by their true names."
"A few days ago in Riga, George Bush said, quite unmistakably: ‘‘the Yalta agreement followed in the unjust tradition of Munich and the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact."
"Once again, when powerful governments negotiated, the freedom of small nations was somehow expendable."
"Yet this attempt to sacrifice freedom for the sake of stability left a continent divided and unstable.’"
"The real cold war in Europe that lasted for nearly 50 years confirms what he said."
"Everyone in the European Parliament knows that NATO, the North-Atlantic union, was created to promote European security in the climate of fear of an invasion by the totalitarian, cynical and aggressive Soviet regime."
"This confirms the fact that for the West, following the Second World War, there was no trust in an ally such as Stalin."
"The evil empire created by Stalin was unacceptable, even though before then the victory over Nazi ideology had been jointly celebrated."
"Ladies and gentlemen, when we are thinking about Europe’s future, what I have just said should be borne closely in mind."
"Sixty years have passed since the Second World War, and Europe together with its allies is shaping its future."
"Unfortunately, Russia, inheritor of the mantle of the USSR, is still making statements denying its influence over the countries of eastern Europe, and the occupation of my country, Latvia, and of Lithuania and Estonia."
"This disowning of historical truth, the deliberate upholding of the crimes of the Communist regime, is humiliating."
"It amounts to contempt for the victims and casualties of the regime, yet it is happening today."
"Russia is trying to hold on to opportunities to manipulate public opinion worldwide."
"Russia is keeping the problem of non-citizens in Latvia in the public eye and exaggerating it, but at the same time it is continuing to violate the human rights of victims and casualties of the totalitarian Soviet regime, and their immediate families, by denying their suffering and losses."
"Such an attitude by Russia does nothing to foster reconciliation between Russia and the states of eastern Europe and the Baltic which have regained their freedom."
"Genuine condemnation of the crimes of Communism and a resolution of their consequences are needed in the name of Europe’s future stability."
"I call upon you to vote for the resolution!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, the history of the EU nations has very definitely not been an easy one."
"It has seen these nations fight against each other, betray each other and commit atrocities against each other."
"It was Europeans who came up with the idea of the supremacy of the Aryan race, the Final Solution for other races and the gas chambers."
"What is more, the rest of Europe initially sat back and did nothing while this was going on."
"I regret to say that a line has still not been drawn under this period."
"Sixty years after the end of the Second World War, there are Members of this House who refuse to vote in favour of resolutions condemning the Holocaust, who persistently put the suffering of the victims of the Second World War on a par with that of its architects, and who distort the past and fail to differentiate properly between the causes and the effects of the most horrendous conflict of all time."
"The recent speeches by a number of leading representatives of the Member States and of the European institutions to mark the 60th anniversary of the end of the war have revealed that they are infatuated with the idea that our golden age of prosperity and peace is a direct result of the European Union’s history."
"For the sake of future generations, we should not forget that this is very far from being the case."
"Peace in Europe can just as well be attributed to the presence of American troops on European soil, and prosperity can be explained by economic growth in Asia and the United States and the increase in global trade."
"As far as freedom is concerned, revolutions took place in a number of European countries, including my own, without any help from Brussels."
"It is a matter of some concern to me that the democracy and prosperity we have succeeded in achieving are now under threat."
"Europe’s potential to act as a global player will be reduced by the incomprehensible and unjust European Constitution, which benefits certain countries at the expense of others."
"The distance that exists between politicians and the real world is a further factor jeopardising Europe’s future, as the citizens of the individual Member States understand ever less of the language spoken by the European institutions and their representatives."
"Where will Europe end up if its public does not understand its leaders?"
"Will it become easy prey for the worst kind of populism, simply because no one can understand it?"
"It is my firm belief that no media campaign will ever succeed in boosting public confidence in the idea of a common Europe."
"The only way this can be done is by implementing practical and easy-to-understand measures that provide solutions to real problems."
"The inability of European leaders to promote growth and the cowardly, Euronationalist approach to economic matters are a far from adequate response to the hard facts of the global economy."
"I represent the citizens of a country that suffered as a result of the Iron Curtain, which fell 15 years ago."
"Today, however, we are seeing attempts to build new ‘curtains’ around Europe to keep out the United States, Chinese textiles, a cheap workforce and many asylum seekers."
"Shutting ourselves off from the world will not solve the problems that Europe is facing."
"In view of the lack of public interest and the economic slowdown, it is becoming apparent that the way in which the European Union is currently governed will be unsustainable if Europe is to be competitive."
"I believe that EU leaders should have the courage to admit to themselves and to the public that the revitalised Lisbon Strategy and the unjust European Constitution are nothing but a dead end, and will not result in more justice, freedom or prosperity."
"The only correct response to the current state of the global economy and global politics is to be open, to limit our interference in economic matters, to lower taxes, to enable the nation states to operate more flexibly and to coordinate matters at EU level in a sensible fashion, and only in instances where it proves necessary."
"I have received a motion for a resolution(1), pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"– This commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Fascism has triggered a repellent exercise in revisionism and historical distortion, part of which is the unacceptable motion for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"Far from being naïve, this dreadful falsification of history sets out to meet some very specific objectives."
"The aim is to wipe out the key contribution made by the Soviet Union and its people’s glorious struggle to destroy the brutal killing machine of the Nazi Fascist armies and regimes, along with its decisive role in reining in imperialist aggression during the post-war period."
"This motion for a resolution seeks to silence and defame the glorious and heroic role played by the communists in the anti-fascist struggle."
"It seeks to airbrush the Nazi horror, its millions of deaths in concentration camps, the millions of men, women and children killed, and the systematic destruction of entire countries."
"It seeks to gloss over the fact that Hitler’s rise to power was aided by German capital and by the complicity of the large capitalist interests, which fed the hope, right until the end, that the Nazi war machine would destroy the main enemy, the Soviet Union."
"It seeks, just like 60 years ago, to defend the indefensible, namely imperialist and militarist aggressiveness and the aggression perpetrated against the sovereignty of peoples."
"It will not succeed!"
"The next item is a series of oral questions to the Council in accordance with Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure (B6-0236/2005)."
"Question No 1 has been withdrawn."
"Is the Council aware that the United States of America's National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has stripped graduate teachers at American private universities of the protection of US labour law?"
"The right to organise collectively into a trade union is a human right."
"Is the Council willing to put pressure on the Bush administration to allow academic unions to organise to protect the quality of jobs, academic freedoms and the intellectual standards of US universities?"
". Mr President, with regard to the situation of graduate teachers in the United States, I can answer Mr Evans by saying that the Council is not acquainted with the situation outlined in his question."
"The type of professional relations mentioned by the Member falls within the jurisdiction of the individual Member States."
"That is why, although human rights issues make up a significant part of the regular dialogue between the European Union and the United States, the Union is not able to debate this type of professional relations with the US authorities."
"Thank you for that response, even if it was not quite the one I wanted."
"Surely, this is not a matter that needs 25 countries to act individually; it is a very serious issue."
"Our relations with the United States are not just about trade and businesses making money and, equally, this is not just a United States issue, nor one solely concerning American citizens, as there are a good number of Europeans teaching at these American institutions."
"Now I understand that the provost of Columbia University in New York has issued instructions on how he would like graduate teachers dealt with and punished."
"I would say to the presidency, in solidarity and in defence of international labour law, that we should not remain silent on this and we should not just stand aside and allow a flagrant abuse of workers’ rights."
"Although this is happening in the United States, it could also be affecting European citizens."
"I would urge him to go back and see what more can be done."
"I regret that I am unable to say anything other that what I have already said, but nevertheless I have taken full note of the Member’s comments."
"Every country must certainly respect international labour law, and I am in complete agreement with that point of view."
"It is a point that I accept and one that could certainly be brought up in the context of relations with the United States, as I have pointed out."
"Do the provisions governing minorities in Serbia, particularly in Vojvodina, the Sandzhak of Novi Pazar and the Presevo valley, accord with European standards, and what is the Council's assessment of them in comparison with the standards which apply to Macedonia under the Ohrid Treaty?"
". The Council is closely monitoring the situation with regard to the rights of minorities in the Western Balkans."
"The latest analysis of the rights of minorities in Serbia and Montenegro is that presented by the Commission in its feasibility report assessing the readiness of Serbia and Montenegro to negotiate a Stabilisation and Association Agreement."
"For its part, the situation with regard to the rights of minorities in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been outlined in the latest annual Commission report, which has been drawn up in the framework of the Stabilisation and Association process."
"Generally speaking, the situation regarding the rights of minorities in the Western Balkans has improved in recent years, although significant progress still remains to be made."
"Instead of drawing a comparison between the provisions made with regard to minorities in Serbia and Montenegro and in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Council intends to continue encouraging these countries taking into account their entirely specific circumstances to pursue a policy on minorities that is in full compliance with European standards."
"Mr President, as the Ohrid Agreement imposes very stringent conditions on Macedonia as regards the protection of minorities, I would ask that we avoid applying double standards, which I rather think we risk doing."
"We are mainly concerned here with two areas: the Sandzak of Novi Pazar and Vojvodina, where the problems with minorities continue to be extremely serious, and it is these that I wish to bring to your attention."
". I readily acknowledge the importance of drawing the Council’s attention to the treatment of minorities in the regions that you have just mentioned, and of making a kind of comparison with the protection of minorities, in accordance with the Ohrid Agreement."
"I believe, however, that we are talking about two different situations, which must be assessed accordingly."
"In the context of the development of its relations with Serbia, the European Union will not fail to insist forcefully on the protection of minorities in the regions that you have mentioned."
"What response has been given by the Council to the suggestion made by Commissioner Rehn at the January AFET meeting that, in a bid to overcome the current stalemate, the Commission was ready to consider adding Article 308 EC as a second legal basis of the regulations on aid and trade?"
". As has already been pointed out in response to similar questions, the Council has persisted in underlining its commitment to pursuing efforts aimed at the reunification of Cyprus."
"It hopes, furthermore, that all Cypriots may soon live together, as Cypriot and European citizens belonging to a reunified island within the European Union."
"From this perspective, the European Union has undertaken to examine measures capable of ending the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community and of facilitating the reunification of Cyprus by encouraging economic development within the Turkish Cypriot community."
"Certain measures have already been taken to this end, such as the ‘Green Line’ Regulation, which was adopted in 2004 and recently amended in order to broaden its scope and increase its effectiveness."
"Important work has also been carried out focusing on other measures, namely Commission proposals concerning, on the one hand, the instrument of financial support aimed at promoting economic development within the Turkish Cypriot community and, on the other hand, exchanges with areas where the government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exert effective control."
"Adopting those two proposals is not yet possible, as there remain problems to be overcome, particularly as regards direct exchanges."
"It is to this last proposal that the Member makes particular reference in his question."
"The hypothesis put forward by Commissioner Rehn at the January meeting of Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs, with regard to a possible reworking of the proposal’s legal basis, has not yet been presented to the Council."
"In actual fact, the responsibility lies with the Commission to rework its proposal in this way, if it so desires."
"Obviously, the Presidency cannot tell at this stage what the Council’s decisions might be in this regard."
"I must point out, however, that legal opinions exist which do not confirm the approach taken by the Commission regarding the legal basis that it initially adopted."
"By means of the Presidency, the Council can once again assure the Member that it will pursue its efforts to promote the island’s economic integration and improved relations between the two Cypriot communities and with the European Union."
". I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for that reply."
"It seems to me that everybody is blaming everybody else."
"It has been over a year since the Council pledged to end the isolation of Turkish Cypriots in the wake of their two-thirds ‘yes’ vote to the UN’s Annan Plan for a political settlement."
"One has to ask what trust can anyone place in EU pledges if this is an example of non-delivery."
"As the minister pointed out, direct trade and helping the economy of the north would assist in a political settlement."
"It is of no help to anyone for the Turkish Cypriots to be so far behind the Greek Cypriots in income and economic development."
"When will some serious pressure be exerted to actually deliver on that year-old pledge?"
"In the meantime, the Turkish Cypriots are dangling out there in isolation, losing trust in EU promises."
"I must confess, I cannot blame them."
"When can we expect these two regulations to be passed?"
". I can simply say to you, Mrs Ludford, that your question comes just at the right moment, since in an hour and a half, myself, as the representative of the Presidency, and Commissioner Rehn, will travel to Cyprus to try to discuss the issues that you have just raised."
"I believe that it is precisely the intention of the Presidency to resolve these issues as soon as possible, and to thus act in accordance with the political commitments undertaken by the Council in April."
"As the author is not present, Question No 5 lapses."
"A joint report by Oxfam, ActionAid and the European Debt and Development Coalition was recently published, assessing EU Member States' performance in the area of development."
"Rich countries of the world agreed in 1970 at the UN General Assembly to reach 0.7% of GNI as foreign aid, at the latest by 1980."
"Twenty-five years after this deadline, only five countries have reached this target, four of which are EU Member States."
"Many other countries have broken their promises in relation to eradicating poverty. For example Ireland has abandoned its plans to reach the target of 0.7 per cent by 2007."
"As the Luxembourg Presidency has stated that the fight against poverty will be the main objective of the Presidency programme, will it use its influence to renew Member States' aid commitments, and how does it plan to ensure fulfilment of EU development aid goals?"
"The Commission’s proposals, which identify the measures to be taken with a view to speeding up the process of fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals, have been under discussion by a Council working group since 14 April 2005. The Luxembourg Presidency intends to put every possible measure in place to ensure that during its meeting on 23 and 24 May, the Council will be in a position to outline the core elements of its renewed commitments."
"Essentially, these commitments will aim to, firstly, lay down new intermediate objectives for increasing public aid budgets by the year 2010, whether individual or regarding the Union as a whole, in an effort to reach a global figure of 0.7% of GDP by 2015. Secondly, they will aim to speed up reforms to improve the quality of aid, and thirdly, to reconsider the way in which the European Union, through its own model of sustainable development – by its internal and external policies – can influence development conditions."
"The European Union is fully aware of the importance and urgency of the task."
"In this context, during its meeting held on 22 and 23 March, the European Council called on the Commission and the Council to speed up their work, particularly with regard to the various components of the ‘development’ strand, so as to finalise the positions on the various issues and to allow the European Union to play an active role during future discussions with a view to the United Nations Summit being held in September 2005."
"I have already announced this morning that the ECOFIN Council, after having considered potential new funding methods at its last meeting, will return to the issue during its informal meeting taking place this weekend."
"I would like to point out to the President-in-Office that this target of 0.7% was agreed 35 years ago and to date only five states, four of them EU states – four out of 25 EU states – have met this target of 0.7%."
"By 2025, 2 billion more people will be on this planet, 90% of them born into the Third World."
"What sort of world will we leave to the next generation?"
"We have just spoken about the Second World War."
"What are we building up for our children and grandchildren?"
"What solid steps will the Council take to see to it that Member States meet their obligations?"
". I actually believe that there is a renewed desire to move clearly and resolutely towards the target of 0.7%."
"I obviously agree with what the Member has just said: it is taking too long."
"In actual fact, we have been discussing this target for more than 30 years."
"It is now time to implement it, and it is true that the timescales that have been set are perhaps still excessively long."
"My question during question time of 23 February 2005 asked the Council if it would remind the Israelis that Mr Mordechai Vanunu was illegally taken from European soil, in fact effectively kidnapped to face trial in Israel for alleged offences twenty years prior to the event, working on the ludicrous notion that he still held secrets that could be harmful to Israel."
"During this question I requested the Council to encourage the Israeli Government to stop its persecution of this individual, allow him to leave Israel and, if he so desires, to live in the European Union."
"However, it appears that the Israeli Government is continuing the persecution of Mr Vanunu."
"What action does the Council intend to take?"
". Since my speech before Parliament in February, the Israeli Government has, to our great regret, taken the decision to extend the restrictions imposed on the release of Mordechai Vanunu last year by an additional 12 months."
"A trial is taking place, moreover, in which Mr Vanunu is accused of having infringed these restrictions, and upon its conclusion he runs the risk of receiving another prison sentence."
"It would appear that this is an extremely sensitive matter for the Israeli authorities."
"It appears that they want to protect the security of the State of Israel in this way."
"By taking the decision to extend the restrictions imposed on Mr Vanunu, the Israeli Government alleged that he still had information to disclose."
"That said, nearly 20 years after the fact, it is also reasonable to acknowledge the fundamental rights of an individual who has spent 18 years in prison, such as the right to live in dignity, freely and peacefully."
"We are therefore planning to pursue the dialogue with the Israeli authorities, in particular on the issue of respect for human rights, in the context of the political dialogue that we are conducting with them, and in implementing the Neighbourhood Policy in which the Israeli Government has pledged to cooperate, on security issues and issues of the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and, precisely, on respect for human rights."
"I thank the President-in-Office for his reply, which was as helpful as it could be in the circumstances."
"However, it is clear to me that Israel has moved from protecting state security to persecuting this man."
"I hope the Council really will keep up the pressure on Israel to release him."
"Mordechai Vanunu has been elected rector of Glasgow University in my country, and we would very much like to see him able to come to the university and take up his role."
"Therefore, I hope the Council will continue its pressure."
". The Council has noted your point and will do what I have just said."
"Serious crimes are currently being committed against the Greek population in Georgia. Attacks have been carried out in the Tsalka region, the cradle of the Greek community."
"Ethnic Greek organisations have reported that some Greek families have been murdered and others have been hounded out of their villages."
"At the same time, they face problems involving their property."
"It has been reported that around 7 000 'invaders' have occupied homes and land in the past seven years and are refusing to return them to their rightful owners."
"Is the Council aware of these facts?"
"What action will it take to protect the fundamental rights of Greeks in Georgia?"
"Will the Council Presidency and Mr Solana make representations to the government in Tblisi regarding this matter?"
"Is Mr Solana prepared to submit a report on the human rights situation of Greeks in Georgia, in cooperation with the OSCE, the Council of Europe and the UN Commission on Human Rights?"
". The Council would firstly like to thank the Member for the information he has communicated with regard to the violation of the fundamental rights of the Greek population of Georgia."
"In its political dialogue with Georgia, the Council has expressed its concerns time and again about the need to improve human rights safeguards in this partner country."
"The Council will continue to make good use of every opportunity to express its concerns regarding human rights in Georgia, particularly in the context of its cooperation with the OSCE, the Council of Europe and the United Nations Commission for Human Rights."
"On 17 January 2005, the Secretary General and High Representative for the CFSP appointed Michael Matthiessen as his Personal Representative on Human Rights."
"The Special Representative for the Southern Caucasus, Mr Talvitie, also assists Georgia in carrying through its political and economic reforms, particularly as regards the rule of law, democratisation, human rights, good governance, development and poverty reduction."
"The Council, in its conclusions of 25 April, highlighted the importance of these objectives and renewed its commitment to develop these various elements in the context of its relations and particularly of its European Neighbourhood Policy."
"When the action plan on the European Neighbourhood Policy between the European Union and Georgia has been drafted and negotiated, the European Union will stress the need to improve human rights safeguards in that country."
"The Council therefore intends to monitor very closely the situation of the Greek community as it unfolds, and to raise the issue amongst the Georgian authorities each time there are grounds to do so."
"The European Parliament will perhaps also wish to address this issue itself during the next meeting of the EU-Georgia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee, which, according to my information, will take place on 13 and 14 June 2005."
"– Mr President, I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his reply."
"I absolutely agree with the framework of principles which he has set out for us."
"However, the problem is not just the framework of principles: it is what we can do, in practical terms, in the European Union to protect human and minority rights in Georgia and throughout the world."
"What levers and control mechanisms do we, as the European Union, have to persuade or pressure the Georgian authorities into respecting the rights of the Greek minority."
"I say this because I have before me the report by the special representative – as you referred to him – of the European Union for human rights for Georgia dated 12 April, which describes the human rights situation, and I must say it describes a very unpleasant situation for Greeks in Georgia."
"What are we doing?"
"What tools do we have within the framework of our relations with Georgia?"
"I think this is what is important today."
". Georgia has gone through a period of major upheaval but is now committed to the path to democracy."
"It is, moreover, seeking to move closer to the European Union."
"I believe that this reconciliation with the European Union, particularly in the context of the European Neighbourhood Policy, should also allow pressure to be put on the Georgian authorities to lead them not only to respect human rights in general, but also, significantly, the rights of minorities."
"I therefore believe that, in the context of the links between the European Union and Georgia, that issue will have to feature prominently."
"It is also, moreover, as a result of Georgia wanting to move closer towards Europe, and the European Union in particular, that we will be better able to also defend the rights of the Greek minorities that you mention."
"On 2 February 2005 in Sofia, eight European Heads of State or Government launched the 'Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005-2015'."
"They pledged to work towards eliminating discrimination and closing the unacceptable gaps between Roma and the rest of society."
"How does the Council intend to contribute to the implementation of the aims of this undertaking?"
"Is the Council prepared to report regularly on the progress of the integration of the Roma into European society?"
". The Council welcomes the commitment made by several Heads of State or Government on 2 February 2005 in Sofia to eliminate all forms of discrimination towards the Roma by 2015."
"I do not need to remind you about the debates that we have just held on the end of the Second World War and on the suffering incurred by the Roma people."
"That commitment is a major step given that, since 1 May 2004, the Roma communities have become the largest ethnic minority within the European Union."
"Due to the specific nature of their situation, their integration is a challenge of major proportions with regard to protecting fundamental rights and social inclusion."
"As the Member is certainly aware, during accession negotiations with new Member States, as well as with Bulgaria and Romania, the European Union has brought up the Roma situation time and again as an area requiring political attention from the governments of those States, in particular in the light of the Copenhagen political criteria relating more specifically to the need to guarantee the respect and protection of minorities."
"In confronting the challenge of integrating Roma communities, the major responsibility falls on national authorities, in addition to the regional and local authorities with the largest number of Roma inhabitants."
"All members of civil society together with the Roma themselves also have a vital role to play."
"For their part, the Member States can also implement, at Community level, various political programmes and relevant instruments relating to non-discrimination, equality of treatment and social integration."
"In particular, they can use the Council Directive 2000/43 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin."
"This directive in fact covers a wide range of areas where discrimination towards the Roma can occur: employment, training, education, social protection, access to goods and services and access to housing."
"Finally, Structural Funds, and particularly the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund, can finance a number of initiatives to benefit the Roma community."
"This is the case, in particular, with the Community initiative Equal, which is funded by the European Social Fund and is developing new approaches to fight against discrimination and inequalities, which, in the job market, specifically affect the Roma community."
"Thank you for that answer."
"In it you reflected the seriousness of the challenge that we face, as the Roma are now the biggest homogeneous minority in the enlarged European Union."
"Are we aware of the lack of activity by Member States, for example, their lack of implementation of the Equal Treatment Directive and of Article 13 of the Race Equality Directive, where the Commission is taking enforcement action?"
"Are we aware that Member States are lagging badly behind on the implementation of existing law that would protect the Roma community, particularly in employment?"
"This is a serious issue."
"Can the Roma issue, given how immense it is, be reflected in final statements by the Luxembourg presidency, to ensure that the United Kingdom presidency that follows takes this issue equally seriously?"
"I wish to press the President-in-Office on the final point my colleague made."
"It would send a very positive signal, if this matter was raised at the level of heads of state and government, and the final communiqué contained a reference to it."
"The Roma feel they are a neglected body within this European Union."
"This would send a good signal to them and would perhaps act as a lead, encouraging the Member States to take proper action."
". Firstly, I will say that EU law must be fully enforced by all Member States."
"I believe that it is a duty shared by all the States from the moment that they become members of the European Union."
"I should like to add that the Community Action Programme against Discrimination aims to promote measures that combat discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin."
"One of the priority areas identified in the 2004 working programme specifically targeted the integration of the Roma into the labour market."
"For all the Member States who have Roma minorities living in their country, this means including those minorities in national action programmes focusing on the labour market."
"I believe that it is a question of using the Community instruments that I mentioned previously to encourage and to lead Member States to treat the social integration of Roma minorities in this way."
"The Commission has submitted new proposals for directives on nuclear safety and the final disposal of nuclear waste."
"The Council has not made any significant progress with the proposals under the present Presidency."
"What is the Presidency's view as to why there has been no such progress, and when can progress be expected?"
". As the Council has already pointed out in its reply to Question No 1778 by Mr Rübig, the process of examining the Commission’s proposals has led the Council to adopt conclusions on 28 June on nuclear safety and on the safety of spent fuel management and radioactive waste management."
"These conclusions reaffirm the commitment of the Community and its Member States to maintain a high level of nuclear safety."
"At the same time, it is a question of – and I quote these conclusions – facilitating the choice of instrument(s), in the framework of the Euratom Treaty, that can contribute more effectively to achieving nuclear safety and the safe management of spent fuel and radioactive waste, without excluding any instrument and in line with the principles of better law-making."
"In accordance with these conclusions, an action plan was finalised in the second half of 2004."
"It is based on three areas: the safety of nuclear installations; the safety of spent fuel management and radioactive waste management; the financing of the decommissioning of nuclear installations and of the safe management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste."
"In this context, the Luxembourg Presidency has drawn up a working programme that sets out tasks to be completed, and has appointed the three groups of experts responsible for the different areas of the action plan."
"On the basis of this programme and considering the calendar of the various international authorities whose work has a bearing on the tasks to be completed, an overall report is planned for the end of 2006."
"I can assure you that the Luxembourg Presidency attaches the greatest importance to this issue."
"It must be observed, however, that there are blocking minorities who are preventing us from advancing more rapidly along this road."
"Mr President, I wish to thank the Council for its answer to Mr Seppänen’s question."
"I have two follow-up questions."
"The first concerns whether the Council believes that the terminal storage of radioactive waste is an issue of common interest to the extent that the EU should try to obtain common solutions for different Member States as to, for example, how and where their waste is ultimately to be stored."
"My second question concerns the Euratom Treaty."
"One of the discussion points in connection with the negotiations concerning the new Constitution related, of course, to whether the Euratom Treaty should be allowed to continue, as the Constitution allows it to."
"Does the Council believe that it would have become more difficult to conduct a supranational policy in this area if the Euratom Treaty had not existed as a legal basis?"
". Let us begin with the Euratom Treaty."
"In addition to the Convention, there have been initiatives calling precisely for a reform of the Euratom Treaty."
"In actual fact, I believe that it might be time to carry out an in-depth reform of this Treaty."
"We know that this reform is an extremely difficult undertaking, however, given that not all the Member States share the same approach as regards developing the nuclear sector."
"Some of them believe, moreover, that the nuclear sector should simply not be developed."
"It is partly for this reason that we remain in deadlock."
"On the issue of storage, I have already told you that consultations are taking place between experts to find a better means of safeguarding the storage of nuclear waste."
"I can assure you that in the context of the work currently being carried out, the Presidency will do all it can to move this issue forward, keeping in mind the safety, security and maximum protection of the environment, and also of the people."
"The Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan recently announced that his government had decided to suspend the entry into force of the new revised Turkish penal code planned for this month."
"Given that the revision and application of the penal code represent one of the Community institutions' basic demands with a view to Turkey's adapting to the acquis communautaire, what view does the Council take of this development?"
"Has it been officially informed by the Turkish Government of the reasons for the suspension and the final date for the entry into force of the new penal code? If so, what response has it given to the Turkish Government?"
"Does it believe that the failure to apply the new penal code will have consequences for the start of negotiations with this candidate country on 3 October 2005?"
". The Penal Code is one of six specific legal texts mentioned by the Commission in its recommendation of October 2004, which, in accordance with the European Council’s conclusions of 16 and 17 December 2004, must be enforced before the start of accession negotiations."
"The Union is aware of the decision taken by the Turkish Government to postpone the date of the entry into force of the Code."
"The Turkish authorities indicated that the entry into force of the new Penal Code was henceforth scheduled for 1 June 2005 instead of 1 April 2005."
"Turkey announced its intention to take this opportunity to bring changes to the text with a particular view to improving provisions relating to freedom of expression and freedom of the press."
"In the recent meeting held between the Association Council and Turkey, the European Union made reference to this important issue and encouraged Turkey to review its provisions with a view to answering the concerns of the Union in this area and acting in compliance with the Copenhagen principles and criteria."
"– Mr President, I should like, more specifically, to ask if you are monitoring progress in the reform of the Criminal Code, the directions in which it is going and the timetable for application."
"What specific demands do you have?"
"Have you set a timetable?"
"Will it be an important issue for you, before 3 October, when examining Turkey's criteria and obligations?"
"I truly believe that the Commission and the Council are very closely monitoring developments in relation to this crucial and important issue."
"At this stage, I have no reason to doubt the firm intention of the Turkish authorities to adopt and to implement a penal code that has been rightly revised for the reasons I have outlined."
"That is why I believe there is no reason to doubt the decisions that have been taken by the European Council."
"Given the possibility of Saddam Hussein being sentenced to death and given the European Union's categorical position on the abolition or non-application of the death penalty and the right to a fair trial, and bearing in mind that the President of Iraq has stated that signing Saddam Hussein's death warrant would go against his convictions as an advocate of human rights and his principles as regards the abolition of the death penalty, can the Council say what steps it will take to reiterate the European Union's firm opposition to the death penalty in any instance?"
". The position of the European Union in favour of abolishing the death penalty is well known; it is actively defended by the European Union in its relations with third countries, and at multilateral level, in accordance with the European Union’s position in respect of the death penalty."
"In July 2004, when faced with the reintroduction of the death penalty in Iraq, the Council reacted by raising this issue with the Iraqi authorities on several occasions, and it will continue to do so in future."
". – Thank you, Minister, for your reply to Mr Papadimoulis's question."
"I have no comments to make."
"The conditions governing the eligibility of ethnic minority parties in Romania to stand in elections are laid down by law: membership of at least 15% of the ethnic minority and more than 300 signatures in 15 of the different regions of Romania."
"According to the Congress of the Council of Europe of 16 July 2004, 'none of these conditions were applicable to parties already represented in the Parliament.'"
"The Venice Commission of the Council of Europe stated on 6 December 2004 that 'the conditions for national minorities…to present candidates are…prohibitive' (Opinion No. 300/2004), that is, it is impossible to satisfy these conditions."
"The European Commission noted in its report on Romania that the registration of national ethnic minority parties for the elections was hampered by considerable administrative obstacles."
"What additional information does the Council have concerning this situation in Romania?"
"What measures has it taken to resolve the problem?"
"What steps does it intend to take, in the light of Romania's forthcoming entry into the EU, to change the situation and ensure that national ethnic minorities have access to democratic representation in line with European standards?"
". Like the Commission and Parliament, the Council has, throughout the enlargement process, stressed the particular importance of protecting minorities and equal opportunities in the political representation of these minorities."
"More specifically, during the last meeting of the EU-Romania Association Council, thus before the signing of the accession treaty, the Union pointed out that political pluralism was an essential principle of any democracy and that it was fundamentally linked to compliance with the Copenhagen political criteria."
"The Union urged Romania to amend all of its restrictive legislative provisions affecting political parties and the planning of local elections, which had, in the past, prevented certain parties from taking part in the polls."
"The Council is well aware of the problems faced by certain new political parties representing ethnic minorities in Romania in registering themselves to stand for election."
"The development of these issues will continue to be monitored from the perspective of the Copenhagen political criteria in the strengthened monitoring of Romania’s pre-accession preparations."
"Member States have agreed two fundamental international instruments for the protection of children and their families."
"One is Council Regulation (EC) No 1347/2000(1) concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility."
"The second is the 1996 Hague Convention which deals with issues of parental responsibility in relations between EU States and third countries."
"As complementary instruments, it was intended that they both enter into force around the same time."
"Member States were due to deposit their instruments of ratification before 1 January 2005."
"Can the Council confirm that this is being blocked by the UK and Spain concerning the application of the Convention to Gibraltar?"
"Will the Presidency outline the steps that it plans to take to address this problem, in the interests of providing a legal framework for cases of child abduction between the EU and third countries?"
". The Council would like to point out to the Member that it considers that the Convention concerning Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Cooperation in respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children concluded at the Hague on 19 October 1996, is a valuable contribution to the protection of children at international level, and it is therefore to be hoped that these provisions will be applied without delay."
"It was with this in mind that the Council took the decision, on 19 December 2002, to invite Member States to sign this Convention in the interests of the Community."
"In respect of the ratification of this Convention, the Council should like to point out to the Member that there is general consensus on the expediency of ratifying it, and that another issue remains, which concerns Gibraltar."
"The Council expects that every effort will be made by the two Member States in a position to find a solution on this issue, in order that the Convention may be ratified by Member States in the interests of the Community, if possible before the end of 2005."
"I am grateful to the President, but I believe this was meant to be ratified in March."
"Letters from the Hague Conference have gone unanswered, and this sends a very poor message to parents and others who would wish to take advantage of this convention, both in the Community and in third countries."
"It also sends an unfortunate message to the outside world."
"I hope your assurance that it will enter into force before the end of the year proves correct."
"If no compromise is reached on the budget for the period 2004-2007 during the Luxembourg Presidency, is there not a danger that the matter will drag on into early 2006?"
"Is there not a likelihood of the British Presidency being unwilling to take up a final position on the matter?"
". In response to this question and to the suggestions that have been made, I can only repeat that the Luxembourg Presidency remains firmly resolved to reach a political agreement on the financial perspectives in June 2005."
"It is, moreover, also the case for the great majority of Members of your Parliament."
"No other scenario is therefore envisaged and the current Presidency has no doubt that, independently of the outcome, future Presidencies will earnestly assume the responsibilities that fall to them."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Council representative for having informed us that the Presidency is determined to reach an agreement."
"I find this very heartening."
"I am, however, somewhat alarmed at the latest reports that have reached us on this compromise, as its conditions would be extremely disadvantageous to the new Member States, such as Poland, and maybe most of all to the Czech Republic and Hungary."
"In my opinion, it is absolutely crucial that a compromise be reached during the Luxembourg Presidency, or in other words in the first six months of this year."
"I hope for the presidency’s sake, and indeed for all our sakes, that such a compromise is achieved, but in my opinion it is essential for it to gain public favour in our countries."
". The Luxembourg Presidency is relying on the firm and resolute support of your Parliament in order to reach an agreement."
"I hope, moreover, that with the goodwill of all governments, we will be able to achieve it."
"With reference to the current debate on the principles underpinning the operation, funding and control of a totally new instrument, the European grouping of cross-border cooperation (EGCC), what is the Council's initial position and along what lines are the discussions on the possible establishment of this instrument and the prospects for its future development proceeding?"
". The European grouping of cross-border cooperation is the subject of a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council submitted by the Commission on 14 July 2004."
"This proposal for a regulation is in the process of being examined by one of the Council’s working groups, which primarily focuses on structural measures."
"Following discussions held within this group from last summer onwards, on 19 April the Presidency presented a compromise text made accessible to the public that acts as a foundation for the work carried out by the group in charge of structural measures."
"It is therefore impossible to say at this stage what the Council’s position will be when the debate is closed."
"Obviously, as it is a regulation adopted in accordance with the codecision procedure, Parliament is party to the procedure."
"Thank you, Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council."
"I am of course familiar with this proposal for a regulation, but there are a number of questions I should like to put to the Council in order to learn its opinion."
"Article 159(3) of the Treaty establishing the European Community provides for specific actions to be adopted outside the funds in order to implement the economic and social cohesion objectives set out in the Treaty."
"I should therefore like to ask what kind of actions these are, outside what funds they are adopted, and whether any plans exist to set up new funds to this end?"
"Furthermore, references to trans-national, inter-regional and cross-border cooperation are primarily to be found in the explanatory memorandum of the proposal for a regulation."
"In the later articles, only cross-border cooperation is highlighted."
"I should like to know whether this implies that such cooperation will be restricted, or whether the opportunities for cooperation that have existed to date under INTERREG IIIA will continue to be available."
". In actual fact, you are referring to the third subparagraph of Article 159 of the Treaty that allows for specific measures to be taken outside the funds that are the subject of the first subparagraph of this article, with a view to realising the treaty’s objective of economic and social cohesion."
"It may refer to cross-border cooperation measures, or to other structural measures."
"I am unable to provide you with any further information, since the task of the working group is precisely that of defining the other structural measures that may form the subject of these measures in the third subparagraph of Article 159."
"As the author is not present, Question No 17 lapses."
"In a statement, the European Union has welcomed the satisfactory conduct of the referendum on a new Constitution in Burundi, but at the same time also urged Burundi to implement the remaining stages of the electoral process provided for in the peace accords as soon as possible."
"What specific initiatives have the Council and the Member States already taken to support the electoral process in Burundi and to help maintain lasting stability in the country after the elections as well?"
"The European Union is carefully monitoring and applying the peace process in Burundi."
"In this context, it welcomes the smooth running of the referendum on adopting a new Constitution, which was held in Burundi on 28 February of this year."
"Adopting the Constitution was an essential step on the road to restoring peace and stability in Burundi and in the Great Lakes regions as a whole."
"Throughout the ceasefire negotiations and the three-year transition period, the Union has remained in close contact with all sides in Burundi, whether by means of the presence of Mr Ajello, the European Union’s special envoy, or by means of a number of visits made by successive Presidencies of the European Union."
"Our support was demonstrated by numerous declarations and steps carried out not only in Burundi itself, but also in adjacent states and in South Africa."
"It was, moreover, South Africa that took the initiative on ceasefire negotiations, first under the aegis of President Mandela and then of Vice-President Zuma."
"The European Union has contributed to financing the deployment of African troops in Burundi, before the African Union subsequently took over, and it is lending its support to the current United Nations mission in the country."
"The European Union has pledged EUR 4.4 million to organising elections and, in collaboration with the regional initiative, it is applying pressure with a view to introducing an electoral timetable before the recently extended transition period runs out on 26 August."
"The European Union’s contribution to the elections accounts for a third of the overall budget allocated to them. We are also preparing an observation mission that will be present in Burundi for the legislative elections taking place on 4 July."
"The national indicative programme signed in August 2003 within the framework of the 9th EDF allocates EUR 172 million to Burundi, primarily in the areas of rural development, budgetary assistance and good governance. These are all areas which, if they receive support, should contribute to maintaining long-term stability in the country after the elections have taken place."
"Mr President, I would simply like to thank the Minister for his extremely clear response."
"A fresh attempt is currently being made to reach agreement on a Statute for MEPs."
"The aim is not just to establish an appropriate, universally applicable pay and allowances system, but also to make transparent and cut back a whole range of privileges which MEPs have hitherto enjoyed, privileges which include exorbitant daily allowances, flat-rate secretarial assistance allowances which require no proof to be supplied of costs actually incurred, extremely generous arrangements for the reimbursement of medical expenses from Parliament's budget and free life insurance."
"In connection with this process of restricting privileges and making them transparent, how does the Council intend to exert influence on the European Parliament?"
"Is the Council prepared to make public the full text of the position paper on the Statute for Members it submitted on 26 April 2005 in the form in which it served as the basis for the negotiations?"
"How does the Council intend to prevent the introduction of new privileges through the back door – for example by means of decisions by Parliament's Quaestors – and in what ways can the Council urge or compel Parliament to use the appropriations entered in its budget in a thrifty and efficient manner?"
". The issue of the Members’ Statute that is referred to in the Member’s question, and in particular the principles to be applied to the reimbursement of expenses of Members of the European Parliament is currently the subject of negotiations and discussions taking place between the European Parliament and the Council."
"I am unable to say any more at present since these discussions are still ongoing, and it would therefore be premature to make more detailed comment on the matter today."
"Mr President, I am asking very specific questions, so please answer them."
"What is the objection to making the position paper public?"
"It is positions that I am asking about, after all, and you refer back to the introduction to my question."
"I have to say to the Council that this makes Question Time meaningless."
"What is wrong with the position paper of 26 April 2005?"
"Why can we not see it?"
"It is of quite fundamental relevance to us."
"I would read out my questions to you were it not for the fact that my 30 seconds are up."
"Please give us an answer!"
"We have been told that Coreper discussed this issue today and it will be dealt with in the Legal Services of the Council and Parliament and then adopted at the 23 May Council meeting."
"Can you assure us that when that final decision of the Council is taken, we will have access to full documentation before Parliament has to make its final decision?"
"Can you promise that we will get all the information on this, and can you confirm that timetable?"
"Mr President, I should like to say that I agree with Mr Martin that there are many privileges that we MEPs could do without."
"Where the travel allowance is concerned, I should like in any case to have a view from the Council."
"I can state that we Social Democrats pay back everything apart from the actual travel costs. In my case, that amounted to EUR 6 300 over just six months."
"We could use that money to do much more in the EU."
". Firstly, I must correct Mrs Kauppi, as there has been no meeting of Coreper today;"
"Coreper has therefore not been able to discuss any proposal in respect of the Statute."
"I can simply confirm that a discussion is taking place on a number of aspects of the Statute, primarily focusing, moreover, on the fundamentals of the proposals made by Parliament to the Council nearly two years ago."
"I would point out, incidentally, that it is the responsibility of the European Parliament to lay down the Statute, after indeed receiving the approval of the Council."
"I would add that the Council has a particular interest in seeing this Statute adopted, which is at least as significant as that of your Parliament."
"As soon as an agreement is reached, I believe that the Statute will be able to enter into force, if Parliament so desires."
"As regards all of these matters, they are decisions that must be taken, pursuant to the regulation, by Parliament itself. I can also assure you, Mr Martin, that the Council places much emphasis on transparency in respect of expenses."
"You are not alone; the Council is as insistent on this point as you."
"One of the two sugar-refining companies in Portugal (which receives support from the Commission) has taken preventive action against the Azores sugarbeet company with a view to banning consignments of sugar from the Azores on the grounds that the latter company's traditional consignments should be calculated on the basis of the average for three years (1989, 1990 and 1991) in which that company shipped no consignments."
"The Portuguese legal authorities requested a preliminary ruling from the European Court of Justice, which clarified the matter (C-0282/00). This prompted the Portuguese legal authorities to reject the lawsuit which was being backed by the Commission – a decision which is currently the subject of an appeal."
"The Commission did not comply with the decision and it has tried every possible means in an attempt to have it reversed."
"One such means was an alteration to the conditions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 1600/1992(2), on the basis of which the Court has not so far found in the Commission's favour."
"The Regulation has been amended in such a way that the Azores' traditional consignments are now calculated on the basis of the average for 1989, 1990 and 1991 – which is tantamount to banning them."
"The amendment proposed by the Commission (COM(2004)687 final) to Article 4 of the Regulation is therefore an amendment to a generic rule, the sole purpose of which is to outlaw competition from Azorean sugarbeet."
"Does the Council not consider the amending of general rules in order to achieve specific aims to be unlawful?"
"Does the Council not think that the Commission's use of its power of initiative in order gain through law-making what it lost at the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice constitutes an abuse of power?"
". The issue raised in this question is the subject of the proposal for a regulation presented by the Commission on 24 October 2004, which provides for specific measures in the field of agriculture for the most remote regions of the Union."
"This proposal for a regulation has been discussed in a general manner by one of the working groups of the Council."
"The Luxembourg Presidency is going to convene a new meeting of this group without delay, in order to speed up efforts – with a view to reaching an agreement at Council level - as soon as the Council receives the opinion of the European Parliament on the proposal for a regulation in question."
"As regards the way in which the European Commission exercises its right of initiative laid down in the Treaties, it is not for the Council to express an opinion."
"– Mr President, firstly, I should like to offer you my congratulations and my best wishes, on this, the first time I have taken the floor since you took up your post."
"I should also like, if I may, to thank the Presidency of the Council for its attention in addressing an issue that is no less important for the fact that it concerns an outlying minority of the EU."
"I should like to ask you, Mr President, if the Luxembourg Presidency intends to continue, from now until the final decision, to devote the same amount of care and attention that it has thus far devoted to this issue, and, thus, if this level of commitment is to be kept up."
". I should like to thank you for wishing us success."
"I can assure you that the Luxembourg Presidency attaches particular importance to the problems of the most remote regions and, as it happens, to farming problems in the most remote regions."
"We hope to be able to bring this matter to a successful conclusion, in line with your wishes."
"Question No 21 has been withdrawn."
"As the authors are not present, Question Nos 22 and 23 lapse."
"According to the Council, 'Assisting the Palestinian Authority on the crucial path to assuming responsibility for law and order and improving its civil police and law enforcement capacity is and will remain a priority for the EU'."
"In this context the EU has recently set up the EU Coordinating Office for Palestinian Police Support in Ramallah."
"Will the President-in-Office indicate what will be the exact remit of this 'Office', and indicate what financial means will be made available to allow it to carry out its functions in a meaningful way?"
". The European Union Coordinating Office for Palestinian Police Support is backing the European Union Special Representative to the Middle East Peace Process."
"His remit is to coordinate assistance provided by Member States of the European Union and, if necessary, that given by international donors to the Palestinian Civil Police."
"He is working in collaboration with the Palestinian Authority."
"In so doing, he provides practical advice both to the Palestinian Civil Police and to those in charge of police matters within the Palestinian Authority."
"At the strategic level, he is responsible for maintaining links with other stakeholders and oversees the reform of the police."
"The unit comprises four senior EU police advisers and a local Head of Office."
"The appointment of two additional advisers is ongoing."
"On the basis of a memorandum of understanding between the European Union Special Representative, Marc Otte, and the Department of International Development of the United Kingdom Government, the development and running costs for the first year have been financed by the United Kingdom in the sum of EUR 390 000."
"An additional sum of EUR 220 000 has been granted by the United Kingdom for an aid scheme in support of small investments, which is managed by the European Union Coordinating Office."
"The duties of the European Union Coordinating Office include identifying, proposing and assisting in managing a number of specific bilateral assistance projects, some of which have already been launched."
"These projects aim, in particular, to refurbish the police training centre in Jericho, to guarantee training and provide equipment for maintaining law and order, and to carry out an audit of the communication infrastructure and communications equipment."
"These projects, which are financed and implemented by Member States of the European Union and other donors, form a major part of the significant sum of financial, material and technical assistance granted to the Palestinian Civil Police."
"The appropriate and essential mechanism for their implementation, in addition to the strategic framework, is overseen by the European Union Coordinating Office."
"The salaries and accommodation expenses of the senior police advisers are the responsibility of the Member States that second them and must be considered contributions of a supplementary nature."
"Administrative support is also provided by the Police Unit located in Brussels."
"The format initially adopted for the setting up of the European Union Coordinating Office offers the advantage of being light and flexible from an administrative perspective, which allows the European Union to react quickly and effectively, and in an appropriate context, to the needs of the Palestinian Civil police; needs which are identified in accordance with the policy guidelines provided by the Council and pointed out in the question."
"I wish to thank the President-in-Office for his very comprehensive reply."
"This work is very encouraging."
"Could he indicate whether this will continue, with additional collective responsibility, into the future?"
"This type of cooperation is vital at present."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, my question has to do with the Coordination Office in Ramallah, where one of the main problems is unemployment."
"Do you think it possible that this Coordination Office might also coordinate economic activities involving Europe and the Palestinian state?"
". Firstly, in respect of the security issues, I can simply state that, given the progress that now appears to be taking shape, and in view of the elections that have been held in the Palestinian Territories, the European Union will have to make a more sturdy commitment to assisting in the implementation of all the security provisions which will enable the peace process to continue, and thus achieve the objective of creating a Palestinian State."
"With regard to economic cooperation, a study must be carried out of the extent to which the European Union, through the significant economic assistance it grants to the Palestinian Territories, contributes to bolstering the Office in question."
"You are by now aware that Mr Wolfensohn will represent the World Bank in the Palestinian Territories in terms of coordinating economic assistance measures: we spoke about the matter this morning."
"We will have to work in close collaboration with Mr Wolfensohn’s Office, and we will have to examine whether the European Office offers the appropriate framework to enable this cooperation to actually materialise and to be as effective as possible."
"As the time allotted to Question Time has elapsed, Question Nos 25 to 28 will be answered in writing(3)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"On a point of order, I apologise to the President-in-Office and to you, Mr President, that I was not here for my question."
"I was at another meeting at the Winston Churchill Building and by the time I got back here, the question had lapsed."
"That is noted, Mr Crowley."
"In any event, I reiterate what I said earlier: I deem Question Time to have finished."
"The next item is the presentation by the Commission of the preliminary draft general budget – 2006 financial year."
". Mr President, the Commission would like to present the preliminary draft budget which we adopted on 27 April."
"This is the last budget for this current financial perspective."
"In our draft, we concentrate on the main political goals agreed by the Commission and Parliament, relating to four main policy areas: the relaunched Lisbon Agenda, security and solidarity, enlargement, and external relations."
"I will discuss these four policy areas."
"The core priority of this budget is the relaunched Lisbon Agenda, which aims to strengthen economic growth and create jobs."
"The European budget contributes to this objective with three sets of policies: internal policies, agricultural development and structural policies."
"Concerning internal policies, an increase of 2% is envisaged."
"Contributing directly to the Lisbon goals, research and development will record an increase of 4.7%."
"The common agricultural policy also shows a clear overlap with the goals of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The year 2006 will be the first year when the funds from direct income will be transferred into rural development spending, which will be boosted to 13.6 %."
"The European structural funds together will see an increase of 5% and reach EUR 44.6 billion."
"Their core tasks are to enhance the growth potential of lagging regions and to increase employment opportunities."
"Added up, all these actions contribute to the goals of the Lisbon Strategy and account for at least one third of the budget."
"To come back to the other main objectives of the budget, solidarity and security, the Commission proposal foresees measures to improve social and environmental security, ensure fundamental rights and promote active citizenship, especially for young people."
"The fight against terrorism, improving food and transport safety, and security of energy supply are also among the priority measures, for which the preliminary draft budget proposes an increase of 5%."
"To conclude on internal policies, I would like to stress that the Commission’s proposal leaves enough margin for the budget authorities, and in particular Parliament, to increase the budget for those programmes which it considers necessary."
"But these increases will have to be discussed with the Council."
"The Commission is, of course, ready to help and support this initiative."
"The next priority is to make enlargement a success."
"The further phasing-in of the new Member States is reflected in all the internal headings, with particularly sharp increases in structural – up to 30% – and rural development policies – up to 9%."
"On the administrative side, this phasing-in is also reflected in the request for 700 new posts."
"For candidate countries, the Commission proposes to budget only the amounts that have already been endorsed for the respective pre-accession strategies."
"To support these pre-accession strategies, the Commission is also requesting 100 new external personnel positions."
"In the external relations field, accommodating the new 2006 priorities while at the same time ensuring the continuity of ongoing cooperation programmes is not possible within the predetermined ceiling."
"That is why the Commission proposes recourse to the flexibility instrument for the major part of the reconstruction aid for Asia."
"We would like to emphasise that, for the fifth time in seven years, the ceiling fixed in Berlin will not be sufficient."
"I now turn to the global figures of the 2006 budget."
"The Commission’s proposal refers to amounts of EUR 112.6 billion in payments and EUR 121.3 billion in commitments."
"The respective increases are 6% and 4%."
"That represents 1.02% of the European Union’s GNI in payments and 1.09% of the European Union’s GNI in commitments."
"Bearing in mind the ongoing negotiations on the future financial perspective, I would like to point out that the Commission is asking for what is necessary and sufficient at this stage to finance the Union’s policies in 2006."
"It should be kept in mind that today we are talking about the annual budget."
"This preliminary draft budget for 2006, which already represents 1.02 % of the EU’s GNI in payments, does not take account of the needs of future enlargement to Bulgaria and Romania, or of the complete integration of new Member States, in particular in relation to the agriculture and cohesion policies that have already been decided upon, nor, of course, does it take account of increased investment in growth and jobs, as required under the relaunched Lisbon Agenda."
"I am sure that this is going to be an important year for all of us and I can assure you that the Commission will strive to help the budget authorities to reach a good agreement on the 2006 budget for the Union and its citizens."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my hope is that the comparison that will follow from this evening’s presentation may bring about a favourable outcome."
"I hope that this year will be a positive one; however, in truth, the initial signs are only partially encouraging."
"It is with pleasure that I acknowledge the work of Mrs Grybauskaité, in whose draft budget can be found positive solutions to certain issues that Parliament holds dear, and which appear in its guidelines."
"I am referring to the modulation of agricultural expenditure in support of rural development, to the increase in heading 2 on regional policy, to the rise in spending on young people and on culture, and to the increase in spending on agencies."
"I cannot say the same for heading 4 on external actions and assistance to SMEs."
"Mrs Grybauskaité informed us that direct assistance in the Lisbon Strategy accounts for more than a third of the draft budget."
"We will check it heading by heading, but on first examination it appears to me that the amounts are insufficient."
"Even if that assessment were incorrect, however, the reference to the agreement reached on sustainable development during the Gothenburg European Council is without question unsatisfactory: there can be no competitive growth without sustainable growth."
"The proposal on external actions, moreover, seems disappointing."
"Without doubt, this is an old sore point, a painful wound that is reopened at every budgetary procedure; a more courageous approach, however, would have put the Council ahead of its responsibilities and would have gained the full support of Parliament."
"In general, we were expecting greater impetus, but our stance will, however, be constructive."
"It is not in our interests to list expenditure, but to defend the rights of Parliament and of the European Union."
". Mr President, Commissioner, it would seem that the many Members who are absent consider today’s presentation to be merely a routine procedure."
"Yet this is by no means the case for myself or for the Commissioner, who can even understand me when I speak Polish."
"What is so special about 2006?"
"Firstly, it is the final year of the current Financial Perspective."
"This means that new and expensive tasks have appeared that did not feature in our earlier plans, and as a result funding will be tight, especially under the third and fourth headings."
"We will inevitably have to reach additional agreements with the presidency, which by then will be British."
"Secondly, 2006 is a transitional period towards the new Financial Perspective."
"As such, it presents us with a problem regarding the level of payments, which is nearly EUR 7 billion lower than the ceiling for payments as a percentage of GNI set in the Financial Perspective, and lower than the 2005 level of 1.03%."
"We should give careful thought to the extent to which this will meet our real needs in 2006."
"Although some features of the 2006 budget are familiar from previous years, there are some new priorities."
"These include an attempt to reinvigorate the Lisbon Strategy by means of a new injection of funds."
"According to the Commissioner, funding for this Strategy will increase by 8%, which will mean cuts to other areas of expenditure under the third heading."
"I would add that increased funding cannot be a substitute for the genuine reforms that are the essence of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Another new priority relates to a number of challenges we face in terms of foreign policy."
"Above all, these involve the reconstruction of countries devastated by the tsunami disaster, and the provision of EU support for the awakening of democracy and civil society that is taking place beyond our eastern border."
"There can be no question that this priority will make it necessary to use the flexibility instrument."
"Another priority that has been added by our rapporteur is youth, and this will be the distinguishing feature of Parliament’s budgetary strategy in 2006."
"I have already emphasised the strong links that exist between the negotiations on the annual budget and those on the multi-annual Financial Perspective."
"It is quite clear that it will be easier for us to negotiate the 2006 budget with the British presidency, and that these negotiations will be conducted in a friendlier atmosphere, if the Luxembourg presidency succeeds in concluding negotiations on the multi-annual Financial Perspective."
"I have no idea whether this is a realistic aim, but I believe that it should be one we all share."
"I understand that the physical preliminary draft budget is with committee secretariat, but that other copies will be available later this week."
"The item is closed."
"The next item is the report by Valdis Dombrovskis, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the estimates of revenue and expenditure of Parliament for the financial year 2006 (2005/2012(BUD)) (A6-0106/2005)."
". Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the following priorities have been put forward in the estimates of income and expenditure in the European Parliament’s budget for 2006."
"First, the successful completion of the 2004 round of EU enlargement, by fully integrating representatives from the new EU Member States into the EU institutions, as well as preparations for the 2007 round of EU enlargement, when Romania and Bulgaria will join."
"The current situation is worrying: despite more than a year having already passed since EU enlargement, many permanent posts set aside for the new Member States still remain vacant."
"It is forecast that by the end of 2005 only 78% of the permanent posts allocated to the new Member States will be filled."
"The European Parliament’s Secretary-General will therefore have to issue a report on the reasons for the delay and make proposals for remedying the situation."
"One of the problems to be emphasised in this connection is the excessive red-tape and slow procedures for taking on staff."
"The second priority is effective and highly targeted use of European Parliament budget resources."
"This priority encompasses such matters as: focusing EU institutional expenditure on fundamental tasks; supporting requests for new permanent positions from the budget only after having assessed the possibility of redistributing resources and staff within the framework of the existing budget; supporting new initiatives only after having assessed their impact on the budget and interinstitutional cooperation with a view to economical and effective use of budget resources."
"Of course, the issue of the sum of over 200 million euro per year which is spent on top of everything else in order to provide the European Parliament with a seat in Strasbourg is still a topical one."
"The main problem is the maintenance of two European Parliament buildings in parallel, in Brussels and Strasbourg."
"It must be acknowledged that this matter falls within the jurisdiction of the European Council."
"The third priority is improving EU budget terminology, making it more complete and more transparent in order to show taxpayers more clearly how their resources are used."
"Improvements will be needed to the draft terminology that has been proposed, so that it can better fulfil these criteria."
"In speaking about the European Parliament budget, I would like to stress that a total budget expenditure ceiling will be set according to careful evaluation of justified needs."
"Achieving a ceiling of 20% of total administrative expenditure is not an end in itself."
"The proposal by the European Parliament’s Secretary-General sets a budget for the European Parliament for 2006 of 1.3416 billion euro."
"We welcome the Budget Committee’s support for the rapporteurs’ proposal to reduce this amount by 20 million euro."
"The experience of previous years, when large amounts of unused resources have been reallocated and some money has not even been used at all, demonstrates that we have an opportunity to spend European taxpayers’ money more prudently."
"The final ceiling on expenditure for the European Parliament’s budget will be set at first reading."
"I would like to stress as important aspects of Parliament’s work in 2006, first a better explanation to EU citizens of the European Parliament’s work, placing particular emphasis, in this connection, on the role of the European Parliament’s information offices in the EU Member States, and second, preparations by the European Parliament to play a larger role in the legislative sphere, as provided in the EU Constitutional Treaty."
"Finally, I should like to emphasise that 2006 is the last year of the existing financial perspective."
"In this regard, the question of the amount of payment appropriations from the joint EU 2006 budget is particularly topical."
"It is important that the total amount of 2006 budget commitment and payment appropriations should correspond to those commitments which the EU has entered into, including those connected with EU enlargement."
"I would like to call on the EU Council to reconsider the attitude it adopted in connection with the EU budget for 2006, where it artificially blocked the amount of payment appropriations."
"If we want to see the EU as a reliable partner, it is important that the EU should fulfil its commitments, including the commitments which it entered into in connection with the enlargement of the EU."
"It is important that in this financial perspective the commitments that have been provided for should be correspondingly reflected in the budget for 2006."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Secretary-General, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by extending the warmest of thanks to our rapporteur, Mr Dombrovskis, for having taken on – and continuing to perform – the thankless task of dealing with the House’s budget, for which he can expect more than just praise and rejoicing on the part of his fellow MEPs, and to which he is devoting himself with a great deal of passion."
"So, first of all, a very warm ‘thank you’ for doing that, from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"There is just one issue I want to raise, and it is one that matters a great deal to me. How much money does the European Parliament need?"
"The figure of ‘20% of administration costs’ is being both whispered in the corridors of the House and held up as incontrovertible truth."
"In this year alone, in 2005, Mr Secretary-General, some EUR 50 million will be surplus to requirements, quite simply because we have to keep to this magic figure of 20%, but without having anything to spend it on."
"In 2006, we will be having more of the same thing."
"Even now, in your preliminary draft budget, as adopted by the Bureau, there is reference to EUR 90 million in unused funds."
"I really do wonder what it is doing there."
"Do we really have to take money out of the European public’s pockets and allow it to be added to an over-expanded budget, knowing perfectly well that cannot even spend it?"
"As I see it, that really does raise the question of whether this is the right way to go about things in the long term."
"What I recommend is that, as there is money that we do not need, that – as we can already see – we will not need next year, we should not even include it in the budget!"
"I would have been very glad if Mr Onesta, who has drafted amendments on this topic, were present here today to take responsibility for the proposals he has made."
"One reason, though, why these funds are not going to be used – and not spent on other things either – is that we are well aware that we will need these amounts of money if we get a Statute."
"I really would ask that we draft an austerity budget for this House!"
". Mr President, allow me first of all to express my thanks to the rapporteur for his report."
"Broadly speaking, we are in agreement with the main thrust of his arguments."
"Naturally, we agree with his view that more needs to be done to improve the rationalisation, accountability and disciplinary rigour of the budget."
"An area which seems to be problematic is that of staff recruitment."
"I suppose it would be correct to assume that staff requests were based on justified and realistic needs."
"Consequently, it is very difficult to understand or justify the delays in the selection and recruitment process relating to enlargement."
"Action has to be taken to rectify the situation and to address this pressing issue."
"Having said that, however, I do not agree that an interim, makeshift solution of employing temporary staff should be considered a viable option or alternative."
"Whilst I can appreciate the reasoning behind this argument, I fear that this type of compromise, if accepted, could lead to a malpractice which may feature occasionally in our future budgets."
"The rapporteur has, moreover, put forward for our consideration a reduction in the margin of the contingency reserve."
"In principle, we agree that appropriations should relate to specific activities and we should avoid cancellation of appropriations at the end of the financial year."
"Nevertheless, we have to take into consideration the challenges we face in the near future and the uncertainties which are still evident, relating among others to multilingual services, property investment, the Statute for Members, as well as the adoption of the Statute for Members’ Assistants, which has our full backing and support."
"In view of this, it would be prudent to agree with the amendment proposing that the final decision on this item should be taken at a later stage."
"In fact, I think that the rapporteur did well to postpone the final decision on the gentleman’s agreement relating to the 20% level of heading 5."
"I agree that this benchmark is not tied to an irrefutable and absolute fixed law and we should not be hesitant to challenge and review this agreement if we are convinced that it is necessary."
"However, I do not think that this is the case and it would be inadvisable to do away with these guidelines now."
"Ironically enough, if used effectively, the stability of the 20% guideline could provide some sound budgetary rigour and efficiency."
"Naturally, we support the arguments that to achieve budgetary efficiency we have to take a critical look at all forms of expenditure, make more efficient use of resources and avoid waste and duplication of functions."
"We should continue to focus on our core services and activities, which leads me to another important point."
"We have not as yet, albeit it with some justification, experienced the full impact of the ‘raising the game’ exercise."
"It seems to me that to date only a few objectives have been achieved."
"Given that the necessary structures are in place, we would realistically expect that in the coming budgetary year most of the targets would be met and a reform implemented to eliminate overt and covert bottlenecks."
"On another level, we very much welcome the proposed improvement in the visitors’ service."
"From my very short and limited experience in the European Parliament, I think that the programmes are a practical and direct tool for improving the perception of the EU."
"In addition, they have a multiplier effect, which should not be underestimated."
"I also warmly welcome the proposal to improve the strategy on communication and information."
"Over the years, we have not dealt with this issue adequately."
"Whether real or perceived, we know that there is a barrier between the EU and its citizens."
"More could and should be done on this important aspect."
"If we really want our citizens to feel that the European Parliament is their parliament, and that it represents their aspirations, then an effective information and communication strategy has to be implemented swiftly."
"That should be one of our main priorities."
"If we fail in this, we will have failed in a very real and fundamental key objective."
"Lastly, I congratulate Mr Dombrovskis again, not just for his report but because he as a new Member, coming from a new country, has provided us with an example that shows that this integration process can be productive and efficient."
". Mr President, first of all I want to thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Dombrovskis, on an excellent report."
"The Parliament’s budget is a complex administrative budget demanding a good deal of familiarity with Parliament’s working methods and procedures."
"The rapporteur has succeeded well in this, and this is reflected, for example, in the small number of amendments."
"I wish him every success in the future too."
"The Parliament’s budget is still characterised by the shortcomings caused by enlargement."
"Although the new Member States have been with us for over a year now, a considerable number of the posts created for them are still unfilled."
"Parliament’s administrative departments even estimate that perhaps just under 80% will be filled by the end of the year."
"The situation appears to be especially problematic in the linguistic sector."
"As it is the case that for the European Parliament to function democratically there is a need for multilingualism and good language services, due attention should be paid to the smooth running and effective functioning of the linguistic service."
"The rapporteur quite rightly focuses attention on budget presentation."
"It requires continual development."
"As with the Commission’s budget, the Parliament’s budget needs to be developed in an activity-based direction which clarifies and validates personal accountability."
"The degree of efficiency achieved should be clearly deducible from the presentation."
"In future, we also need to establish various indicators to provide a basis for analysing the action taken."
"It is particularly important to focus attention on how efficiently Parliament itself works. The ‘raising the game’ reform is especially important for all Members of Parliament."
"They have to take decisions on issues which are more complicated than ever."
"For that reason, it will be necessary to give additional support to legislative work."
"The Parliament’s budget has traditionally been kept at a level corresponding to 20% of administrative expenditure."
"As it has been possible to maintain rigour in parliamentary expenditure, particularly as a result of good building policy, there would seem to be a good deal of room for manoeuvre at present: anything up to EUR 90 million."
"Because there is a surplus from last year, it is impossible at this stage to predict what the actual needs will be."
"Accordingly, the final decision on the contingency reserve must be left until the autumn."
"It will be unnecessary to increase the Parliament’s budget unless there are genuine reasons for doing so."
"A 20% limit is not a target we should be aiming at, but a self-imposed ceiling."
"The report before us will provide a good basis for follow-up work."
"Chairman, Madam Commissioner, distinguished House. The most recent opinion poll surveying the attitudes of Slovakia’s citizens to the European Union has given a clear answer."
"A year into the EU accession, 83% of Slovakia’s general public have a positive opinion of that step, and today the Slovak Parliament ratified the draft Constitution for Europe."
"On the other hand, the citizens of Slovakia are becoming extremely sensitive to the problems associated with constraints on the exercise of the MEP mandate, especially of the Members representing the new States."
"These constraints are due to the time-consuming administrative processes within the European Parliament in providing linguistic support, adequate translation capacities and availability of interpretation services in the parliamentary committees and political groups."
"The draft resolution to the European Parliament budget tabled by Mr Dombrovskis – and I am taking this opportunity to thank him for his fine job – aptly responds to this situation."
"It is only regrettable that the original wording of the draft resolution, which described delays in recruiting new staff as unacceptable, has been replaced in the current version by a softer attribute, ‘deplorable’."
"Inadequate linguistic support undermines the principle of equal opportunities and limits the exercise of the MEP mandate, especially of MEPs from the new Member States."
"This essentially implies discrimination, which is contrary to the spirit of a united Europe, a Europe that we were joining as new members, and is genuinely unacceptable."
"It would be undoubtedly deplorable and inappropriate if approval rates vis-à-vis a united Europe were to decline in the new Member States as a result of shortcomings in the administration of the European Parliament rather than due to budgetary restraints."
"Mr President, I would like to concentrate on three issues: the global level of Parliament’s budget, personnel policy, and information policy."
"Concerning the global level of Parliament’s budget, the Secretary-General’s proposal set the level of Parliament’s budget at 20% of heading 5, which is EUR 1 340 million."
"I strongly support the rapporteur’s proposal to reduce the appropriations of the contingency reserve by EUR 30 million and enter in the buildings reserve an amount of EUR 10 million."
"The report also underlines that the level of Parliament’s budget should be determined on the basis of justified needs and reminds us that conciliation appropriations should be avoided."
"The European Parliament’s personnel policy should be improved."
"Improvements should be brought in to speed up recruitment procedures to fill the 750 unoccupied posts within the European Parliament’s administration and to create a truly merit-based promotion system."
"The report also underlines its concern about the accelerated shift of auxiliary to contract staff and requests detailed information on this issue."
"I suggest that we, the European Parliament, should call on the Secretary-General to examine ways to mitigate the effects of the abolition of the status of existing auxiliary agents of the political groups who are awaiting the completion of recruitment procedures."
"We should call on the Secretary-General to present the Bureau with a proposal to modify the internal rules on recruitment adopted by the Bureau on 3 May 2004, to enable political groups to benefit from the same recruitment provisions that apply to Parliament’s administration."
"Last but not least is information policy."
"The rapporteur supports improving the visitors’ service and strengthening the role of external offices."
"It is underlined that in order to reach the citizens, Member States’ communication policy should take account of national differences."
"Finally, I would like to thank Mr Dombrovskis for an excellent report."
"Mr President, this report is a twofold scandal, in that it is a bitter reflection on the majority opinion in this House, and lays bare the tricks with which this House works."
"This report was originally couched in very general terms, but, by way of oral amendments, decisions have been incorporated in it to the effect that, of Parliament’s expected surplus – totalling EUR 90 million for 2006 – EUR 60 million should simply be kept in reserve – where, as we know, all sorts of things can happen to it in the course of the Budget – and a further EUR 10 million be put aside for buildings, even though various people, including the Secretary-General, who is here today, have always said that we do not actually need it for that."
"Instead of simply handing this money back to the European taxpayer, rather than doing something for the reputation of this House and demonstrating that, yes, we have got the message and can manage with less, it has been fraudulently added to the budget by means of amendments, and it is worthy of note that those amendments were oral."
"Why do I describe them as having been added fraudulently?"
"I do so because I, as a full member of the Committee in question and entitled to vote, objected to them, and my objections were simply passed over; there have to date been no replies to the objections I have raised to the Bureau and to the President of this House."
"According to an undated letter, all that was not meant that way."
"That is a matter of dispute."
"I will use all legal means at my disposal."
"Neither this resolution nor this report have come about in a lawful manner, nor may the vote proceed tomorrow."
"For the sake of the European taxpayer, I call upon the few who are present here to vote against this report, and, in particular, against these specific parts of it."
"There will be signed motions to this effect."
"Could you please confirm whether you have received the letter from the President of Parliament in reply to the complaints you raised?"
"If not, I will send an usher around with a copy of it."
"Mr President, at lunchtime today I received, by fax, an undated letter in English, which I presume is what you are referring to."
"Let me add that other Members have, within the space of three days, received replies of immense length, but, despite repeated warnings, this matter has been dragged out."
"I would also add that I have already replied to this letter, firmly in the negative."
"The way this matter is being handled is one I regard as irregular and unlawful."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament’s budget for 2006 ought to reflect a number of the key priorities set out in the Dombrovskis report."
"As an MEP from a new Member State, I should like to alert the House to several practical problems, which are directly related to the fact that certain aspects of the way in which Parliament works have still not been changed following last year’s enlargement."
"My primary concern is that the official languages are still not accorded equal status, even though a year has passed since enlargement, and that interpretation is not available at many committee and delegation meetings into the languages of all those present."
"There are also major delays in distributing documents in Members’ official languages."
"These problems are a direct result of the slow progress made in employing officials from the new Member States within Parliament’s administration, and it is not only interpretation and translations that have been affected."
"The number of people from the new Member States working for Parliament continues to be very low, and we are still a long way from filling all the posts for which funding was earmarked in the budget."
"There is absolutely no justification for these delays, which really are quite substantial."
"According to the Dombrovskis report, it is likely that only 78% of the jobs that have already been created will be filled by the end of this year."
"In my opinion, urgent steps must be taken to rectify this state of affairs, and to ensure that citizens from the new Member States are represented equally within Parliament’s administration."
"I also find it intolerable that European Parliament signs in Parliament’s buildings are still not displayed in all of the EU’s languages."
"My attention was drawn to this by the first group of visitors that came from the Czech Republic back in November 2004, and in spite of the reminders I have sent to the quaestor, nothing has yet been done about it."
"The services offered to visitors to Parliament do however operate relatively smoothly."
"I have already invited two groups of citizens to Strasbourg, and their reactions lead me to believe that such visits are extremely important."
"Nevertheless, we could still improve the way we communicate with the public."
"I regret to say that no publicity materials are available in Czech or in the other languages of the new Member States, and no copies of the European Constitution are available for visitors from the new Member States."
"I believe that something must be done about this in the near future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have risen to speak on Parliament’s budgetary estimates for 2006 and the Dombrovskis report on these estimates."
"The EU draft general budget for 2006 was presented a short while ago to the House, and so I should like to start with three comments on this draft."
"Firstly, as a representative of Poland, which is a new Member State, I am alarmed at the extremely low level of payments provided for in this budget, namely 1.02% of EU GNI."
"It should be noted in this connection that under the current Financial Perspective, the ceiling on payments for 2006 is 1.08% of GNI, or in other words EUR 7 billion more in absolute terms."
"The second point I wish to make is that it is the European Commission that has proposed this level of payments, even though it was only recently that this very same institution advocated average annual payments of 1.14% of GNI in the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective."
"In my opinion, it will not be an easy task to explain to EU citizens how it will be possible to fund all of the EU’s expenditure from a total of EUR 112 billion, with payments expected to reach around EUR 130 billion in 2007."
"Thirdly, I find it puzzling that this budget provides for a significant increase, or more precisely a 6.2% increase, in expenditure on administration, whilst expenditure on external action has dropped by 2%, and expenditure on the pre-accession strategy has decreased by as much as 4% in relation to 2005."
"Following on from my previous point, I should like to move on to the issue of Parliament’s budgetary expenditure in 2006."
"This is expected to amount to 20% of total expenditure on administration, or in other words to EUR 1 342 million."
"This represents an increase of 5.5% in relation to 2005."
"It should be stressed that the main reason for this increase in funding is to ensure that funds are available to complete the EU’s enlargement to include 10 new Member States, and to enable preparations to be made and the necessary funds to be earmarked for Bulgaria and Romania’s accession in January 2007."
"I would take this opportunity to note that only 78% of enlargement-related jobs for which provision was made in the 2004 and 2005 budgets will be filled by the end of 2005, which is extremely alarming."
"In conclusion, I should like to congratulate Mr Dombrovskis on having drafted a comprehensive report on Parliament’s expenditure in 2006."
"It covers not only issues relating to enlargement, but also those relating to the quality and efficiency of Parliament’s work, in particular the work done by Members on documents drafted in their own languages."
"It also details the problems we face in bringing Parliament and the fruits of its labour closer to the citizens."
"Mr President, I want especially to thank Mr Dombrovskis and the others who have had a hand in this report."
"No other parliament in the world – or so I believe – saves the taxpayer a two-figure million sum in one year."
"Such economy with money is indeed praiseworthy."
"We are, as we know, pressing for the adoption of the Statute, which will, while relieving the national budgets of a massive burden, mean additional expenditure for Parliament."
"If we add up the average cost of an official, then this precautionary measure – along with what the Statute is going to give us – is particularly worthy of attention and praise."
"We will, in future, have the task of explaining this Europe of ours far better than it has been."
"We have to make the people more aware of what the European Parliament does."
"One of the main criticisms levelled during the election was that people hear too little about this House’s political activities."
"I wish to call on those who exercise responsibility in it to put far greater effort into information policy than they have been wont to do so far."
". Mr President, I am responding to Mr Martin’s reservations relating to the legal aspects, not to the substance."
"The set of oral amendments he mentioned was submitted the day before voting in the Committee on Budgets to its members and there were no reservations regarding these amendments."
"After voting for several of them, Mr Martin started to raise reservations, but without clarifying on which Rules he was basing his reservations."
"Therefore, I went ahead with the vote, having the unanimous support of the Committee on Budgets."
"That is my clarification."
"Mr President, I wish to make a statement in accordance with Rule 145. What Mr Lewandowski has said is quite inaccurate."
"The practice in this House, both in the plenary and in the committees, is that if an objection is made to an oral amendment proportionate to the quorum – which means one person objecting in a committee, or 37 Members standing up in the House – the amendment cannot proceed to the vote."
"I would point out to the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets that this practice, and this rule, is not dependent on the point in time at which such an oral amendment is moved."
"We all know that the written amendment generally goes into rather more detail."
"The very same thing that I have described we last saw this Monday in the Committee on Budgetary Control, the chairman of which – himself also from a new Member State – kept on asking whether there were any objections to an oral amendment, and it was plain for all to see that there would have been no vote if any objection had been made."
"What is going on here is an attempt at evading responsibility, at avoiding the admission that something has been done in a way that ought not to be possible."
"I insist that, in terms of substance – I have been given this speaking time, I am entitled to it under the Rules of Procedure – I did indeed refer to Rule 150, which precisely ..."
"The Commissioner for the next debate has not arrived."
"Otherwise, I would not have allowed this exchange."
"The President has written to Mr Martin."
"The letter states that the objections that Mr Martin raised were not concerned with linguistic problems, but concerned the substance of each amendment."
"Given that, the President believes that the decision made by the chairman of the committee to proceed with the vote was in line with the Rules of Procedure and past practice."
"Since Mr Martin has indicated that he intends to raise this again tomorrow, I suggest that he follows that procedure."
"I do not want to pursue this now."
"I should like to add, Mr Martin, that I hope I did not hear you accuse the chairman of the committee of misrepresenting what happened."
"You must be very careful about what you say."
"The interpretation I heard suggested that you were suggesting that he was lying."
"You must not say that."
"The Secretary-General has listened with great attention to the interventions of all colleagues."
"I am very grateful to you."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be tomorrow at noon."
"The next item is the Oral Question to the Commission by Jo Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on institutional aspects of the European External Action Service (B6-233/05)."
". Mr President, I think that we as Members of this House have the duty to find out about the exact starting time of debates, and there is no excuse whatsoever for absence."
"We have sufficient means of finding out when we could attend a debate here."
"In addition, I should in all honesty say that since only on a rare occasion does the Commission respond to my pertinent questions, I am not all that interested in the Commission position. That is just by the by."
"I have been both amazed and amused by the nervous tone of the question that the Committee Chairman, Mr-Leinen, has put."
"It betrays the fear of an outspoken advocate of the Constitution that one of this Constitution’s most striking innovations, namely the advent of a European External Affairs Minister, will turn out to be the intergovernmental Trojan horse."
"It appears that this minister and his administrative machinery, the European External Action Service, are now also causing doubts in the minds of those in favour of him, but it is far too late for that."
"In of Friday, 6 May, Henry Kissinger clearly indicated that the creation of one telephone number will not solve the lack of common external policy."
"I can, in fact, recommend that article to you all."
"What matters, after all, is the content of what will be said when the telephone rings."
"Once again, the European Union is making the classic mistake of cushioning the lack of political agreement with purely institutional measures."
"An honest analysis of these institutional measures reveals that the much-praised, but very unfortunate, construction of the double hat is disturbing the institutional balance among the European institutions."
"The advent of a European External Affairs Minister goes against the important maxim that the various institutions operate independently of one another."
"Indeed, paragraph 7 of Article I-26 stipulates that members of the Commission must not receive any instructions from any government, institution or body."
"It appears that this provision does not apply to the Commission’s future Vice-President."
"I would defy all advocates of this new role to refute this."
"This minister, but also the European External Action Service, will be a constant source of interinstitutional tension, and I have not even mentioned the funding of the officials employed in that Service, and relations with national diplomacy, to which we have devoted another fine hearing, ending in many question marks."
"Mr Leinen doing the splits, however, is small beer compared to the athletic acrobatic skills that the future minister and leader of the external service will need to display."
"As a fervent opponent to this Constitutional Treaty, I hope that it will be rejected in France, just as it will be in my own country."
"Should that not happen, there will be a continuing need for close monitoring on our part of this dangerous adventure called the European Union."
". Mr President, I have just come from a public meeting in Lorraine on the European Constitution, at which the majority of people were in favour of our having a European foreign minister and him having an External Action Service under him."
"I am confident that people throughout Europe take the same view of things: Eurobarometer, for example, constantly echoes the popular desire that Europe should speak to the world with a single voice."
"It is for that reason that provision is made for this in the European Constitution."
"A foreign minister would give European values a face and speak up for European interests in the world."
"If he is to perform these tasks, he will, of course, need the External Action Service of which we have spoken."
"His dual role makes the construction rather complex, and it is to this that we must find a solution."
"I believe that we must do so in the spirit of the Constitution – and what is the spirit of the Constitution?"
"It is that the former second pillar, with its rather intergovernmental approach, be integrated into the Community method."
"The whole point of the debates in the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference was to integrate what was the second pillar into a European Union possessing legal personality and intended to act, both internally and externally, as a single entity."
"Article 296 of the Constitution states that the foreign service shall be established through a resolution of the Council, following consultation with Parliament, and with the Commission’s consent."
"That is the point we are addressing today."
"The Commission has a part in shaping the foreign service."
"We, in this House, were concerned that the Council had moved on much further with its work, had started driving in fenceposts and already had definite plans in mind, while the Commission was being too hesitant and taking too reserved an approach to this issue."
"It is for that reason that we have, today, raised the question of how the Commission intends to ensure that the Community method is further developed and guaranteed in the foreign relations sphere, of how – in administrative and financial terms – the service is to be organised, and how Parliament will be able to monitor what it does."
"We should use all available means to prevent a third bureaucracy coming into being alongside the administration of the Commission and the Council; that would be the worst possible thing to happen."
"The question then, of course, arises of whether the foreign service is part of the Council or of the Commission, and this is where we have to consider the existence, even now, in many countries, of delegations that could become EU embassies."
"I think it would be right and proper to make this service – where its organisation and budget are concerned – part of the Commission rather than of the Council."
"That the Council would have a full part to play would nonetheless be guaranteed, for it is quite clear that the service would exist to implement the decisions taken by the Council as a political entity."
"Examples of this kind of duality exist in many countries, including in Germany, where, at certain administrative levels, offices serve both the local authorities and the State."
"Far from being unheard-of, it could work in this case too."
"We also have to decide what the External Action Service is meant to do or refrain from doing."
"I do not believe it would make sense to create a mammoth authority with responsibility for every portfolio from Commissioner Mandelson’s trade to Commissioner Michel’s development policy."
"These must be parcelled out between a traditional foreign service, for which the foreign minister has responsibility, and other Directorates-General and Commissioners with their own remits."
"Having the foreign minister also as a vice-president of the Commission would, of course, allow powers and responsibilities to be concentrated in one pair of hands, and consistency to be established in this area."
"We look forward with eager anticipation to what the Commission has to say to us, hoping that what is done about this important issue will be faithful to the spirit of the Constitution and will make it manifest."
". Mr President, the new arrangements in the field of foreign relations provided for in the Constitutional Treaty present an opportunity for the European Union to strengthen the efficiency and coherence of its external action."
"That is one good reason why the Constitutional Treaty should, hopefully, be ratified."
"In particular, we need to bring together as far as possible the two pillars of the Union's external action: Community external relations and the common foreign and security policy."
"That will increase our impact, strengthen our voice and help us to promote our European values and interests worldwide."
"For this reason, the Commission supports the creation of the double-hatted Union Minister for Foreign Affairs."
"In fact, the Commission proposed this idea to the Convention."
"It is a logical and necessary improvement of the structure created by the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties."
"The future minister, building on his experience as High Representative, will at the same time be a Vice-President of the Commission."
"As a member of the college, he will have access to Community competences and to the tools of the Community method, which will be essential for his tasks."
"It follows that we are strongly in favour of the creation of an effective European External Action Service to enable the Minister/Vice-President to do his job effectively in full respect of Community procedures."
"The Constitution confirms the Commission's important responsibilities in foreign affairs, including its role in external representation of the Union and in the execution of the budget."
"It enhances its role of coordination and coherence in the different areas of external policy, and this will be the special responsibility of the Minister/Vice-President."
"Under the Constitution, as under the present Treaty, the Commission will implement the budget under the scrutiny of Parliament."
"The rights of Parliament will have to be respected, both as budgetary authority for the operational and administrative budget and in its role in multiannual programming."
"President Barroso and High Representative Solana have agreed to work closely together."
"As you know, the future proposal for the establishment of the services will be made by him as minister and decided by the Council after consulting Parliament and obtaining the consent of the Commission."
"The Commission, including the Minister/Vice-President, will seek to preserve and promote the Community method, which has proved its capacity to work and achieve good results in external relations."
"More generally, the Commission will be active and vigilant in safeguarding the institutional balance."
"Member States have started to discuss the issues concerning the establishment of the European External Action Service and are beginning to understand the complex issues involved."
"A process of reflection and comprehension is continuing in capitals, notably on the status of the future service."
"There is a general agreement that it should be of a nature, but there are differing ideas as to what this could mean in practice."
"Let me say a word on the question of the administrative status of the new service in relation to the Commission and Council, which is a key point in the draft resolution of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"The various issues concerned are still under discussion, so it is too early to give a definitive answer."
"The various requirements imposed by the Constitution, for instance regarding the inclusion of officials from the Commission, Council and national diplomatic services, will have to be met."
"The responsibility of the Commission for the execution of the budget and in relation to Community policies should be preserved."
"At the same time, duplication should be avoided."
"Synergies and efficiency should guide the preparations; stronger and more coherent external action should be the guiding principle."
"The next step will be a joint progress report to be submitted by the High Representative and the Commission to the European Council in June."
"In this context, the views of Parliament are important, and I am therefore pleased to participate in your debate today."
"I conclude by repeating that we, in the Commission, share the objective of parliamentarians to safeguard and enhance the Community method, and the role of the Commission and Parliament in this process."
"At the same time, I believe that we share with you the aim of creating new structures that can really contribute to improving the effectiveness, coherence and influence of the Union's policies and actions in the world."
"Naturally, there are still uncertainties on various sides: Parliament, the Commission, the Council Secretariat and Member States all have their concerns."
"But we believe that the chances and opportunities for the Union and its institutions can, in the end, overcome those concerns."
"We should use this opportunity to make progress towards a stronger and more effective European foreign policy."
"Commissioner, we began the debate without you."
"Perhaps in your reply at the end of the debate, you could make some reference to the fact that you were late and explain why that was so."
"Since you are responsible for relations with the European Parliament, this would be helpful."
". Mr President, we have had to endure Mr Belder telling us what he thought, or rather what he did not think, about the Foreign Service."
"That is the masochism we have to suffer in this Parliament, and you, Mr President, are largely responsible for it."
"Having said that, however, I believe that this is a crucial issue and I am therefore delighted that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has taken this initiative."
"When we discussed this issue in the Convention, it caused enormous controversy and my friend and colleague Elmar Brok was one of the people who worked hardest to move in this direction."
"If you were to ask me which of the innovations in the European Constitution was the most significant, I would have no hesitation in saying the Foreign Affairs Minister."
"I believe that the figure of Foreign Affairs Minister, double-hatted, that is to say, appointed by the European Council but Vice-President of the European Commission, has prospered in the end because, for the intergovernmentalists, this is a way to get their hands on the Commission’s money and staff and, for the more Communitarianists, this is a way to have a say in the Union’s foreign policy."
"The way we structure this Minister's fundamental instrument, the Foreign Service, is therefore very important."
"And, Madam Vice-President, you have been extremely reserved."
"What do I mean by that?"
"That you have told us nothing."
"In the document prepared by your services, you have told us that you are negotiating and that we will wait to see what happens."
"Well I would like to tell you that for my group, the Group of the European Peoples’ Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, this is a very important issue and that, given that foreign policy is something for governments rather than for peoples, for princes rather than peoples, as the old saying goes, we in this Parliament want control over the Union’s foreign policy."
"The location of the Foreign Service is therefore a crucial issue."
"We will therefore examine the location for this Service very closely and my Group friends and colleagues will undoubtedly be able to tell you very clearly in their speeches where we want it to be located."
". Mr President, I am approaching the subject from the angle of development cooperation."
"We regard the creation of the European External Action Service, following on from the European Constitution, as being of enormous importance."
"We see the establishment of this service as an important step towards a Europe that speaks with one voice and plays a more effective and coherent role in the world."
"I want to focus on the significance of development cooperation policy as one of the cornerstones, and a major one, on which the EU’s external relations policy is based."
"Two concepts are central in this: independence and coordination."
"With regard to independence, development cooperation is an independent area within the very broad range of external relations."
"This position will be reinforced in the new European Constitution, because development cooperation and humanitarian aid will form independent objectives, with their own legal basis."
"Since these areas of policy are pursued at Community level, the Commission and Parliament have a major role to play in them."
"It is of the utmost importance that this responsibility should remain with both institutions."
"At the same time, though, coordination between the different components of external policy must improve."
"We are in favour of incorporating this service in the Commission’s remit, on the provision that the Council determines how the intergovernmental competences are fleshed out."
"Coordination between the different components is necessary for a coherent policy, which is an explicit requirement in the Constitution. That was, in fact, already the case in the Maastricht Treaty."
"Coherent policy must ensure that achieving the main objectives of development policy (the millennium objectives for development) is not being tripped up by another leg of external policy, such as trade policy or defence policy."
"We should also avoid duplication, for that is a waste of time and money."
"We should therefore join forces, also on the ground."
"Finally, I should like to add that the funding of this service should not be at the expense of existing external policy budgets or achieving the millennium objectives."
"The European External Action Service is an important new concept within European external policy, which we must shape carefully by respecting the Constitution’s provisions and the European Parliament’s rights."
"It is of the utmost importance that the Community model should be respected in this area and that the Commission should be able to maintain its role as executor of the policy."
". Mr President, the setting-up of the External Action Service is extremely important, but it is also a very tricky thing to do successfully."
"Succeed, and we will have achieved functional integration on the ground in third countries, whose greater efficiency will not only project the interests of the Union more effectively across the globe, but will also percolate up to the analysis and planning level in Brussels."
"The Foreign Minister needs a first-class service to fuel him with the resources and intelligence he needs and also to recruit and train a diplomatic service that is properly European."
"I welcome the Commissioner’s cautious statement, but it is quite clear that agreement is far from being achieved inside the Council, especially between the interests of the smaller and larger Member States, and some of the principal problems remain to be resolved."
"The Commission must certainly seek to recruit the trust of the foreign ministries of the Member States, but it also needs to preserve the special prerogatives and experience that it has acquired over decades across the policy spectrum, from development to the environment and, of course, including trade."
"Parliament is clearly nervous that the President of the Commission could be reduced to being the Union’s Minister for the Interior while leaving the complete foreign dimension to the Foreign Minister/Vice-President."
"That would emasculate the Commission and do a great disservice to all concerned."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. The question of the distinguished MEP, Mr Leinen, was asked as the Member States set about ratifying the Constitutional Treaty."
"I am happy that my country, Slovakia, today ratified this Constitutional Treaty, all the more so that I have been involved in drafting it."
"It is in accordance with this Constitutional Treaty that the European Parliament should prepare itself for playing a new strengthened role."
"Until now, the European Parliament has had but a minimal influence in the foreign policy area, which was largely exercised through decision-making powers with regard to the budget."
"We should realise that the European Parliament is the only European institution directly elected by the citizens."
"We should therefore eliminate the democratic deficit and make sure that the European Parliament is directly involved in the decision-making process with regard to foreign policy."
"The European Parliament should not be merely consulted."
"The shaping of the European Union’s position in foreign policy may not be left exclusively under the purview of diplomats."
"The Commission and Council should cooperate with the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the other committees as required."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European External Action Service is a wide-ranging undertaking in administrative terms, and probably the most important structural issue to emerge from the Constitution, at least as regards the shape of the European Union’s future executive activities."
"We really do, I think, have to make a success of this, for it will be decisive in determining how Europe may play its part in the world, and I also believe it would be wrong to approach this issue in a defensive way, by saying that the foreign minister is to do what the Council does today, and then cobbling something together, leaving development and trade with the Commission as before."
"The foreign minister’s task, irrespective of who has responsibility for what, is to determine the substance of external action as a whole, resulting in a natural tendency for everything to come within his remit."
"It follows that a defensive approach on the part of the Commission will not help move things forwards."
"It must instead be proactive; rather than allowing decisions to be taken elsewhere and all except certain subject areas to be outside its competence, it must press for every decision to be taken within the Commission."
"That will be the key issue."
"Mr Dehaene, who will speak shortly, was in charge of the working group on this at the Convention, and so he knows what the Convention wanted; what it wanted was to take the Community method further."
"Much as I am obliged to you, Commissioner, for indicating that you share Parliament’s desire to move the Community method forward, does this mean that we will have a single European external action service that is – organisationally, administratively and in Budget terms, dependent on the Commission?"
"This is a clear and simple question, and no answer has been given to it."
"We therefore ask you to do so, perhaps when revisiting the issue."
"We are willing to support the Commission, and it was MEPs that got the rule that this can be done only with the Commission’s consent accepted by the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I hope that the Commission will be courageous enough to seize this opportunity and to come to this decision for itself."
"No decision can be taken in the face of its opposition, and I hope that you will therefore go further than the general Community method by adopting the position of the declaration Mr Leinen has submitted, according to which the external action service will, in administrative, organisational and budgetary terms, be attached to the Commission, while, of course, faithfully implementing the Council’s decisions on matters in which the Council is competent."
"I believe that the dynamics of administrative development mean that this is the only way forward that is in your interests and ours."
"Perhaps you could make your answers plainer, and then even I might understand them."
"– Mr President, we all agree that the Constitutional Treaty introduces important institutional innovations as far as external relations are concerned."
"We have referred to the creation of the position of Minister for Foreign Affairs and the establishment of the European External Action Service."
"It would be no exaggeration to say that, with these new institutions, the institutional embryo of the future common European Ministry of Foreign Affairs is being created in the European Union."
"I am one of those who believe that the Constitutional Treaty could take bolder steps in the direction of deepening these policies, extending the qualified majority and further strengthening the jurisdiction of the European Parliament in the field of common foreign policy."
"In all events, however, under present circumstances and taking account of the correlations, we have a positive and compelling compromise, which is why I support a vote in favour of the Constitutional Treaty."
"As regards the new institution of the European External Action Service, we must start preparing for it to operate as of now, so that we are ready as soon as – I trust – the Constitutional Treaty enters into force in November."
"There is too little time, if you think that important institutional and organisational matters need to be resolved."
"That is why Jo Leinen's initiative was the right initiative at the right time."
"However, I must point out that the best possible solutions need to be found in order to strengthen the efficacy, consistency, cohesion and visibility of external action."
"One of the basic issues is the reinforcement of the advisory and controlling role and greater involvement on the part of the European Parliament, both now, at the preparatory stage, and once the European Service is up and running."
"That is why I propose that we ask the President of the Commission and Mr Solana to submit a joint progress report to the European Parliament, before presenting it to the European Council in June, and to promise to consult Parliament at all subsequent stages."
"I have a great many doubts and reservations about the setting up of a European External Action Service, and I should like to draw the House’s attention to three I regard as crucial."
"The first relates to the question of whether Community legislation provides a legitimate basis for the European External Action Service."
"The relevant articles of the Treaty on European Union have admittedly been cited, as well as other pieces of legislation, but the main point of reference for the establishment of this Service is the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe."
"It follows from this draft Treaty that the setting up of an EU Diplomatic Service is a simple consequence of conducting a common foreign and security policy and appointing an EU Foreign Affairs Minister, as already mentioned by previous speakers."
"It should be pointed out, however, that the draft Constitutional Treaty has not yet been adopted, and what is more, that there are serious grounds for believing that it will be rejected by the citizens of the Member States."
"The question is therefore whether we should not acknowledge that any discussion of a European External Action Service would be extremely premature at this point in time."
"I would also suggest that this is yet another example of the EU’s arrogant attitude towards the citizens of Europe’s sovereign states."
"Since the EU institutions appear to believe that they have the right to act ahead of time, I would ask whether the Commission has a plan B, in case the Constitutional Treaty is rejected."
"Secondly, the governments of the Member States entered into a commitment when they signed the draft Constitutional Treaty in November 2004, and this commitment has questionable consequences."
"The Member States undertook to refrain from, and I quote: ‘any action that might impede entry into force of the Constitution’."
"Does this automatically mean that the Member States must engage in mindless propaganda that advocates the adoption of this Treaty?"
"Does this not preclude the provision of reliable and objective information on the contents of the Constitution and the effects it may have on the lives of Europe’s nations?"
"Finally, my third concern relates to the planned structure of the European External Action Service, as the latter may entail the creation of a new army of officials with unclear, or even only partial, powers."
"We cannot even be sure that this structure will not involve the same matters being dealt with by the Directorates-General, the External Action Service and the other Commission agencies."
"The end result of this will be a burgeoning of the EU’s bureaucratic machinery, even though the latter already lacks transparency and merely places an undue burden on taxpayers in the Member States."
"What financial impact is the establishment of the European External Action Service expected to have?"
"How will these costs be shared, and who will bear the greatest burden?"
"Furthermore, I should like to ask how many officials currently work in the Commission services responsible for EU external policy, and how many officials are expected to work in the future External Action Service?"
"Mr President, in answering this debate, I should like to invite the Commissioner to focus on two points."
"One follows on from what the last speaker said."
"Since the External Action Service can only have legal status and legitimacy if the Constitution is approved, the Commission and the Council, by working to put the structure, staff and framework of the EAS in place, is surely engaged in blatantly presuming the outcome of the ratification process."
"In this regard, can the Commission tell us how much it is budgeting to spend on these presumptive and pre-emptive moves that it is taking?"
"How much has this speculative venture cost us to date and how much is it likely to cost us in the next 18 months?"
"Secondly, could the Commission spell out for the wider public its vision of how the foreign affairs of Member States will be conducted once the EAS is in place?"
"Specifically, is it correct to conclude that national foreign affairs will then only be able to be conducted in a manner consistent with the common foreign policy and will only be able to operate in a manner that is subservient to the EAS?"
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate you for looking rather enthusiastic, though I have my suspicions that you would much rather be eating asparagus with the rest of the House at this moment."
"I have three general points."
"First of all, I think that this is probably the most important institutional question that we will face within the next four to five years."
"It is really about executive power: it is about who runs foreign policy – the Commission or the Council."
"I am very happy that the Member States have taken the issue forward."
"I am happy that they have provided five for the Antici Group;"
"I am happy that they have been dealt with in the Coreper meetings; and I am also happy that the Commission has had confessionals with the Member States."
"Most of all, I am happy that, in the European Parliament, we have brought the debate and the discussion out into the open."
"The second point I wanted to make is that I think an external relations service for all of us will bring only benefits."
"In many ways, this whole issue has only winners."
"It is about providing us with better consular services; it is about providing us with better reporting; and, in general, it is about providing us with a better common and foreign security policy."
"Because, as we all know, without a functioning civil service on a European level, it cannot work."
"The third point I wanted to make – and this is to reiterate what Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Brok said – is that there are two key issues that we are looking at from this side."
"The first is that, even though the system might be it is very important that two things remain with the Commission: one is the budget and the second is general administration."
"To finish off, I would like to say to the Commission that I hope they stay very firm to the end, because we have to avoid the counter-contamination of issues such as trade and development going over to the intergovernmental and Council side."
"Never underestimate the capacity of the Council Secretariat to pull the rug out from underneath the Commission – they will do it if they get a chance."
"Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, as Mr Brok already pointed out, I should like to give testimony as chairman of the Convention’s external relations working party, whose main concern was to avoid the eventual adoption of a double external policy, one derived both from the Council and the Commission."
"On a positive note, the working party wanted to achieve greater coherence and continuity of policy, as well as to make it possible to deploy all the EU’s resources for common external policy actions."
"Although a majority of the Convention’s members were of the opinion that this could be best achieved via the Community method, we were sensible enough to realise that this is at the moment not feasible."
"That is why this compromise has been worked out between those in favour of an improved status quo and those in favour of communitisation."
"The External Affairs Minister would be President of the Council of Ministers, determining its agenda and, as its spokesperson, guaranteeing the coherence and continuity of policy."
"As Vice-President of the Commission, he would also forge a link with Community policy."
"In addition, with the Commission’s approval, he would be able to use Community funds to back up his policy."
"The working party’s position was that, ideally, he should consult the Commission about his initiatives, and get it to support them, from the very outset."
"We had even proposed that, in the case of a common initiative of the External Affairs Minister and the Commission, the Council should decide by majority."
"To most, that appeared to be a bridge too far, but I would nevertheless claim that the success of the External Affairs Minister and the influence he will be able to exert will largely depend on the way in which he fits in with the Commission and works with it."
"From the very start, the working party realised that the External Affairs Minister’s logistical support was crucial."
"We have always argued in favour of changing the delegations into a unified external representation in the form of EU embassies."
"In Brussels too, the Minister should have a strategic service at his disposal, comprising both Commission and Council officials for the moment and diplomats posted from Member States."
"Although this service will need to work for both the Council of Ministers and the Commission, the working party took the view that, in terms of dynamics, it was best if it was brought within the Commission’s scope, even though it has to be at the loyal service of the External Affairs Minister and the Council of Ministers."
"It appears to me that setting up a new autonomous administration is miles removed from what we wished for."
"We wanted to abolish the pillars, yet a super pillar is being created, in the shape of the new service."
"Similarly, to decommunitise the Commission services also seems to be a step in the wrong direction."
"The Commission must defend its position to the utmost and find a place for this external affairs administration in its services."
"The Commission should not forget that it must be in agreement and has the last say, therefore."
"In the Brok report, we in this House will clearly speak out in favour of these solutions and wholeheartedly support the Commission, but it is up to the Commission to guide the negotiations."
"Mr President, the whole issue of a common Community diplomacy is one about which I and my national party have serious reservations."
"I cannot deny that the huge clout the Commission now wields from its aid activities and its monopoly on external trade brings with it an additional large international political and economic dimension as well."
"Furthermore, given the concomitant development of the CFSP and CESDP, although ostensibly intergovernmental, there has been a rise in the international profile of the EU as an actor on the world stage."
"However, coming from a large country – the UK – with a proud and independent foreign policy, I oppose the proposals in the draft EU Constitution, which sets up for the first time the legal personality of the EU and establishes the post of Foreign Minister, led by the new five-year Council President."
"All of this is designed to create a more coercive and binding common foreign and security policy, threatening full UK policy independence in the field of foreign affairs."
"Clearly, in the EU of 25, there are now many more small countries like Mr Stubb’s home country of Finland facing the prospect of a six-monthly EU presidency if the Constitution does not come to pass."
"For them, it is attractive to see the economies of scale which can come from an EU diplomatic service, including their national staff manning Community delegations."
"There will also be financial savings from the establishment of full-blown EU embassies, in the unlikely event that the Constitution comes to pass, which can replace, in part, small countries’ bilateral missions, if necessary."
"Nevertheless, I sympathise with better and more thorough diplomatic training for Relex staff sent abroad in the Commission delegations."
"I support more formal European Parliament scrutiny in the form of hearings of delegation heads of mission by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on appointment of this Parliament."
"Also, MEPs should enjoy more formalised assistance when on mission – which, it must be said, we normally do."
"However, I have serious worries about granting the EU more trappings of statehood, which the EAS signifies, if it further reduces my country’s ability to conduct its own independent foreign and security policy when it is in our own national interest to do so."
"– Perhaps the most complex, controversial and fascinating aspect of the challenge of constitutionalising Europe is that of external action."
"Through external action, Europe spreads a new style of governance around the world, characterised by the active sharing of democratic values and respect for human rights."
"Consequently, the External Action Service does not only mean administrative and financial streamlining, and a desire to organise."
"The Service now demonstrates that the EU’s foreign policy is a shared project for life, a model of consensus on the broad horizons for the human race that Europe is drawing for itself and for its relations with the world."
"All of which calls for its institutions to work together transversally and for external policy decisions to be rooted in democracy."
"The emerging Constitution illustrates that decisions on common foreign policy are now being made on the basis of criteria that are not exclusively intergovernmental, but rather transversal to the European institutions that process political decisions. Accordingly, the Commission’s action automatically sets off a connection with Parliament."
"If we are to have a coherent Europe, with a clearly defined strategic vision based on multilateralism and on a new system of international law, we need to ensure that the institutions interact in synergy with one another and that there is permanent internal consensus."
"This is the way forward for the new European External Action Service."
"The following questions are thus raised, with regard to the service: What is its organic configuration?"
"How will it handle its enormous multidisciplinarity?"
"How will it set up its chains of authority?"
"How will it prevent tension arising between the Council and the Commission, not to mention the tendency for relations between the two to descend into feudalism?"
"Lastly, how will it set out the chain of responsibility, including the chain of democratic responsibility?"
". Mr President, I thank the few of us who are usually here at the night sitting of the European Parliament."
"It can sometimes be somewhat of a challenge to follow the time planning of the European Parliament."
"I was under the impression that this would start at 10 p.m."
"That is why I was here ten minutes earlier – happily together with Mr Leinen – and I thank you for welcoming me to the debate."
"I have listened with great interest to what parliamentarians have said tonight in this debate because the European External Action Service is a subject that arouses passions."
"It touches on institutional and constitutional issues of fundamental importance; the creation of a Union Minister of Foreign Affairs, who will at the same time be a Vice-President of the Commission, is a key innovation in the institutional architecture of this European Union."
"It brings close together the two pillars in the field of foreign affairs – the Community method and the intergovernmental method."
"This two-hatted Minister will have tasks of different kinds. That is why the creation of this service is such an important and difficult challenge."
"I shall comment briefly on a few issues that were raised."
"To Mr van den Berg, I would say that development policy is and will remain a key component of European Union policies and an important asset for Europe in the world and in the context of the Constitution."
"Development policy is not subordinate to other policies."
"It retains its special status in the frame of the Community method, but all the policies need to be better integrated in a coherent foreign policy concept."
"This will strengthen, not weaken, the effectiveness of the Union’s development policy."
"I can assure Mr Duff that the Commission is not going to be emasculated by the Constitution as regards Community competences."
"The Minister and his services will be bound by Commission procedures and the principles of collegiality, under the guidance of the Commission’s President."
"I entirely agree with Mr Brok that we should not be defensive."
"For the Commission, the new arrangements under the Constitution offer more opportunities than risks."
"It is also important to underline that nothing can be decided against the Commission in this field."
"To Mr Allister and others, I would say that we are not prejudging the ratification of the Constitution."
"We are simply preparing the decision, which can only be taken after the Constitution is ratified and comes into force, and after Parliament has given its opinion."
"On the implications for the budget and for personnel, no plans or estimates or calculations have been made because we are not yet at that detailed stage of planning."
"Parliament, as budgetary authority, will decide on all these figures later on."
"I think those are the principal issues raised, and I can assure you that Parliament’s views will be taken into account as this dossier develops in the coming months."
"In particular, the resolution which the Committee on Constitutional Affairs adopted on Tuesday – which I understand will go to the plenary session in two weeks’ time – is a contribution which must be taken into account, not only by the Commission but by Member States and the Council as well."
"We expect further technical work to continue in the second half of this year, so that decisions of principle can be taken in the course of next year when the ratification of the Constitution is completed."
"Parliament will be formally consulted on the proposal regarding the Minister at an appropriate stage, so tonight’s debate will be followed by others in which Parliament can amplify its views in the light of progress on which the House will be kept informed."
"I shall conclude by repeating that we in the Commission are conscious of the concerns of parliamentarians to safeguard and enhance the Community method and the role of the Commission and Parliament in this process."
"I know this is something that Mr Brok is concerned about."
"We share with you the aim of creating new structures which can really contribute to improving the effectiveness, coherence and influence of the Union’s policies and actions in the world."
"We will check on the information that you were given, Commissioner."
"In my book an attractive woman is always allowed to be late."
"With the exception of one Member who spoke before you arrived, Commissioner, all the Members who spoke in the debate are still present."
"That is unusual."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Wallström for saying that nothing can be decided against the Commission."
"That is what is stated in the draft Constitution."
"I am obliged to her for making this clear once more."
"What is at issue is not whether Parliament’s positions can be taken on board, but the fact that we have asked what the Commission’s negotiating position is, in other words, whether or not it is arguing that this service should be attached to it."
"We would be very interested to know what you think about this."
"Nor is the issue in any way about the involvement of Parliament; on the contrary, we are here today to help the Commission avoid the situation in which it would be an internal market mechanism and the Foreign Minister a powerful figure in his own right, and instead establish that it is the Commission which, administratively speaking, performs the European Union’s role in the world."
"Mr President, perhaps you could supply me with the document that would provide us with a basis in law for ascertaining that Parliament has to nudge the Commission in the right direction."
". Mr President, I just wish to say that it is important to understand that we are not yet at the negotiating stage."
"We are still at the preparatory stage, where we look at all the technical details."
"It would be unfortunate to lock ourselves into negotiating positions now."
"There is too much technical and preparatory work to be done before that."
"As I said earlier, we will keep Parliament informed of our progress."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place in Brussels on Thursday, 26 May."
"The next item is the report by Javier Moreno Sánchez, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the assessment of the Doha Round following the WTO agreement on 1 August 2004 (2004/2138(INI)) (A6-0095/2005)."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Moreno Sánchez on his excellent report, which reflects very well not only on its author but also on this House as a whole."
"I welcome this debate, because I regard Parliament as the Commission's essential partner in the conduct of our trade policies, that is, in particular, the case in advance of the Doha Round, which remains our number one priority."
"Mr Moreno Sánchez has underlined the need to make progress on all the issues in this wide-ranging agenda, with a clear emphasis – which I strongly support – on the objectives of poverty reduction and sustainable development."
"Those were at the heart of the founding charter of this Round, and they remain as important today as they were when they were first articulated."
"Since I took office, I have made every effort to advance the DDA and to keep it on track."
"I want Doha to put trade at the service of development."
"That is what I believe in and stand for, and it is at the heart of the policies I am pursuing."
"However, Europe cannot do this on its own."
"As I said in Geneva on my very first day as Trade Commissioner, the EU cannot be the WTO's sole banker."
"Last summer, Europe had the courage to put its agricultural export subsidies on the negotiating table."
"It is now up to others to show their hand."
"In concrete terms, this Round has to yield improved market access and increased business opportunities all round, not only for developing countries – I expect and want them to be the biggest winners of this Round – but also for our own industry and service providers in Europe."
"That will enable us to build on Europe's strengths in the knowledge economy, for the prosperity and benefit of all."
"Market access in industrial products – NAMA – and services too are key issues in the Round."
"Without progress on these issues, there can be no conclusion to the Round."
"To achieve this, I want to ensure that the more advanced developing countries engage more intensively on non-agricultural issues."
"Thus far, they have pushed hard their case on agriculture, as they are perfectly entitled to do, and as I would expect them to do."
"However, they have shown little willingness to embrace the necessity of real movement on their part on NAMA and on services, even where objective analysis suggests this would be in their own economic interest."
"This has to change."
"We all have to show a willingness to adapt, to change and to accommodate others' interests."
"That is why we have made our move on agriculture."
"The other main industrialised countries now need to follow our example to be more proactive on services and to work on their own agricultural reforms in order to match what we in Europe have put forward."
"Last week, several informal meetings of WTO trade ministers took place in Paris."
"I expressed my very real concern about the slow pace of the present negotiations."
"I called on all members to stop playing their cards so close to their chests and start putting them on the table."
"That goes for all of us, I am not just pointing the finger at others."
"We all need to do that, not Europe alone."
"I also explained our idea of what an ambitious round should amount to."
"It requires parallel progress on all three pillars of the agricultural negotiations – not just export subsidies – including the tariffs and quotas that restrict market access."
"There must be visible efforts by all industrialised countries – not only the EU – to reform their farm policies; and a substantial and real – not just paper – reduction of industrial tariffs by all countries in a position to do this, including the advanced developing countries, always respecting the special circumstances of the weak."
"Offers on services that provide genuine new business opportunities must be tabled and the WTO's rulebook substantially strengthened, be this in regard to trade facilitation, anti-dumping or geographical indications."
"I also renewed my plea for additional efforts to address the specific concerns of the developing countries, and especially – though not exclusively – the poor and vulnerable ones, through special and differential treatment in the Round and by the richer parts of the world substantially stepping up aid for trade."
"You are quite right to identify capacity-building – the essential support we need to give – to enable trade to take place to facilitate that adjustment, so that developing countries, in particular the weaker ones, can genuinely participate in the opportunities for trade that we are advancing through this Round."
"We made progress in Paris."
"We reached agreement on the vital but highly technical issue of the conversion of specific duties – so many euros per bushel of this, so many euros per kilo of that – into their percentage ad valorem equivalents."
"While the core issue of how much and on what basis these tariff equivalents will be reduced remains to be discussed – that will come later – we now have a basis on which we can move forward on agriculture and, as a result, on all other aspects of the DDA."
"On this I should like to acknowledge and pay tribute to the work of Mrs Fischer Boel."
"Agriculture is a tough subject and I respect how she handles it."
"We can also expect progress in relation to industrial tariffs in the months to come."
"Many members also reaffirm their intention to submit improved offers on services by the end of this month."
"We expect intensified discussions among key players between now and the mini-ministerial in China, which will take place on 12 and 13 July."
"Before the summer break, we should see a first approximation of what a possible Hong Kong package could look like."
"If there is any chance of an ambitious outcome in Hong Kong at the end of this year, and thus an ambitious Round, this first approximation, which I hope that we can see in July, should, at the very least, firstly, establish areas of growing convergence amongst WTO members issue by issue."
"It should also provide clarity about our shared level of ambition on the core market access issues – agriculture, NAMA and services; and, finally, identify the key problem areas on which agreement will have to be struck to ensure success at Hong Kong and then complete the Round."
"I am glad that these ideas are contained in the chair's summary of the Paris mini-ministerial."
"You can rest assured that it is in this spirit of high ambition that the Commission will continue to work towards Hong Kong."
"The Commission wholeheartedly agrees with much of the report, but I just wish to pick out two specific points."
"Regarding the special mention of flexibility for developing countries in paragraph 6 of the report, the Commission agrees with the thrust of the point being made."
"We are prepared to grant flexibility to developing countries through special and differential treatment, both for LDCs and other weak and vulnerable countries."
"However, we can do this only if we take the level of development into account and that means differentiating between developing countries issue by issue."
"We cannot simply accept a 'one-size-fits-all'."
"The second point concerns the suggestion of a 'development box' in the agriculture negotiations mentioned in paragraph 9."
"The Commission can agree that the framework can and should protect EU interests."
"However, it is over optimistic to say that: '… the EU will be able to cope with these reductions' in domestic aids that distort trade."
"On market access, the report assumes that very positive treatment granted to sensitive products will allow the EU to protect its market organisations."
"This is certainly what the EU hopes, but difficult concessions on some products will still have to be made, even in the best of circumstances."
"Let me finish there."
"I will listen to what Members of this House have to say and respond at the end, if and when I have an opportunity to do so."
"Again, I thank Mr Moreno Sánchez for his report and this House for the opportunity to debate this very important subject."
". The negotiations at the Doha Development Round are intended to give the economies of the developing countries a shot in the arm and also to give them a genuine place in the world economy."
"They are geared towards a fairer distribution in the world."
"In order to fight world poverty, we agreed on what we termed the millennium objectives for development."
"Sound trading conditions for developing countries can make a significant contribution, and this is what we should be aiming for in Hong Kong."
"There are a number of points I should like to raise, some of which the Commissioner has already mentioned."
"In our trading policy, we should be able to draw more of a distinction between the different developing countries."
"The discrepancies are too great for one uniform framework."
"There are strong and weak, large and small economies."
"There are countries with much and little scope for production and growth."
"We should be able to customise our policy more."
"That is why special and differential treatment of the developing countries should be one of the key items on the agenda in Hong Kong."
"There has been much talk about the consequences of the agreements in Hong Kong will have for the trade concessions that have been made to developing countries, which they fear will be eroded."
"I would ask the Commissioner to inform this House after the negotiations of whether they in fact have been."
"Thirdly, it seems that developing countries are still scarcely able to derive any real benefit from the opportunities that are given to them, and so I wish to highlight the importance of capacity-building and technical assistance."
"We must work hard on those aspects in order to reinforce the countries’ export and trading capacity."
"It is also important, where countries rely on one or two export products, to try to encourage them to diversify."
"I would now like to turn to export subsidies, which were already mentioned by the Commissioner, and whose adverse effects on the local markets are already known."
"We must work on a timeframe to phase out export subsidies as a matter of urgency."
"It is unfortunate that no end date has been stipulated in the text."
"Finally, the European Union has an important task in Hong Kong."
"We all know how the negotiations in Cancún went."
"This should not happen again."
"Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report, which is a sound one, and for the good cooperation."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today’s debate is especially important as we are in an accelerated phase of negotiations in Geneva."
"You have said that last week, in Paris, the Ministerial meeting had progressed."
"For my part, Commissioner, I should like to make four observations."
"Firstly, I am very concerned about the attitude adopted by numerous countries that are not genuinely committed to these negotiations."
"I claim as evidence the complete absence of real progress made in matters other than agriculture."
"The discussions surrounding the access to the market in industrial products and services are at a standstill, as are those concerning the rules."
"We cannot endorse such unbalanced negotiation in which agriculture pays for every other sector, when the European Union has made enormous efforts in this particular sector."
"Secondly, the success of the negotiation round requires a genuine undertaking of responsibility from emerging countries, such as Brazil, India and China, in the negotiations."
"These countries must also open up their markets to other developing countries, as the real driving force of development will lie, in the years to come, in the growth of trade between countries of the south."
"Thirdly, the recent decision of the Appellate Body in respect of sugar reminds us that there is no honesty in negotiations."
"It is therefore crucial to evaluate each point of the negotiations from the perspective of WTO legislation in order to prevent a situation in which the compromise we have accepted is dashed by a decision taken by WTO judges and in all likelihood also penalises the poor countries."
"We must re-examine this issue."
"The fourth and final point – and the most important point – that I should like to impress upon you, Commissioner, is that the negotiators taking decisions today carry a heavy responsibility faced with the future of millions of men and women."
"It is easy to conclude negotiations, but I believe that problems will perhaps only surface in the more distant future, when you will no longer be in charge."
"I have faith in you."
"Yet, above all, do not leave it to your successors to resolve the difficulties."
"From this moment on, before signing or saying yes, let us consider the issue together twice over so that we can pass on an acceptable dossier to your successors."
". – Mr President, the challenge of the Hong Kong Conference lays down the boundaries of the credibility, operational acceptance and dynamism of the WTO."
"In my opinion, there are five structural reasons hampering the negotiations of the Doha Round:"
"First, the inability of leading trade partners to reconcile themselves to ceding internal financial and political independence."
"Secondly, the difficulty in taking decisions, due to the huge increase in numbers in the WTO, accompanied by its increasing heterogeneity."
"Thirdly, the lack of equilibrium in the liberalisation of trade between advanced trade systems."
"Comparatively speaking, the Union has made the greatest concessions, with the result that the European market is the most open market in the world."
"Fourthly, the unwillingness on the part of other international actors also to assume a leading negotiating role."
"Fifthly, the defensive stand of the developing countries towards the new subjects of negotiation."
"The extension and reinforcement of the multilateral regulatory framework of the WTO, which constitutes the EU strategy, is limited by the principle of the specialisation of international organisations."
"This principle also lays down the boundaries of the further development of the WTO both in the global organisation of social policy and in the global organisation of environmental issues."
"Consequently, what needs to be established, in my opinion, is a new global 'umbrella' architecture to house the following pillars:"
"- the WTO, which satisfactorily promotes the efficient distribution of resources;"
"- an international economic organisation for international economic stability;"
"- an international development organisation for the international redistribution of resources and support for the development of poor countries;"
"- an international environmental organisation for the protection and improvement of the global environment and natural resources."
"The terms of the globalised economy dictate new overall regulation of the global economic system on the basis of the social and ecological market economy, regulation which will promote the distribution of resources, stability, international solidarity and environmental and consumer protection."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to raise a couple of points that need to be borne in mind when considering this report, which is, after all, the first to be presented by the Committee this year."
"We will then, in the second half of the year, produce a second one to follow, observe and comment on the Commission’s deliberations and negotiations."
"As far as both the Committee and my group are concerned, the question to which it gives rise is what can be done, firstly to ensure that we are actually being helpful, in a supportive way, in bringing about a positive result in Hong Kong – even though there will be no final conclusion, a positive result would be nice in any case – so that negotiations can then be continued on a sound footing; secondly, also in order to ensure that the great claim we make in the title of ‘development round’ is justified by reality; and, thirdly, to ensure that the European Union’s interests are defended."
"This is of course a very complex business when one bears in mind that the outcome of Cancún was not exactly a very good one, that we have had a very difficult start and that the negotiations are currently looking rather shaky."
"There is also the problem of the countries with emerging economies, which are fighting to be allowed to take up a leading, global role in the world."
"That is very much apparent from the example of China – about which we will have a debate tomorrow – but also from Brazil and, of course, from India."
"All this adds up to a very difficult and complex situation."
"There is another aspect to which we have to give consideration."
"I would ask you, Commissioner, to revisit the subject of how in fact this House, the Committee on International Trade and yourself are to relate to one another in the course of this year."
"If the new treaty were already in place, Parliament would have a very great deal more power, with more direct machinery for consultation."
"Our mechanisms are very good and long-established, but they are all somewhat informal in nature."
"At the same time, though, it is also the case that the public would like to see us more directly involved, with more power and more rights in a process involving negotiations on agriculture and services sectors."
"These are very sensitive areas, debate on which can be very vigorous, and on which there are no ready-made and unambiguous positions, whether in our group, in this House or among the public at large."
"How, then, can we ensure that, in the course of this year, we can organise this critical process involving the Commission, the Committee and Parliament in such a way that the result is fruitful cooperation over and above what we have already established, and including the critical areas I have mentioned?"
"If you actually have to make changes to the negotiations, or changes to your plans – and you can rest assured, Commissioner, that you will have to deal with these things – then how can it be guaranteed that cooperation will be so close that we will really be able to discharge the responsibility placed upon us by the public?"
". Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report, which, I believe, provides an excellent overview of the current state of play in the negotiations following the WTO’s Geneva framework agreement and on the eve of the conference in Hong Kong."
"Clearly, the success of the Doha Development Round is crucial to a further liberalisation of world trade."
"Indeed, after the failure of Cancún, the credibility of the multilateral trading system is at stake."
"While the success of Hong Kong is crucial to further economic growth, it will also be a serious test of the WTO’s legitimacy."
"I share Commissioner Mandelson’s view that the Doha Round should primarily be regarded as about development."
"Trade and development must go hand in hand and greater involvement of the developing countries in the framework of a fair world trade is an essential component in the fight against hunger and poverty in the world."
"It is promising that last week, a compromise was reached about import levies on agricultural products and that with it, an impending failure of the Doha Round was warded off."
"The translation of linear import levies into common percentage-based tariffs, based on the value of the products, is a careful, but nevertheless, important step in the direction of a blanket agreement on trade in agricultural products."
"My group, however, remains convinced that all export subsidies in agriculture must eventually be abolished, for it is, and remains, unacceptable that current EU agricultural policy should cost an average European family approximately EUR 100 extra and should make it harder for the developing countries to escape the poverty trap."
"The World Bank calculated recently that success in this trade round can lead to an increase in worldwide income by EUR 385 billion per annum."
"If Africa can increase its share in world trade from 2 to no more than 3%, its annual income will increase by USD 70 billion."
"That is far more than what it is now receiving in development aid."
"For that reason alone, we cannot afford another failure."
"Mr President, I thank Mr Moreno Sánchez for his work on this issue, but I think it will come as no surprise to him that, unfortunately, our Group cannot support his report as it stands."
"While there are some good parts, highlighting the aims of sustainable development and poverty eradication, these are sadly undermined by the overall direction of the report, which is an uncritical endorsement of deregulated free trade as the principal means of achieving those goals."
"The assumption still seems to be that more trade automatically equals more growth, which automatically equals more poverty reduction, yet the reality on the ground is quite different and, as the recent UNDP Least Developed Countries report makes clear, greater integration of some of the poorest countries into the international trading system has generally not led to poverty reduction amongst the poorest people."
"Another assumption underpinning the report is that, if only the WTO’s critics understood the institution more, then somehow we would mysteriously fall in love with it, or, as the report puts it, ‘the WTO must provide adequate information and explanations to civil society [...] in order to avoid the process of globalisation and the role played by the WTO being widely misunderstood and misrepresented’."
"Quite frankly, this is unhelpful and patronising nonsense."
"Increasingly, large sections of civil society know exactly what the WTO is about, and they know precisely how damaging the process of economic globalisation can be."
"What we need is not a cosmetic public relations exercise but a fundamental, thoroughgoing reform of the institutions and the rules of world trade so that sustainability and equity are genuinely put at their heart."
"Now to some of the detail: our Group has retabled its original amendment on commodity prices."
"Falling commodity prices is one of the single greatest reasons why poorer countries do not get a fairer deal out of world trade."
"As many as 43 developing countries depend on a single commodity for more than 20% of their total export revenues."
"If prices for the 10 most important agricultural commodities exported by developing countries had risen in line with inflation since 1980, those exporters would have received around USD 112 billion more in 2002 than they actually did, which would have been twice the level of official development assistance."
"Frankly, I find it extraordinary that the Committee on International Trade, which prides itself on saying that trade should support poverty eradication, could have rejected an amendment which sought action on stabilising commodity prices."
"I hope that the plenary will support us on that tomorrow."
"We have also tabled an amendment on the Commission mandate."
"It is hard to imagine what justification the Commission can possibly have for working on a mandate that is six years old and which, therefore, fails to reflect any of the important changes that have happened since it was agreed."
"Perhaps Mr Mandelson could tell us what that justification is because, from an institutional perspective, we cannot pretend that, after two out of the last three ministerials ended in collapse, we are dealing with business as usual."
"We cannot ignore the resistance of many countries in the south to embark on more and more new competences for the WTO."
"Now that a new Commission is in office and as the new WTO Ministerial approaches, we should give a sign to the international community that Europe reflects these changes and is able to learn from the mistakes made in both Seattle and Cancún."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am truly astonished to hear in this House that the WTO is the vehicle for improving and promoting fair, inclusive trade."
"How can such an idea be asserted?"
"We only have to look at the tangible results of the rounds of negotiations that have been and are still being held."
"How can we talk about reciprocity between a giant and a dwarf, between David and Goliath?"
"How can we hope for developing countries to be the winners of this round if we do not change our policies?"
"Why do we not enter into the merits of the results?"
"Why is there no mention of how subsidies given to 25 000 cotton growers in the United States have reduced millions of people to starvation in Central Africa?"
"Why is there no mention of how TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) have deprived and continue to deprive 30 million people – the great majority in Africa – of anti-AIDS drugs, and of how the enforcement of TRIPS in India has halved the number of people in the developing world who have access to anti-AIDS drugs?"
"Why is there no mention of the disaster caused by the subsidies for intensive agriculture paid out by Europe and the United States?"
"At the Cancun Ministerial Conference, that disaster united Brazil, India and the countries in the South against Europe and the United States."
"Furthermore, what preparations are we making for the next WTO Ministerial Conference to be held in Hong Kong?"
"The impression is that we will succeed in liberalising the social services and health services, in the name of an economic liberalism that will quite simply end up making those services fee-based – and controlled by large multinationals – in the countries in the South, denying access to a large proportion of the population."
"Why is no mention made of the Economic Partnership Agreements?"
"We have discussed them and we have seen their tragic result in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly held at Bamako."
"Through the appeal for complete liberalisation of trade with countries in the South – particularly Africa – and the abolition of import duties in those countries, such agreements contributed to destroying their economies, denying them the opportunity to autonomously choose their own strategies for a different kind of development."
"In contrast, I believe that we should fight for a reduction in the role of the World Trade Organisation."
"We should fight to ensure that a whole range of goods can come under the management of other agencies, such as United Nations agencies for instance, starting with agricultural and pharmaceutical products."
"For these reasons, our group expresses its entirely negative opinion on the report presented to this House."
". Mr President, despite the failure of the Cancún Conference in September 2003, multilateral trade negotiations in the WTO are still defined by the Doha programme."
"The agreement reached in August 2004 by the General Council of the WTO has managed to relaunch these negotiations, and I welcome this."
"From the outset, let me say that I also welcome the report and I congratulate the rapporteur on his work."
"I am particularly pleased that the proposal on behalf of the Committee on International Trade is a considerable improvement on the original document, notably in relation to how to include developing countries in the world trade system, and the importance to be attached to the liberalisation of certain non-essential services and, importantly, to the solutions being proposed to reduce agricultural protection."
"The compromise amendments adopted in committee have, in my opinion, improved this text."
"This report is a fair analysis which takes due account of European expectations and interests in the context of what is bound to be a difficult round of negotiations."
"In the context of the WTO talks, I am concerned about agriculture and, in particular, about the future of small family farms in my own country, which, let it be said, are the backbone of Irish society."
"There can be no question of changing the European agricultural model or the Luxembourg agreement on CAP reform."
"As far as European farmers are concerned, they have signed up to a reform which I consider to be cast in iron and which remains valid until 2013."
"They have signed up to a reform that was moved to bring the CAP into line with the WTO."
"They have signed up to a deal that involves tremendous upheaval in the sector."
"Our farmers need policy stability in order to plan for the future of their businesses and the livelihood of their families."
"There can be no question of going back on any of those commitments."
"I must say, Commissioner, that I am encouraged by what you have just said in this regard and I believe that you will rigorously defend our interests here."
"Finally, I think that we all agree that the WTO is the best forum in which the rights of all states – rich and poor, developed and developing – can be protected."
"I also believe that multilateralism is the way forward and I am pleased that the Commission has maintained this position."
"I look forward to the Hong Kong Conference in December of this year."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is absolutely vital that we make headway in this round of negotiations, which are about reform and liberalisation."
"The World Bank’s calculations, to which Mr Van Hecke has just referred, indicate that a successful conclusion to the Doha round could increase global incomes by up to EUR 500 billion per annum, and so success at Doha means war on poverty, it means large-scale and effective development aid and hence a chance of prosperity and social justice for everyone in the world."
"It is a chance that we must seize for the sake of the people of Europe and people around the world."
"I would like to take up the issue of public participation, which Mrs Mann and Mrs Lucas have just mentioned."
"We still have a clear recollection of the images from the ‘Battle of Seattle’."
"More and more people see everything that is summed up under the heading of ‘globalisation’ as a danger rather than an opportunity; in Europe, whole generations are completing their schooling without having been taught what underpins the social market economy and world trade, which leaves them open to misinformation and at the mercy of deceitful campaigns."
"We watch our media reporting almost exclusively about the relocation of production, rather than on the creation of new jobs or increased prosperity, both of which we owe to world trade."
"We see this making people more and more insecure, and we see radical groups like ‘Attac’, among others, using the funding they receive from the Community to work against the Community’s interests by misinforming and frightening people."
"I would therefore ask the Commission – through you, Commissioner Mandelson – to devise a scheme whereby, in parallel with the negotiations, a campaign may be pro-actively mounted to win the public over to free and fair world trade, enabling people in Europe and around the world to be persuaded of the benefits of global trade and taking them with us as we go down this right and necessary road."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since its launch, the WTO has been heavily criticised."
"Today, on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of this organisation, we could take stock and ask the following question: do we need the WTO?"
"In the context of the relentless growth of globalisation, we unquestionably have no option but to acknowledge our need for a multilateral organisation."
"To the other question, ‘do we need this organisation the way it is currently run?’, however, my response would be far more cautious."
"Indeed today, the world is still not managing to distribute its wealth in a balanced way."
"Trade has a significant role to play in creating this balance, but its existing rules have until now remained largely indifferent to the demands and needs of a large part of the planet."
"Faced with this observation, I sometimes harbour the naive hope that the Hong Kong Conference, which will take place at the end of the year, will alter this undeniable fact and will, above all, finally fulfil the hopes raised by the launch of the Doha Development Programme."
"Last month, on 10 and 16 April, hundreds of NGOs and associations made their voices heard throughout the world in support of fairer trade."
"I share their opinion that trade based on the sole and simplistic principle of casual will not result in greater distribution of wealth; quite the opposite."
"Our priority must be to reorient international trade in order to equip it with a genuine economic and social justice dimension."
"If we really hope to help the poorer countries to benefit from globalisation, we must re-evaluate all world trade rules in a more equitable manner, by considering the link between trade and sustainable development."
"In my opinion, members of the WTO should therefore include these principles amongst their objectives, but above all they should draw on the outcome of the practices and the rules enacted so that they are then in a position to adapt the policies conducted in a more fair and equitable way."
"I also hope for a transparent WTO, and a credible and legitimate organisation, whose decisions could be upheld by its members and civil society."
"As a European Member of Parliament elected by European citizens, I can only state, and above all regret, the current lack of information of which I have fallen foul, to enable me to satisfactorily carry out my democratic control function."
"Yet more regrettable is that we, as European Members, have no say in the Commission’s negotiation mandate."
"The same applies, however, to our future."
"Whilst I am anxious about the consequences and repercussions of the Directive on services for our European public services, I am easily annoyed when faced with incidences of the liberalisation of services at international level, which could threaten – often public – services linked to citizens’ basic needs in countries that often have the most urgent need of them."
"If we are widely agreed that services linked to healthcare, education, and cultural and audiovisual sectors have exceptional status in the negotiations, we must not, however, forget the services that relate to basic needs such as water and energy, since we cannot call on developing countries to liberalise these services when this would lead to their being dismantled."
"I should like to point out that we made a commitment in New York, in 2000, in support of the eight Millennium Development Objectives."
"These development objectives cannot be dissociated from the Doha Development Programme and the negotiations taking place."
"We cannot make promises one day and then quickly forget them the next."
"The case of the Philippines is one example amongst many others of the harmful effects of liberalising water distribution services."
"In fact, following the liberalisation of this service in 1997, the price of water not only increased by 600%, but the very quality of the water also dropped to such a degree that it today causes illness."
"I am most fearful that, by the year 2015, we will not succeed in halving the percentage of the population that lacks permanent access to water."
"If we cannot have access to water, we cannot live."
"Mr President, we have, tonight, already heard a great deal about fair trade and about trade in a spirit of solidarity."
"The rapporteur wants it to benefit all, and Mr Caspary has calculated for our benefit that EUR 500 billion will make everyone rich and happy."
"Even Commissioner Mandelson gives me the impression that he believes that the abandonment of agricultural production by our own countries would cause an outbreak of prosperity in the countries of the developing world."
"I do not share their idealism."
"Trade neither feeds the hungry nor makes the poor rich, and those who make money out of it are primarily those interest groups who demand free trade out of the desire to profit from it to the exclusion of others."
"To Mr Caspary, who so breezily talks about ‘free and fair trade’, I say that free trade and fair trade may well be mutually contradictory and exclusive."
"We ought to examine more closely whether that is so, and that is what I would like to do."
"Commissioner Mandelson spoke of the need for us to do away with restricted market access, particularly for foodstuffs."
"I would point out to him that the European Union is the world’s biggest importer of foodstuffs, so this is not about market access but about the conditions subject to which the products find their way onto our market."
"If the European Union gives the least developed countries free access to our market, that free market access does not automatically make them rich; one must, on the contrary, consider the conditions applicable to the free access to the market in this instance."
"If they manage to sell their products at our price levels, then they will be able to develop their national economies, but if the multinationals buy from these countries at below the poverty threshold, it will be the ruin of them."
"They bring their goods to our markets at prices that destroy our agriculture."
"The Commissioner spoke of the need for a proactive movement towards the provision of services, but we cannot all cut each other’s hair; on the contrary, we also have to produce something."
"In the agricultural sector, we need services through production."
"The maintenance of cultural landscapes renders a great service to European society, one for which farmers must be paid subject to the terms and conditions obtaining here."
"On the global market, professors, bankers and even Commissioners reach a lower price than agricultural products, and that is why we have to talk about terms and conditions, which means about adjusting them and making them fair."
"It is not a simple matter."
"It is simple to define the word ‘free’ in quantative terms, but to do so in qualitative terms takes some effort."
"Although abolishing export subsidies in one of our major importing sectors was the right thing to do, it would be pure lunacy to abandon our own production and let the world come to us."
"We need a special form of external protection, with the conditions to which production here and our own farmers are subject replicated abroad, and we have to set the conditions, the prices and the levels in such a way that these countries can develop their economies rather than being forced under the poverty line, and without our own farmers going bust."
"Commissioner Mandelson, I hope that we will soon be able to discuss these matters with you at rather greater length and in somewhat greater depth in the Committee on Agriculture."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, what the Commission was mandated to do in 1999 it showed itself incapable of doing, not only at the negotiations in Seattle, but also at those in Cancún."
"I believe this was the right thing to happen; it should have led to the Commission being given a modified mandate, one that focussed not on more deregulation and the opening up of markets, but on organising real fair trade between the various countries of the world, which are developed to greatly differing degrees."
"Fair trade means the introduction of a system in which everybody involved can see that they have a real chance of developing, and are enabled to seize this chance."
"For some countries, that may mean protecting their markets until such time as the regional economy has become sufficiently strong to stand up to foreign competition."
"In other regions, this may mean opening up a market in order to offer other providers export opportunities."
"Rather than exerting even more pressure to bring about the opening up of markets, this would mean reducing the pressure, which has become a permanent feature."
"Agreements such as GATS or NAMA can rob developing countries of the chance to build up their own industrial and service sectors and, at the same time, to develop high environmental and social standards."
"It is the current debate on textile imports, though, that shows us the other side of the coin – what the opening up of markets means to the industrialised nations."
"When talking about the Doha development agenda, the term itself indicates that development has to be on the agenda, and that it must not just be about the opening up of markets."
"Issues such as preventive health care, education, social protection and environmentally-friendly production methods are inseparably part of it."
"This is more important to us than the Singapore issues, even if they appear to have been reduced in number from four to two."
"What matters to us is that trade systems should come into being that make it possible for the prices of coffee, cocoa, textiles, bananas, cotton, sugar, and many, many other products to be kept stable."
"I believe that the right approach is not more competition, but more cooperation."
"Export subsidies for large-scale agri-businesses must be done away with."
"No attempt must be made to deregulate public services, in particular the supply of water."
"Alongside the WTO, the relevant UN institutions – UNCTAD or the ILO, for example – must be given greater weight in development matters."
"The European Union must come to give a different answer to that which it has given hitherto to the developing countries’ calls for the implementation of ‘Mode 4’."
"Demanding of the developing countries that they should open up their markets to goods, services and capital, at the same time as the European Union denies less-qualified workers access to its labour markets, in which there is supposedly freedom of movement, has nothing to do with equal rights."
"If you want world trade, you first have to ensure balanced development, or else what will be promoted by trade will not be progress, but growing disparities between the poor and the rich."
"What I really do want to say to Mr Caspary is that those who regard ‘Attac’ as a radical group have not grasped the idea that it is from the presence of differing views that democracy draws its life!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should also be asking ourselves in what ways Hong Kong and the Doha round can help us achieve the Lisbon objectives."
"Our primary concern is with growth and employment, and we know that the trade unions, the pensioners’ associations and children are all calling for more money in their pockets."
"Growth is essential to our society, and I prefer not to think about the sort of debate we would have in this House if we were to say that we wanted to achieve the opposite of Lisbon."
"It is because we agree on the importance of the Lisbon goals that it is important that the WTO round be well-prepared."
"While there is a need for better organisation within the WTO, we must also ensure that we arrive at Hong Kong with a sound minimum compromise in our pockets, which, last time in Cancún, we failed to do."
"If our experts in Geneva do not manage to work out a minimum compromise, we will again risk failing to achieve credible results."
"What is central to the development agenda is that prosperity must be worked for; it can be shared out only once."
"If you want to have it for the long term, you have to work for it yourself."
"This is where small and medium-sized enterprises need access to markets."
"Loans are needed for firms to be started up, for training and for infrastructure."
"We have to give thought to how, in this round, we can get prosperity in these countries to increase: not by redistributing wealth, but by helping people to help themselves through the traditional structures of family businesses, to which these countries are accustomed."
"We have to enable these, the poorest countries in the world, to get access not only to local and regional markets, but also to global markets, and for that we need the parliamentary dimension."
"What we need, Commissioner, is not more power, but quite simply for the best ideas to compete."
"We in this House are willing to help you get them to do this, and to enter into a dialogue with you in order that we may, together, achieve what is best for Europe."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, we all welcome the positive outcome of the August 2004 agreement which was, to a great extent, the result of Community initiatives."
"We hope that the final outcome will perpetuate this Community effort and initiative."
"Farming ended up being the most important chapter in the negotiations, despite the fact that we had insisted from the outset on balanced attention to all aspects of the Round, with fair results for all sectors and all partners."
"However, the final agreement should not bring into dispute any aspect of the recent reform of the common agricultural policy and should safeguard equivalent commitments for all trading partners."
"The question of access to the agricultural product market and, more importantly, the technical aspects of the method for calculating ad valorem equivalents proved to be the key point in the negotiations."
"The technical commitments should be such that the sustainability of Community products is safeguarded."
"Protection of agricultural indications and the incorporation of non-trade aspects should not only be an objective, but should also constitute a precondition to the final agreement."
"These elements also determine the multi-operational role of European farming."
"Cotton was put forward as a major issue for the promotion of negotiations with less developed countries."
"We hope that additional commitments for this product will also concern other trade partners."
"The report by Javier Moreno Sánchez succeeded in safeguarding the balance in the matter of his proposals for WTO negotiations."
"Commissioner, I would suggest that you follow the rapporteur's 'poetic principle'."
"It maintains that the interim agreement constitutes a step along a road which is not ready made: it is the act of walking that creates it."
"However, the objectives are ready made and the potential for derogations cannot be limitless."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate Moreno Sánchez on his excellent report, which demonstrates vision and the capacity to identify common objectives, in such a broad and complex as the Doha negotiations."
"The purpose of this Round, which has been called the ‘Development Round’ since it began in 2001, is to strengthen the basic principles of the multilateral commercial framework, responding appropriately to the problems of the developing countries."
"Success in the negotiations must allow them to make trade an integral element of their national development policies and, to this end, we must have sufficient flexibility to deal with the precarious situation of the least-developed countries, to recognise the new role of the emerging countries and to tackle the particular impact of liberalisation processes on the vulnerable countries."
"Aware of these problems, the rapporteur rightly raises the need to provide specific technical assistance and to create capacity in the developing countries; the possibility of introducing a development compartment, for the least-developed countries, in the negotiations on agriculture; promotion of South-South trade and the need for the emerging countries to continue to open up their markets to the least-developed countries; and recognition that the principle of special and differentiated treatment should be the backbone, which would involve non-reciprocity in trade rounds, and which must be adaptable to the characteristics of each developing country."
"Its application must make it possible for the International Monetary Fund, and other organisations, to establish a trade integration mechanism intended to compensate for the losses they may suffer as a result of trade liberalisation."
"As rapporteur for the report on the System of Generalised Preferences, I am very pleased with the rapporteur’s support for my proposal that attention be paid to the erosion of tariff preferences that may result from the Round, repeating the request that the Commission produce a special report examining its impact and proposing the measures to be adopted."
"The Moreno Sánchez report makes a magnificent contribution to clearing up reservations and moving forward a Round that satisfies the aspirations of all of its members to make progress."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to thank the rapporteur for the good work and the excellent report and would like to single out three items that I regard as important."
"First of all, transparency, which other Members have already mentioned."
"It is clear that the subject of the negotiations, and – presupposing that negotiations are brought to a successful end, the actual decisions taken will have a considerable impact on a huge number of people."
"That is why it is essential that a democratically elected Parliament such as ours be kept constantly informed in detail about the negotiations and involved in them."
"The Constitution will offer us more scope in this respect, but I would urge you, Commissioner, in the next couple of months and years, to do more than you are strictly speaking required to do in order to involve this House, and, by extension, civil society, in this matter."
"Secondly, world trade must also be fair."
"It should benefit everyone, but the developing countries, in particular."
"One of the key objectives must be to eradicate poverty with a new and customised trade policy."
"For that purpose, we must first of all ensure that those countries are given the necessary technical back-up during the negotiations in order to further develop their negotiating scope, and also to work on capacity-building."
"In addition, the outcome of the negotiations should be what I would refer to as ‘developing-country-friendly’."
"That will require some political courage and also concessions on our part."
"Let me take as an example the gradual phasing out of our export subsidies, for which a clear timeframe should be drafted in my view."
"My third, and last, point concerns the liberalisation of trade in services, which is important and creates great opportunities, but we must clearly define the area."
"After all, there are services which should ideally not be managed by the free market, namely the services of general interest."
"These should remain outside of the negotiations and do not, in my view, only concern education and health care, but also, for example, water, the source of all life, as someone said before."
"Unfortunately, there are now examples in some developing countries of the privatisation of water supplies having had very pernicious effects."
"I therefore hope, Commissioner, that you share this view."
". Mr President, I would like straight away to endorse the sentiments of the last speaker."
"I know exactly the point he is making about water and other essential public services."
"Nothing that will be done in this round, and certainly no part of the policies that the Commission pursues, will infringe or endanger those basic interests and requirements of life."
"I can assure you of that."
"If I can go back to something that Mr Rübig said earlier when he talked about the need for the round to end in a sound minimum compromise, he is right."
"It sounds as if he is looking forward to a round that ends without ambition."
"That is not what he meant."
"To achieve a sound minimum compromise is the hardest thing."
"Standing here responding to this debate tonight, that end looks a long way off."
"But it is coming towards us."
"I say that for two reasons."
"First of all, the negotiating authority and mandate of the United States will not continue indefinitely to sustain the life of this round."
"That is something we need to bear in mind."
"Secondly, there is such a thing as negotiating fatigue."
"I am beginning to see some signs of fatigue creeping in, an impatience, a desire to get to the end in order to move on."
"I think that impatience is healthy."
"I hope it is healthy, and I hope that the sort of negotiating fatigue that we are starting to see will encourage people to show their cards a little bit more, to project to the end game in this round, to see how, when all the parts are fitted together, we will see a round that ends genuinely in wins all round for people, but not least and in particular, for those members of the WTO who are most in need of a successful and ambitious end to this round."
"Bearing in mind some of the contributions that have been made, for example, by Caroline Lucas and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, I respect entirely where you are coming from in the remarks that you make, but I profoundly disagree with you in your rejection of the premises and basic principles of the international trading system."
"I hope you will forgive me when I recall the enormous benefits that the richer and well-off countries have derived from the international trading system."
"Now that we have done so well, now that developed countries are so well off, and now that we in Europe are doing so well after decades of open trading, your approach seems to me simply to want to knock the ladder away for the rest of the world to catch up."
"And I reject that."
"I think it is a rather self-defeating approach to make."
"Of course trade is not some magic wand."
"Of course trade is not the answer to the development needs and requirements of every poor and vulnerable country. But equally, we have to recognise that no country has made itself prosperous or better off by cutting itself off from the rest of the world."
"That is at the heart of your prospectus."
"I agree that access to markets is not enough in itself."
"You have to help poor countries produce products, increasingly higher value-added products, to enable them to trade profitably in the global economy."
"Simply opening your markets is not an end in itself."
"Enabling people to produce and supply into those markets is the crucial point, and was at the heart of Mrs Martens’ remarks at the opening of this debate."
"I strongly agree with her when she identifies preference erosion as such a problem for many single commodity-dependent developing countries."
"It is a very difficult thing and is a huge challenge for us in Europe to deliver effective help and assistance to countries which are highly dependent on single products."
"When we talk about the reform of sugar, raised earlier in the debate, we know that we have a responsibility not only to manage and bring about that reform in the interests of the people we represent, or the people you represent in this Parliament and whose interests I reflect also, but we also have to make sure that the assistance in adjustment and restructuring that we deliver to poorer, less well off developing countries, for whom sugar is absolutely central, not only to their economy, but to the fabric of their society."
"Such commodities are a lifeblood for countries and we know the obligations and responsibilities that we have to such countries."
"Agriculture is without doubt the most complex and challenging subject of negotiation in this round."
"I agree with Mr Daul that we cannot place all the weight of this round on agriculture."
"I think I made that clear in my opening remarks and I certainly accept his view that agriculture must not foot the bill for the all the other sectors."
"I want to ensure that we look to the long term in this round – yes, including after I have ceased being a Commissioner."
"I do not look forward to that as an early prospect, but one day others will take over and you are absolutely right."
"The actions we take now and the negotiations we undertake in this round, have to ensure that there is a sustainable future for European agriculture."
"We must not put that at risk, we must not put it in jeopardy and nothing that I or the Commission do in the course of this round will create such a risk."
"That means, too, that adjustments have to be managed and reform and change embraced; of course, we must."
"Of one thing I am sure: you cannot just leave agriculture to the free market."
"You cannot do that in terms of the security of the food supply, but also the importance and the weight you attach to sustaining rural communities, which are an essential feature and component of our way of life, of European civilisation."
"When we talk about agriculture and the interests of people who live in rural communities, their interests in this round, for me it highlights the importance all the time of explaining, justifying – I think you used the term ‘advertising’ – what we are doing in this round."
"Advertising in the literal sense is what we need to do."
"We have to advertise the huge potential benefits and prize that is in our grasp in the successful and ambitious completion of this round."
"We have to advertise the rationale for our negotiations; they are complex, they are difficult for the ordinary citizen to grasp – heaven knows, I find them difficult to grasp sometimes and I am the Trade Commissioner."
"It should not be taken as a given, as an assumption, that what we do in this round we can simply deliberate on and decide behind closed doors and pass down to a grateful public at the end of the day, as if that is the beginning and end of involving civil society."
"I say this, too, not only because I am very conscious of the sensitivities, fears and anxieties that these negotiations highlight – trade is a very political subject indeed – but because it also highlights the important role of parliamentarians: Members of this Parliament, but not just this Parliament, members of all national parliaments are involved as well."
"That is for two reasons, first of all, parliaments in their work, and the scrutiny offered by parliamentarians, puts pressure on people like me to explain and justify what we are doing."
"I think that is very important."
"But, secondly, what you are doing is representing civil society in a representative and authentic way, in ways that non-governmental organisations do not always do entirely faithfully."
"When you offer that scrutiny and when you offer that representativeness, what you are doing to this process is conferring legitimacy on it."
"Legitimacy that it would not otherwise have if it were simply conducted in secret without any transparent way of working, without any accountability for what we are doing and saying during the course of these negotiations. So I agree with those Members who have emphasised the need for Parliament and parliamentarians to have a role."
"It is true that if we had a constitution, the role and access of Members of this House to this process would be formalised."
"Nonetheless, without the Constitution so far, we still have a very good relationship, we were able to achieve across the range of what we do informally what in time I hope and predict we will be able to cement formally as well."
"When it comes to issues like services – water and other public services – which, in particular excite anxieties amongst the general public, then it is right that the general public, the citizens, are able to see in their democratic forum, in this Parliament, their anxieties and their concerns being properly aired and properly represented."
"That is why I am grateful to those tonight who have raised the issue of services and have done so in such a constructive way."
"I hope that meets the point of those who have emphasised, quite rightly, the role of civil society in this."
"It also touches on, and I fully accept, the future role and performance of the WTO itself, as Mr Papastamkos has raised in his own contribution."
"To those who attack the WTO more sharply, I would say this: I do not know of an international institution, I do not know of a better form of global government that exists in our world today that matches the WTO in its democracy – yes, each Member of the WTO, big or small, powerful or weak, has the same vote and it is one vote."
"And it takes decisions, and it makes findings against the most powerful in the world."
"It is the only international institution, it is the only organ of global governance that I know that can challenge and compromise the sovereignty or the United States and get away with it."
"It is the only organisation I know that can enforce its decisions, arbitrate between countries, however mighty and powerful they may be in the international community."
"I think that is something to celebrate and applaud and it is something, in my view, that we should build on rather than condemn."
"I am sorry I have not responded to all the questions that have been raised."
"But I want to emphasise this point in conclusion: there is a genuine need for us to put development at the heart of this round; it is absolutely central to Doha and its founding values."
"Those who argue, as some have done in their contributions tonight, that the capacity to trade is crucial, I wholeheartedly agree with you. It means overcoming barriers at ports, enabling trade to be facilitated."
"That is why that part of our negotiations, in my opinion, is so important."
"It is about the ability to get goods to market and to meet standards, which is why aid for trade is so important."
"Yes, our SPS standards, those standards that protect the health and safety of European citizens and consumers, are very important and we should uphold them; our citizens – people you represent – would expect us to do so."
"But, equally, we have to understand that for many in developing countries, these standards look like barriers."
"These high standards of health and consumer protection look like protectionism to the outside world."
"They are not, but it places a great obligation on us, not only to maintain the integrity of our standards, but actively to go out and help and deliver assistance to poorer countries to enable them to meet those standards, meet those requirements, rather than simply shrink away from them and in the process, taking their goods and what they offer to our markets with them."
"Let me finish on this point."
"I agree that the common agricultural policy is a bit of a problem in some ways, it is a great necessity, a source of life and livelihood and very important in sustaining our rural communities in very many ways."
"But what are the problems we have in the common agriculture policy?"
"The CAP is really not responsible for the problems of world poverty today."
"Europe offers the most open markets in the world."
"The tendency of some to turn the common agricultural policy into some sort of devil incarnate, as far as developing countries are concerned, is misconceived and misplaced."
"Of course it needs reform, and if I can just make the point about family farms to Mr Ó Neachtain, I want to protect small farmers, too, but let us remember in the context of our discussions about the future of the common agricultural policy – and I think I am right in saying this – that 75% of CAP payments go to farmers with above-average incomes."
"So when we are talking about protecting small farmers and when we are talking about protecting the incomes and livelihoods of some of the less well off people you represent in Parliament, let us also remember that they too need reform of the common agricultural policy."
"Yes, preserving the European model of agriculture, but not preserving the CAP in aspic for all time."
"It can, and should, work even better than it does for the people who are most in need."
"In conclusion, if we can reach broad agreement at Doha, at Hong Kong and after, it will be a huge achievement for the world."
"It will enable us to complete a round that has stretched over the life, not just of one or two, but of three Commissions."
"It is a huge prize, a great prize that is in our grasp."
"That is why, in my view, however taxing and however vexing this round is, we certainly should not give up, and nor will we."
"There is a huge amount to achieve for the most needy and the most deserving in our world, as well as countless millions of our own fellow citizens."
"There is a lot at stake, a lot to play for and we are going to proceed on that basis towards eventual success."
"Mr President, I would like to make a brief statement."
"Commissioner Mandelson misinterprets me in supposing that I do not want to address the poverty that is in the world."
"What is the case is that my group and I are giving some thought as to how we can enable people living in poverty to have a share in our prosperity."
"We also have some clear ideas as to how to go about this."
"I hope that Commissioner Mandelson will join us in entering more deeply into debate and thus be enabled to interpret our thinking better."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
". The next item is the oral question to the Commission on the implementation of WTO rules by China (B6-0230/2005)."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the question that I have the honour to present on behalf of the Committee on International Trade relates to the current state of our commercial relations with China."
"As you know, China’s entry into the WTO in 2001, which Parliament supported, was the result of a laborious negotiation in which the European Union played a very important role."
"There were no precedents for the entry of a commercial partner whose rules were at such variance with the common system."
"We should remember that to join the WTO was an objective actively pursued by China for ten years, to which end it carried out a series of detailed concessions in all sectors, it committed itself to fulfilling all of its obligations and accepted the monitoring of that compliance."
"This has been expressed repeatedly by Chinese leaders, particularly since the policy implemented by Deng Xiaoping."
"So far, the predictions of generalised conflict with China have not come true."
"Nevertheless, recurrent problems arise in fields such as the protection of intellectual property — the fight against forgeries and counterfeits — the transparency of legislation, standardisation and certification, the openness of services, in particular financial services, telecommunications and transport, and numerous non-commercial obstacles, such as the CCC, the notorious China Compulsory Certification, which is almost impossible to obtain."
"The essential issue, however, is that China has to deal with a significant contradiction: to open up its markets and to protect its own industry, within a context in which rules such as the application of the ILO conventions on child labour, the establishment of free trade unions, etc. do not fall within the context of the WTO, but are important, as is environmental protection, and in this regard I would like to point out that China signed the Kyoto protocol two years ago now."
"We are currently in a situation in which it appears that China is operating extremely close to the limits of what may be acceptable."
"And the case of textiles, which other Members have mentioned, is an example of this, since it is affecting many countries and not just the European Union."
"I am not advocating that we call into question the decision taken on 1 January on total liberalisation, but rather that we examine, for example, the possible significance of a policy of dumping in terms of invading markets, how energy can be subsidised, how funding policy is being applied and whether there is privileged funding, etc."
"These are important issues."
"Another specific and very significant example is the recording industry, which is facing a very dramatic situation in Europe."
"At the moment, the majority of pirating, almost 70 %, takes place in China and much of it is taking place on the Internet."
"Furthermore, it is almost impossible to receive royalties, because structures do not even exist."
"In any event, I would like to point out that the European Union has supported China's integration into the world economy."
"This is a challenge for everybody that requires a process of economic and social reform on an unprecedented scale."
"China still has ten years to complete its transition to a market economy."
"In any event, it is the case that China has already moved from a centrally-planned economy to an economy which appears to be governed by Manchesterian capitalism led by Communist mandarins."
"It is for the Chinese to take charge of their own development, but it is important that we have control involving the greatest possible transparency and knowledge."
"In summary, Mr President, we have reached the final phase of the Doha negotiations, which must be concluded in Chinese territory, in fact, with such decisive issues as the openness of its economy, the exchange rates of its currency and stability in a part of the world in which a very alarming arms race is taking place."
"Furthermore, China plays an important role in the Club of Twenty, which brings together some of the great tenors of the new world stage, and because of its history, because of its weight and also because the European Union has advocated that China should be incorporated into world trade, I believe that it makes sense at this point to ask these questions, taking the view that we are all in the same situation regardless of our specific characteristics, but that we must respect each other in order to survive together."
". Mr President, I would like to thank you for this opportunity to respond to this debate."
"It is important."
"It raises some very serious issues for us, and I am very glad this initiative has been taken."
"I am also very grateful to the distinguished chairman of the Committee on International Trade for making his points in such a balanced and moderate, but no less serious way."
"I agree that we have a great challenge on our hands to bring about the progressive integration of China to the global economy and to the international trading system."
"We also have a responsibility to those whom you represent, and to whom others of us are accountable and are answerable, to smooth these changes in the best way we possibly can."
"It is true that in one sense China is testing the limits of what is acceptable, as the honourable Member said."
"Another way of putting it, however, is that China is presenting a competitive challenge to us in Europe to which we need to adjust."
"Now many have."
"In some cases though that adjustment remains to be made and we have to assist people in doing so."
"My broad view is that China’s renaissance in recent years brings with it many implications for the European Union and it is essential that we equip ourselves properly to deal with these challenges."
"I believe that China’s astonishing economic growth will be good, not only for China but also for Europe and for the rest of the world."
"That makes it all the more important that we build the sort of dynamic relationship with China that is based on partnership, cooperation and respect, not just for each other, but for a rules-based multilateral economic system."
"It is against that backcloth that I want to address two sets of issues this morning: first of all, the appropriate response we need to make to textiles imports from China and, secondly, what we need to do to continue to push China on its WTO implementation record and in particular its record of enforcement of intellectual property rights."
"I shall first address the issue of textiles."
"The level of textiles imports and the dramatic increase that we have seen since the beginning of this year, when textile quotas were finally removed, has become a very sensitive topic in many of our Member States."
"There are many who have serious concerns and anxieties."
"It is clear why and I understand those anxieties."
"I am confident that our response is both appropriate and proportionate, but also legally defensible."
"We have to satisfy both those requirements, basing our response on facts and data."
"We need to act with a degree of caution, but also determination."
"The Commission guidelines on the use of a safeguard mechanism were intended to equip us to respond effectively to any unreasonable surge in imports from China."
"As I am sure you know, the Commission has now launched investigations into nine categories of Chinese textile exports to the EU based on import statistics for the first quarter of this year."
"In all these categories, import volumes for Chinese textiles have now risen above the ‘alert levels’ defined by the Commission."
"I always said that I would act on the basis of the relevant data and I am doing so now."
"Now that the alert mechanism has been activated, I have set up an experienced task force to conduct a full and rapid investigation into these named categories."
"It will reach its conclusions within a maximum of 60 days."
"This investigation will determine whether market disruption in Europe and elsewhere really has occurred."
"We will also have to consider the actual damage to producer interests, set against the consumer benefits involved."
"If it proves necessary and justified, I will use the safeguard powers at our disposal."
"A number of other categories appear to give cause for concern, but after careful consideration I have decided that further analysis of the data is required."
"This is being undertaken."
"In addition, there have been requests for the application of the urgency procedure foreseen by the guidelines."
"This would mean going directly to formal consultations with China under the WTO without an investigation, if there is evidence that irreparable damage will be caused to EU industry in the absence of such a course of action."
"My services are currently analysing these requests."
"In parallel, I have actively engaged with the Chinese authorities to give them advance warning wherever possible, to urge them to provide concrete evidence that the measures they have put in place are having an effect, and to explore whether they cannot do more and indeed to urge them to do so."
"I have launched informal consultations with China in an attempt to find a sustainable solution for all parties."
"This was high on my agenda last week in Paris when I met with the Chinese Trade Minister Bo Xilai."
"My message to Minister Bo was that to avoid the EU having to take action, China needs to give a stronger response to curb its export growth in the short term."
"I believe that my message was received loud and clear."
"I have noted the statements made by the Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao yesterday in Beijing and I would like to welcome the fact that China now understands the acute concerns of certain Member States, as Wen Jiabao acknowledged yesterday in Beijing, and that China prefers, as he said, a solution based on dialogue and cooperation."
"I also welcome the fact that China considers the need to resolve this issue as amongst China’s primary interests in relation to the EU."
"I noted with particular interest the statement by Wen Jiabao that, in addition to the measures already taken to curb textiles export growth, China will take even stronger measures in the near future."
"I welcome this, but I also believe that the effects need to be felt quickly if they are to stay our hand in any action that we might consider taking."
"It is imperative that China explain in detail, and quickly, the type of additional measures it intends to adopt and what consequences these will have on future trade flows."
"I am looking forward to receiving such information as a matter of great urgency."
"Failing to receive such concrete information quickly would narrow the options available to the EU to resolve this issue and could leave me with no alternative other than to act under the WTO."
"I have a team of officials in Beijing this week."
"They are meeting Chinese counterparts as we speak now, to follow up on my discussions with Minister Bo last week and on yesterday’s statements by Prime Minister Wen Jiabao."
"Let me turn now to other matters concerning WTO implementation."
"This is important because the WTO agreement is the lynchpin for the development of our trade relations with China."
"China has made substantial progress in implementing its WTO commitments, as set out in its accession agreement, but some issues still raise concerns."
"I am addressing these in both a bilateral and multilateral context."
"Discussions have met with considerable success in a number of areas, in particular on coke, the construction and automobile sectors, and sanitary and phytosanitary measures."
"However, concerns still remain in the automobile sector, in services sectors such as banking, and in telecommunications."
"I raised these and pursued them when I was in Beijing earlier this year and I will continue to do so."
"I accept that a particular area of concern is the need to ensure an adequate and efficient level of protection in China of intellectual property rights."
"China has shown willing, but the continuing difficulties encountered by European industry in terms of counterfeiting and piracy have made clear that more work is needed."
"I am addressing this issue on two fronts, using a combination of political pressure and cooperation, both bilaterally and on a multilateral level."
"I am determined to give practical answers to industry’s concerns."
"We took an important step forward when the Chinese recently agreed to my proposal to set up an Intellectual Property Working Group."
"The intention here is to address problems in a systemic way and on a sectoral basis."
"It will include experts from business who know where the delivery problems in China’s laws exist."
"But IPR is a worldwide problem, and it therefore requires consideration on a global level."
"Within the WTO, the EU, as well as the US and Japan, used the 2004 Transitional Review Mechanism to challenge China on its implementation record of its obligations in respect of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, otherwise known as TRIPs."
"The answers given by China demonstrate its commitment to the fight against counterfeiting and piracy, but further efforts are obviously needed and I am committed to helping China make those further efforts."
"The EU has also suggested that the Review Mechanism could be usefully complemented by a multilateral discussion within the TRIPs Council, and I intend to follow this up."
"But I also believe that continuing to share our expertise by providing technical assistance on intellectual property is an important element of our work with China."
"We have recently concluded an EC-China Agreement on customs cooperation."
"Another example of assistance is EU financing of training on trademarks for judges."
"These are just two instances of the sort of cooperation that will help China build a sound and coherent enforcement system."
"Finally, I would encourage European industry to make use of all available tools in the EU and in China to protect its own rights and put the system to the test."
"In conclusion, the level of cooperation and partnership that China and the EU are demonstrating in these areas are the building blocks for a dynamic and more effective relationship between us."
"Nobody should underestimate the huge potential gains and benefits for us in Europe of such a relationship growing and being soundly based."
"There are obviously going to be challenges ahead, and I will ensure that the EU responds in a timely and effective manner."
"But there will also be great opportunities for European industry and producers to supply into that rapidly expanding Chinese market."
"If we can work together to ensure that a rules-based economic system is respected and strengthened in the DDA, then the rapid economic growth in China will benefit the EU and the rest of the world."
"That is why in responding to the question originally put, I say again that we have to combine our short-term management of the problems that are thrown up by China’s expansion with a clear-sighted, longer-term perspective of the opportunities that China’s growth offers Europe."
". MrPresident, ladies and gentlemen, China has, over recent years, become a major player in the global market, and so it has certain obligations to fulfil and bears a considerable responsibility."
"This being so, I would like to put a number of questions to the Commission."
"Firstly, last year saw 9 000 court cases in China involving product piracy."
"That is a good start."
"What is the Commission going to do to support the Chinese in their efforts to this end?"
"Secondly, although sentences are handed down, they are often not carried out."
"How will the Commission support the Chinese authorities in enforcing the sentences passed on product pirates?"
"Thirdly, products exported from China are often in breach of patents and copyright."
"During Question Time on 8 March, Commissioner Kovács assured me that the EU would offer to send customs officers to China at the EU’s own expense to help their Chinese counterparts in their work."
"Has this offer in fact been made to the Chinese, and how have they responded to it?"
"Fourthly, a steam iron made in China, which bore the CE label but did not meet the relevant standards, recently caused the deaths of two people in Greece."
"What will the Commission do to get the Member States, without delay, to put in place effective market controls preventing such products from being put on sale and compelling the Chinese manufacturers to comply with standards and patents?"
"Fifthly, there are to this day in China many obstacles to European firms."
"What does the Commission propose to do in order to effectively remove these barriers to trade, most of which do not take the form of tariffs?"
"Sixthly, modern weapons contain the most modern of technologies."
"What adverse effects on businesses and jobs in Europe does the Commission anticipate if the embargo on weapons – and on the transfer of associated technologies – is lifted?"
"Seventhly, what is the Commission actually doing to induce China to allow its currency’s exchange rate to find its own level?"
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following on from what Mr Caspary has just said, there are a number of points I would like to address."
"I very much welcome the safeguards that have been put in place, and I hope that you can obtain reliable data, including reliable data from the individual Member States."
"As I see it, Romania is one example of how it is not that simple to get your hands on reliable data."
"I hope that you will then not delay in bringing that data to the Committee on International Trade, so that we who sit on that Committee can discuss it with you and advise you on it."
"I also rejoiced to hear that you had, in your speech in Singapore on 29 April, revived an old initiative of this House, that being the demand for closer cooperation between Europe and Asia."
"This House did once advocate a free trade area and urged that it should at least begin with one state."
"While we now have a very strong presence in Latin America, there are other regions, Asia in particular, that we have been positively culpable in neglecting."
"I agree that, where China is concerned, we are paying a bitter price for this."
"Our major concern – of which textiles might be described as merely a ‘super-example’ – is the unfair competition that, for various reasons, exists in China."
"Competition may be deliberately unfair, or the unfairness may very well be involuntary."
"What do you propose to do about it?"
"What can actually be done to ensure that enquiries take a good hard look at such things as disguised subsidies?"
"You also mentioned intellectual property rights, but there is a good deal more to it than that."
"There is a particular case that you have been considering for a very long time."
"I would be grateful if you were to say something about it."
"This case, moreover, has to do with non-ferrous metals, and this House has for some considerable time been calling for an enquiry into disguised subsidies for these."
"In China, in particular, reimbursement of VAT is used to support the local recycling industry."
"What progress has been made with enquiries into this?"
"Might I ask you to say something about this?"
"Quite apart from all that, it is a good thing that you have done something about investment."
"We are right behind you in that respect and wish you plenty of success."
". Mr President, too little too late, that is how one can describe Commissioner Mandelson’s recent announcement that use will be made of the textile-specific safeguard clause which permits Europe to limit imports until 2008."
"That decision was taken about a month after the United States had swung into action."
"Time and again, the Commissioner has said that trade with China should be seen as a challenge rather than a threat."
"Indeed it should be, and I think the European textile industry is prepared to do so, provided, though, that the trading game is played correctly on both sides."
"In countries such as China, unfair trade practices, including export subsidies, dumping prices, direct and indirect government support, free capital and illegal imitations and piracy, are endemic."
"This aggressive trade policy is making the European textile and clothing sector crack at the seams."
"And yet, Commissioner, this sector is still an extremely important industrial sector, with a total turnover of EUR 200 billion spread across 177 000 businesses that, post-enlargement, employ 2.7 million textile workers, equivalent to 7% of the total industrial workforce."
"In fact, not only Europe, but also a large number of developing countries, are at risk of collapsing under China’s aggressive export policy."
"At the end of last year, this House urged us to pursue a more assertive trade policy in respect of China."
"That import figures would be alarming could already be deduced from the import products without quota."
"I hope that the measures now announced by the Commission will not prove to be too late in the day, and, above all, that they are merely a first step towards protecting our industry, in a manner acceptable to the WTO against unfair competition, from wherever that may come."
"Mr President, clearly there are very real concerns about the impact of China on other players in the international trading system."
"We have already heard about the impact of the surge in textile imports on the EU and the devastation some EU producers face as a result."
"But let us not forget the impact on other developing countries."
"China’s deflationary pressure is already driving down wages right across the developing world and pushing global suppliers to reduce their workers’ rights and conditions in a bid to remain competitive at all costs."
"In the Philippines, for example, the government has ruled that its law on the minimum wage would not longer apply to the clothing industry."
"In Bangladesh, the government recently announced that it would increase the number of authorised overtime hours and reduce the restrictions on women’s night work."
"Chinese workers themselves do not necessarily have much to gain either, facing seven-day working weeks, very low wages, appalling health and safety hazards and no trade unions."
"We are looking here at a downward spiral of social and environmental standards; certainly minimum international standards might help stem that downward spiral."
"It is most important for this debate not just to focus on this or that sector, textiles today or footwear or machine components tomorrow."
"What we are looking at here is a systemic problem."
"It is a challenge posed by a country that has entered the international trading system not just with a comparative advantage but with potentially an almost absolute advantage in just about everything."
"It is complacent and patronising to assume that Europe and the West can keep a monopoly on innovation and high-tech while China simply does the manufacturing."
"Chinese graduates are also moving up the value-added chain."
"Very soon we may need to face the possibility that there could be very little that Europe could produce that China cannot produce more efficiently."
"The old assumption that while the EU and the industrialised countries keep the leading edge in knowledge-intensive industries while developing nations focus on lower-skill sectors, is now open to huge debate."
"The response to the challenge posed by China needs to include a thorough reassessment of the assumptions that have underpinned international trade theory up until now."
"We need to look again at the old ideas dating from David Ricardo onwards that comparative advantage always works in everybody’s best interests."
"I hope the Commission will act swiftly on textiles."
"I would also like to hear what the Commissioner plans to do about these longer-term systemic issues."
"We need a more balanced view than this oral question suggests."
"We should be looking at some of the impacts of liberalisation on China itself, because there is ample proof to suggest that many of the poorest people in China face significant losses themselves, particularly in the agricultural sector, as a result of China’s accession to the WTO."
"So let us have a more balanced view; a view that looks into the future as well."
". – We are not following in the slipstream of those who seek to shirk their responsibilities with regard to the objectives of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) talks and to the manner in which they conduct those talks, and who, having attempted to impose the blind and brutal liberalisation of world trade, with its extremely damaging economic and social consequences, are now trying to pass the buck and blame China for all of the world’s evils."
"Their discourse seeks to disguise the fact that it is the large economic groups who stand to gain the most from the current liberalisation of world trade."
"They are the ones who relocate their production in search of higher profits; they are the ones who, owing to their domination of distribution, come away with the lion’s share."
"The textiles and clothing sector is an example of this alarming situation."
"China was not to blame for the way in which the WTO talks on the textiles and clothing sector were conducted; the Commission and the Council were."
"China is not responsible for the over-valuation of the euro, which exacerbates the problems and hampers the competitiveness of the textiles and clothing made in EU countries."
"It is the Council and the Commission, not China, that have thus far failed to activate the safeguard clause, in spite of the appalling situation that the EU’s textiles and clothing sector is currently enduring, particularly in countries such as Portugal."
"Instead, they delay this crucial decision."
"I therefore ask the following questions: When will safeguard clauses be activated?"
"When will there be a revision of the Commission’s mandate for WTO talks?"
"What we must do is suspend and reverse the current policies on trade liberalisation."
"What we must do is ensure a level playing field for trade, by introducing a system that is geared towards genuinely and sustainably developing each country’s potential, a system that is not based on dominance and dependency, a system that is thus geared towards urgently improving the standard of living for people across the world and towards guaranteeing their rights."
". Mr President, the problems of the global textiles sector divide Europe into a north and a south camp."
"To put it succinctly, it pits the advent of cheaper textile imports against the maintenance of our own textile sector."
"Although I understand that Commissioner Mandelson has to steer a middle course between those in favour and against measures against China, I think it is far too late to launch an investigation now."
"The Commission should have utilised the past few years to develop a position on an unencumbered global textiles market and a policy towards that end."
"I think that discussion on the temporary introduction of protective measures should focus on the period after 2008 if this House is not to end up having exactly the same debate in three years’ time."
"The period until 2008 should be used to start a dialogue with the Chinese authorities –a dialogue with the dual purpose of underlining both the importance of a stable global textiles market and China’s WTO obligations."
"After all, the WTO grants China rights, but also requires that it tackle, for example, restricted market access in the services sectors in banking and telecommunications."
"I wish the Commissioner much perseverance in his negotiations with his Chinese opposite numbers."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the case under examination very closely affects the existence of thousands of companies and the employment of millions of European citizens, including 570 000 Italians in the textile industry alone."
"On top of that, there is the footwear industry and other sectors all in line to be hit by the Chinese tsunami effect."
"The end of import quotas owing to the expiry of the Multifibre Agreement, the entry into force of the EU-China bilateral agreement of 2000 and the counterfeiting of the EC trademark were the subject of three questions that I addressed to the Council and the Commission on 6 January of this year."
"Concerned by the consequences, I sought to find out what provisions the Commission intended to adopt, given that the principles upon which the WTO rules are based (the environment, work, non-harmful products, counterfeiting) were being violated by China."
"The replies were of a provisional nature and, even today, the Commission – perhaps a prisoner of a mistaken rigour in interpreting the law – behaves more like a notary than a political, governing body."
"To all of the above must be added the impact that the REACH Regulation will have on the competitiveness of businesses: Europe is anxious to apply and to export an increasing number of principles and values, which is entirely proper, whilst China and other countries are concerned to produce tights, shoes, knitwear and suchlike at low cost and export them to Europe, with the gratifying outcome for Europe of witnessing the progress and higher levels of employment achieved by exporting countries."
"The picture would appear almost complete if we consider that relocations favour large European companies, but impoverish Europe, whose white collar workers and capital, together with equipment and machinery, are emigrating elsewhere, leaving thousands of unemployed workers clinging to the dream of social values."
"The Europe of knowledge, research and innovation cannot be divorced from the Europe of competitive production."
"It is a matter of cause and effect."
"A distinguished and most humble monk, Saint Benedict of Nursia, was fond of repeating the words ‘Pray and work’ to each of his brothers, in order that the abstraction of prayer did not distract from the reality of life."
"We must reflect on the extensive resources that we still possess, on the very many regions addressed in Objective 1, and on the support policies."
"A new strategy needs to be drawn up, and we need to additionally consider the poverty and needs that exist in Europe itself, including its requirement for harmonious development."
"We need to assess, moreover, whether vulnerable regions can truly hope for genuine development and whether they can attract European companies to relocate onto their soil."
"That would perhaps be possible if well-equipped business districts and a modern system of tax breaks were created in those very regions."
"Mr President, the Chinese textiles affair is just one illustration, Mr Mandelson, of a much greater problem."
"In international trade, two contradictory elements need to be reconciled: firstly, and obviously, the need to trade and therefore to remove barriers; and, secondly, the need to ensure that jobs and social benefits are secure."
"In pro-am golf, this problem is resolved by giving the professional a handicap."
"In international trade, the handicap of customs duties had been created."
"With the GATT and the WTO, decisions have, however, been taken since 1947 firstly to reduce the duties and then to abolish them."
"Article 341 of the Constitution confirms this."
"Clearly, the upshot of this is the Chinese affair."
"The solution, Mr Mandelson, is to invent a new customs technology."
"Instead of reducing and abolishing duties, you, Commissioner Mandelson, need to propose to the WTO that it reduce duties. In this way, the importer would make a customs credit – a kind of economic drawing on the importer’s economy - available to the exporter."
"The system would impose a duty on Chinese textiles coming into Europe and provide China with a customs credit which could only be used for purchasing products that had emerged from the European economy."
"In this way, a virtuous circle would be created."
"The system would resemble the compensated contracts, offshore contracts and Marshall Plan systems but, in this case, the credit is made available by the customs duty itself."
"The thorny problem of relocations would thus be resolved in terms of a new customs technology."
"."
"It is now the turn of the other speakers on the list: 20 speakers are listed to speak and as per the apportionment of time decided by the groups, the majority of these speeches will last for one or two minutes."
"I appreciate that it is highly difficult to deliver a speech within one minute, but we are having problems, some of them technical, linked to the closure of this sitting, and the departure of many Members will be disrupted by a strike taking place at Strasbourg Airport."
"I must strictly enforce the speaking time."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the liberalisation of Chinese exports on 1 January 2005 was welcomed by many as a major victory of free trade."
"A few months later, we are returning to over-protectionism, both on the part of the European Union and on the part of the United States of America."
"Many, moreover, have lost no time in calling this trade attack 'Chinese fever'."
"In truth, if you think about it properly, this is a war, not a war of impressions, but a war of substance at all levels, which is aggravating Europe's and the United States' relations with Beijing."
"We need to comment on one fact here: in the first quarter of 2005, China's economy grew at a rate of 9.5%, due to the explosion in exports, which rose by 35%, increasing China's foreign currency reserves to just over 650 million dollars."
"We are therefore debating an economic, historical, cultural and commercial behemoth which today appears to be awakening from a long slumber."
"Today China is showing its real strength and its limitless potential in the commercial sector, in trade, in exports, in technology and, in particular in goods, the raw materials for which traditionally have a history which goes back centuries for this country of mysticism with its volcano beneath the ground which is ready to explode."
"The attention of the European Union and its vigilance in passing resolutions on relations with China are welcome here because:"
"- firstly, 9 categories of Chinese products are currently the subject of investigation;"
"- secondly, China is becoming stronger and stronger on the world political scene;"
"- thirdly, the European Union is China's most important trading partner and China is the European Union's second most important trading partner."
"Consequently, we have strong ties with this country;"
"- fourthly, China can prove its commitment to WTO rules by improving its legislation on intellectual property and thus controlling imitations and"
"- fifthly, with this approach and current rates, the WTO estimates that China will have 3/5 of exports in 2015, a position which it held for a thousand years, from 500 to 1500 A.D."
"I wonder how the European Union will deal with the Chinese fever giant."
"Mr President, if Commissioner Mandelson had come to this Chamber in February and said ‘I am now going to implement the safeguard clauses in the textile agreement’ he would have been a very popular man; he would have won lots of applause in the House, but he would also have been very wrong."
"I believe that his approach is absolutely admirable."
"He has managed to resist the pressure on him to act precipitately."
"The approach that the Commission is taking is correct in terms of making sure that we have all our facts marshalled, that any action we take can be legally justified and, if there is a legal case for taking action, that action will be taken."
"That is the right approach."
"An alternative approach would have resulted in the EU being accused of being protectionist, it would have damaged our relations with China itself and, above all, it would have sent a very bad signal for the Doha Development Round."
"So his approach is correct."
"I should like to add one caveat, however."
"The news today that America’s balance of payments has surprisingly improved might be good news for America, but underlying that there is a clear indication that imports from China have dropped dramatically and that the decline in Chinese imports includes a 21% reduction in textile imports."
"I do not want Europe to be seen as a soft touch."
"I do not want China to think that it has to respond to American pressure, but not to European Union pressure."
"So, if the statistics and facts justify EU action, I am sure the Commissioner will agree that he will have to take that action and send a very strong signal to China."
"On other issues, I hope that the Commissioner – and I was pleased to hear his comments on this – will keep up pressure on China in terms of intellectual property rights."
"The Chinese justification that it is all too complicated, that the difference between regional, national and local structures makes it impossible for China to implement WTO rules, just does not wash because China can do it when it comes to protecting Chinese intellectual property."
"China should also be made to do it in relation to European intellectual property."
"It is good news that China is part of the WTO."
"It is good news that China has to respect rules."
"It is our job to make sure, in the long term, that it sticks to those rules."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we call on you today for a particularly firm and timely approach to your handling of this dossier."
"You have explained to us what you have done and what responses you await."
"Allow us to state that the opening of the inquiry seemed late in coming."
"Worrying statistics were already reaching us in January, February, March and April, showing an abnormal – absolutely exceptional – increase in imports from China."
"The serious damage caused to the textile industry is obvious, and is one of the conditions cited by the WTO Treaties for implementing the safeguard mechanism."
"We believe that China is probing the limits of the application of the Treaty, and Europe must behave responsibly."
"We are all pleased at China’s entry into the WTO; we helped to achieve this objective."
"Commissioner, we are certainly not calling for protectionist measures or a return to the old ideas of import duties, but for a Europe that stands strong and firm in making China respect the rules to which it has itself subscribed."
"It is obvious that this country – I am talking about China – is striving to become the manufacturing centre of the entire world."
"Today it is happening with the textile industry, tomorrow it will be the mechanical engineering industry and later on the electronics industry."
"Europe’s response will be crucial and will act as a benchmark for future crises in other sectors."
"Mr President, the logic of global free trade has now hit us too."
"It is, then, hypocrisy to demand that we be protected against textile imports while ignoring the conditions in the oil and precious metals industries where there are not the same threats against European companies."
"What we should do is introduce fair tariffs across the board whereby manufacturers which do not comply with ILO requirements and environmental requirements are obliged to pay."
"These tariffs ought then to be returned to the developing countries in order to improve their environment and social situation."
"I find it odd that we have to concentrate on protecting large companies’ intellectual rights in China when it is mainly human rights that need protection in China and when that is of course where we should be investing our energies."
"The transition from free to fair trade now demands reform of economic policy as a whole, however, so that trade becomes a tool for human beings, and not the other way around."
"The UN’s environmental protection organisation, UNEPO and the UN’s development programme, UNDP should call the shots where the World Trade Organisation is concerned, and not the other way around."
"– Mr President, the interest which you are showing in the workers and in whether or not China is honouring its important obligations towards the WTO is both hypocritical and belated."
"The Commission played a leading part both in the signature of the multifibre agreement and at the WTO and it is on this basis that textile products are being imported from China."
"The textile industry and cotton cultivation started to shrink in the Member States of the European Union many years before 1 January 2005, when imports of Chinese textile products were allowed, with painful consequences for the workers."
"The WTO is an imperialist organisation which serves the interests of the multinationals and of big business, at the expense of the workers' interests."
"They set the particularly strict terms for the accession of China to the WTO, for the purpose, in other words, of opening up its markets, of liberalising the markets and of privatisation, so that they could exploit China's wealth-producing resources and workers."
"In exchange, China secured the free movement of its textile products."
"The belated interest in workers in the textile industry and other sectors is being expressed at a time when the workers' wrath at and fight against the anti-grass roots policy of the European Union in the Member States is growing."
"The objective of this initiative is obviously to disorientate and appease the workers intending to vote NO to the European Constitution."
"We also note that the warnings about limiting Chinese imports come at a time when pressure from the United States of America and the European Union on Beijing to break the fixed parity between the dollar and the yuan is culminating; in other words, the imperialist centres want China and the other countries of Asia as a huge consumer market for their goods, without any competition from them on international markets."
"The danger emanates not from China, but from international competition on the part of the imperialists."
"We are fighting for international economic relations on an equal footing; we defend the right of the peoples to choose their own path."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the has reported that, following Thursday’s meeting between Mr Mandelson and the Chinese Trade Minister, Mr Mandelson reaffirmed that he does not plan to make hasty decisions in confronting the influx of Chinese products, ‘The long-term stakes are too high to allow the Chinese to damage our partnership and a longer deadline is required to make the suitable adjustments.’"
"Even here today, in this House, when faced with the request from certain countries, including Italy, to take urgent steps to activate the safeguard mechanism, you tell us that you are examining the dossier."
"What is the reasoning behind the Commission’s tardiness?"
"What are the real interests at stake?"
"How can it be that the textile industry has been so shamelessly left at the mercy of events and of what has rightly been described as a tsunami?"
"The Minister for Industry, in the hearing duly organised by Mr Baron Crespo, gave a precise account of the figures: 100 million employees working 24 hours per day."
"That is a war machine and you are seeking to confront it with legal technicalities?"
"That indicates an unwillingness to protect the textile industry and Europe’s small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, faced with the invasion of Chinese textile goods, the urgent adoption – and I stress urgent – of the safeguard mechanism is a crucial step."
"There is a need, however, also to responsibly think up a strategy for the long-term."
"There are six points to which I should briefly like to draw the attention of the Community institutions."
"Firstly: a strong commitment to the fight against the counterfeiting of European goods and trademarks, together with a more incisive and effective strategy on intellectual property is vital."
"Secondly: an unambiguous policy for strengthening, at European level, customs controls on goods originating from outside of Europe."
"Thirdly: the introduction of a non-EU mark of origin, which will also apply to products that are only partially manufactured in third countries."
"Fourthly: putting on the agenda a serious discussion of the consequences of the excessive appreciation of the euro."
"Fifthly: a European pledge to finally hold a debate on the systematic and unjustifiable devaluation of the Chinese currency (the yuan), in the framework of the WTO."
"The sixth and final point: calling on China to comply with international rules protecting workers and human rights."
"Mr President, Commissioner, when China joined the WTO in 2001, this was in theory a way of bringing trade relations between China and the European Union into balance."
"Nonetheless, this balance is altered when the ground rules of international trade are not respected."
"I want to speak first of all about the measures needed – in accordance, let us not forget, with the WTO agreements - to protect intellectual property."
"These measures help combat pirating and counterfeiting effectively."
"In order to guarantee the future of our textiles industry, it is now up to the European Union to ensure that the agreements protecting textile patterns and designs are respected."
"Faced, finally, with what is recognised as market disruption – I am referring here, of course, to what you yourself have confirmed is the spectacular development of Chinese textile products – we need to apply the legal instruments available to us within the framework of the WTO."
"Moreover, do you not believe, Commissioner, that it is now imperative, when all the indicators are in the red, to set in motion an urgency procedure enabling safeguard measures to be implemented?"
"Why are you delaying so long, to the detriment of our industries and to the detriment of the industries in the countries close to us?"
"There is no making up for lost time."
"This is not about implementing protectionist measures."
"In fact, it is about making China understand that its membership of the WTO entails both rights and duties."
"Mr President, Commissioner, last weekend, one of the biggest ships in the world docked at the port of Valencia."
"It came from China and carried 5 100 containers, mostly containing textile goods."
"Some people described it as the ship of unemployment, the job-destruction ship; nevertheless, a prominent business leader pointed out that our great challenge was to ensure that that ship did not return to China empty, but full of our products for that immense and growing market."
"I believe that that is the great opportunity facing us as Europeans."
"In order to make this possible, however, two conditions are essential."
"The first is that the openness of the markets and progress of exchanges should be of reasonable dimensions and that the textile sector should be assisted in its process of restructuring."
"We cannot allow the creation of a serious imbalance that will eventually destroy the European textile industry and have dramatic social consequences for many European regions."
"The second is that we all have to play according to the same rules and that conditions must be reciprocal."
"That includes compliance with the WTO agreements, which have been mentioned here by several speakers."
"We must also demand that the rules that we must all follow include respect for the ILO conventions and the protection of workers."
"I believe that the Commission must respond to the request of five countries of the Union to establish clearly all the products seriously affected by the Chinese influx and that an investigation and consultation procedure must be initiated immediately with China."
"Commissioner, I am sure that you have the support of this House to continue working and seeking a negotiated and cautious solution, as you have said."
"Nevertheless, it must be made clear that, if there is no appropriate response, the only solution will be to take safeguard measures."
"Let us make the rules of the game that we must all play by clear today."
"Let us anticipate the changes awaiting us and let us create reasonable conditions so that the European industry can deal with the challenges facing it."
"–Mr President, we Europeans have every right to expect China to meet all the obligations that membership of the WTO implies, but China should also be guided by the spirit of the WTO rules, in the same way that Commissioner Mandelson himself is guided by the spirit of the Constitution, even though the Constitution is not yet in force."
"It is for that reason that we welcome the imposition of safeguards."
"Compliance with the treaties must be tested and demonstrated."
"So far, of course, China’s accession to the WTO has been a triumph not only for China itself, but also – and particularly – for us Europeans."
"We should at long last come to see the debate in its global dimension, and not just from the narrow Eurocentric angle."
"Commissioner Mandelson has tried to look at it globally."
"Calls are made for the return of trade barriers and for tighter controls, but these would be a slap in the face for the European manufacturers who have spent 10 years campaigning for a changeover from quota-based trade to more competition, and have now been successful."
"To return to the special arrangements would be to regress to protectionism, and that, now in particular, would send completely the wrong message."
"Nevertheless, minimum standards in the labour market have not ceased to matter; they still do, and it is for that reason that we Europeans should do everything in our power to get the WTO, too, to accept more democratic rules."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the EU is taking a reckless approach to the Chinese way of doing business, and I refuse to be swayed by the argument that textile manufacturers have had 10 years to prepare for the liberalisation currently underway."
"It was not until 2002, after China had joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO), that it became possible for the EU to determine what the impact of gradual liberalisation would be."
"Prices fell by 40%, and China captured 75% of the market in a trice."
"There could probably have been no clearer indication that EU trade policy should change course."
"Yet that is exactly what did not happen, even though the Member States have entrusted the EU with exclusive power over trade policy."
"At present China is ruthlessly crushing the poorest Asian and African countries, where textiles were key to survival."
"Dumping prices will mean that one million European textile manufacturers, including tens of thousands of women in the Czech Republic, will lose their jobs in areas where textiles are a traditional industry."
"It is not only the famed Chinese industriousness that makes such prices possible; they are also the result of minimal environmental and social standards, not to mention child labour, and state subsidies and China’s undervalued, state-controlled currency also play a part."
"We are opening up our markets, yet textile manufacturers are barred from the Chinese market."
"The car factories are ample proof that the principle of cooperative ownership is being violated."
"I believe it should be quite clear from what I have said that the WTO rules are being breached."
"The EU must use any economic and political instruments it has left to force China to observe the rules of fair competition, both for the sake of sustainable development on our planet and for the sake of the values that prompt us to regulate the European market, even though we know that we are increasing the cost of producing goods in Europe and lowering our competitiveness in the process."
"If the EU wishes to boost public confidence in integration, it must form a united front and become a strong partner for the WTO, on a par with Japan, China and the USA."
"The Commission, the Council and also this House should view this as a duty, rather than a challenge."
"I am delighted that the Commission has realised that the impact of liberalisation needs to be mitigated, but it is not enough to impose 7% quotas for one year."
"I would urge the EU to make major changes to its foreign policy towards China, in order to ensure that this policy is in line with the long-term goals of the EU internal market."
"I very much hope that we can succeed in this task."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome the tone with which you have dealt with this important dossier on trade relations with China – in defence of Europe’s interests, but without that leading to a lurch backwards to the time of impossible and dangerous trade protectionism."
"We must pay attention, however, to the textile industry, where I believe there is an issue emerging that is also political in nature."
"The importance of events is such that the citizens of Europe are looking to us with great anxiety to find an effective escape route that a united Europe alone can provide."
"They will not tolerate any kind of delay or even just the impression of involuntary powerlessness."
"It is therefore necessary to immediately adopt useful policies, as you have said."
"In addition to opening talks with the Chinese authorities, we must encourage the introduction of concrete provisions, such as labels of origin to encourage consumer awareness, and a more rigorous, intense fight against counterfeiting."
"Creativity, innovative technology, and team spirit among the institutions, industry, the social partners and the research world are, of course, equally necessary."
"I believe that this Parliament, together with you, will equally be ready to play its part in this possible breakthrough."
"– Mr President, the accession of China to the WTO and its integration into the global economy are a very positive development."
"China is already one of the biggest trading powers in the world and its growth has positive repercussions on the development of many other countries."
"However, there are indications and substantiated accusations that China is not fully honouring its obligations under its WTO accession agreement."
"It has maintained restrictions in domestic trade and in the distribution of goods, such as state subsidies, discriminatory tax concessions, administrative hurdles and obstacles to the establishment of and access to its market for foreign companies in the services sector."
"Furthermore, it is not applying in full the principle of national treatment."
"Similarly, there are serious delays in the application of WTO rules on the protection of intellectual, commercial and industrial property and on foreign investment."
"The result of all this is reduced access for European companies and the blocking of European exports to the Chinese market whereas, on the other hand, the European market remains open."
"In order not to upset trade relations between the European Union and China and to ensure that the voice of neo-protectionism does not prevail, the Commission is being called on to take other initiatives, so that there is a balanced result in bilateral trade, on the one hand, and any unfair practices are lifted, on the other."
"The first and best solution is to open further the Chinese market to European exports of industrial and agricultural products and services and, at the same time, to mitigate aggressive Chinese exports of certain products, such as textiles today, tomorrow cars or other products."
"The application of the safeguard clauses for which provision is made in China's accession agreement is a reasonable last resort, a reasonable ."
"Commissioner, as I see it there are three issues that require an appropriate and rapid response from the Commission."
"The textile, clothing and footwear market provides us with an excellent example of how Chinese imports can destroy a market, and have a knock-on effect on other sectors."
"The first issue that needs to be addressed is the length of time it takes the Commission to act, as well as the fact that the misguided decisions it takes are not only damaging, but unfortunately sometimes also irreversible."
"The second issue relates to the liberalisation of the EU market, the consequences of which have included a sudden influx of subsidised imports, such as subsidised coal."
"This has led to price competition that has given rise to so much concern and has eventually ruined the coal market."
"This has made matters even worse for the mining industry, even though the efforts of the latter go towards meeting the EU’s energy needs."
"The third and final issue relates to the preferential trade agreements concluded when the EU still had only 15 Member States."
"It is time to revise the customs agreement and the preferential quotas, taking the interests of the enlarged EU into account, as at present the trade displacement effect does not always give rise to the relevant creation effect."
"By way of example, agricultural and food products from the United States are still keeping goods from the 10 new Member States off the EU market."
"Mr President, Commissioner, since 1 January of this year, some 500 jobs have been lost in Belgium too as a result of the unequalled increase in Chinese textiles imports."
"At this rate, it is expected that some 2 000 jobs will go by the end of this year, and if nothing is done, this will continue in the years to come."
"Allow me to quote two figures, Commissioner, which I received this morning. These are figures that reflect the increase of Chinese imports in Belgium over the past quarter, from January to April 2005."
"Imports of Chinese jumpers have increased by 747% and of men’s trousers by 2000%, which adds up to a 20-fold increase."
"The European – and Belgian – textile and clothing businesses have, nevertheless, largely adapted to the new competition."
"They have specialised in a number of products, God knows how many, and are thus attempting to respond to the new threat and get their punches in first."
"Unfortunately, Commissioner, it is extremely difficult to arm yourself against an opponent who resorts to unfair dumping practices, as has been mentioned several times this morning, and illegal counterfeit practices in particular."
"An increasing number of European textile companies are faced with shameless and illegal imitations produced by their Chinese competitors."
"I am delighted to hear this morning that you are determined to tackle this scourge."
"The question is how quickly you want to act because figures over the past few months show that the situation is critical."
"You said this morning in your introduction that you would like to further analyse the information."
"What exactly do you mean by this?"
"I hope that this does not mean further delays."
"This debate is not intended to prompt you, Mr Mandelson, into taking protectionist measures against China, on the assumption, of course, that such a thing is possible at this stage."
"This is an appeal to make it clear to our Chinese friends that dumping and counterfeiting have no place in Europe and are far from being fair trade practices."
"It is up to you, the Commission, to see to it that this is done."
"Mr Mandelson, the employers and workers in Europe’s textile and clothing businesses are relying on you."
"Please do not let them down any longer."
"–Mr President, Commissioner, Europe still has cause to worry about its textile industry."
"As a Vice-President of the International Textile, Clothing and Leather Workers’ Association, I am only too familiar with the present situation, and with the potential social consequences of the job losses that are threatened."
"The degree to which the Member States are prepared to meet the new situation does indeed vary widely."
"That there is ever-increasing interpenetration of goods in the global economy is self-evident, and it is of course the case in China too."
"Even I can see that, but the rate at which trade is currently being liberalised, accompanied by exports increasing at an unheard-of rate, does of course jeopardise everything."
"In Europe alone, over a million jobs are seriously at risk, while on a global scale – and this I say with my vice-presidential hat on – over 30 million textile workers are under pressure, with the threat of their jobs going elsewhere."
"That is how things stand on the global market at the moment."
"The question is, then, whether the majority of the EU of 25 will, for reasons of solidarity, throw their weight behind protection clauses and whether, now that the textile industry has cried out for help, it might also be possible to get the process speeded up."
"September might be too late."
"Today, it is the textile industry; tomorrow it will be someone else’s turn."
"It is in those terms that we appeal to you."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, we need to define measures to protect the textile industry, measures so that the market and trade can operate, and measures to protect consumers."
"We need to safeguard these measures by complying with international law and the rules of international trade and, more specifically, through China's protocol of accession to the WTO."
"However, in complying with it, not only we can, but also we must activate the textile safeguard clauses."
"Our strategy on textiles must, in my opinion, be based on competitiveness, quality and consumer protection."
"For the purposes of consumer protection, I think we need to adopt measures to inform consumers about the attributes of products through appropriate labelling, for example with labels of origin, quality labelling, ecological labelling and, most importantly, labelling which indicates the effect of the product on the consumer's health."
"As far as competitiveness and quality are concerned, I propose that research be reinforced and focus on:"
"a) high-quality innovative products,"
"b) creating research and development centres,"
"c) research into the effect of products on the environment and consumer health."
"Finally, as regards the Commission communication on textiles, which stipulates as a strategic objective that the production chain must be maintained in countries in the Euro-Mediterranean zone, so that resources do not ultimately disappear via these countries, I have the following comments to make:"
"- firstly, we need to help small and medium-sized enterprises established there to become more flexible and to respond better to consumer demands and"
"- secondly, the Commission needs to expressly undertake to facilitate trade within the Euro-Mediterranean zone by applying customs duties as quickly as possible and refusing to confine itself to the current bilateral transnational agreements."
"– Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Mandelson for the information he has given us and for the particular sensitivity which he has demonstrated over the last period on the major and serious problem of textiles."
"The statistics for the last period sent by the Member States to the Commission illustrated how critical the situation is."
"The situation is critical in the Member States, and in Greece in particular, as Mr Mandelson can see from the statistics submitted by the Greek authorities on closures of textile companies and job losses."
"I believe that the communication on the part of the European Commission on the guidelines is the right move."
"I agree that it is a move in the right direction."
"It is a good thing that the Commission laid down alert levels for each category of Chinese textile products."
"However, I should like to say that Mr Mandelson should re-examine the planned duration of the investigation to be conducted by the Commission and of the procedure for unofficial consultations with the Chinese authorities."
"These periods, these terms must be reduced."
"However, I should also like to emphasise that these guidelines should have been laid down earlier."
"The Commission had promised that it would submit them last autumn; unfortunately, they were rather late."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are at present importing a very large number of products from China on favourable terms or at low prices."
"This does of course increase Europe’s purchasing power."
"Europe already has the greatest purchasing power in the world, and cheap imports make us even stronger in this respect."
"The other side of the coin is that people are paid very low wages in China and hence have very little purchasing power, so the low level of wages in China puts us at a disadvantage and makes it less likely that we will sell goods there."
"It is therefore vital that we should debate market access, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Such access to the market should be balanced and founded upon reciprocity, with both sides being able to learn from one another."
"In this respect, the negotiations that are currently in progress are of particular importance."
"It is also important that we in Europe should give some thought to what might happen if monetary parity were to begin to be subject to the operation of the market."
"The international financial markets are currently characterised by considerable movement and very marked oscillations, and it may be supposed that parity with China will become temporarily flexible, with inevitable consequences for our markets."
"As regards subsidies, taxation and dumping, we should give some thought to how we can join with China in finding solutions together, and we should in particular make a start on trade facilitation in order to bring about more transparency in this area in future, making it possible for the customs authorities to work together and for a mutual relationship to be established, such as is customary for equal trading partners."
"Each side should see what the other’s problems are and try to negotiate compromises."
"I now wish Commissioner Mandelson a great deal of success in doing just that, believing as I do that this House will be alongside him and vigilant in these negotiations."
". Mr President, this has been a very useful, rather balanced and proportionate debate, but I well understand the huge anxieties and sensitivities that are excited by this issue of textiles."
"Let me say that, of all the contributions made since the opening remarks, if I had to identify one contribution with which I was most in sympathy and which most corresponded to my own views and approach, it would be that of Mr Calabuig Rull, because stressing that we need to see China as an opportunity as well as a potential threat and that the containers that are heading towards Europe with all these textiles and other goods and produce need then to be sent back to China filled with goods and produce hits exactly the right note."
"When I talk about goods and produce I also mean a huge potential and expanding market for European services."
"I agree that we need to help the textiles industry in Europe to restructure and adapt, and we are giving that assistance."
"I agree that, if China is to have its own growth accepted by the international economic community, then it needs to reciprocate by opening its own markets to others’ produce and to comply with international agreements."
"However, I also agree that, if, in the circumstances of this very sudden and very dramatic surge in Chinese exports, we have to take action on our side in order to manage this transition and to smooth these changes, then that action is open to us to take."
"It may be limited in terms of its content and its duration."
"None of us should exaggerate – especially for those who are directly concerned with these changes – what is at our disposal to do in order to counter this."
"At the very least, we can limit the growth of Chinese exports on a temporary basis."
"It is not open to us, under the WTO rules, to do more than that."
"However, where the facts justify our doing that, I, certainly, and my colleagues in the Commission will not shrink from doing so."
"It is easy in a debate like this to talk in generalisations."
"What we cannot do is act in generalisations."
"We have to act on a case-by-case basis and on the basis of the facts."
"Why?"
"Because we must act in a way that is legally defensible."
"The worst course of action for us in the Commission would be to act in a way that we could not subsequently defend, only to find ourselves challenged in the WTO and forced to reverse the actions we have taken."
"That would be a tremendous disappointment and setback for those who are most directly affected, and we must be careful."
"Therefore, we must enforce the rules, but we cannot invent the rules."
"That is what we must bear in mind throughout this."
"Also, there is a mixed picture developing in terms both of the impact of import levels on particular commodities and categories of textiles and of the impact on production levels and employment within different parts of the European textiles industry."
"Not just in the United States, but in some cases also in Europe, import levels are falling."
"In other cases, Chinese imports and their growth are displacing the imports from third countries."
"So it is a mixed picture."
"In terms of the impact of these trade flows on European production and employment, it is true that, in some cases, the impact appears to be dramatic, based on the facts that I was reviewing with my services only yesterday, facts, for example, from Greece, Portugal and Italy."
"There are some very disturbing developments."
"I have to take note of those and I have to base my future actions on those facts."
"In the case of some of our other Member States, I have yet to receive the relevant data and the relevant information."
"Even certain Member States at the forefront of the demands for me to adopt emergency and urgent procedure have not sent me the facts on which I could base such urgent action."
"However, I am sure it will be forthcoming."
"Mr Caspary, Mrs Mann and Mr Martinez raised interesting questions and ideas, and I will write to them in response in due course."
"Finally, the statement made yesterday by the Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, in which he seems to have decided to give instructions to relevant government departments in China to prepare effective action to curb Chinese export growth, is welcome to me."
"We need, however, to look at the reality of these actions, when they are agreed, and consider the impact they will have."
"In the light of those, the Commission will consider what future action it will take from here on."
"The debate is closed."
"China’s economic dynamism and its consequences for the European economy has highlighted how powerless the European institutions are to defend fragile industrial sectors such as the textiles industry."
"The principle of dismantling the quantitative limitations of the multifibre arrangement was agreed in 1986 when the multilateral trade negotiations of the Uruguay Round were launched."
"At that time, China was not a big supplier of textiles and was not a member of the GATT."
"A lot of French textile companies had already relocated to North Africa or Egypt."
"When, moreover, the Uruguay Round agreements establishing the timetable and the method for dismantling the quantitative restrictions were signed in 1994, China was not a member of the new WTO, which it only joined in 2002."
"Criticism of China cannot therefore conceal Commissioners’ and EU governments’ responsibility for the huge difficulties experienced by the textile industry and, unfortunately, extending to other sectors."
"What is also scandalous is having agreed, in the name of world trade, to enter into agreements with the largest totalitarian country on the planet, and one which violates all the human, social and economic principles on which Europe is supposed to be built."
". My doubts about admitting China to the World Trade Organisation have been borne out by the way in which that country fails to stick to the rules, not only as regards textiles, but also in the case of intellectual property."
"By admitting China, we also got Taiwan into the bargain as a member of the WTO, but, of great value though that is, it does not relieve us of the duty to remind China that it has to play by the rules."
"Moreover, the question also arises, even if China were to adhere to the rules, of whether industries such as textiles in the EU could compete against low-wage countries."
"Europe must specialise, must concentrate on the production of high-quality products, and must focus on deploying high-quality labour."
"Only then can we handle the competition on the world market."
"The next item is the report (A6-0111/2005) by Mr Herrero-Tejedor, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the implementation of the European Union’s information and communication strategy (2004/2238(INI))."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are going to vote on in a few minutes time covers, or attempts to cover, two fundamental objectives: firstly, to evaluate the application of the European institutions’ information and communications strategy, in other words, to look back and see what we have not done properly; and secondly, to propose certain effective ideas that contribute to making the information and communication policy better, in other words, to look ahead and see how we can improve that policy."
"I would like to thank all the political groups, in particular the shadow rapporteurs — María Badía, Giulietto Chiesa, Helga Trüpel and Manuel Portas — for the efforts they have made to enrich the report, something they have undoubtedly achieved, and to reach a broad agreement that allows us to vote on a text which hinges on five basic agreements."
"We basically agree that we have to ensure that information reaches every citizen, that they receive it via the most modern instruments, that is to say, television, radio, the Internet and the new technologies."
"It is not sufficient for us to prepare responses aimed at a few citizens who are already aware of being European and who already know what they need to ask."
"We must ensure that awareness of Europe, of what it means to be European, reaches everybody, and that sooner or later, everybody feels the need to ask what the European Union can do for each of them."
"We basically agree that, in order to do this, we must ensure that the messages of the European institutions reach the right audiences."
"We must ensure that these messages awaken the interest of the citizens, each and every one of them, according to their respective concerns, because it makes no sense to spend a lot of money providing generalised information that is ultimately of hardly any use to anybody."
"Every household must receive the message that is relevant to that particular household."
"And to that end, information must be decentralised, it must be channelled by means of local and regional media, with the help of good professionals, genuine professionals who are able to give the media the kind of assistance they really need."
"We basically agree that the citizens’ legitimate aspirations to participate actively in the development of the European Union will only be met if we are able to touch the emotions of the citizens."
"The European Union is no longer an ordinary international organisation with purely financial aims."
"It is a community of values."
"Those values are the very soul of the European Union."
"We must make it visible and we must make it attractive."
"We basically agree that we can do little from here without the cooperation of the Member States and the national parliaments."
"And we basically agree that it would be a mistake not to ensure that interinstitutional cooperation functions properly."
"This final point, that of cooperation amongst the different European institutions, has so far led to a very fluid dialogue during the production of this report, an unusually fluid dialogue, I would say, with the European Commission, and we all want this to continue. But it is not enough to want it."
"Desires are not enough. Only facts matter."
"It is a fact that, through this report, the European Parliament has tried to bring itself into line with the Commission as far as possible."
"And the Commission now has two options: either to incorporate Parliament’s contributions into the new communication about to be issued, or to do without them."
"If you chose the first option, we will move forward; if you chose the second, we will take an enormous step backwards."
"The ball is in your court, therefore, Mrs Wallström, but since I am sure that you want to do the right thing, and since I can testify to your willingness to hold dialogue and to reach agreement, I am also sure that you will be able to take this opportunity for the Parliament and Commission to work together in this fascinating task of communicating Europe."
"Amen."
". I am very pleased to address today, in this House, the vital topic of communicating Europe to our citizens."
"Mr Herrero-Tejedor has done an excellent job in tabling a report that poses the right questions and suggests important answers."
"I welcome the rapporteur’s suggestion that this plenary should have a debate on communication at least once a year."
"The support of Europeans for the European project hinges on our communication efforts."
"We have all known for years – and the ongoing public debates on the ratification of our Constitution show this clearly enough – that despite our common efforts to communicate, Europe’s citizens still say that do not know enough about, or are not interested in, the European Union, and do not understand its role and its benefits for them."
"Less than half voted in last year’s European elections."
"Apathy and ignorance are enemies of our democratic foundations."
"As our latest Eurobarometer reveals, there is a clear correlation between the level of information and the support for the Constitutional Treaty; 75% of those who know the Constitution well declared they were in favour, while the support of those who have never heard about the Constitution is only 22%."
"The conclusion is evident: the need to communicate our projects is crucial for the future of the European Union."
"Communicating Europe is a highly complex task because European construction is in itself complex; because the European project is an evolving project and because perceptions of the European project vary and are defined, to a large extent, by national history and circumstances."
"Moreover, we should never forget that no communication can be better than the policies it wants to communicate."
"More than ever before, the European Union needs to explain its aims and policies clearly and comprehensively."
"That is why the Barroso Commission has made communication one of its strategic priorities."
"The foremost priority of the present Commission is connecting with citizens."
"However, I should like to add that this is not just the Commission’s responsibility."
"In fact, it is very much the responsibility of all players: Parliament, the Council and, above all, the Member States."
"The Commission will therefore put forward a White Paper on communication."
"It will identify options and possible solutions to the challenges that have been outlined and will be the starting point of a long-term process of structural reform and change in communication culture, involving all actors concerned within and outside the Commission."
"The new approach will follow three strategic principles, which are also taken into account in the draft of the Herrero-Tejedor report that you are debating today."
"The first involves listening to people and taking their interests and concerns into account; the second, explaining our policies and their impact on people’s daily lives; and the third, connecting with people by communicating more and as closely as possible on topics that are of real interest to citizens."
"We have identified five main areas for action."
"The first is political commitment and ownership."
"Commissioners will engage as key communicators about all portfolios."
"They will also get involved in better planning and coordination of communication activities, which will concern all levels."
"The Commission will better integrate communication into our working culture and into policy formulation."
"The second involves professionalising our communications."
"That includes providing an effective and service-minded spokesperson service, improving research through polling and surveying and evaluating the impact of our communication activities."
"We must make better use of our tools and provide more and better training."
"The third concerns connecting with and responding to citizens."
"That involves adapting messages and matching national and local concerns – instead of taking a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach – and conveying them as close to the citizen as possible."
"As proposed by Mr Herrero-Tejedor, that means using contemporary tools, giving priority to those which are more likely to reach the greatest number of citizens, such as television, radio and the internet; using a language that people understand and a more decentralised implementation; using our representations in the Member States as well as our relays and networks in close cooperation with Parliament and the Member States."
"Our fourth focus is on adapting the means to the objectives."
"I believe we can all agree that communication is a human-resource- and budget-intensive activity."
"We will, therefore, need to allocate financial and human resources in a manner corresponding to our goals."
"Communication will have to be considered as an in-built cost in all activities."
"All of that will be based on a qualitative and quantitative assessment of communication activities within the institutions."
"Last but not least, the fifth point is that we need to work together."
"We need to work with the Member States and with other actors."
"A progressive approach, leading to the possibility of forming an over-arching European Union approach to communication based on real coordination and synergies between the institutions, should be established."
"However, we cannot forget other key actors, such as national and regional governments and parliaments, civil society and the media, focusing particularly on the regional and local media in the Member States."
"The next step will be the White Paper and the results of the broad consultation process we will launch, which will, hopefully, lead to more consistent and efficient communication with Europeans, which is our common responsibility."
". –Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, information builds awareness, while the lack of information diminishes consent."
"That is what we learn from all Eurostat’s statistics, from our day-to-day experience of the public, from opinion polls at home and, of course, also from what is going on around the directive on the internal market in services and the debate on the Constitution."
"In no way is it my intention to apportion blame here today, nor do I want to demand anything of anyone."
"It is for the EU institutions themselves to actually back up with actions what we have been saying in reports for years."
"At the same time, this is not a task for the institutions, but rather for the members, the Member States, the MEPs, the officials, the Commissioners, and for us ourselves."
"So it is that, further to what Commissioner Wallström so rightly said, there are a number of things I would like to demand of this House."
"Firstly, I demand that every Commission proposal should, from the very outset, specify in clear and precise terms what added value for the public the European regulation in question represents."
"Secondly, I demand that the Commission should submit to the Council a communication and information plan as part of the package when it is required to decide on any and every European project."
"Thirdly, I demand a plan for the Europe-wide training and in-service training of journalists, to be carried out by the European institutions."
"Let me say, fourthly, that it is the Council, to my mind, that is the principal cause of this public relations disaster."
"There was in the Convention a three-year debate on the drafting of the new Constitution, and the Council and the Member States slept through it."
"The Council and the Member States are not discharging their shared responsibility in the European legislative process, so let us do so, not least in our own countries, in providing the public with comprehensive and timely information."
"Fifthly, I demand of us ourselves that we use the funds we are left with for information and communication."
"It is intolerable that – as happened in Austria – an information document should be issued on the Constitution without any reference whatever, whether in word or image, to either the Members of the European Parliament or the Members of the Convention."
"I demand that more use be made of visitors’ groups, of exhibition and display facilities and of the translation service, enabling us to actually do the things we want to do."
". Mr President, I would like to begin by stressing the importance of this report by Parliament on the application of the European Union’s information and communication strategy, and I would also like to thank the Commission for its good attitude, since, for the first time, before its presentation, this strategy has been debated with Parliament, thus allowing Parliament to influence its final content, rather than being restricted merely to responding to it."
"The objective should be, above all, to keep the citizens constantly and adequately informed, with a view to promoting their knowledge of, and their interest and participation in, the European Union’s affairs."
"The debates going on in the various countries with regard to the approval of the Constitutional Treaty demonstrate that there is a serious lack of knowledge of the functioning, the policies and the work of the Union."
"The result of this strategy should demonstrate to the citizens that belonging to the European Union brings them benefits in terms of their everyday lives."
"We must act on many fronts, making full use of the citizens’ preferred media, such as television and radio, since these are best able to reach them in their homes, and, in the era of the information society, it is essential that the Union’s websites appear in the official languages of the Union and also in the languages with official status in the Member States."
"The European citizens have the right to full and impartial information on Community affairs, in their own languages, on the basis of respect for and protection of cultural diversity and as a guarantee of their understanding and involvement in the project of European integration."
"If we really want our citizens to be informed, I believe it is entirely appropriate to insist that studies relating to the European Union be incorporated into the teaching syllabuses of the Member States, with a view to promoting a sense and an awareness of European citizenship from the outset."
"The Union’s communication strategy has shown itself to be insufficient and defective so far, and it is therefore essential that the Commission take account of the recommendations in this report by Parliament in the communication that it is announcing for this very month, in order to bring the European Union closer to the citizens."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the level of information on Europe available to European citizens is extremely low, and the reason for that is not technical, but political."
"We will vote today on a report concerning the European Union’s information and communication strategy that is seeking to improve the techniques and methods by which the Union promotes itself."
"Between these methods and the citizens, however, looms a wall of indifference, which is spectacularly demonstrated by the lowest ever turnout at the elections in 2004: only 45.7%."
"That is not only the effect of an insufficient and bureaucratic communication strategy, but of a Europe that is still very remote from its citizens, who do not know how it is made up, how it began, what its purpose is, whom it serves, of whom it is made up, where it is leading us, and whether it is useful or irrelevant to us."
"Let us be clear, this Europe is a construction site, and thus it is obvious that its main features are still not visible."
"At present, moreover, it is still a union of major economic, commercial and industrial powers, far more so than a union of populations and people."
"Its institutional architecture suffers greatly as a result of it, and the spirit issuing from it in no way fosters widespread participation by the people."
"It is also as a result of this isolation that there has arisen the bureaucratic narrow-mindedness that has impeded or obstructed its relationship with the people."
"In a Europe of such contrasts, there is not much sense, in fact, in having built one-way, vertical information structures from the centre outwards, since this has imposed a uniform and standardised communication model that has not worked."
"It is a model, moreover, in which citizens have to seek out information for themselves and not the other way round: this simply means that no information reaches the great majority of the people concerned."
"An effective information centre is required, a general staff of communication specialists."
"However, the concept of decentralised communication is also required, originating from the various countries and conceiving this communication in terms of different ways of thinking and languages; a concept of communication that is not solely propaganda."
"I am convinced that an effective way of informing European citizens on Europe is to emphasise not only its strong points but also its weaknesses, because it is also from those that the real, but not utilised, potential of Europe emerges."
"For this reason, , I believe that it would be beneficial for all 25 countries to turn to a referendum, including those countries, such as Italy, that are not bound to do so."
"The result does not matter; in the end Spanish, French and British citizens will have a much greater understanding of Italians."
"This is a legitimate method of communicating in Europe; legitimate because it is democratic."
". –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too am persuaded of the importance of the communication strategy, which must, of course, be more than merely a technical procedure; it must also communicate the spirit and underlying concept of Europe if we really are to win the public over."
"We simply have to explain to the public that nowhere in the world is there anything like this project in the development of which we share, that it brings them benefits, that it is all about cooperation, mutual understanding and peace, and that it is political, for only then will we be able to inspire them with any sort of enthusiasm for it."
"What we need, then, above all, is to get information to people where they are, using different kinds of information stands, with which we have to make both Parliament and the Commission present to the nations."
"I also think more use needs to be made of the opportunities afforded by schools, which would, if appropriate, involve modifying curricula."
"I do not see this as propaganda, but as political education and information – in the best sense of the word – focussing on European political integration and on Europe’s understanding of itself."
"I also agree with the suggestion that a hotline should be set up, that prizes should be awarded for good ideas, that more journalists should be invited and that now really is the time for us to put the European Constitution campaign centre stage."
"There should be more debates in the Member States’ parliaments, and in these we too should participate."
"There is one problematic aspect that I would like to mention."
"We all agree that European information and ideas have to be transmitted via the media, but I am firmly convinced that the right thing to do is to continue – perhaps by means of joint projects – to support existing television stations, such as EuroNews, rather than to set up a Parliamentary TV channel, which I do not think is really going to appeal to people."
"Instead, we should support, and concentrate our resources on, the other communication technologies available to us, with which people are already familiar, rather than pour money into a European Parliament broadcasting station, with which we would reach fewer people than if we were to opt for another, cooperative, approach."
". – I feel that Mr Chiesa hit the nail on the head when he said that there was an enormous chasm between the European institutions, their leaders and the citizens."
"This can be resolved first and foremost by means of good policies and, less so, by means of good techniques."
"Where our opinions strongly diverge, Mrs Wallström, is that when we say it takes two to communicate, we do not mean that one side provides the information and the other takes it in."
"This is a primitive concept that is still prevalent in the opinions expressed by Europe’s leaders."
"I should like to make three comments about the report, which makes great efforts to reach points of consensus or convergence."
"All culture is communication, yet the reverse is not true."
"We therefore disagree that the EU and the institutions can finance fictional works, films and artworks in order to disseminate and promote European ideas."
"Commissioned works damage culture, damage creativity and, in so doing, damage Europe."
"My second objection concerns the dividing line between information and propaganda."
"It is one thing for us in this House to seek to involve the institutions in referendum campaigns, but the truth of the matter is that we are talking here about communication, of which the primary objective is to guarantee the adversarial principle, the right of reply, yet this is not mentioned in the proposal before us."
"Thirdly, there is the issue of using public resources and money intelligently."
"The concept of a parliamentary channel is bureaucratic and dated."
"It is a terrible idea."
"Contrariwise, the right way forward is to invest in Euronews, in information built on the foundation of editorial freedom; this is the right way forward, the way in which we can see news stories that we do not like."
". Mr President, Commissioner, I have tabled 25 amendments to this report on the strength of what has been said in this House."
"What is the dividing line between information and propaganda?"
"It is not very clear."
"I call on the Commissioner and the citizens of Europe who are following this debate to ponder certain terms included in this report, such as ‘persuasion’, ‘promotion’, and ‘insist’."
"Such terms make me fear that the boundaries between information and propaganda are at times dangerously crossed."
"The concern that emerges from this is that we are selling the European brand as if we were selling a can of Coca-Cola or a pair of shoes."
"If it is the case that in Italy, where they did not want a referendum, citizens are not familiar with the European Constitution, or in Spain, where they actually approved it by a large majority, 80% of Spanish citizens were not acquainted with the European Constitution, I believe that any construction project that starts from the top and not the bottom is inevitably doomed to fail."
"Above all, I shudder at what I hear regarding our supposed need for more money and a new publicly owned European television channel, and the need for cash prizes to be awarded to film makers so as to make us proud to be European."
"I would point out to Members and to the Europeans who are listening to us that EUR 250 million has already been spent annually on communication on Europe."
"This sentiment must originate from the bottom and not the top."
"Billions of euros can be invested, but if there is no genuine democratic process then no one will take pride in being European on the basis of a Parliamentary report."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur for the work he has done."
"Today’s debate illustrates that we are still some way from being able to say that the EU institutions provide appropriate information and communicate well with the public."
"The information provided must also be reliable, and our citizens must be treated as equals and individuals."
"Most importantly, this information must reach those who need it, as well as those who are simply interested in knowing more."
"A further problem to be overcome is that information is not always available in all the official languages."
"I would add that transparency and a lack of bureaucracy should be the governing principles of information provision."
"This is rarely the case, unfortunately."
"I should also like to comment on a number of issues relating to the Constitutional Treaty."
"As I see it, what is needed is clear and objective information on this Treaty, rather than propaganda, whether for or against."
"The Constitutional Treaty is an extremely detailed document, and the result of numerous compromises."
"Our citizens should therefore be provided with information they can trust, and the starting point should be good translations."
"Mr President, this report claims that the Commission has a political responsibility to support ratification of the Constitution."
"However, it also calls for Jesuitical schools propaganda and using British taxpayers’ money to support the ratification process."
"Mrs Wallström told this Chamber on Tuesday evening that people will get what she chose to call ‘information’ about the Constitution, but I doubt it will point out, as eminent constitutional lawyers already have, that the Constitution totally reverses the relationship between the EU and the Member States."
"Whenever before did a sovereign nation permit outsiders to write and impose a new constitution on them, except after defeat in war?"
"Nor, I doubt, will the British be reminded that, in our country, the State draws power from, and answers to, the people."
"In the European Union, the State now seeks to exist in its own right and have the people answer to it."
"Nor will it remind the UK that our rights and freedoms are our birthright."
"They are not in the gift, or at the discretion, of a passing parade of political nonentities."
"The proposed Constitution has done us a great service: it has crystallised the threat."
"We are beyond discussing legislation, and it is time you recognised that you are seeking to become masters in someone else’s house, and that is intolerable."
"There is a saying: ‘What we don’t know, we fear.’"
"This applies also to familiarity with the European Union and its institutions."
"Yesterday we debated the future of Europe 60 years after the war."
"The majority of speakers emphasised in different ways that Europe’s greatest achievements since the war have been preserving peace, reconciliation among nations, cooperation and acceptance of our diversity."
"Yet this peace is not a self-evident thing, and we will also need to strive for it in the future."
"Democracy is a highly challenging assignment, which allows a person great freedom."
"And for that reason it is all the more important to have good, effective and objective information, so that we might more easily make correct and intelligent decisions."
"I welcome the appeal to European Union institutions for an improvement in the conditions for accredited journalists and the working relations with them, since the high costs mean that particularly newspaper and television houses in smaller countries cannot afford direct coverage and reporting from the sessions of its institutions or training for their journalists so they might have a greater familiarity with the working of the European Union."
"On Spring Day in Europe this year I participated in a number of fascinating events organised in Slovenian schools."
"Students together with teachers had prepared cultural programmes, exhibitions and round tables."
"At these meetings I gained the feeling that young people are ultimately interested in what we do in the European Parliament, how you can obtain employment in European Union institutions, what jurisdiction the EU has, and what the constitution will mean."
"I therefore welcome the proposal that Member States include in their education programmes a familiarisation with European institutions, since no information can be effective if we do not have appropriate prior knowledge of a given topic."
"There also needs to be a reworking of the ‘Europa’ website, so that all the official languages will indeed become equal."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, as we have already heard from many speakers, confidence in the European Union and in its institutions is certainly not as high as it might be."
"What underlies this is that great lack of information, of which many of my fellow Members and I are constantly reminded at various events, and with which, indeed, we are reproached, and so it is for us to endeavour to improve matters."
"It cannot be right, as we approach so important a decision as that on the European Constitution, that there should be no campaign of information and explanation, or at least no long-term one."
"It is irresponsible of us to allow such ignorance in this area, resulting in a great deal of popular disquiet as a result of the various misinterpretations, some of which we have just heard from various sides of the House."
"We also have to ask ourselves how efficient our current information and communication strategies are and how many members of the public they reach."
"There is a need not only for better cooperation between the institutions but also for structured partnership with the Member States."
"None of us can do it on our own."
"We need to look at and consider the various technical developments that have been achieved in the fields of radio, television and the Internet."
"There should also be more scope for European information in the regions, although this does of course presuppose willingness on the part of those with responsibility for them."
"As it is in schools that people are enlightened, and that knowledge is extended and deepened, the education ministers must make it their business to create a permanent place in the timetable for the European Union and its institutions."
"We were told yesterday – in speeches that were very different but all good – about how successful we have been in recent years in making European policy and moving the peace project onwards, but we can cope with whatever the future brings only if we involve the public, keeping them informed and expecting them to accept their share of responsibility."
"Mr President, the fact is that it is not only ordinary people, but also politicians in the Member States, opinion formers and Members of Parliament who know very little about what the European Union is, what it does, what it is for and what decisions are taken here."
"Concealing the measures of help to people that have been adopted in the European Union, they in some cases, either through ignorance or bad faith, deliver a single message that consists of explaining that a proportion of the problems they are unable to resolve are due to the EU."
"I therefore believe that a communication strategy, as well as many other things mentioned in this report, should in the first place be aimed not only at ordinary people but also at opinion formers and politicians in the Member States, beginning with members of the national parliaments."
"Secondly, it should have a clear and very precise purpose: that of bringing it home to people what goes on in the EU."
"It should not, as is sometimes the way of things, just be about anthems, flags and varieties of European music, such as the Ode to Joy from the Ninth Symphony."
"It is a question of counteracting the negative publicity of so much national policy by letting people know what takes place in the EU and how it benefits their lives."
"Mr President, information conveys what is happening objectively and is good for a democracy."
"PR and propaganda are about selling something for which there is no demand."
"The Commission was reasonably successful in maintaining the balance between information and propaganda but, unfortunately, the report is along the lines of more propaganda."
"Naturally, there is always a desire to appear in a positive light, but EU institutions need to be classed in the same category as authorities that are obliged factually and correctly to describe rules, laws and the work they do."
"I am therefore opposed to paragraph 5, according to which universities are to spread the EU’s values instead of critical thinking, analysis and knowledge."
"I object to paragraph 9, which is all about pure product placement, something we usually try to restrict."
"The calls for a European Parliament TV channel are unrealistic. It is better to have fair conditions for public service television and tougher rules to combat media concentration."
"Mr President, communication is a two-way process."
"I sit on the Committee on Culture and Education, which, through its rapporteur, will of course dutifully produce a report for us all to vote on."
"I have little doubt that the report will eventually pass through this place and find its way onto the statute books of every Member State."
"Is anybody listening – here, in this Chamber, or out there, in the real world?"
"No one out there can affect that process; no one in here can originate or terminate reports that come our way, so why should anybody care?"
"But the Commission wants them to care, so it decides to spend millions of euros on propaganda – for that is exactly what this is."
"Paragraph 40 summarises the EU strategy of deception and propaganda."
"In one breath it is declared that the Union’s institutions have a duty to inform citizens clearly and objectively about the proposed Constitution, yet in the same paragraph it is decreed that these same institutions have a political responsibility to support ratification."
"How, then, can objectivity figure when the final objective has already been decided?"
"And you wonder why the EU is held in such contempt!"
"My colleagues in UKIP and I will not be supporting the ratification of the Constitution or this shameful report, which admits the true problem but is designed to overcome it by propaganda and lies."
"I have said before, if the EU is the answer it must have been a silly question: that much you can communicate!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is a real gem of official propaganda in which the Commission and the governments surpass themselves in building their new world."
"The foundations of European policy are characterised by utopia, demagogy, political correctness and the absence of any reference to the values on which our civilisation is based."
"To this desire to have people forget what we are, on the model of the Communists who wished to make a blank sheet of the past, can be added a commercial dimension whereby the EU’s communication strategy inevitably becomes subject to market principles, to the point at which there is talk of promoting a ‘Europe’ brand in the same way as an everyday packet of washing powder."
"Children, obviously seen by the fervent supporters of Europe as being more malleable, are the preferred target of this communication."
"A promise is even made to them to define the soul of this new Europe - an odd term, ‘soul’, when you have rejected any Christian references in your draft Constitution."
"As a cherry on the cake, the possibility is raised of allocating financial bonuses to media that have apparently been able to communicate the European idea and European values."
"Corruption is being reinvented, as it were, but at European level."
"That is a good start!"
"In France, we are well placed to make a judgment about the way you view information."
"In the middle of the referendum campaign and in contravention of electoral law, 14 000 advertising hoardings have been erected on which selected and abbreviated articles are to be read, urging a ‘yes’ vote."
"We think all this is extremely worrying for the future."
"– MrPresident, Commissioner Wallström, only a matter of metres from here stands the Arte Studio, one of the most modern studios in Europe."
"It would be appropriate for us, when sitting here in Strasbourg, to cooperate with it in enabling the European public to see what is being done for them here."
"Communicating to the European public the added value that this House and its Members provide is one of our most vital tasks."
"One of the main problems is that the topics discussed in this House are very complex and wide-ranging, so journalists need incentives if they are to relate better to European issues."
"I suggest that we should award prizes for the best journalistic writing about what we do here, about countries and about worldwide issues."
"It is, as has already been said, of the utmost importance that we give our attention to journalists and to education."
"Again and again, I am surprised by the enthusiasm shown for our work by visitors to this House and by the positive frame of mind in which they leave it."
"That should continue to be the case in future."
"We should also try to make it easier for schools to access European material in the new library programme that we have developed."
"There are a lot of excellent DVDs, which do a very good job of describing the work we do."
"Members should be given the opportunity to access these EU-made productions in order to make them available to schools, universities and interested parties."
"Ladies and gentlemen,"
"when I was in Pärnu recently, in my native country, I was touched when an elderly woman came up to me and thanked me for providing information about the European Constitutional Treaty."
"It was her request that in future there should be significantly more information about the European Union."
"For this reason, I am fully in agreement with rapporteur Herrero-Tejedor that the provision of information about the European Union should be increased."
"The rapporteur has drawn attention to the great amount of room for improvement, from the content of the information communicated to a competition for original communication ideas."
"I agree with the idea that the mass media should be involved to a greater extent, and naturally the catchword here is television, this being the medium that most influences and engages society."
"We should, however, engage in a little introspection."
"Do we in Parliament do enough work ourselves? I would like to illustrate my point with an example."
"Since the end of last year, Parliament has lacked a public relations officer who is fluent in Estonian."
"For half a year, Parliament has not issued a single Estonian-language press release on its website – it is fortunate that this is the case only for my native language."
"At the same time, however, I would like to ask specifically: ‘Who in Parliament is responsible for this question, and in what way?’"
"First impressions often shape our perception of things for many years to come."
"In the same way, the new Member States’ perception of the European Union is being shaped today."
"I am convinced that Parliament needs to provide a good example by respecting agreements on cultural diversity and language policy."
"The observation of these principles also presupposes continuous Estonian-language media work; in other words, that a sufficient number of public servants and translators and interpreters should be hired from new Member States as soon as possible, in order to ensure a smooth bilateral exchange of information."
"Finally, I would like to note the fact that the Estonian media is represented in Brussels by only one correspondent; as a result of this, the absence of Estonian-language reporting at Parliament is doubly bad, and needs to be solved immediately and without delay."
"Thank you for your attention!"
"–MrPresident, in Europe is all our hope, but its prospects are not good, to judge by what is said in the debates in those Member States preparing to hold a referendum."
"What is the cause of this?"
"It is not just about the work we do; rather, the cause is to be found in broad public opinion, and particularly the way in which it is reported in the media, for it is primarily they, rather than us alone, that influence the climate within which public opinion is formed, and so that is where we must start."
"Much as I am in favour of the efforts to standardise school textbooks and of the adaptation of information to the groups for which it is intended, what matters is that our public relations work – that done here in the European Parliament and also by the other European institutions – should become more professional."
"It is still the case, for example, that nothing dramatic happens in this House that might be of interest to journalists and would make the proceedings clearer."
"Our votes are held quite separately from our debates."
"What this means is that we have to get the fourth pillar of democracy, the fourth of the four powers, the media, more involved."
"That is what we must aim for."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving me the floor."
"Allow me first of all to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for the work they have done on a subject as fundamental as the implementation of the European Union’s information and communication strategy."
"I should like firstly to emphasise the context in which we are led to express an opinion on the EU’s information and communication policy."
"A number of us have for some months been closely involved in referendum campaigns for the Constitution."
"The very many public meetings in which I participate never cease to bring it home to me how little knowledge many of our fellow citizens have of the European Union’s basic rules and policies."
"I therefore wish to support this report and emphasise three crucial points in it."
"First of all, there is a real need to pay greater attention to the content of the messages in order to arouse people’s interest on the basis of their individual concerns."
"The recent televised debate between President Chirac and young French people again emphasised the degree to which political leaders were struggling to highlight the positive impact of the European Union on our fellow citizens’ daily concerns."
"It is obvious, moreover, that only a system of decentralisation can facilitate access to information for a greater number of Europeans."
"I should like, for example, to testify in this House to the excellent work done by the European Parliament’s Marseille-based information office in my region."
"Finally, I am convinced that, as emphasised by the report, the information and communication policy will only be effective when knowledge of the European Union and its institutions is integrated as a subject in its own right into the Member States’ school curriculums."
". Mr President, it is definitely an extraordinary challenge to communicate in a European Union of 20 official languages, with a very complex structure, which is an evolving project."
"It is also a political arena with all the different views reflected, as is demonstrated here all the time."
"In ending this debate, I would just like to repeat my thanks to you for your views."
"From much of what has been said, and some of the very good ideas we have heard, I can see there is convergence with what we are now preparing in the White Paper."
"But I must just repeat that communication – and this is also addressed to Mr Portas, for example – is a two-way process."
"It has to be a dialogue; it has also to involve listening to citizens."
"That is my second point and I mentioned it in my introduction."
"One of the guiding principles has to be to listen better to citizens and their concerns, otherwise we will not succeed."
"I agree with those who have said that propaganda will not work."
"Scaremongering will not work either, so I think we have to be very careful in designing our information activities."
"I underline what has been said by Mr Karas and others."
"This is something for all players."
"It has to be integrated at the very start of the process of preparing different proposals."
"We have also received some very good ideas including journalist awards."
"A number of things have been mentioned that we will follow up."
"When our White Paper has been published, we will soon have a chance to come back with a number of these principles and very concrete proposals."
"Thank you for the debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at noon."
"Mr President, I have a brief point to make arising from Rule 126 and those following it in our Rules of Procedure."
"Yesterday – in some cases as late as after 11 a.m – meetings that had been scheduled weeks ago to happen between 3 p.m and 5.30 p.m were cancelled at short notice."
"This was done at the President’s behest in consequence of the plenary debate due to be held at 3 p.m."
"While I very definitely do see why yesterday’s debate was so important, I do not understand why I, as chairman of an intergroup, was informed as late as 11.10 a.m that it was due to be held, while other Members were notified between 8.30 a.m and 11 a.m."
"Nor am I sympathetic when cancellations occur at such short notice and the President, who had given this instruction, was seen, at 4.15 p.m. in the courtyard within the tower, toasting a number of visitors, at a time when we were required to be in the plenary and were not allowed to gather in the intergroups, working parties and other bodies."
"I regard this as unacceptable."
"I note your statement."
"I, for my part, think that it was noted in the agenda, but I shall contact the competent authorities."
"Mr President, I wish to raise a point of order under Rule 130, 152 or 166 with regard to the delay which is being caused today by the debate."
"I do not wish to delay this House for long, because delay is the problem."
"However, how much longer are we to go on fixing times for votes, which today was to be noon and then became 12.10 p.m. and is now going to be 12.20 p.m.?"
"This House should operate properly and within the Rules."
"Today there is a strike at Strasbourg airport and many Members are unable to make proper travel arrangements."
"The Cash Office tells me that upwards of 150 Members, each Strasbourg part-session, are losing half a day’s pay because they have to leave early to catch their only flight."
"I ask that the Bureau of this Parliament consider bringing the votes forward on a Thursday so that we may vote in time to catch aeroplanes."
"I shall make that request known to the Bureau."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Mr President, further to Rule 73 of our Rules of Procedure, I would again like to say that lawyers take the view – as indeed do I – that this report’s adoption by the committee was not lawful, and that we ought not to be permitted to vote on it now."
"I have already made this point on several occasions."
"Legal action will be taken."
"While I take part in this vote, I do so under protest."
". Mr President, I wish to clarify the situation."
"The oral amendments contested by Mr Martin were submitted to the committee members one day before voting."
"We had voted on several of them, when Mr Martin started to raise reservations on two occasions, without giving a clear Rule as a point of reference."
"Therefore, I went ahead with the vote with the full support of my committee."
"A decision by the chairman of the Committee on Budgets has therefore been taken on the basis of Article 151, paragraph 3, and we shall now proceed to the vote."
"As we know, the Aarhus Convention entered into force on 30 October 2001 and 19 out of the 35 parties to the Convention are EU Member States. These countries therefore have a special responsibility to create the mechanisms needed to implement it."
"Accordingly, at the second meeting of the parties, due to take place in Almaty, Kazakhstan between 25 and 27 May 2005, measures must be taken that pursue the legislative work leading to the implementation of its proposals."
"In common with the rights already enshrined in the Convention, it is also important to lay down precise provisions ensuring that the public is properly involved in the decision-making process concerning GMOs, and directives guaranteeing public involvement in international fora."
"Those provisions and directives will act as an instrument, by means of which the parties can improve public participation, at regional and global level, in other conventions and treaties dealing with issues relating to the environment."
"We believe that the national parliaments should decide of their own accord upon their respective positions during the conference in Almaty on the Århus Convention."
"The Member States need independently to determine their attitudes to participating in the decision-making process concerning GMOs and to establishing a funding system designed to guarantee funding on a predictable basis (paragraph 4)."
"Those countries that have not ratified the Århus Convention must, of course, take an independent decision as to whether or not they wish to do so."
"In our view, the European Parliament should not be lecturing or advising them on this matter."
". One of the key factors in developing public policy, and action on a public and private level that is conducive to protecting the environment, is collective and individual awareness of the importance of environmental issues."
"This issue, so often wrongly portrayed as a concern held exclusively by left-wing party-political organisations, is by nature an issue that conservative parties and politicians must be, and indeed are, greatly concerned about."
"Informed public debate is, moreover, the best way to combat environmental demagogy, which does exist, and those policies that overlook our obligation to the present and, more importantly, to future generations."
". The resolution adopted today in Parliament welcomes the decision to hold a Seminar of Governmental Experts, in order to discuss the EU’s role in the fight against climate change, to discuss support for research and development on sustainable energy and to discuss limiting polluting emissions from road, air and sea transport."
"We support this, but wish to underline that effective measures must be put in place and the political will must be there for the Commission and the Member States to take part in this effort. Consequently, proposals must be tabled on a future strategy based on the Kyoto Protocol, on technological innovation and on developing environmental technology."
"As the resolution states, we also deplore the fact that various countries have not ratified the Kyoto Protocol, including the United States of America, which is responsible for most of the emissions."
"Lastly, I must point out that there must be greater financial support for adaptation measures in developing countries and the least-developed countries, although it is true that the developing countries should not follow the example of the industrialised countries in terms of pollution."
"Given that all countries have the right to appropriate development, they must be granted the necessary backing for that appropriate development to take place."
"Global climate change constitutes a problem we believe there are good reasons for dealing with at international level."
"The EU is one of several international organisations that have an important task to perform in this connection."
"We question, however, why the European Parliament needs to call upon the Member States and the future Presidencies to act in a certain way on climate issues."
"The resolution contains political views concerning energy issues and the Kyoto Protocol, as well as instructions as to the way in which third countries such as China, India and the United States should act."
"We are voting against this resolution. Our reason for adopting this position is that we believe that the national parliaments should decide of their own accord upon their respective commitments and positions concerning political issues and do so within international organisations."
"The report contains exhortations from the European Parliament to the Member States and third countries as to how they should act on the very important climate issue."
"That is something to which we object, in spite of a number of good intentions in the proposed resolution."
". The Kyoto Protocol is rightly seen as an extremely important instrument in the field of climate change."
"It is important, however, that the statements of principle and commitments to meet obligations of various kinds, which are often publicly repeated, are followed up by practical action."
"When it comes to the environment, as with most other issues, good intentions are rarely backed up by actions."
"Speaking about them is not in any way the same as following them up."
"I therefore feel that the way forward is through serious and dispassionate study of the political and geopolitical struggle."
"We have chosen to abstain from voting on this matter."
"Many of the wordings are extremely commendable."
"We object, however, to the EU’s efforts to play a foreign policy role by making declarations concerning humanitarian disasters in the world."
"We do not believe that the EU should adopt positions on international issues on behalf of Member States and are of the view that the national parliaments should formulate their own attitudes to international issues."
"We support the Swedish Government’s position on the Sudan issue."
"Important though it is to improve the conditions in relation to democracy and human rights in Central Asia, we believe that this is not a task for the EU because this region is not in the EU’s immediate vicinity."
"These tasks are better carried out by a pan-European security organisation such as the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)."
"We welcome the declaration’s wording about strengthening the role of the OSCE but cannot support the declaration’s basic purpose: that of strengthening the EU’s foreign and security policy."
"We therefore choose to abstain from voting."
". As distinct from the experience of the European countries under Soviet domination, most of the countries of Central Asia have not followed a path worthy of our applause or satisfaction; far from it."
"Throughout the region, there are sound reasons why we are active in demonstrating our concern and why we are channelling all of our political efforts into creating a large democratic area that is characterised by freedom and respect for human rights."
"The EU’s experience, both with countries that have joined the EU and with neighbouring countries, has shown that, on this issue, and in this geographical area, the EU has the potential to exert a positive influence, which it must do with courage and determination."
"First of all, I would like to thank Mr Elmar Brok, who prepared the draft resolution on this important issue."
"The expanded European Union unifies Member States having different histories and past experiences, and they possess different approaches towards relations with Russia."
"In this Parliament there are also members with different opinions on this matter, and therefore I would like to express my pleasure that we have succeeded in adopting the resolution on the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War by such an overwhelming majority of the votes."
"There is not a single family in my country which would not be affected by the soviet occupation."
"The second occupation."
"Therefore, our resolution adopted today is also about every family in Lithuania."
"Thank you, colleagues."
"Mr President, I voted for the resolution on the sixtieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War."
"In this resolution the European Parliament has honoured the soldiers who died on all fronts during the Second World War."
"We should note in particular that this resolution consolidates, in written fashion, an understanding of the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states and the Stalinist Soviet Union’s dictatorship in eastern and central Europe."
"Today we would like to reveal the whole truth about the Second World War, regardless of its unpalatability to any of the parties involved."
"I believe that this resolution, which also contains an appeal to make archive documents accessible for research throughout the world, will be a starting-point for substantial joint work in the future."
"Fabrications and speculations persist only in the absence of truth."
"We must not allow this to continue any longer!"
"I call for the continuation of investigation into the truth about totalitarianism, regardless of ideology."
"I call for this truth to be made public!"
"Historical truth also demands international condemnation of Soviet totalitarian Communism."
"Therefore, in full awareness of my responsibility towards voters from my party, the New Era Party, I voted for this resolution."
"Mr President, with regard to the motion on the end of the Second World War, the Italian delegation has voted in favour of the resolution, despite having many doubts about its content."
"We voted out of a sense of responsibility and because we recognise that it is the product of a compromise among the various trends within Parliament; we stress, moreover, that it is not the responsibility of Parliament to write, comment on, or confound history."
"For this reason, we regret the inexplicable absence in the text of any reference whatsoever to the European Resistance, which played a significant part in the defeat of Nazi-Fascism and in establishing freedom in this continent."
"Mr President, I voted for Mr Brok’s resolution."
"However, bearing in mind that this is a very important step forward, the EU’s historic approach is still not fully balanced and the victims of communism still have a second-class status."
"Therefore, for the future, we need to have a complete knowledge of the history of Yalta and its consequences."
"This is also important for EU-Russia relations."
"We should urge Russia to assess its own history – including the reoccupation and annexation of the Baltic States – and to apologise for the crimes the Russian Soviet totalitarians committed."
"Mr President, I, too, voted in favour of the resolution."
"As a German, I am grateful to all those who freed us from National Socialism when we, unfortunately, were unable to throw off its yoke ourselves."
"It started by depriving the German people of their rights, blinding many of them, and then plunged nearly the whole of Europe into war and violence."
"As a West German, I am grateful to those who liberated us, above all the Americans, without whose presence for decades democracy would not have been able to establish itself within our borders and elsewhere."
"Along with the victims who suffered up to and including 8 May, there were, in Europe’s Eastern half, victims after 8 May: the innocent victims of a change of dictatorship from National Socialism to the Soviet tyranny that it took 45 years to bring down."
"The Russia of today should acknowledge that people from Tallinn to Leipzig, from Warsaw to Varna, could not accept that what the Soviet Union imposed on them after Hitler’s demise was freedom."
"Along with them, the Germans to the east of the three Western zones paid far more for Hitler’s crimes than we did, for we were fortunate enough to be able, very soon, to play a part in the project that was and still is the answer to all the challenges of totalitarianism: the European Union."
"So let us, in future, make a better job of things in Europe!"
"Mr President, the resolution on the future of Europe contains part of the historical truth."
"I congratulate our colleagues here."
"The remarks made about the War and post-war relations also mention the captive nations left behind the Iron Curtain."
"In 1988 and 1991, the Russian people were considered, and often acted, as one of those captive nations, striving for democracy on the same side of the barricades with us, the Baltic nations, against Soviet totalitarianism."
"Mr Putin does not remember that because, at the time, he was still acting against Germany."
"Today’s leadership of Russia is not making much of an effort to turn that conception of self-determination from the political and moral status of formerly captive nations to that of a nation."
"Therefore, the dismantling of the former captive nations is treated now in Moscow as the greatest tragedy for one of them."
"Allegedly, the Russians were different from others in their prisons."
"Such a misunderstanding is not just insulting and spiritually destructive for the ordinary Russian people, but also harmful for sincere cooperation."
"Mr President, you have a difficult task in this undertaking to urge the current Russian leadership to abandon their legacy of Soviet mindset and stop deploring everyday Russia’s captivating past."
"Our resolution opens the way for that."
"Distinguished Mr President, I voted for the resolution ‘Future of Europe Sixty Years after the Second World War’ and I want to thank all of my colleagues who supported it."
"This resolution is a huge moral satisfaction for all who experienced the sufferings of World War II and any violence after it."
"Many of them no longer live and those who do are thankful that the European Parliament has not forgotten."
"I thank on behalf of my father, Štefan Kányai, who experienced almost nine years of hell in a Russian gulag."
"It will be a source of knowledge for young people, who, thank God, have not experienced a war, to learn a lesson from the past and build a free and peaceful future of Europe."
"We object to wordings inserted into the text as contributions concerning the EU’s future and method of working."
"There is a belief that the building of a federal EU will create peace, with NATO’s role in Europe and the world being simultaneously reduced."
"There are also many other things to add to a resolution dealing with the end of the Second World War."
"Canada’s important role in the final victory must not be forgotten."
"Nor should the American presence in Europe in the post-war period be forgotten in the context of preserving peace."
"We particularly object to the wordings in paragraphs 1, 7 and 8 of the draft resolution."
"In order to honour the victims of the war, we have, however, chosen to vote in favour of the resolution as a whole."
". The resolution adopted today by the majority of the Members of this House is not about the 60th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Fascism."
"The actual aim of this resolution is to condemn the Soviet Union."
"It is an attempt to airbrush out of the picture its decisive role in the defeat of Nazi Fascism in 1945; its defence of peace and its opposition to the brutality of imperialism; its role in the enormous advances in the standard of living of millions of workers; its solidarity with dozens of peoples seeking to gain their independence and sovereignty; and its contribution towards their release from the yoke of colonialism and towards the correlation of forces that took place after the end of World War II."
"This Parliament resolution is an appalling and shameful exercise in revisionism."
"Among many other serious problems, it is at the very least a distortion of history to say, as the resolution does, that ‘European integration’ helped to get rid of fascism in Portugal, when Portugal was a Member of NATO from the outset; when the fascist regime benefited from the connivance of the governments of many countries taking part in the so-called ‘European integration’; and when those countries supported the colonial war effort undertaken by the Portuguese fascist regime."
". I and my British Conservative colleagues have voted in favour of this Motion which commemorates the suffering of the millions who died at the hands of Nazi tyranny."
"We fully endorse gratitude expressed in the motion for those who gave their lives in the liberation of Europe."
"In particular, we give thanks for the bravery and sacrifice of the millions of British men and women who, under the leadership of Winston Churchill, played such a crucial part in liberating so many people."
"We endorse the motion's recognition of the freeing of the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe from the yoke of Communism and their fight for liberty."
"The enlargement of the European Union to include the former Communist states is something British Conservatives have long sought."
"Their role in our future is of vital importance."
"However, we requested a number of separate votes in this motion where the text refers to ‘European integration’, a term associated with political integration."
"British Conservatives acknowledge that the EU has made a significant contribution to peace among the nations of our Continent."
"But, we believe that the EU should develop as a partnership of independent nation states, not as a single federal entity."
". Today, this House adopted a resolution about the future of Europe 60 years after the Second World War."
"The resolution attempts to give an overall analysis of European history over the past 60 years, including Nazism, Stalinism, occupation, freedom, and much more."
"Much as I agree with the gist of the resolution, the European Parliament is a political body rather than a congress of historians."
"Our role cannot be to type out on a word processor, in the space of a week and a half, an analysis of recent European political history."
"We should stick to what we are good at, and it is for that reason that I have abstained from the vote."
". Whilst we wish to commemorate the end of the second world war in Europe, this document amounts to a re-write of history, even stating in the title that World War 11 ended on 8th May 1945, which it did not as the world still faced Japan."
"The addition of propaganda that the EU is somehow involved in the subsequent peace is objectionable to me and to the seven members of my family who fought in that war against the Axis."
"I note that on the schedule this resolution was entitled ‘Future of Europe’ whereas the actual resolution is entitled ‘60th Anniversary of the end of the Second World War on 8 May 1945’."
"The EP should be specific when making resolutions."
"For the above reasons, I voted against this resolution."
".– We voted against the disgraceful resolution which uses Goebbels' methods to pervert and distort history."
"The communists and the Soviet Union, who were at the vanguard of the resistance, the sacrifices and the defeat of fascism, are being slandered by the very political powers which nourished, supported or tolerated the rise of fascism."
"Today, in calling the liberation of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe by the Red Army a new occupation, they are giving political support to the restoration of Nazi symbols; they are giving a political alibi to the SS collaborators and fascism in those countries."
"Fascism was born of capitalism."
"The attempt to pervert history is an attempt to poison the conscience of younger generations, so that they accept the crimes of imperialism today, and to stop them fighting to overturn them."
"This rabid anti-communist attack will not stop society from moving towards socialism."
"The message of the victory over fascism is alive and topical."
"It is directly linked to the united fight of the peoples against imperialist barbarism."
"We remember that, however strong the fascist axis appeared to be, it did not avoid being crushed and did not prevent the red flag with the hammer and sickle from being hoisted on the Reichstag, symbolising its defeat by socialism."
"The same fate is in store for the unfair, exploitative capitalist system."
"Distinguished Mr President, I voted for the resolution ‘Future of Europe Sixty Years after the Second World War’ and I want to thank all of my colleagues who supported it."
"This resolution is a huge moral satisfaction for all who experienced the sufferings of World War II and any violence after it."
"Many of them no longer live and those who do are thankful that the European Parliament has not forgotten."
"I thank on behalf of my father, Štefan Kányai, who experienced almost nine years of hell in a Russian gulag."
"It will be a source of knowledge for young people, who, thank God, have not experienced a war, to learn a lesson from the past and build a free and peaceful future of Europe."
". We all feel the widespread revulsion at the horrors of World War II, and feel the need to recall what the human race, communities and individuals were capable of doing."
"We therefore sincerely share the feeling that this occasion should above all serve to say: never again."
"What is more, this is the root of the establishment of the EU."
"Other memories should not be overlooked, however."
"For the countries of Eastern Europe, especially the Baltic States, the celebration of the end of the war is not exactly a celebration of freedom, in light of the fact that the liberators were the Soviet military, which did not start to leave until 1989."
"Consequently, while it may seem irrelevant to mention the Soviet Empire in the same breath as the end of the war, it is not irrelevant from the point of view of that part of the world, given that one blended into the other."
"Furthermore, how is it possible to celebrate the liberation, as though pretending that the liberation was not followed by occupation?"
"We cannot."
"If we want peace, we need the truth."
"We therefore celebrate the end of the Second World War, but let us not think that the horrors finished there."
"Other people’s memories must also form part of our memory."
"I was opposed to this debate ending with a resolution, and I have to say that the poverty of our document confirms my fears."
"I have therefore chosen to abstain."
"The debate was valuable and enlightening and no doubt one of the most important we have held within this new Parliament, which constitutes an enlarged Assembly following the reunification of Europe."
"What we have is a mosaic of histories that together spell History writ large."
"The debate has been enriched by the vision and perception of all those who have taken part in it and cannot, almost by definition, be the subject of a compromise document."
"All those in this House who have already negotiated resolutions of this type know that they are only a patchwork made up of each negotiator’s contributions."
"What may work for the drought in Spain is at a loss to account for the complexity of the most crucial chapter of our European history."
"The compromises mean that this document no longer has any force and no longer communicates any message."
"I personally should have liked it to have concentrated, for example, on paragraph 1, which contains its key message: to be aware of our past so that we never experience anything similar again, to keep this memory alive, to teach people about it and to pass it on."
"It is a challenge in anticipation of the day when half of our young people do not even know the name of Hitler."
". Whilst we wish to commemorate the end of the Second World War in Europe, this resolution amounts to a re-write of history, even stating in the title that World War II ended on 8 May 1945, which it did not as the world still faced Japan."
"UKIP MEPs have therefore felt obliged to vote against this resolution."
". While the Resolution has many positive points, for which I voted in favour, there are significant omissions and false emphases."
"The victory of 1945 would not have happened but for the steadfastness and courage of the United Kingdom and the British Empire fighting on alone and holding the German forces at bay for over a year after the fall of France."
"The Soviet communists were, of course, allies of the Nazis for the first 20 months of the War."
"After the War, the freedom of the West was guaranteed by the continuing engagement of US forces, through NATO, in the security of Europe."
"The United Kingdom contributed disproportionately to the success of this enterprise."
"And we should not underestimate the enormous contribution of certain key, resolute individuals - Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II - to the eventual collapse of Soviet tyranny."
"The anniversary of the end of the War should not be used as another opportunity to eulogise the role of the EU, a Project with some profoundly undemocratic aspects and which is heading in the wrong direction."
"The process of European integration is driven by a small political class and is certainly not ‘the result of a free decision by the people’."
". I reject the resolution for the following reasons."
"Firstly, it takes the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Germany and Europe as an opportunity to advance revisionist views of history by treating Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union as equivalent."
"Secondly, this assumption of equivalence minimises the crimes committed by German fascism, notably the extermination of Europe’s Jews; it is evident that the resolution’s object is to relativise this temporary abandonment of civilisation."
"The resolution makes no reference to the decisive contribution of the Soviet Union to the victory over Fascism."
"Sixty years ago, the world was liberated from Nazism, in the name of which, and with the support of business and industrial interests and a large proportion of the German people, the incomparably inhumane industrialised destruction of the Jews was decided upon, the whole of Europe plunged into war and millions of people killed."
"The most brutal means, including torture and the murder of tens of thousands, was used to put down the anti-fascist resistance, which consisted largely of Communists and Social Democrats."
"To take, today, the commemoration of the end of Nazi rule as an opportunity for depicting 1989 as the actual day of liberation, is to trivialise the Nazis’ regime of terror, to slander the Soviet Union and the immense sacrifices made by its people and the Red Army, and to encourage the resurgence of nationalism, right-wing extremism and the growing tendency to relativise the Nazis’ crimes in Europe."
"It is quite another signal that is needed, in the shape of an unequivocal and explicit commitment never to allow fascism another chance in Europe."
"The rapporteur talks in vague terms about upgrading existing services, creating new services, making technical adjustments and expecting ‘fine-tuning’ and extra resources for information offices, mainly in Romania and Bulgaria."
"The text selected for voting on is unclear but can only be interpreted as a request for additional appropriations."
"We are opposed to increased expenditure, particularly when it is a question of proposals entailing increased administrative costs and further money for a budget heading that is often used for pure propaganda."
"We have therefore chosen to vote against the resolution as a whole."
"For 2007-2013, the European Commission proposes approximately EUR 1 000 billion in appropriations for seven years, that is, commitment appropriations to the tune of 1.24% of Europe’s GDP."
"In terms of European budgetary expenditure from 2007 to 2013, our committee entered into a simple accounting debate about whether, over seven years, EUR 1 022 billion was to be expended, as desired by the European Commission, EUR 987 billion, as proposed by our rapporteur or EUR 977 billion, as desired by those countries that are the biggest contributors."
"Instead of losing EUR 3 billion each year, France may lose EUR 5 billion or even EUR 7 billion."
"At USD 2 500 billion per year, the United States’s annual budget is 20 times greater than Europe’s."
"That says it all: Europe, with its global agenda and minuscule budget."
"Seeing this, everyone appreciates that this distortion will be untenable."
"As from 2014, two issues will arise: the explosion in the European budget and the advent of taxation."
"These are the two areas on which our committee’s resolution is silent, leaving the taxpaying electorate to vote on the European Constitution while remaining oblivious to the budget."
". This report on the estimates of revenue and expenditure of Parliament for the financial year 2006 falls within the scope of consolidating the last enlargement and preparing for the forthcoming accession of Romania and Bulgaria."
"Given that it proposes to make more efficient and streamlined use of budgetary appropriations, to make the next budget more comprehensive and better explained with a view to bringing Parliament closer to the citizens, and to enhance the quality and efficiency of its work, I have decided to vote in favour of this report."
"We are in a new cycle of international trade negotiations."
"It is staggering that we were continuing to negotiate for ever more liberalisation of world trade without ever properly taking stock of this liberalisation in economic and social terms."
"The European Union is the only political entity in the world that respects the WTO’s rules."
"It is the most open market there is, and the least protected against, for example, dumping, unfair practices and counterfeiting."
"It too often refuses to take the required retaliatory or safeguard measures, as in the case of Chinese textiles."
"At the same time as opening our economies to out-and-out competition from around the world, the EU increases the number of regulations that put our companies at a disadvantage in the face of such competition. It also makes scarcely any effort to open up to European exports those markets that are closed to them due to exorbitant customs tariffs or regulatory barriers."
"The ECB does nothing for the rate of the euro, which is notoriously overvalued, is a drain on our exports and still facilitates low-price imports."
"The rapporteur is right."
"World trade is not fair."
"With the collusion of the Commission, its main victim in terms of unemployment, an increase in poverty, company closures and the undermining of social stability is, however, Europe."
"We support the report’s general purpose: that of liberalising international trade."
"We also support the calls to phase out the export subsidies in the EU’s common agricultural policy (CAP) and give the less developed countries quota- and duty-free access to the EU’s market."
"These calls are incompatible with the wording in the report to the effect that ‘the European agricultural model’ must not be questioned (paragraph 16)."
"The liberalisation of trade policy must go hand in hand with fundamental reform of the CAP."
"We Swedish Social Democrats have chosen to vote in favour of the report on the assessment of the Doha Round following the WTO agreement."
"The general tenor of this report is constructive, because Parliament is giving its support to free and fair multilateral trading systems within the framework of sustainable development."
"We cannot, however, support paragraphs 16 and 17."
"The planned reform of agricultural policy is absolutely necessary because it is a first step on the way towards fair world trade."
"We are opposed to all the attempts to make it more difficult for developing countries to sell their products within the EU."
"Access by the developing countries to the EU’s market must be given priority over continued agricultural aid."
". The agreement reached in Geneva, July 2004 was vital for keeping the Doha Development Round on track."
"However, the Geneva agreement merely set out a roadmap."
"The really difficult decisions are still to be made."
"The EU must show serious intent with regard to ending agricultural subsidies."
"Third countries must make concessions on market access for non-agricultural products."
"Pressure must be removed from developing countries as regards services and the so-called Singapore Issues."
"A successful agreement on world trade this December in Hong Kong could do much to reduce poverty and despair in the world."
". The development of international trade is one of the most effective weapons in the fight against inequality between countries."
"The surest way for people to achieve progress, peace and human development is for them to have the opportunity to produce, to place what they produce on the world market and to be able to acquire new products, based on fair competition rules, on proper monitoring, on respect for the principles of defending human rights, on protecting the environment and on sustainable development."
"It is therefore up to governments to act responsibly, with determination and with awareness of the importance of what is at stake."
". The implementation of the European Union's information and communication strategy is of the greatest importance given that public awareness of EU matters has in the past often been affected by a lack of consistency, particularly in Member State government dissemination of information, and by polemical reporting in some sections of the press."
"I shall be recommending to my national delegation colleagues that they abstain on the overall vote for a number of reasons including the section of the report concerning ratification of the European Constitutional Treaty."
"This must primarily be a matter for each Member State to decide."
"It is by its very nature a controversial issue and public opinion could be unduly influenced one way or the other if it were felt that pressure were being exerted from non Member State sources."
". A good information and communication policy should improve citizens’ perception of the EU by raising their awareness of the European dimension of citizenship and by showing them the practical benefits in their day-to-day lives of belonging to the Union."
"I regret that the EU’s information and communication strategy has fallen well short of its objectives."
"According to Eurobarometer, the level of public knowledge of basic EU matters is very low and there was a record low turnout for the last elections to Parliament."
"I therefore endorse the idea of creating a decentralised information system, whereby the information goes looking for the citizen. This will be complemented by an interinstitutional strategy aimed at strengthening the EU’s image and at stepping up cooperation between the Commission and Parliament, in order to make the best possible use of human and material resources."
"This must also involve the Member States and national governments, in conjunction with the European institutions, so that we can derive the maximum benefit from the institutions’ common strategy, and thus ensure maximum impact at local and regional level, which would be to the benefit of the Union and all of its citizens."
". The EU’s information and communication strategy must always be objective and respect pluralism, cultural diversity and human rights."
"The events we have witnessed, particularly recently in the context of the so-called draft constitutional treaty, have been examples of neither objectivity nor pluralism."
"What we have seen is a major propaganda campaign that does not respect pluralism and the different opinions held by the Members of this House, nor does it take into account the spectrum of opinions held by the public."
"This report is a clear example of manipulation dressed up as the EU’s information and communication strategy."
"Take Article 40, for example: ‘have the political responsibility to support the ratification of the Constitution’."
"It also overlooks opposing opinions."
"Unfortunately, various proposals that would have improved the report were rejected in the vote in plenary. We therefore had no choice but to vote against."
"What is ‘factual’ information and what is ‘false’ information about the EU?"
"What is information about the ‘European idea’?"
"Obviously, information about political institutions bears the imprint of political values."
"Facts can be distorted, and a mere selection of facts can be presented in order to influence people."
"In our view, an information strategy should provide scope in the political debate for all views, ranging from those of people who recommend increased supranational government of the EU to those of people who recommend strictly intergovernmental cooperation."
"An institution like the Commission must not argue in favour of the draft Constitutional treaty or of the development of increased supranationalism in the EU."
"For example, the proposal in paragraph 9 of the report that the EU institutions should reach agreements with TV companies able to produce drama series, game shows and films etc designed to promote the EU’s ideas and values is downright ridiculous."
"Some of the EU institutions’ information material goes beyond what may be regarded as factual information, and some of the information about the EU aimed at children and young people should never have been given out."
"In a democracy, a variety of players should engage in free and open debate."
"There should be no player promoting a political line ‘from above’ with the help of taxpayers’ money."
"The Moderate delegation has today voted against the report on the European Union’s information and communication strategy."
"We are of the view that a political institution such as the European Parliament should not be used for opinion forming geared to certain ideas or for influencing the media to act in a particular way in relation to the political debate being conducted in the Member States."
"This report is a real gem of official propaganda in which the Commission and the governments surpass themselves in building their new world."
"This document demonstrates, if there were still a need to do so, that the European project is firstly a totalitarian project aimed at inculcating a new way of thinking, behaving and living."
"The foundations of European policy are characterised by utopia, demagogy, political correctness and the absence of any reference to the values on which our civilisation is based."
"To this desire to have people forget what we are, on the model of the Communists who wished to make a blank sheet of the past, can be added a commercial dimension whereby the EU’s communication strategy inevitably becomes subject to market principles, to the point at which there is talk of promoting a ‘Europe’ brand in the same way as an everyday packet of washing powder."
"Children, seen by the fervent supporters of Europe as being more malleable, are the preferred target of this communication."
"A promise is even made to them to ‘define the soul’ of this new Europe - an odd term, ‘soul’, when you have rejected any Christian references in your draft Constitution."
"Either one has, or does not have, a soul, and Europe has nothing of the kind."
"As a cherry on the cake, the possibility is raised of allocating financial bonuses to media that have apparently been able to communicate the European idea and European values. Corruption is being reinvented, but at European level."
"That is a good start!"
"The European project that you are constructing for us is a monstrous one, so reminiscent is it of methods and procedures that have proved themselves in other totalitarian systems remembered with horror."
"Never forget, however, that resistance to oppression is an inalienable right of peoples who wish to remain free."
". I welcome this report and the rapporteur's recognition of the importance of a more effective communication strategy."
"I am pleased to see the Commission recognising the need to improve communication with citizens and agree with the rapporteur that it is vital Europe be bought closer to its citizens."
"This is particularly pertinent in light of the continued decline in European Parliament election turn-outs, reaching a record low of 45.7% in 2004."
"A more effective Communication strategy will do much to counter the Euro-myths propagated throughout the EU."
"The political institutions can have but one communication strategy: truth and transparency, in tandem with a readiness to listen as much as to make ourselves heard."
"Even if it is true that the vast majority of Europe’s citizens feel close to the essence of the spirit of the EU, it is nonetheless also true that that there is a sense of alienation when it comes to its day-to-day running, and with regard to the content of some of its texts."
"The prime objective is, therefore, by means of transparency and truth, and complete respect for pluralism, to increase the visibility of what the Union is, and to pay attention to what the citizens are saying."
"There are two sides to all forms of communication and this is one of its most democratic characteristics."
"Let us therefore take this on board."
"Like motherhood and apple pie, information and communication are what almost all of us in the European Union can believe in."
"This really is the only topic that unites us."
"From left to right of the Chamber, we are all agreed in lamenting the disastrous shortage of information and communication."
"It is a black hole in which sceptics of all kinds are swallowed up, there to dispense their venom."
"One has only to consider the debate that is raging in France at present."
"The ‘no’ camp will stoop to lying in any way in order to advance its cause."
"In the name of Europe, is nothing sacred?"
"How paradoxical it is, too, that Commissioner for Communication Mrs Wallström, who took part in the debate, had a ten times higher profile with her previous portfolio - that of the environment – than with this one, which should however thrust her centre-stage."
"Poor old Europe, the ‘non-communicable’ subject, it would appear."
"I have no magic solution, any more than anyone else has."
"Just a few certainties."
"I am certain, for example, about paragraph 5 of our report, which is about teaching Europe in schools, explaining it, recounting it and decoding it, and doing so in a lively way involving dialogues, exchanges and visits."
"This is a crucial task, and not an impossible one. Having spent six years replying to the questions of thousands of secondary school pupils, I personally know that, for them, the EU will never again be a merely virtual object."
"The next item is the Commission statement on the drought in Spain."
". Mr President, the Commission is fully aware of how serious the drought is in Spain."
"It understands the concerns in this respect and is determined to help."
"There exist today means which provide possibilities in situations such as this."
"The Commission has already issued, on 10 May, a decision allowing areas in set aside to be used for grazing animals in nine independent communities in Spain."
"However, the Commission has received no other specific request on the part of the Spanish authorities in connection with the application of direct aid schemes within the framework of the situation created by the cold weather and the drought."
"Any request submitted by the Spanish authorities to the Commission, for example for payment of advances, will be given serious consideration."
"The Commission's response will be based on current legislative provisions, taking account of the budget available."
"The Commission has issued a communication, in which it outlines the various alternative possibilities for combating the dangers and crises in farming."
"As talks on this issue are at a very early stage in all the institutions, it is too early for the Commission to commit to specific action, even pilot action."
"Nonetheless, I can say that the Commission, in response to a request from the European Parliament, will shortly set a pilot study in motion on the subject of farm insurance schemes."
"Within this framework, I should also like to refer to the question of transferring intervention reserves raised in the resolution."
"The Commission is firmly against this sort of transfer, in order to avoid distortions of the market which put local and regional producers and wholesalers at a disadvantage."
"As regards the call for flexibility in the common market organisation in fruit and vegetables in the resolution, the Spanish authorities are responsible for this matter, subject to certain criteria."
"Although there are possibilities for using rural development resources to relieve producers hit by the drought or cold weather, the Commission has not as yet received any such request from the Spanish authorities."
"If such a request is submitted, the Commission will examine it immediately, so that it can do whatever possible."
"Within this framework, it could examine the possibility of redistributing amounts already budgeted on the basis of rural development, by channelling them to actions to reinforce measures such as 'replacing farmers' for which provision is made on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999."
"Similarly, the Spanish authorities, as happened in the case of Portugal, could examine the possibility of derogations from the application of certain measures, such as agricultural environmental measures, by notifying the Commission of cases recognised as cases of '' on the basis of Commission Regulation (EC) No 817/2004."
"As regards the risk of forest fires, certain preventive actions can be included under rural development measures financed by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999."
"The Spanish authorities could also ask for the regional programmes to be amended, in order to reinforce, within the framework of these programmes, measures to prevent forest fires."
"However, it should be mentioned that additional support based on the above measures can only be set in motion subject to compliance with the budget for existing programmes."
"As regards using the Solidarity Fund, it is true that the serious drought and cold weather may be seen as a natural disaster and, as such, to generally fall within the scope of this fund."
"However, in order to mobilise the Solidarity Fund, the interested Member State must submit the relevant application to the Commission within ten weeks of the date of the first damage noted."
"In order to qualify for aid, the calculated cost of the overall direct damage must exceed EUR 3 billion at 2002 prices or 0.6% of the gross national product of the country in question, whichever is the lower."
"This means that the damage threshold for 2005 applicable in Spain's case is just over EUR 3.1 billion at today's prices."
"The Solidarity Fund can only cover specific emergency aid measures taken by the public authorities, such as, for example, temporary replacement of infrastructures of vital importance, which will allow normal daily activity to resume."
"It is important to emphasise that the Solidarity Fund of the European Union was not set up in order to cover all the costs connected with natural disasters."
"In particular, the EU Solidarity Fund does not allow compensation for damages of a private nature, including in the agricultural sector."
"The Commission has repeatedly proven that it uses all the possibilities offered by the Solidarity Fund for the benefit of states hit by disasters, including mobilising the Solidarity Fund for the shipwreck of the ."
"However, the effort being made to achieve a degree of flexibility does not mean that certain provisions of the regulation will be overlooked."
"Similarly, as the honourable Members of Parliament will know, the Commission approved, on 6 April, a proposal for a new Solidarity Fund."
"This proposal, which will need to be examined by the Council by Parliament, makes provision, among other things, for a significant reduction in the damage threshold for mobilising the fund, extends its scope and defines a broader range of eligible actions."
"The Commission will be delighted if its proposal is supported by Parliament, given that it moves to a considerable extent in the direction being sought today."
"Finally, Spain may decide to compensate farmers with state aid for loss of income as a result of the serious drought and cold weather."
"The Spanish authorities must notify the plan to the Commission."
"It is, nonetheless, fundamental that:"
"- firstly, they must prove that the losses caused by the weather reach the 20% or 30% threshold;"
"- secondly, that there is a direct connection between the losses and the bad weather;"
"- thirdly, that there is no overcompensation of the damage caused."
"The Spanish authorities can also use the new 'de minimis' rule for state aid."
"Aid of up to EUR 3 000 per farmer may be granted for three years without notifying the Commission, provided that, among other preconditions, the upper limit applicable to Spain is not exceeded."
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for what you said."
"It clearly indicates your sensitivity towards the urgent problem, indeed the tragedy, currently facing the Spanish countryside."
"Unfortunately, you have confirmed some of my suspicions about the Spanish Government’s inertia in this connection."
"I hope that this resolution and other measures that we are adopting as a matter of urgency in this Parliament will also be a wake-up call to our government."
"Commissioner, the damage caused in Spain by the frost and drought is already in excess of EUR 2 000 million, representing a third of the aid received by our country under the common agricultural policy."
"According to the estimates made by farming organisations, the effects of the bad climatic conditions suffered in January, February and March will go on being felt for a number of years, since a substantial number of trees have been lost, and farmers will not regain their productive capacity in the short term."
"What has been most affected is production in terms of fruit, olives, plants, flowers and crops."
"Cattle breeding has also been affected by the loss of pastureland and the damage caused to the water supply."
"This is a pressing matter in my own region – that of the Balearic Islands – where, in Menorca, there is currently a shortage of more than 1 500 tonnes of food for the animals – a very serious situation for them."
"The shortage of pastureland, combined with the problems in piping water to farms, has also caused extraordinary harm to cattle throughout Spain."
"The increase in fuel prices also exacerbates an already critical situation, so it would be as well to take account of the requests that are being made for a European directive to be prepared that would slow down this increase in fuel prices, which is such a burden on our farmers."
"The Spanish regions most affected by this frost and drought are as follows: Valencia, Murcia and Andalusia, where 50 000 hectares of olives may disappear, with a major environmental disaster somewhere along the line and, shortly afterwards, a possible process of desertification;"
"Aragon, Castille-La Mancha, Catalonia, Estremadura and, as I said, the Balearics; and La Rioja, with its vineyards, and Galicia."
"The European Union should devise specific instruments for tackling extreme situations such as this disaster happening in Spain."
"I should be grateful to you, Commissioner, if the matter of this insurance fund could also be addressed."
"These are practical measures that need to be implemented as soon as possible."
"The Solidarity Fund was set up a few years ago following the floods, remembered by all of us, in the centre of Europe."
"As you mentioned, it was also used for some very practical measures."
"Think of the aid granted to Spain following the accident involving the , the funds duly requested by the People’s Party government or the money used to restore the vegetation in a number of areas affected by the fires."
"At the present time, Community solidarity should also be demonstrated through the release of resources from this fund to cover, at least, the costs sustained by many Spanish farmers due to loss of productive capacity, since the frost in question has damaged numerous plantations, often irreversibly."
"As your draft resolution points out, the frost and drought are causing damage to the economies and living conditions of many areas this year."
"Mr President, I shall attempt to sum up."
"Taking advantage of the presence of the Commissioner, I should like to urge the Commission to be flexible, since the situation experienced in Spain is ultimately the result of a climate disaster, the kind of event for which this Solidarity Fund was first set up."
"Apart from referring to this fund, the resolution also mentions simple measures that can be applied."
"I hope that the Spanish Government will act quickly and that we shall be able to implement these measures."
"My political group has proposed this series of measures in this resolution, and I hope that they will be approved by plenary."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his understanding remarks about an extremely serious problem in Spain which, in my own region of Aragon, as well as in the Pyrenees, is coming to a head in a way that may have a series of repercussions over the next few years."
"I also want to say that this is due in part to the fact that the previous government did not put the plans relating to drought into effect."
"These were to have been fully implemented by 2003, and we are attempting right now to make up for this failure."
"We must, however, focus in any case on current measures with a view to the future, and it must also be said that the government has now already made contact with the services of the Commission, even if it has not yet got the assessment under way in practical terms."
"This is because the frost damage is being assessed throughout the south."
"A start has now been made on assessing the impact in the north of Spain, specifically throughout the northern half of Spain."
"As I said, our government has already been in contact with your services, and the interventions both of our government and of Commissioner Fischer Boel in recent days are a specific incentive to conclude this assessment, which was obviously going to require more time than had been expected because of the problems I mentioned, relating to the frost."
"The measures proposed by our Socialist Group in the European Parliament are, specifically, this flexibility that the Commission is planning to apply, the anticipated aid, the release of grain reserves for livestock – which are also in a very critical situation – and flexibility in also making available to such livestock fields and pastureland that have been taken out of cultivation."
"We also put forward the proposal – and I hope that the Commission will be alert to this – for special attention to be paid to preventing the fire risk that, throughout the northern part of Spain and especially in Galicia, will increase over the next few months, and we should naturally also like to demand or propose that special consideration be given to the problem of drought in the context of the Solidarity Fund, which is now being adapted."
"Finally, we would ask the Commission to establish a European Drought Observatory because we believe that this drought is neither unique nor peculiar to the present time but that, precisely because of the climate change that is under way, it will become a structural phenomenon."
"We would ask the Commission, then, to coordinate all the preventive and remedial actions and all other possible measures, from the environmental to the agricultural, in order to ensure that this European Drought Observatory can prevent future problems."
"Mr President, this resolution begins with a long list of the problems that have affected Spain."
"Unfortunately, these are no isolated phenomena. We remember the heatwave in France last year."
"The fact is that nine of the ten hottest years during the last 500 years have now occurred during the last ten years."
"Moreover, it is not good enough merely to alter agricultural policy in order to compensate farmers who are affected."
"We must have plans for dealing with disasters, but the big plan expected of us in this House today by future generations is one designed to combat climate change. Otherwise, what has happened in Spain will just be the first in a long list of disasters in which people, animals and natural features suffer as a result of climate change."
"Climate research shows unambiguously that not even our ambitious objective of a no more than two-degree temperature increase will be achieved with the objectives we have set for emissions reductions. On the contrary, a much more vigorous policy is required."
"We must not adjust policy in the wake of disasters. Rather, we must adjust policy in order to remove the reason why disasters occur."
"The former Spanish Government, which for a long time fought EU initiatives to introduce climate taxes and to alter the energy system with a view to protecting the climate, must, in actual fact, be criticised on this point."
"If this fight against constructive work on climate change continues, Spain will be hit on further occasions too."
"I therefore hope that, on behalf both of future generations of Spaniards and of people in the rest of the world, the Spanish Government will now place itself in the forefront of combating climate change on our earth."
"– I should first like to apologise on behalf of Mr Meyer, a Spanish Member of my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, who is not able to take part in this debate, due to the air transport problems that you mentioned, Mr President."
"In any event, the problem of the drought in Spain is also a problem in Portugal."
"The entire Iberian Peninsula is suffering the consequences of the drought that has already lasted for many months and that, in tandem with the frost, has had a devastating effect on vegetables, flowers, grasses and fruit trees, and on livestock and certain manufacturing sectors."
"In many towns in Portugal, however, there is even a risk that there will not be enough water to supply the population. I should therefore like to stress at this point that water is an irreplaceable public asset and a universal human right, which must be protected and which must not, under any circumstances, be treated as merchandise."
"In addition to standing shoulder to shoulder with Spanish and Portuguese arable and livestock farmers, we are also showing solidarity with the towns and populations affected by a tragedy that could have serious consequences in the not too distant future."
"Whilst it is important to take one-off measures, such measures do not take account of the fact that the situation could last for many more months, due to the shortage of seed and cattle feed."
"We are similarly concerned about the risk of forest fires, and various regions are already under threat. We therefore feel that effective action must be taken, as a matter of urgency."
"What is needed is an effective, Community-wide system to protect European farmers from the risks and crises of the situation in Portugal and Spain."
"It should be borne in mind that the reform of the common agricultural policy forces farmers to take responsibility for managing the risks that had previously been absorbed by policies supporting the market and prices."
"As a result of trade liberalisation, farming is now much more vulnerable to specific risks and crises that are beyond the farmers’ control."
"It is therefore not enough to say that a study is due to be carried out into the pilot project study agreed in the 2005 budgetary process to set up a Community insurance scheme."
"We must press ahead more quickly with the creation of a compensation mechanism such as a farmers’ insurance scheme financed by Community funds, aimed at offsetting the effects of natural disasters such as droughts and forest fires, by guaranteeing a minimum income for farmers."
"We also urge greater openness and flexibility so that resources from the solidarity fund can be used to minimise the damage to production capacity in a large number of regions and to remedy the most serious cases in Portugal and Spain. That way, the standard of living and economic stability in many regions will not be affected."
"There must also be financial support to offset the rise in costs and the reduction in agricultural production and in farmers’ incomes. Full-time farmers on low incomes must also be temporarily exempt from social security contributions, without loss of rights, and seasonal credits must also be extended for two years, interest-free."
"We also feel it is important to look into the possibility of setting up a European Drought Observatory and of taking action to encourage people to use water more sensibly."
"– Mr President, on the occasion of my first speech in this House with you in the chair, I should like, if I may, to heartily congratulate you on your election and to say not only that I hold you in high regard, but also that I consider you a great friend."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, on 14 April, in this House of European Democracy, Mr Casaca expressed his solidarity with the people worst affected by the drought, especially the farmers of the South of Portugal and the region, as well as the farmers of regions such as Seville, Huelva, Badajoz and Cáceres."
"Unfortunately, drought cuts across national borders."
"This is a genuine, large-scale, natural disaster, on which the European institutions, and consequently Parliament, must focus a great deal of attention."
"Accordingly, to pick up last month’s debate, we wish to restate our solidarity with Spain and with Spanish farmers."
"Crop and livestock farmers, and producers of forest products, must be compensated for the considerable losses that they have suffered and will continue to suffer."
"We must minimise the effects of the drought suffered by workers who depend on crops, livestock and forests and who have already lost their jobs, or whose jobs are under serious threat."
"In Spain and in Portugal, exceptional measures must urgently be taken to promote jobs in the affected areas."
"In my country, the Farming, Food and Forestry Union puts the number of workers who have already lost their jobs, or are in danger of losing their jobs, at 50 000. This situation is expected to worsen as stocks in water protection areas and in groundwater run out, and given the impossibility of operating irrigation channels."
"In Portugal and in Spain, it is the oak groves that are under the greatest threat."
"Thousands of Iberian oak and holly oak trees are in the throes of death."
"Major regions of the Iberian Peninsula are on the brink of desertification."
"We are not embellishing a situation that is genuinely dramatic."
"My description of events is based purely and simply on objective facts and realistic parameters."
"Desperate times call for desperate measures."
"The European institutions have not ignored this disaster."
"The Commission, for example, has committed itself to providing assistance in its resolution, which we note and welcome."
"At European level, however, we must do more and do better; the support that has been offered must be stepped up and a multifaceted programme of action – given that the situation is complicated by a wide variety of factors – must be drawn up and implemented."
"The Europe that we are constructing must be a thing of great substance, hence my words today, which are both an overview and a call for action; an overview and a call for action not addressed to the deaf and the mute, but to each and every one of you, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner."
"I address these remarks primarily to your conscience, as free, fair and fraternal men and women."
"We are counting on you."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that we are all aware of the same problem and that we all know that this is not a problem for political parties but a problem at state level for each of our countries."
"It is a European problem, the tackling of which has, for many years, been postponed when dealing with overall policy."
"I think it is very important to bear in mind that drought is a disaster which, moreover, also afflicts areas least able to be defended against water shortages or bouts of frost."
"My fellow MEPs have already talked about the tragedy of losing more than EUR 2 000 million."
"For myself, I should like, however, also to talk about the human factor."
"I walk every weekend through my own region and know what it is to see black trees that will never grow again."
"I know the nature of a people like that of the Mediterranean region in which those with substantial farms, in many cases on the verge of retiring from farming with no one to take over from them, also think that the trees being planted will take more than six years to grow."
"As a result of this disaster, much of the land will go uncultivated and will be liable to end up as mere desert."
"Let us not forget – and this is an important factor – that, in the future impact assessment, due weight will need to be given to the fact that it is, for example, the very olive groves and almond trees that are key factors in preventing desertification and preserving the scarce rain in our soil."
"Nor must we forget that livestock are dying of thirst."
"The other day, a shepherd told me, ‘twenty-five per cent of my livestock will be going to the slaughterhouse this year."
"I cannot keep so much livestock."
"I have no water."
"The animals are thirsty’."
"I want to say something more."
"The Natura 2000 network, about which Europe is so concerned, is in danger because the wetlands are without water."
"Those of us who live at this Mediterranean latitude in Murcia, Valencia or Andalusia know perfectly well that the birds are already no longer heard in the mornings because they have gone to places where they can drink."
"Even if householders put water out for them to drink, that is not enough because they lack not only drink but also food."
"That much is obvious, and Europe will need to include the fact among the variables it will have to study."
"There is a series of measures proposed by the European Union."
"I am grateful for what you said, Commissioner, about forestry aid, but let us bear in mind that the summer has not yet begun."
"The Mediterranean climate, pitiless as it is, is really going to put us through it because our situation is already critical."
"It is May, and it has not rained."
"I am also grateful for the idea of a pilot study, but I would point out that such a pilot study will have to be comprehensive."
"Not only has my government acted belatedly, but it has taken measures that will exacerbate the situation."
"Why?"
"Specifically because, four years ago, this Commission was presented with a National Hydrological Plan whereby water would be carried to these regions, indeed to the whole of the agricultural area."
"The European Commission delayed accepting the plan, the subject became politicised and, in the end, the Spanish Government kept the water where it was."
"Water is what, moreover, would have enabled the wetlands to thrive."
"It would have created a degree of hope and enabled the trees planted to replace those seriously affected by the frost or drought to grow again."
"We now face bleak prospects, a plan having been shelved for entirely political reasons."
". Mr President, I should like to thank all the honourable Members for their reaction to this Commission statement."
"I should like to make a number of brief comments:"
"First of all, the Commission has repeatedly demonstrated that it is flexible and that it uses all the possibilities at its disposal, such as, for example, the Solidarity Fund, which it tried to use in order to respond to requests from various countries including, as I mentioned earlier, Spain in the case of the ."
"I should like to say to Mr López, as regards the question of insurance, which is extremely important that, as I mentioned in my initial statement, we have set in motion and have in fact already started this study."
"We do not yet have any results but, in all events, they will form part of the more general debate on combating and managing the dangers and crises in farming."
"In reply to Mrs Figueiredo, I should like to say that, as far as insuring farmers' income is concerned, this runs counter to the principle behind the revised Community agricultural policy and most of the issues she referred to come within the jurisdiction of the Member States."
"In all events, as I said in my initial statement, the national government has the facility, without any other procedure, to pay EUR 3 000 to farmers who have sustained losses."
"Mr Schlyter's comments on the adjustments needed in various countries in order to combat climate change are absolutely correct."
"In Buenos Aires we agreed, within the framework of the United Nations, on the adjustments needed in all countries, especially in very poor countries, which have trouble meeting requirements caused by the overheating of the planet and, of course, in the Member States of the European Union, where measures of this sort are needed."
"It should be noted that the Mediterranean will face an even bigger problem from climate change, given that the temperature has risen over the last 100 years by 0.6°C in the world as a whole, but by approximately 0.9°C in the Mediterranean."
"In other words, we had a far bigger increase in temperature and, as a result, many more problems, including the problem of drought."
"That is why Mrs Ayala's proposal on a drought and forest fire observatory is very interesting."
"The Commission is examining this proposal and evaluating the possibility of creating such an observatory, but has not taken a decision in this respect."
"Finally, I should like to mention that the Commission is particularly concerned about the situation prevailing in Spain."
"We have already taken a number of actions to help farmers and their families, which will, in turn, help the agricultural economies which have been hit."
"For the time being, preliminary preparations are being made for a number of additional actions and, at the same time, my colleague and Commissioner with jurisdiction, Mrs Fischer Boel, is in close contact with the Spanish Minister of Agriculture."
"I have taken note of the various important comments made and, of course, I shall pass them on to my colleague who, I am sure, will take them into serious account."
"Mr President, I want to say to the Commissioner that, previously, when he remarked that they had not received the letter from the Spanish authorities, I was rather confused because I had been told that it had in fact been sent."
"I have now confirmed this."
"The letter from the Spanish authorities was in fact sent out last week, so that, if it has not yet arrived in the Commission’s post, it should be about to do so."
"I have received four motions for resolutions to close the debate, in accordance with Rule 108(5).(1)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place immediately following the ongoing debates."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Togo.(1)"
". I represent Scotland, on the north-west frontier of our European continent."
"We recreated our Scottish democracy in 1999 with the establishment of the Scots Parliament, when it was reconvened by my party president and former Member of this House, Winnie Ewing, with the words: 'The Scottish Parliament, adjourned in 1707, is hereby reconvened'."
"So why am I raising the subject of Togo and the situation there within this House?"
"Because my internationalist party is appalled by injustice wherever it occurs, and it is up to us within this House to shoulder our global responsibilities."
"Since 1999, other countries across Europe have rediscovered democracy."
"Ukraine, Georgia and others have looked to the EU for inspiration, guidance and support, as they have stepped towards democracy."
"Therefore, it is all the more important that our European Union does not lapse into double standards."
"My group and I fear that in the case of Togo the EU could be on the verge of doing precisely that."
"I would refer you to our motion for a resolution and I commend it to you."
"Last month's presidential election in Togo, on 24 April, has been marred by allegations of massive vote fraud, even including allegations that almost a million phantom voters were created, swelling the ranks of those eligible to vote by one third."
"The response of the EU to this, and to the resulting deterioration within Togo itself, is in marked contrast to the inspirational response of this House and our European Union to the situation in Ukraine."
"In a statement last Friday, our European Commissioner, Mr Michel, said that the EU would be watching to see whether Togo complied with pledges it made last year to respect human rights and public liberties."
"My group says that we need to do more than watch."
"Our resolution sets out rational, reasonable, sensible and constructive measures, which we in the EU could take to support Togo."
"I am glad the Commission is committed to watch."
"What my group wants to know is: what is it going to do?"
". Mr President, on 21 April, at Bamako in Mali, a neighbouring country to Togo, a meeting was held of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly of the EU and the African, Caribbean and Pacific states."
"Three days before Togo went to the polls, we had vigorous debates on the situation there."
"The situation was, unfortunately, that, of the two sides in the debate, the Europeans took the view that something was amiss in Togo, while most of the African delegates, in particular, protested when we tried to declare in advance of the election that it was neither free nor fair."
"We were, unfortunately, right, for it was clear even before the election that no attempt was being made to keep to what had been agreed with help of the regional economic union in West Africa, ECOWAS, namely that opposition parties would be allowed to take part in the preparations for the election."
"It was noted that up to a million extra voters suddenly materialised, that the issue of electoral registration cards was far from transparent, and that voters’ registers were hardly, if at all, checked."
"Incidents of violence ensued."
"We unequivocally demand that the Togolese Government, which bears full responsibility for this, should, along with all the interested parties, return to the negotiating table."
"We call on it to arrest those involved in inciting violence."
"We take the view that what we saw happening in that election cannot justify a resumption of the European Union’s cooperation with Togo."
"Under these circumstances, that is not possible."
"We therefore call on the Commission to make it quite plain to Togo how that country is to conduct itself in the coming months, so that the people there may be in no doubt about what line we take."
". – Mr President, the narrow strip of land on the west coast of Africa has been on the receiving end of criticism for many years now from the international community for systematically violating human rights and for irregularities in political governance."
"Although the political parties were formally legalised in 1991 and there has been a constitution since 1992, large international organisations, such as the United Nations, the Economic Community of West African States and the African Union, complain that there is systematic violation of human rights."
"Of course, violation of human rights is nothing new in this part of the world; it has been taking place for a great many years, for the 38-year long dictatorship of the then president, who was succeeded, when he died, by his son, who was elected as president in the recent elections."
"The outcome of the elections is of course the result of forgery."
"I do not think that there can be any doubt about that and, of course, it was the reason for the outbreak of unbridled violence, which has already cost over one hundred lives and forced eighteen and a half thousand refugees to flee to neighbouring counties."
"The European Union is rightly calling on all the political powers and institutions to demonstrate a sense of responsibility by showing full respect for human rights."
"Without fail, the twenty-two commitments which the Togo Government made and signed during consultations under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement on the question of respect for human rights must be honoured in every possible way."
"I support today's motion for a resolution which, among other things, accepts that action by all the European Member States of the European Union must be united and that statements must be avoided which are of no material help and merely give rise to reactions in the area."
". Mr President, the presidential elections held on 24 April in Togo were subject to serious irregularities, as a consequence of which there was an outbreak of violence resulting in many deaths and injuries."
"In addition, thousands of people fearing for their lives fled Togo for neighbouring Benin and Ghana."
"Togo has suffered election violence on several occasions in the past because the previous dictator-president, father of the current president, repeatedly rigged the polls in his own favour."
"According to Amnesty International, several hundred opposition supporters were massacred by state security forces during the 1998 election."
"Opposition supporters claim that similar attacks by the security forces are taking place today."
"In order to stop the present escalation of violence in the country and prevent similar shameful events from taking place in the future, we join our voice with those calling for, amongst other things, the establishment of a national unity government in Togo and the speedy implementation of constitutional and electoral reforms."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the commitment and action of the European Union – particularly of the Commission and the Council – should be focused both on censuring usurping governments – identifying any foreign intervention – and on encouraging the cancellation of debts owed to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank – particularly by means of support for international trade through an equitable and joint formula."
"Instead of sending relief aid and calling on NGOs for support for development projects, moreover, Member States should commit themselves directly to training efforts in the country and to the better use of agricultural resources, by exporting European technologies and expertise."
"The Union could, for instance, directly organise technical teams, made up of recent graduates or senior citizens with experience, who are specialists in building infrastructures, in the food processing industry and in other sectors that are vital for the development of Togo and other similar countries."
"We vote in favour of the resolution."
". Mr President, the presidential elections held in Togo on 24 April of this year gave rise to bitter controversy, with accusations of vote-rigging and violence."
"The Commission has associated itself with strong condemnations of the riots and violence against civilians that followed the announcement of the provisional results and which left a reported number of 50 dead and 300 injured."
"The violence and the brutal repression by military forces also caused 23 000 Togolese to take refuge in neighbouring Benin and Ghana."
"Given the very tight electoral timetable, under which elections had to take place within 60 days of President Eyadema’s death, the European Union could not send an electoral observation mission that would have met our usual standards of observation."
"The European Union abstained from any pronouncement on the fairness and transparency of the vote."
"Admittedly, many problems arose during the preparation of the elections, and irregularities were reported by the Ecowas electoral observation mission on election day."
"Today, we believe that the utmost priority is the re-establishment of calm and stability and the prevention of any further violence."
"In order to achieve this, we attach paramount importance to the fulfilment of the 22 commitments undertaken by the Government as a result of the consultations held under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement."
"These commitments include respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms, namely press and media freedom, as well as a true political dialogue with all political protagonists in Togo, with a view to preparing the next legislative elections."
"We believe that the effective implementation of the 22 commitments, with close scrutiny from the European Union, as well as from the international community, will allow the country to progress towards national reconciliation and democratic development."
"In conclusion, I would like to assure you and Mr Smith that we are not just watching, but we have decided that the conditions for the redemption of cooperation established by the Council decision of 14 November 2004 remain valid. Such a resumption can only take place in the context of the fulfilment of the 22 commitments I just referred to."
"More specifically, full resumption will not be possible until free, fair and transparent legislative elections, held in an electoral framework accepted by all parties, have taken place."
"The Commission is ready to give its support to the holding of such elections, including the sending of a European Union electoral observation mission."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place immediately after the ongoing debates."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on violations of human rights and democracy in the Republic of Mari El in the Russian Federation.(1)"
". Mr President, when I speak about the troubles of the Mari El minority in Russia, it is not my aim to blame, once more, the Russian authorities."
"Russia is not a member of our Community."
"One can say that it has more than enough problems without my criticism."
"The situation of the Russian minority in some European countries is also worrying - perhaps, sometime, we can discuss that as well."
"However, this afternoon we are talking about a small Finno-Ugric nation somewhere in the huge Russia."
"Around 750 000 Maris live in the Republic of Mari El inside the Russian Federation."
"The autonomous Republic is named after them, but they happened to become a minority in their own land."
"In a country with fair minority rights it is not a problem, but that is not the case in the small Republic of Mari El."
"The Russian-speaking majority elected a Russian president against a Mari candidate, which can be understood."
"However, the re-elected president seems to lead an undemocratic and brutal fight against his opposition and, through them, the whole Mari community."
"Mari opposition newspapers can be printed only outside of the Republic."
"Opposition journalists and intellectuals have been attacked frequently; some of them have been killed."
"Minority language education is threatened by the local authorities."
"We have to condemn those kinds of anti-democratic atrocities always, but in the case of a small nation, the attacks against the basic national institutions, such as schools and media, threaten the very existence of the nation."
"That is why we condemn the violence against the Mari minority in Russia, and that is why we ask the Russian Government to show the same kind of attitude toward its minorities that the Russian Government would like to be provided for the Russian minorities elsewhere in Europe."
"I believe this is the first time that the name of the Mari people has been mentioned in the European Parliament."
"I welcome them here, both as a European and a Finno-Ugric brother from Hungary."
"I wish them all the best."
"They should know that a nation, small or big, inside or outside of Europe, deserves the same respect and the same rights."
"I hope our Russian partners also understand that every minority – Russians out of Russia and non-Russians inside Russia – deserve the same rights to save their identity, culture and linguistic heritage."
". Mr President, many nations share the same linguistic roots."
"Connected with that is a respect for one’s native language."
"Moreover, using one’s own language creates a sense of security."
"A person’s language is the basis of his or her culture."
"Culture is language-bound and language is culture-bound."
"Certain events in the region of Mari El, in Russia, have caused us, as Finno-Ugric linguistic relatives of the Mari people, to focus our attention on the status of minorities and minority languages in Russia."
"This is also a matter of democracy."
"Democracy is not just about voting."
"Democracy also means working on issues with others and being able to use one’s own language."
"The events that have taken place in Mari El, which are clearly associated with violence and human rights violations, need to be made the subject of a local criminal investigation."
"This will increase Russia’s credibility as a state subject to the rule of law."
"There are three Finno-Ugric nation states in the European Union, and in addition there are three million people representing the Finno-Ugric nations in Russia."
"There are seven countries in Europe with populations smaller than that of the Finno-Ugric peoples in Russia."
"These representatives of the Finno-Ugric nations in Russia are, however, spread over many regions in a large country."
"In this connection, we could talk far more generally about safeguarding the position of minorities and languages in Russia."
"We hope that the state authorities in Russia will give more support than they do now to school attendance and studying in one’s own language."
"Cultural and linguistic diversity is a source of immense wealth in Russia, and we hope that it will be exploited better than it is now, and more than it is now."
". Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Greens, I would like to make a brief statement on this motion for a resolution."
"I am glad to see all parties making clear their unanimous and unequivocal position on this matter."
"When fundamental democratic rights and issues of civil and minority rights are at stake, any appeal to reasons of state or economic interest is false and inadmissible."
"I am from the South Tyrol, a region with ethnic minorities, and, in comparison with many others, it is now in a privileged position."
"Particularly now, 60 years after our liberation from fascism and National Socialism, we still remember well how the state used the traditional forms of oppression to discriminate against minorities, including the banning of political opposition, attacks on the media through the intimidation of journalists, putting at a disadvantage all who did not speak the official language, outlawing mother-tongue education, the courts’ unwillingness to act against such injustices, and so on."
"State power uses always the same means of oppression against minorities, for whom solidarity from outside is very important, and so I very much welcome this House’s outcry today against the Russification of the Republic of Mari El."
"The Mari speakers are a small linguistic group, and need a great deal of solidarity from the international community."
". Mr President, Czarist Russia was nicknamed the prison of nations, and the Soviet Union was called the gulag of nations."
"Unfortunately, the collapse of Communism did not bring about freedom, nor did it grant rights to the small nations of Russia."
"At a conference at the end of last week, Vladimir Kozlov, one of the leaders of today’s opposition, said that real ethnic cleansing is being carried out in the Republic of Mari, especially in administration, the overt goal of which is the elimination of the autonomous Mari Republic."
"His statement is of no surprise, since the current president of the Republic of Mari is a Russian citizen, the Moscow-born Mr Leonid Markelov, who does not even speak the local language."
"During his presidency, attacks against free press have become regular, opposition leaders and journalists have been assaulted, including the opposition candidate, Mihail Dolgov, a Mari national, who was brutally assaulted."
"By the way, no judicial verdict has been reached in any of these cases yet."
"Mari language schools are being closed down, and education in the Mari language is only allowed in the primary levels of elementary education."
"Only Russian can be used in administration, all of this pointing to the fact that this minority’s rights are seriously restricted."
"An agreement, called the action plan, was ceremoniously concluded between the EU and Russia the day before yesterday."
"At last, we have an opportunity to provide direct assistance to those who live there, instead of just condemning Russia’s practice."
"This plan allows us to cooperate in the field of minority rights, that is, to promote the use of minority languages, preservation of cultures, the publication of textbooks, to encourage exchange programmes, scientific and scholarship schemes, and to foster an independent media and education in the mother tongue."
"This action plan also promotes strengthening an independent and unbiased judicial system."
"We must, therefore, help Russia in order for the offenders to be brought to justice, so that order and safety may finally prevail in the Republic of Mari as well."
"For this reason, I would like to ask the Commission and the Council to act firmly and provide specific programmes to protect the maltreated Mari minority based on the new agreement."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating yet another issue that one might well call sensitive."
"We are being called upon to consider the life and tragedy of a small nation that has, quite frankly, been conquered by Russia."
"Ever since the 16th century, Russia has adopted a different approach to national expansion from that of the colonial powers."
"Although the latter gained power over various countries throughout the world, they did not generally believe that these countries should be fully integrated with the colonial homeland and robbed of their cultural, national and linguistic identities."
"Russia approached the matter differently, by immediately deciding to Russify every country it conquered, and to deprive the country of its identity and the inhabitants of their religion and language."
"Russia took this approach towards Poland in the 19th century, and the Poles suffered a great deal as a result."
"As a rule, Russia’s attempts to Russify the country were extremely cruel, as they consisted in exiling tens and hundreds of thousands of people."
"Although some of them were simply encouraged to leave, many were brutally forced to do so, with Russians then arriving to take their place."
"There was a sharp rise in such practices when the Communists came to power following the October Revolution, as it was then that Russia decided to intensify efforts to Russify all of the countries under its rule."
"The small Finno-Ugric nation we are discussing today, namely the Republic of Mari El, also fell victim to Russia."
"This small republic is now entirely under the control of the Russians who went to live there, and its original inhabitants, the Finno-Ugric people, are now nothing more than a persecuted minority."
"I would remind the House that the same is in fact true in those countries that have freed themselves from Russian rule."
"The majority of the people in these countries still belong to the original population, rather than being Russian, but there is a powerful Russian minority that does not view itself as being in any way integrated."
"This kind of situation can be seen in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, where the Russian minorities are determined to make their presence felt, regardless of the interests of the countries in which they live."
"One need only pick up a newspaper in any of these countries to see that the Russian populations are antagonistic or downright hostile to their countries of residence."
"These populations frequently claim rights that in any other circumstances we would acknowledge, yet a prerequisite for the acknowledgement of such rights is that the people concerned demonstrate at least minumum loyalty towards the countries in which they live."
"Matters are even worse in the Republic of Mari El, as Russians now form the majority, and the original population has become a persecuted minority."
"Journalists are murdered, there are not enough schools, it is impossible to receive an education and anyone who speaks out in favour of the Finno-Ugric population is persecuted."
"We must ensure that a balance is achieved between the rights of the original owners of the country and those of the democratic majority."
"The latter is in fact simply an occupying force, and it must not be allowed to tyrannise and persecute the minority of original inhabitants."
". Mr President, I am very happy that almost all political groups have joined forces in this Chamber to address this very serious and alarming problem."
"In the Russian Federation there are 19 different nations of the Finno-Ugric family, totalling 2.7 million persons."
"All are minorities in their respective autonomous republics."
"There are serious obstacles to the practical implementation of the cultural and educational rights of these minorities."
"For example, education in the Mari language is provided only in some elementary schools, so that only about 20% of children can enjoy lessons in their mother tongue."
"The publication of textbooks in Mari is practically non-existent."
"So the linguistic identity of the Mari is slowly fading."
"I am also concerned about political developments in Mari El Republic."
"Last December, the local president, Leonid Markelov, considered to be a strong pro-Moscow politician to the detriment of native cultural autonomy, was re-elected."
"When the Mari ethnic opposition, led by Mr Vladimir Kozlov, questioned the fairness of the election results, Mr Kozlov was brutally beaten up."
"There has still been no satisfactory investigation into that act of violence."
"Alarmingly, independent journalists have been harassed for a considerable period of time; three of them were murdered in 2001, many others have been intimidated and their papers forced to close down."
"Also, as a result of the recent elections, several Mari school directors and civil servants of Mari background have lost their jobs."
"School directors were forced to give explanations as to why people in their areas voted for the opposition candidate."
"A considerable number of MEPs have signed an appeal in support of the cultural rights of Mari people."
"This appeal has collected almost 10 000 signatures."
"The point of our resolution is to call on the Russian authorities to respect their obligations under international law and 'to provide quality education in one's native language on all levels, thus securing that the Mari language and Russian are placed on the same footing throughout the Republic.'"
"Mr President, both Russia and its predecessor, the Soviet Union, have always practised a homogenising policy: the notion of Russian authority dislikes diversity."
"During its course of history, the Mari nation, for the most part, has successfully withstood assimilation, and has effectively fought to preserve its own language and identity."
"After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the situation of Mari El, the Republic of Mari, was promising."
"However, it did not last long, eight to nine years, perhaps, when a new anti-diversity policy was launched by Russia."
"The Mari nation’s hope for enjoying equal rights with Russians was shattered."
"The Mari language is excluded from the public sphere, education and the media and Mari activists are harassed, assaulted and forced to leave Mari El."
"Although it would be absolutely necessary for the central authority to intervene, there is no sign of it at all."
"Either ignorance or the tacit acceptance of anti-Mari campaigning prevails."
"Pressure on Maris has considerably increased this past year."
"This proposal’s goal is to send a multi-dimensional signal towards, firstly, Moscow as a reminder of its commitment to preserve the cultural diversity of its minorities instead of eliminating them."
"Secondly, this signal would also be directed to the Russian elite living in Mari El to remind them that it is not possible to launch minority oppression unnoticed in the 21st century."
"Thirdly, toward the Mari people to reassure them that the European public is attentively monitoring their hardships, and is ready to support their cause."
"Ladies and gentlemen,"
"at today’s discussion, it would be appropriate to quote Vladimir Lenin."
"Lenin referred to Tsarist Russia as a prison of nations, though the Soviet Union was no different from Tsarist Russia in that respect."
"Lenin’s words are still timely today, since the Kremlin, which is strengthening central authority and inciting nationalism, shows no respect for minorities."
"Xenophobia in Russia has taken the form of fascist strike forces."
"This is especially dangerous in a country where one fifth of the population is not of Slavic descent."
"The persecution and killing of non-Russian journalists is very worrying."
"This combines Vladimir Putin’s wish to suppress the independent media and ethnic discrimination."
"Evidence that the authorities support attacks on Maris is provided by the fact that fascist attacks have gone unpunished for years."
"When cooperating with Moscow, one should not turn a blind eye to the situation of the ethnic minorities in Russia."
"In his speeches, the Russian President Vladimir Putin often speaks of his commitment to European politics."
"Russia’s policy towards ethnic minorities, however, once again confirms that President Putin’s deeds do not match his words."
"Since the Second World War, ethnic strife has decreased in Europe."
"We respect cultural diversity, and seek to protect and support varied cultural traditions."
"Europe-leaning Russia should, like Europe, understand that cultural diversity is Russia’s strength, and not a danger."
"Unfortunately, however, we can see the opposite happening."
"For this reason, when taking part in political discussions with Russia, representatives of the European Union must seriously raise the issue of the protection of ethnic minorities in Russia."
"A total of 28 million members of ethnic minorities live in Russia."
"Of those, four million speak Finno-Ugric languages."
"Only around twenty books a year are published in the Mordvin language, which has about a million speakers; there is no daily newspaper, and the language is not taught in a single school."
"The situation of the Maris is somewhat better, but the number of publications is decreasing rapidly, and the absence of secondary and higher education in the Mari language also has an effect."
"A European approach does not merely require Russia to end attacks against the ethnic opposition."
"It also means that the Russian Government must support the preservation of the languages and culture of ethnic minorities through legislation and other actions."
"At the moment, this is a dream, but it is the responsibility of European countries to support that dream, and if necessary fight for it."
"Thank you very much!"
". The violations of human rights and democracy we are debating today are taking place in the small Republic of Mari El, which is part of the Russian Federation."
"Unfortunately, this Republic belongs to the Mari only in name, as it is one of the numerous countries and nations that have been subordinated and annexed by Russia."
"Like the Armenians, the Chechens and many others, the Mari people have fought for years to retain their identity and independence."
"Even though the Mari ASSR declared its sovereignty in 1990, the situation of this nation is unfortunately becoming ever more difficult."
"Its inhabitants, known to us all from Russian and Polish literature as the Cheremis, speak a Finno-Ugric language."
"They have repeatedly been the victims of repressive measures, particularly during the Stalin era, when Komsomol groups chopped down their holy groves and the Mari were exiled to Siberia."
"It is for this reason that only half of the Mari people currently lives in the Republic of Mari El, with the rest scattered around Russia and forced to integrate with the Russian population."
"President Markelov, who rules over the Republic of Mari El, came to power following a controversial election."
"He was born in Moscow and does not identify himself in any way with the nation, and in fact cannot even speak Mari."
"He systematically curtails the rights of the population, in particular with regard to freedom of speech."
"The Mari people find it difficult to receive education in their own language, as Mari schools have been closed and there are not enough schools or universities."
"Ethnic Mari civil servants have lost their jobs, and opposition journalists suffer persecution, as do the independent, private media."
"This has prompted them to seek help, both from the Finno-Ugric nations of Finland and Estonia, with which they share many cultural similarities, and from the European Parliament."
"The Mari people have a right to sovereignty, independence and their own identity, as do all those fighting for the independence of countries and nations in the former USSR and elsewhere in the world."
"We are therefore opposed to the persecution they are suffering, as well as to the attempts at denationalisation and human rights violations that are taking place in the country."
"Although history provides us with many examples of the spirit and staying power of occupied nations, and even though their efforts have often been crowned with success, the price of such success is frequently the suffering and death of a large number of people."
"As the late Holy Father John Paul II once said, one nation must never expand at the expense of another, that is at the expense of another nation’s subordination, conquest, coercion, exploitation and death."
"If different countries and nations are forced to live together under one government, sooner or later this will always result in a threat to peace and a struggle for independence and sovereignty."
"An emerging superpower like the European Union would do well to heed this warning."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, European standards should be observed across the whole of Europe, Russia included."
"The right of all peoples to use their own language, to preserve their cultural identity and to promote their own culture, even if the language and culture involved are those of a very small nation, is one of these standards."
"Russia signed the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages exactly four years and two days ago."
"It is therefore by no means unreasonable to call on Russia to respect the Mari language, which has been officially recognised as the language of the Republic of Mari El."
"This is especially important with regard to secondary schools and universities, where respect for the Mari language is currently lacking."
"The repressive measures taken against head teachers and journalists who have defended the sovereignty of this small nation are also a particular cause for concern."
"We have no desire to chastise Russia, as it is a country with which we wish to cooperate closely. Yet we cannot shut our eyes and ears to human rights violations, wherever in Europe they occur."
"We cannot sacrifice human rights and the rights of minorities for the sake of cooperation with Moscow."
". Mr President, the Commission is generally aware of the situation of the Finno-Ugric indigenous populations such as the Maris."
"We also know about the problems raised by certain Members of the European Parliament in connection with the treatment of Maris – the problems aired again here today – and, specifically, as regards the Mari language in schools, the obstruction of the media and the recent presidential elections in December 2004."
"The Commission considers that common values, including respect for human rights, are the cornerstone of its relations with Russia."
"During the EU/Russia summit in The Hague in November 2004, Presidents Putin and Barroso agreed to hold regular consultations between the European Union and Russia on human and minority rights and fundamental freedoms."
"The Commission's objective is to use these consultations to strengthen the open and constructive dialogue with Russia on all related matters."
"A first round of these consultations was held on 1 May 2005 in Luxembourg."
"During this meeting, certain matters were examined, including the human rights situation, the rights of people who belong to minorities and fundamental freedoms in the Russian Federation and the European Union."
"We are also engaging in a constructive exchange of information about matters relating to cooperation on human rights in international fora, especially in the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Council of Europe and the OSCE."
"The Commission considers that these consultations with Russia provide an appropriate framework for more detailed talks with the Russian authorities about the situation of the Maris."
"For this, however, more information will be needed and, consequently, information and analyses by Members of Parliament are welcome."
"Finally, I should like to inform you that the next round of consultations with Russia on human rights, the rights of people who belong to minorities and fundamental freedoms will probably be held in the second half of 2005 under the United Kingdom Presidency."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place immediately after the ongoing debates."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Burma/Myanmar.(1)"
". The international community should not tolerate the violations of human rights that are taking place in Burma."
"During the 40 years in which Burma has been under military rule and forced to follow the ‘Burmese way to socialism’, the country has gone from being one of the richest and best-educated in South-East Asia to one of the poorest."
"The Burmese generals who rule the country, which is one of the most repressive dictatorships in the world, have resisted any kind of pressure from the international community for the past 10 years."
"Aspects of the Burmese regime that should be particularly condemned include the Burmese generals’ fight against the opposition, the use of chemical weapons by the Burmese army, the failure of the country to cooperate in any way with international organisations, the persecution of ethnic minorities and the political arrests."
"It is well known that political prisoners, who number around 1 300, are tortured during interrogations, and international standards of justice are not observed in political life."
"Forced labour is an extremely common occurrence, with 800 000 Burmese citizens affected every day."
"Furthermore, restrictions have been imposed on citizens’ freedom of opinion, movement, information and assembly, as well as on participation in political life."
"The Burmese education system is falling apart."
"Since 1988, more universities have closed than have opened, due to fears that students will become politically active."
"Half of the state budget is spent on the military and on maintaining a 400 000-strong army, even though the country is not presently at war."
"The number of children forced to serve in the army stands at 77 000, and many of them join when they are only 11."
"Only a very small fraction of the budget is set aside for medical care, and the medical sector is in a disastrous state, with a shortage of basic medicines and qualified staff."
"Another major problem is the sexual exploitation of young women, girls and children from ethnic minorities."
"Given these problems, it would appear that the only chance we have of ensuring that the regime starts to make the necessary changes is to impose tough economic sanctions, targeted at strategic sectors where the regime holds a monopoly, such as oil, gas, timber, the extractive industries, and marine products."
"UN diplomatic measures are also needed."
"In fact the UN and the European Union both have a moral duty to intervene and even to interfere in the domestic affairs of a country that commits such gross violations of human rights."
". Mr President, the Burmese people continue to suffer extensively under inhuman repression practised by a long-lasting authoritarian military government."
"Thousands of political prisoners are subjected to mistreatment and torture and denied access to a lawyer or a fair trial."
"Burma holds the disgraceful record of having more child soldiers than any other country in the world."
"It also holds the shameful record of having the world's only imprisoned 60-year-old Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi."
"On 19 June 2005, her 60th birthday, this remarkable lady will have spent a total of 2 523 days in detention."
"Gross violations have been committed by the Burmese army against ethnic minorities, including summary executions, torture and rape."
"An estimated one million people have been internally displaced and several hundreds of thousands have fled to neighbouring countries."
"The organised violence exercised by soldiers against women, including young girls, in areas of internal conflict, is a well-known atrocity in Burma."
"Hundreds of cases have been documented, with a high percentage of these cases involving gang rape and, in many cases, resulting in the killing of the victim."
"The ALDE Group has long supported Mrs Suu Kyi's efforts to bring democracy to her country, and we call for her immediate release from detention."
"In addition, my Group wishes to see an increased role for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in the refugee camps along the Thai-Burmese border and a permanent UN Human Rights Monitor in eastern Burma to investigate thoroughly human rights violations."
"Furthermore, the ALDE Group will continue to urge the European Union to take every opportunity to put pressure on the Burmese junta to restore democracy in the country."
"We also support the tourist boycott of Burma and are in favour of the targeted imposition of economic sanctions on Burma in order to encourage a speedy democratic reform."
". Mr President, here we are at the end of a week full of anniversaries and memories, for it was 60 years ago that National Socialism was defeated and Europe liberated, and 15 years ago that the Iron Curtain was rent asunder."
"These anniversaries shed a very unflattering light on those who, in former times, kept quiet about oppression or did business with those who inflicted it."
"Let us then give some thought to what judgment future generations will pass on those who, today, do likewise, for the Iron Curtain may well no longer be there, but what has been called the Bamboo Curtain, erected by socialist generals around Burma, is still there, and terrible tragedies are being played out behind it, ranging from brutal violations of the human rights of tens upon thousands of political detainees to the targeted deployment of poison gas against the Karen people."
"With the use of gas, the attempt is being made to kill off a people or at least to break its spirit."
"These are terrible things to be going on in the 21st century, and they impose an obligation upon us."
"Two things need to be given particular emphasis."
"The first is the urgent necessity of our ensuring that Burma does not take over the presidency of ASEAN in 2006."
"ASEAN is in some sense the EU’s offspring, being a federation like the EU, albeit as yet more economic than political, but it is still our most important partner, and it is intolerable that such an important partner organisation should have a murderous regime at its head."
"Secondly, we must, by all political, economic and legal means, oppose those who are still unscrupulous enough to do business with such a regime."
"The question we must of course always ask ourselves is: what harms the people, and what benefits the people?"
"Cutting the country off completely is obviously not the right way to go about it, but allowing those in power to shamelessly accumulate wealth, while presenting them with only flimsy paper protests about human rights violations, wrecks Europe’s credibility."
"That is why our words must be backed up with deeds."
"I appeal to the Commission – and I would say the same thing to the Council – to adopt, once and for all, a tougher approach to dealing with Burma."
"Protesting from time to time is useless; instead, we must be systematic in bringing pressure to bear until this repugnant regime is no more."
". Mr President, last Saturday, in Burma’s capital, Rangoon, explosives were detonated in shopping arcades, department stores and in an exhibition centre, killing 11 people and seriously injuring 150 others."
"On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I denounce this resumption of terror."
"These attacks show that, since our debate in September 2004, the situation, far from improving, has, tragically, become more acute – something highlighted by Mr Posselt and by other previous speakers."
"Burma/Myanmar is a multi-ethnic state, and has been under military rule with scarcely any interruption since 1962."
"To this day, the military refuse to allow the National League for Democracy, which won the 1990 elections, to form a government, and the National Assembly meets without democratically elected members."
"In February 2005, the leaders of numerous opposition parties and ethnic groups were arrested."
"Despite massive international protest, including – on many occasions – from this House, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi is still under house arrest."
"Forced labour is so widespread that the International Labour Organisation ILO has called on the EU Member States to reconsider their relations with Burma."
"I have to say, Commissioner Dimas, that, with these things going on, I do not understand what the Commission is doing."
"During this year’s ‘Burma/Myanmar Day’, you presented a report that held out the prospect of increased economic and social cooperation with the regime."
"The EU is a community of values, first among them the protection of human rights and the safeguarding of democracy."
"If the EU wants to be able to make a tangible contribution, let it appoint a Special Envoy for Burma."
"At long last, there must be dialogue between the military junta and the democracy movement."
"Ethnic groups and minorities must gain acceptance at long last."
"Humanitarian and social evils must be done away with."
"Only when there is demonstrable progress in these areas will there be any justification for stepping up aid from the European Union."
". Mr President, I should like to start by pointing out that the Commission shares completely the concerns expressed today by Members of Parliament on the situation in Burma/Μyanmar."
"The Commission continues to call for the unconditional release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners."
"It also continues to call on the Burmese regime to participate in a substantive dialogue with all the political parties, including the National League for Democracy and all the ethnic groups."
"It is clear that national reconciliation and the restoration of democracy can only be achieved through a transparent and constructive dialogue between all the legitimate interested parties."
"That is why the Commission regrets that the terms which might allow the National League for Democracy and all the other legal representatives to participate in the national assembly are not being met."
"As no specific positive developments have been noted in respect of the political situation and human rights in the country and given that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other political leaders continue to be detained, the common position of the European Union on Burma/Myanmar was renewed on 25 April for a further year."
"The serious sanctions against the military regime have been maintained and I can assure the honourable Members of Parliament that all the representatives of the European Union will continue to take every opportunity to raise specific issues, such as human rights, forced labour, the lack of democratic development and the continuing detention of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other politicians."
"At the same time, on the basis of the agreed policy of the European Union, communication channels with the Burmese regime will continue to be kept open."
"The European Union is ready for direct, substantive and open talks with the regime during high-level Asia/Europe conferences or bilaterally on the fringes of such conferences."
"The recent conference of foreign ministers of ASEAN, the Association of South-East Asian Nations, in Kyoto on 6 and 7 May was an opportunity of the first order to discuss all the European Union's concerns openly and directly with the Burmese leadership."
"These discussions took place both during the ASEAN conference itself and between the EU troika and the Burmese foreign minister, Mr Win."
"During the meeting between the troika and Foreign Minister Win, he was also given a list of the names of political prisoners about whom the European Union has expressed its concern."
"As regards the chairmanship of ASEAN, the Commission continues to hope that significant progress can be made towards national reconciliation and democratisation and the release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi in the run up to Myanmar's taking over the chairmanship of ASEAN."
"There is as yet no agreed EU position on its participation in ASEAN conferences if Burma/Myanmar takes over the chairmanship."
"However, it is clear that a good number of countries have reservations about participating in ASEAN regional meetings unless there are decisive positive developments in Burma/Μyanmar before it takes over the chairmanship."
"Consequently, the efforts being made by numerous parliamentarians in ASEAN in order to pressure Burma/Myanmar into making political changes before it takes over the chairmanship are particularly encouraging."
"Finally, I should like to say a few words about Burma Day, which the Commission organised on 5 April and during which a debate was held on the basis of the independent experts' report prepared by two excellently trained consultants."
"Even though the report also refers to EU policy on Burma/Myanmar, the objective of Burma Day 2005 was to focus the debate on the possibilities for providing aid inside Burma/Μyanmar."
"This aid will not be channelled through the government; it will be implemented transparently and responsibly through UN agencies and non-government organisations."
"EU political sanctions were not debated during Burma Day."
"All the speakers were selected on the basis of their ability to contribute to the overall debate on aid and their experience from working inside Burma/Myanmar, not their views on the sanctions."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Mr President, I would like to make an oral technical amendment."
"There is some confusion in this resolution."
"In the introduction, it is mentioned that presidential elections took place in the Republic of Mari El on 19 December 2004."
"However, in Article 3 of the resolution, where the same presidential elections are mentioned, the date given is 4 February 2005."
"In fact, that is the date when the Mari opposition leader was attacked."
"I would suggest that in paragraph 3 we delete the date '4 February 2005' and replace it with the correct date of the presidential elections, 19 December 2004."
"Mr President, I just wanted to ask you to bear in mind, in the next sittings here in Strasbourg, that we should have a quarter of an hour’s break before the vote, thus maintaining the House’s dignity through speeches and votes and visits by honoured guests."
"A 15-minute break is good for concentration, and I would ask the Bureau to make provision for one in future."
"This sitting of the European Parliament is suspended."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 12 May 2005."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I must begin by informing you that, within the context of our interparliamentary relations, a delegation from the Knesset chaired by Mrs Naomi Blumenthal, Chairperson of the Delegation for Relations with the European Parliament, is visiting the European Parliament."
"I would like to welcome Mrs Blumenthal."
"I hope that the meetings you have held with Members of the European Parliament have been fruitful, Mrs Blumenthal, and that, by means of better reciprocal information, they can contribute to highlighting the conditions necessary for a fair and lasting peace amongst all the parties involved in the conflict between the Israeli and Palestinian people."
"I must point out that last week two of our Members of Parliament were amongst a group of Europeans who were detained at the Havana airport and were not allowed to enter the country, in which they had arrived on tourist visas with a view to attending the ‘Assembly to promote civil society’."
"I must point out that the Presidency had no knowledge of that visit to Cuba, that the said group was not an official parliamentary delegation and that the Presidency was not informed afterwards by the Members in question."
"But that will not prevent me from expressing the concern and condemnation that I share with the Commission and the Council with regard to these incidents."
"I have raised this issue with the Cuban authorities, but I also believe that I must tell you that the recipient of the European Parliament’s Sakharov Prize Mr Payá – has been very critical of the said meeting, which he has described as a great fraud against the opposition."
"It is no weakness to be courteous, but I believe that we should all seek the best possible information about the political events that we attend."
"I would insist that this in no way means that the actions of the Cuban authorities do not warrant condemnation, but I also believe that you should be made aware of this situation and of the opinion of a person to whom this Parliament has paid tribute."
"Mr President, I feel that this Parliament has the duty to expressly condemn the terrorist car bomb attack this morning in Madrid."
"I feel duty bound to completely and roundly condemn this attack on my own behalf and on behalf, I believe, of everybody here."
"Thank you, Mr Mayor Oreja."
"The applause following your comment demonstrates that this Parliament – of course – joins you in your condemnation of the attack this morning, in which, fortunately, nobody has been killed."
"There are a series of amendments to the agenda, in addition to those announced on 12 May."
"These amendments, which appear in the corrigendum that has been distributed, are as follows:"
"The first debate of the afternoon will be the debate on the motion of censure against the Commission."
"The report by Mr Leinen is therefore brought forward and we shall deal with it before the report by Mrs Malmström, and the report by Mr Skinner will be withdrawn from the agenda."
"Mr President, I would just like to point out that, while we agree that Mr Skinner’s report should be removed from the agenda, I do ask that care be taken in future to ensure that translation – particularly of draft legislation – is given absolute priority."
"We have a major problem not only with translations, but also with interpreting, and often have problems with deadlines if reports of this kind cannot be translated and processed in good time."
"I would ask, firstly, that this be noted, and, secondly, that the Skinner report should, if at all possible, go to the top of the list for the June partsession, so that we can consider it before the relevant Council meetings."
"Alright, Mr Swoboda, you are correct."
"It will be included on the agenda for the next partsession."
"The reason for its withdrawal, at the request of the rapporteur, is that it was not available in every language, as you have pointed out."
"Mr President, I should like to amplify the point made by Mr Swoboda, as the report on the protection of minorities in an enlarged Europe has also been withdrawn from the agenda because translation was not completed."
"I wish to confirm that translation was not completed and to emphasise to the House that a number of reports are now being withdrawn for this reason."
"Mr President, will you investigate why this is happening so frequently to Members across this House?"
"I request that the debate and the vote on the report on the protection of minorities in an enlarged Europe take place in the June I partsession in the presence of the Council."
"Thank you very much, Mr Moraes."
"The reason is quite simply the great complexity of working with 20 languages and the problems we sometimes face in having to produce translations into all of them properly and on time."
"I regret that we also have to withdraw this report."
"We shall deal with it during the next partsession."
"Please understand that the only reason is the complexity of this Parliament’s work."
"Mr President, it is nice to hear that the rapporteur is said to have withdrawn his report."
"In fact he found out about it last night at 9.15 p.m.!"
"Surely that is not usual in this House, but then perhaps we should expect anything."
"Or perhaps it is truer that we have had to make way for the vote of censure today and therefore legislative business comes second in this regard."
"It is clearly a problem for this House."
"As we know, we have to move this legislation into an important phase; the next meeting of Ecofin can only be held on 7 June, so it will be a very close vote indeed."
"I hope that your services will take that into account when you next consider moving legislative items on the agenda."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I simply wish to protest against the amendment of the agenda."
"The rapporteur has expressed himself on this point."
"For my part, I wish to stress that, while we can understand these translation issues, they still disrupt our entire working routine, both in the parliamentary committees and in plenary sittings."
"There is a real problem here, and I imagine you will be anxious to resolve it, so that we can settle back into the normal rhythm of parliamentary activity."
"As regards the legislative dimension of the draft that has just been withdrawn from the agenda, let me make an additional point."
"The Council wanted us to aim for an agreement on this particular instrument at the first reading."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs took the necessary steps to comply with this wish. The draft was duly adopted in committee, but it still awaits adoption by the House."
"I find this regrettable, as do many of my colleagues."
"I take note of your protest, Mrs Berès."
"We will do everything we can to ensure that you do not have to protest again."
"Mr President, this is not specifically about our agenda for this mini-session but a matter that affects our work generally and therefore the June I partsession."
"Many of us suffered disruption to our flights out of Strasbourg on the Thursday of the May I partsession."
"Could I ask you what steps you have taken to discuss this with the French Government and the authorities at Strasbourg airport to try to ensure that we have smooth and uninterrupted travel to and from Strasbourg?"
"Many of us go to Strasbourg under protest in the first place, and the fact that it cannot even be ensured that we can get there and back properly is a matter of grave concern."
"So, could you please tell us what steps you have taken to ensure that we have trouble-free travel next time?"
"As you know, the difficulty was due to a strike by workers at the airport."
"I imagine that Strasbourg airport is not the only airport in which strikes can take place."
"I therefore imagine that you have nothing against the right to strike."
"To continue with the agenda for tomorrow, Thursday 26 May, the following amendments will also be introduced:"
"The final vote on the report by Mr Busk on exceptional market support measures is postponed until a later partsession."
"The report by Mr Costa on the Protocol to the Agreement on sea transport between the European Community and China in view of the accession of new countries is withdrawn from the agenda since Parliament has not yet been consulted."
"And the report by Mr Leinen on the revision of the Framework Agreement on relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission will be voted on after the reports voted on pursuant to Rule 131 of the Rules of Procedure."
"We shall proceed to the debate on the first item, the motion of censure presented against the Commission."
"I must inform you that this motion of censure, presented on 12 May and announced in plenary, has been amended with regard to the list of Members presenting it, due to the fact that certain new Members have signed it and other Members have withdrawn their signatures."
"Nevertheless, the net result is that the number of signatures still exceeds the number required by the European Parliament’s Rules of Procedure for the presentation of a motion of censure."
". Mr President, I wish to say to Mr Barroso that it is nice to see everyone here today."
"It has taken some time to organise this gettogether."
"I am conscious that many of the Commissioners would much rather be in France campaigning for a ‘Yes’ vote."
"However, they are here for a very simple reason: I wrote to all of them on 3 February asking what free holidays and hospitality they had received since becoming European Commissioners – but answers came there none!"
"Luckily, the newspaper has produced a series of revelations."
"It informed us that Mr Barroso had enjoyed a cruise aboard a luxury yacht owned by Spiro Latsis, who has done business with the EU institutions for many years, and whose Lamda shipyards, just one month after this holiday, received the green light from the European Commission for a tenmillioneuro grant."
"Just last week a Latsis company – the Aegean Motorways Group – was put on a shortlist of for the lucrative Athens to Thessaloniki motorway project."
"I now see that even within the European Commission itself, the head of the Bureau of European Policy Advisers, Mr Sidjanski, also speaks for the Latsis Foundation."
"Thank goodness for !"
"We also learned that Mr Mandelson enjoyed a holiday with the lobbyist Peter Brown, and that he also went on a luxury yacht owned by the Microsoft cofounder, Paul Allen."
"Last November, at President Barroso’s inauguration, I asked of this Commission: ‘Would you buy a used car from them?’."
"I suppose I should have said ‘a luxury yacht’!"
"What fairminded person could think that the Commission should police itself in this regard?"
"I have not accused Mr Barroso or any of the Commissioners of any wrongdoing, but it is a case of Caesar’s wife; it is a case that you have to be seen to be above suspicion."
"However, Mr Barroso’s reaction was one of denial."
"He stated in his letter – when it finally arrived – that ‘hospitality is a normal fact of private life’."
"He obviously has a better circle of friends than me, but no matter."
"Was the relationship with Mr Latsis really purely personal?"
"Was there really no conflict of interests?"
"If that is the case, perhaps Mr Barroso could tell me why he resigned the maritime portfolio shortly thereafter?"
"I suggest that he did possibly feel compromised."
"I hope that Mr Barroso will make some concessions today."
"We all hope that he will."
"However, he should remember that what we are asking for is full disclosure."
"As long ago as 1961, President Kennedy introduced a code of this type into the White House."
"It can be done and it should be done!"
"By ignoring my simple request and by maintaining that these free holidays do not constitute a conflict of interests, Mr Barroso has put himself in an unenviable position."
"When in a hole, one should stop digging, and I therefore ask him to give us full disclosure."
"However, none of this would have happened if it had not been for the bravery of 77 Members of this House."
"These independently minded people have been subject to very unpleasant threats and bullying."
"Mr President, with your permission and pursuant to Rule 141(4), I give way to my colleague, Mr Helmer, to put a question to me."
"One moment, please."
"For the time being, it is for the Presidency to give the floor."
". Thank you, Mr President!"
"Nonetheless, there has been a lot of bullying going on."
"The leaders of the four big groups are so blinded by their belief in European integration that they simply cannot accept any criticism, particularly when it comes from dreaded eurosceptics like me."
"In fact, there are plenty of people on this list who will vote ‘Yes’ to the Constitution and who believe in the European project."
"It is simply a question of having this Parliament do its job!"
"What is the European Parliament for?"
"It cannot initiate legislation and it cannot repeal legislation."
"What it can do is hire and fire the bosses."
"It can hold to account the Commission: – the government of Europe, as I keep being told."
"I contend that this Parliament has failed and that it is the leaders of the four big groups who are in fact the guilty parties in this matter."
"It happens time and again."
"Last November, when I revealed that Commissioner Barrot had recently received a criminal conviction for his part in an embezzlement case, what happened?"
"I was attacked;"
"I was called a hooligan; I was told I had behaved like a football supporter."
"However, all I had done was tell the truth!"
"In that episode, and in this one, Mr Schulz will say ‘something must be done’ and, like the Grand old Duke of York, he marches his ten thousand men up the hill, only to get a phone call from Gerhard Schröder and march them back down again!"
"I suppose that there is great irony in all this in that, as a very committed eurosceptic, I have been asked to lead this charge today."
"However, this is not an argument about whether the EU is a good thing or a bad thing."
"All we, the signatories, want is transparency and proper governmental procedures."
"We also want the European Parliament to stand up and to do its job for once!"
"Pursuant to Rule 141(4) of the Rules of Procedure, Mr Helmer may put a question to Mr Farage."
"Mr President, with your permission, I rise under Rule 141 to put a question to Mr Farage."
"I wonder whether he agrees with me that the pressure exerted by the larger groups to have signatures withdrawn from the motion of censure was an affront to democracy and transparency, and brought shame and disrepute on this House?"
"Does he agree with me that it was particularly discreditable for Mr Poettering to bring such pressure to bear on the British Conservatives, given that we were elected on a manifesto commitment to oppose fraud and corruption?"
"Finally, does he agree that it was inappropriate for the leader of the British Conservatives to demand withdrawal of Conservative signatures under the threat of ‘very serious consequences’?"
"Mr President, I agree with what Mr Helmer has just said, which I am sure is a surprise to everyone."
"I wish to thank him for illustrating so clearly the kinds of bullying tactics that have been employed."
"Frankly, the leaders of the four main groups should be ashamed of themselves for the way they have behaved."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, the motion of censure at the heart of this debate is clearly unwarranted and entirely without foundation."
"Let me explain why."
"Its authors tabled it on the grounds that it was the only way to compel me to come and explain myself to the House on the matter in question."
"In fact, you know perfectly well that I am always available to the European Parliament."
"I regard my availability as a sign of respect for your institution and of interest in its work and as part of a commitment to openness and transparency."
"The fact is that the vast majority of this House, whose views were expressed through the Conference of Presidents, considered that the present matter did not merit a plenary debate."
"It took the view that any questions there might be had been adequately and fully answered in my letter of 22 April 2005 to President Borrell."
"In other words, all the explanations I was asked to give were provided in good time."
"As far as the substance of the matter is concerned, I have nothing to add to the content of that letter."
"Last August, together with my family, I spent a week with a former lecturer and friend of mine at the invitation of another mutual friend on the latter’s private yacht in Greece."
"My friendship with them goes back more than twenty years to the time when I was at the University of Geneva."
"In other words, this is a longstanding personal and academic association that predates my entry into politics, and its character has not changed since then."
"Our relations have never involved any sort of business dealings or interests, and I have no knowledge of any link between these friends and the Commission which could justifiably arouse suspicion of a conflict of interests."
"The author of this motion of censure maintains that a few days on holiday among friends raises questions regarding a decision taken by the Commission authorising a payment of state aid in Greece and, in more general terms, regarding the Commission’s code of ethics."
"This is a malicious allegation."
"There is no link whatsoever between this aspect of my private life and the activities of the Commission."
"With regard to the decision authorising the state aid in Greece, let me remind the House that it was taken by the previous college of Commissioners under Mr Prodi on the basis of a proposal made by Mr Monti at a time when I did not hold any position of responsibility in the Commission, which truly shows how unjust, unwarranted, unfounded and absurd is this motion of censure against the present Commission."
"This time lag which the author neglected to mention in the text of the motion which explains why some Members signed the motion without proper knowledge of the facts is clear evidence of deliberate sophistry on the part of the author."
"Besides, I must remind you that the incumbent college of Commissioners, at my behest and under my authority, has applied the most stringent set of rules on transparency and conflicts of interest ever to be adopted by any institution of the European Union."
"In short, the motion of censure is based on a gratuitous insinuation."
"The fact that the members of the Commission can have personal friendships – and, moreover, that the nature of these friendships is exactly the same before and after a Commissioner’s assumption of office and bears no relation to his or her appointment – does not equate to a conflict of interests and cannot be described as such."
"The fact that friends and acquaintances of a Commissioner might be affected by Commission policy does not and cannot of itself warrant suspicion of a conflict of interests."
"This applies equally to the Commission, to Members of the European Parliament and to members of governments."
"There is not a single political decisionmaker who has no friends or acquaintances; if the thinking of the authors of this motion were taken to its logical conclusion, the very existence of these links would paralyse every democratic political process."
"This, as I have said already and shall say again, would be absurd."
"On the other hand, if the censure motion is absurd, why are we debating it today?"
"Why have I come here, given that my predecessor, for example, sent a representative to the debate on the last motion of censure rather than attending in person?"
"I have come because I believe it is important to know exactly what this Parliament feels about this type of political manoeuvre."
"If I am here, it is because I do not regard this motion as a personal attack on myself."
"I have nothing against the author, and I do not believe he bears me a personal grudge either."
"He merely finds it very strange that someone should receive an invitation to spend some days on a yacht."
"I must admit that I know of no one who would be brave enough to invite him aboard a yacht for a single day."
"I well understand his difficulty."
"So it is not a personal issue, but it is a serious institutional issue, because this type of attack reflects a populist undercurrent which resorts to manipulation by oversimplifying important and complex matters, an undercurrent opposed to the Europe we are engaged in building."
"This particular motion actually invokes essential values and concepts of democracy, such as ethical conduct and transparency, but it does so with a view to mystification on the basis of pure supposition."
"It is an attempt to disguise the true aim of the motion, which is to undermine the credibility of the EU institutions and the entire integration project by substituting the fabrication of alleged scandals for ideological debate."
"This is where the line separating democracy from demagogy is crossed, and we cannot accept this abuse of the democratic process."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the people of our Union have no taste for political posturing."
"Europeans utterly reject gutter politics."
"I am sure that the overwhelming majority of this House thinks likewise and wishes to make that abundantly clear."
"The political challenges confronting us at the present time require both deep thought and wholehearted efforts on our part."
"It is entirely legitimate to be more or less enthusiastic about the European Union."
"It is entirely legitimate to be more or less critical about the direction taken by the Commission or by the European Parliament."
"It is entirely legitimate to have different political visions."
"What is not legitimate is to play off one European institution against another."
"Nor is it legitimate to pervert parliamentary procedures in the way that this motion of censure does, to use sophistry and insinuation and impugn people’s motives without any evidence."
"These are not constructive contributions to the debate; on the contrary, they deprive the people of Europe of their rightful claim to our concentration on their expectations, their concerns and their problems."
"The extremist approach adopted by the author of this motion is designed to obscure the issues rather than clarify them."
"Let me reiterate to all of you, President and Members of the European Parliament, that my entire college and I are committed to the highest standards of transparency and ethical conduct."
"Let me reemphasise our openness to dialogue with this Assembly."
"Let me also express once again our gratitude for the support and solidarity shown by the vast majority of you, and in saying that I am thinking particularly of those who do not always agree with me ideologically but who have nevertheless made a point of distancing themselves from this type of political manoeuvre against the Commission."
"It is in this spirit that I ask you – and I believe this will be the only merit of the present debate – to censure this motion of censure by rejecting it overwhelmingly."
"That is the signal of hope we could send out from here to the whole of Europe, because that would be the best way to serve the cause of democracy, which is at the heart of our European Union."
". Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, there are debates in which one participates out of a sense of duty and responsibility towards European integration and its institutions, and this debate today is one of them."
"Those who have tabled this motion of censure have done so on the basis of Article 201 of the Treaty establishing the European Community and of Rule 100 of our Rules of Procedure."
"Whilst respecting that right, we would also say that the authors of the motion, by availing themselves of it, devalue these rights by what is a selfevident misuse of them."
"Along with the members of the other groups mentioned a short while ago, my friend Mr Brian Crowley, the Chairman of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, has informed me that he endorses what we said on 13 May, that being that the action by the authors of this motion is wholly unjustified and utterly overexaggerated."
"To that, I would add today that I regard this motion as unworthy of decent human beings and as a politically transparent act of opposition to the integration of our continent."
"As the President of the Commission has pointed out, and as I am well aware, the cruise took place in the second half of August."
"The Commission gave its approval for the project to which the motion refers on 23 September, this House voted to express its confidence in the Barroso Commission on 18 November, and the Commission took office on 22 November."
"So it is clear that the responsibility for the approval on 23 September lay with the Commission under Romano Prodi. This shows how absurd this motion is and how it lacks credibility."
"So it is that this motion of censure collapses like a house of cards!"
"The authors of the motion are not, in fact, concerned with José Manuel Durão Barroso as a person. It is an attack on the European institutions and on their credibility, particularly on that of the Commission."
"It is a personal vendetta, pursued with the improper purpose of bringing discredit upon the European institutions, and to do so only a few days before the referenda on the Constitution in France and the Netherlands."
"Five Members belonging to the European Democrat element in this group signed this motion; they did so without informing, let alone consulting, the chairman of their national delegation or the Chairman of the group."
"Let me say here and now that these five Members have placed themselves outside the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and no longer enjoy its solidarity."
"I am addressing Mr Helmer when I say that there is no member of this group with whom I have had as much patience as with him."
"You, Mr Helmer, have just resigned your membership of the PPEDE Group, and, out of respect for the dignity of every individual, let me say that I wish you personally all the best for the future."
"Let me tell the House that we have confidence in the Commission and in its President."
"A fortnight ago, in what was for me one of the high points of my political endeavours here in this House – an overwhelming majority of us faced up to Europe’s past and, by adopting the resolution on the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, joined in a great majority decision to acknowledge the historic truth of Europe and set out on the road into the future."
"We are well aware of our responsibility, and we will not allow anyone to undermine our determination to keep on working on the labour of peace that is the integration of Europe."
"So, Mr President, you and your Commission may continue with your work, for we are right behind you!"
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the President of the Commission tells me that his links with Mr Latsis go back a very long way into his past."
"In that case, Mr President of the Commission, I have to ask you whether he was with you in the Maoist youth movement, for if he were, that would make him the only Maoist billionaire in Europe."
"What Mr Poettering has just done is, I think, very much the right thing to do."
"With Members like the one you have just addressed in your group, Mr Poettering, you have no more need of political opponents."
"I can therefore do no other than warmly congratulate you on taking the action to which you have just referred."
"The case we are here to discuss has, in fact, already been answered."
"The decision that is supposedly worthy of criticism was not taken by the Commission under Mr Barroso, but by the Commission under Mr Prodi, and was within Commissioner Monti’s sphere of responsibility."
"As Mr Poettering has just demonstrated by naming dates, it is in no way something for which this Commission has to answer."
"The authors of this motion, or at least the brains behind it, are well aware of that, and so one has to ask why the motion was tabled in the first place."
"It was tabled precisely in order to bring about what is happening here right now."
"That is what it was aimed at, no more and no less."
"There are no political motives behind it."
"The aim was that there should be cameras up there and crowds of people jostling one another in front of the entrance to this Chamber; it was that what is happening should happen."
"Just for show, and nothing more: that is the political substance behind this."
"Mr President of the Commission, you are entitled to have this House tell you what it expects of you and of your Commission."
"We did so in some detail when the Commission was appointed."
"My group has not always been satisfied in its dealings with this Commission, and you can take it as read that, if there are things to be criticised and objected to, we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament will do just that."
"If these accusations turn out to be substantiated, then we will give them our attention."
"I speak on behalf of all the members of this group when I say that I am not prepared to allow defamation and insinuation to become a parliamentary strategy."
"That is something we are not prepared to accept."
"It is for that reason that I declare, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, that we will not be voting in favour of this motion."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Democrats and Liberals in this House, let me say to the signatories of this motion of censure that they are being ridiculous."
"They presume to say ‘’, but neither Mr Farage nor Mr de Villiers is an Émile Zola – far from it!"
"This motion is nothing but a ploy to discredit the European Commission."
"What is the real motive of those who have tabled this motion?"
"It is not transparency; if it were, the signatures of at least four British separatists who refused to publish details of their financial interests on the Internet would not be appended to this motion."
"The signatories of this motion of censure had but one aim, which was to discredit the President of the Commission and the entire Union with him."
"Why, moreover, did they choose to make this move only a few days before the referenda in France and the Netherlands?"
"Not for any of the reasons they put forward, but to cause the Union maximum embarrassment in the runup to these public consultations."
"Mr Barroso, you must feel rather perplexed."
"We started a debate about hospitality."
"You volunteered us the information about your holiday with Mr Latsis as an example: a friendship of long duration, a holiday accepted before you took office, before there was any debate about whether you might assume certain responsibilities you are now accused of abusing – quite apart from the fact that there is hardly a major industry in Europe which does not receive some government support."
"And if you had no contacts with industrialists, you would have as few friends as Mr Farage!"
"Liberals and Democrats will defend accountability and transparency in all of the European Union’s business."
"It is part and parcel of a government’s contract with the electorate."
"We are proud to have been at the forefront of the campaign for this."
"We all know there is a case for greater transparency."
"Under President Pat Cox, under President Borrell, through interinstitutional agreements with the Commission, we have made, and we continue to make, progress."
"The Commission’s code of conduct was revised with the entry of your Commission."
"It probably needs to be more explicit about the notion of hospitality."
"We also defend the right of Members to bring a motion of censure under our Rules, but such tools should be used with caution."
"Members should beware that frivolous use such as this risks discrediting both the tool that Rule 100 gives us and this House."
"This debate is a deflection from serious business."
"We must all be vigilant on matters of public accountability, but we must also let the Commission get on with the job of bringing the European Union’s Member States closer together."
"Europe needs builders, not a demolition squad; MEPs who look forward, not those who look back; parliamentarians who see opportunities, not those who exploit difficulties."
"There is room for diversity of view about the future of the European Union, provided those views are presented honestly and openly through public debate."
"As a recent election in the country I know best shows, when the views of the movers of this motion are presented openly, they get very, very little support."
"I trust that this House will give a clear answer to the signatories of today’s motion."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a very large majority of my group considers this motion of censure to be inappropriate and they will vote against it in June."
"They consider it to be inappropriate because President Barroso’s personal relations with Mr Latzis do not strike us as being relevant to the future of Europe."
"I very much regret that the fury directed towards the alleged financial irregularities of the Commission causes us to forget more and more that 80% of cases of mismanagement of Community finances involve the Member States."
"I would prefer it if Members were more active in also dealing with this issue."
"We believe that using the motion of censure does nothing to help the legitimate cause of greater transparency and responsibility from the Commission, and that it only serves to strengthen the opinion of those who, like Mr Farage, believe that the Union should simply be abolished."
"That does not mean, however, that our political judgment on the work of the Commission and its President has changed."
"I must say that my Group is slightly uneasy about the way in which this debate is being conducted."
"It is certainly adhering to the rules, but with such restrictions on the time and opportunity to speak that it seems to be a show for those who are for and against Mr Barroso, providing too great a platform for Mr Farage and his playmate, Mr Helmer."
"Mr President, we take this opportunity to draw Mr Barroso’s attention to the fact that this is only the first and obvious consequence of the mistaken decision to keep Mrs Cruz in her role."
"This situation is clearly a golden opportunity for machinations and insinuations, in addition to obviously greatly delaying and complicating the legitimacy of the proceedings taking place."
"In addition, it is more than obvious that only complete transparency and a greater readiness to agree immediately to a debate can help prevent us from falling into these traps."
"Today, the Commission is exposed to issues of potential conflict of interest which have not been tackled at their roots."
"To conclude, Mr President, it is our opinion that in order to win the debate, and to sideline Mr Farage and his associates in the political debate, your role must be reasserted."
"You must reassert your role as the guardian of Europe’s interests."
"There are currently no positive initiatives emerging from the Commission in the context of the environment, society or culture."
"Do something in order that the people of Europe can acknowledge you and can acknowledge, alongside you, the complete legitimacy of the European plan."
"– Mr President, the president of my group cannot be here in the House today, but he made his position clear in a letter published this morning."
"If the aim of the motion is public clarification as regards a potential conflict of interests, then that aim is being achieved as we speak."
"A number of members of my group put their names to this initiative, convinced that it would be a means of obtaining the necessary public explanations regarding the allegations that had been circulating and were consequently not expelled from our group, Mr Poettering."
"On the other hand, if the intention was, or is, one of censure based on the President of the Commission’s holiday, or using the holiday as an excuse, then that is something that we wish to have nothing to do with."
"The Leftwing opposition in this House is political in nature."
"We do not seek to deflect attention away from the real issues that oppose us to the Commission, namely the neoliberal policies that it pursues."
"We would have taken a different view had Mr Latsis, the owner of the yacht, been involved in financial matters requiring a decision from the European institutions, in which case the services of the Commission would have been alerted about the illadvised holiday."
"As it happens, in this connection, nothing – nothing whatsoever – has yet been proven, and there is therefore no merit in this motion of censure."
"This is the view held my most members of the Group."
"Mr President, I was one of those who signed, and was among those who withdrew their signatures when satisfactory information was forthcoming."
"Mr Barroso’s holiday is not worthy of a minute of attention."
"Transparency, on the other hand, is very much worthy of constant attention, something that we must all strive for, in light of the disengagement between the citizens and the blindness of the current leaders of Europe."
"The promotion of transparency requires facts, rather than insinuation or obfuscation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we do not advocate a freeforall in the cause of promoting transparency; after all, people in glass houses should not throw stones."
"I want no part in this populist clamour."
"If we were to table a motion of censure it would seek the truth and block those policies that hinder employment, rights and the desire for peace in this world."
"Mr President, responsibility for today’s debate lies with those who did not allow us to have the debate last time."
"When Mr Farage raised the matter, I asked for a list of all gifts in excess of EUR 100."
"I have still not been given that list."
"Last Sunday, I asked Eva Joly – the examining magistrate who has got business people and politicians into prison for corruption – about where the dividing line is between gifts and corruption."
"‘EUR 120,’ she said."
"Gifts of more than that amount do not belong in the public sphere."
"I want to know who gets what from whom and I want to be able to check whether consideration is provided."
"Matters got off to a good start with Barroso."
"He gave us a list of 3 000 working parties, which had so far been kept secret."
"That list is now at Bonde.com."
"We do not, however, know the names of the participants."
"How many friends have been placed in the expert groups?"
"How many people have been appointed independently of the general appointment procedures?"
"How many EU employees and consultants also receive salaries from elsewhere?"
"Openness is the best tool honest people in power have for defending themselves against pressure from their own friends."
"The new Commission is not responsible for the sins and scandals of the past, but it could demonstrate a new approach."
"Provide us with the names of all the experts."
"Let us see who obtains what from the budget."
"Let us see all the Commission’s contributions to the legislative process."
"Sack the next person who lies, instead of sacking whistleblowers."
"Give the Commission’s sacked accounts manager, Marta Andreasen another job."
"Begin afresh with openness, democracy and proximity to the people."
"You will lose some friends in the upper echelons, but you will gain in terms of people’s confidence in you and in terms of support for European cooperation."
"Thank you, Mr President, even if I still do not have enough to express gratitude for."
". Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission President for coming to the Chamber to respond to the motion tabled by some of my colleagues."
"I was at the Conference of Presidents meeting which took the decision that there was no substance to the allegations being presented, and that it was right that President Barroso should respond by letter."
"The Conference of Presidents took on board his opinion, as expressed in that letter, that there was nothing to substantiate the allegations made."
"Be that as it may, I do not deny Members and colleagues the opportunity to table this motion of censure."
"The fact that it makes them look ridiculous, takes up our time and diverts us from dealing with really important issues that affect the everyday lives of European citizens obviously does not matter to them. It matters to me."
"We have a situation in which conspiracy theories, innuendo and general misconceptions, lies and myths are told about what goes on in the ‘dark corridors’ and ‘cubby holes’ of the European Commission."
"We are told we should be afraid of the danger lurking behind us, and that things are happening that we do not know about, when the reality is that every single decision taken is accountable."
"Every single action taken is not taken in an exclusive format or by one person, but goes through a host of motions and a series of individuals and organisations before a final decision is reached."
"What we are really witnessing today is opportunism of the most crass and basest order."
"It is an opportunism which seeks to create a myth that ‘there is danger lurking out there’, predicated on the basis that we are the white angels who shine the light into dark corners."
"That is what the authors of this motion would have us believe."
"However, the reality is that they are trying to prevent positive action being taken, and to prevent real debate taking place on issues of concern to the people of Europe."
"Most importantly of all, this is an attempt to undermine a project in progress for the good of all the peoples of Europe."
"As we have seen with the most recent enlargement, it is one which continues to progress."
"Finally, Mr President, I would like to thank President Barroso for coming to the Chamber."
"I apologise for being a member of a Conference of Presidents which may have put you in the embarrassing position of thinking you would not have to come to the Chamber."
"However, I know that in the future you will recognise it depends very much on who is asking the question, and then you will decide whether or not you should come."
"Mr President, I would like to praise the Commission – or some Commissioners at any rate – for having produced, on 18 May, a paper from which I shall now quote: ‘We must bring more light to bear on the way we work and find new ways to reconnect with the European public.’"
"The document goes on to say that all official correspondence by letter should be made available in a public register."
"One of the people who got this initiative underway was Commissioner Siim Kallas."
"There is also the issue of the power exercised by lobbyists, for, in this House, in contrast to the USA, there is a great lack of transparency where they are concerned."
"The reason why I signed the motion – a reason I share, I think, with many other Members – was that I expected precisely that sort of explanation from you, and what, Mr President of the Commission, did you give us?"
"What must be the feelings of the editorial staff of , who made the whole thing public, not to mention the reporters of the or those working on the ARD’s ‘Tagesschau’ yesterday evening, when they hear you using words like ‘rabblerousing’ and ‘misuse’."
"Not least as one who has been a journalist for many years, I object to such accusations."
"Your statements, Mr President of the Commission, put you on the wrong side of the debate. You are sending out the wrong messages."
"By saying what you say, you are defending an EU lacking any transparency whatever, full of intolerance, and – yes, I will say it – characterised by paralysis."
"The stunned rigidity associated with the EU Constitution is precisely because of the sort of behaviour of which you have, lamentably, given an example today."
"By this pushing away, you are making yourself a symbol of an EU characterised by oldboy networks and – oh, yes – the power of lobbyists."
"In so doing, you do damage to the ideals in which many of us believe."
"The fundamental problem is precisely that; this attitude of withdrawal, this no longer comprehending what is at issue, when what is at issue is the ideals of the EU."
"Like many others, I am in favour of Europe, but not of this EU and its abusive practices."
"Without transparency, there is no democracy."
"Stick to what you said a fortnight ago, and then we will not have to say ."
"Wake up, I beg of you!"
"Mr President, first of all I should like to thank all the political groups."
"In fact, all of the groups, except the one that initiated this motion of censure, have rejected the terms of the motion, and I thank them for that."
"I do believe they have all helped us, in the European institutions, to send an unmistakable signal of our determination to distinguish clearly between democracy and demagogy."
"There remains one substantive and serious question to be answered, and for all those who are committed, as I am, and as all the members of my Commission are, to the principle of transparency, I should like to spell out our position precisely. To this end, I shall repeat what I said on the matter in my letter to President Borrell."
"Since the letter was written in English, I shall read it in English."
"‘I should add that the rules applied to members of the Commission are stricter than those currently applied in most Member States."
"Nevertheless, the question has been raised of whether additional rules in this area would be helpful.’"
"Some of you, like Mr Watson, have spoken about that possibility."
"I then said to President Borrell that it is perhaps useful to recall that the Commission proposed an agreement to create an advisory group on standards in public life back in November 2000, which would have covered the European Parliament, the Council, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, as well as the Commission."
"That proposal is still on the table and the Commission is of course ready to discuss it with the other institutions."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I want it to be clearly understood that the Commission is ready to work constructively with all of you for transparency, good governance and proper accountability within our institutions."
"What I cannot, however, accept as President of the Commission is this suspicion towards the institution I have the honour to lead, this sort of anathema some people pronounce on it."
"I just cannot accept that."
"We shall work together for greater transparency, but we shall not give in to demagogy."
"I therefore thank all the political groups for having drawn this distinction today between demagogy and democracy and for having contributed in this way to the realisation of our European ideal."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the next partsession."
"Mr President, we put forward a proposal, which was rejected, for a general debate."
"We put a number of questions to the Commission during the hearings, where we were promised information about the expert groups. We have still not been given this, and nor shall we be given it."
"What information is it that has to be protected?"
"Mr Bonde, I regret that the switch by means of which I intended to cut you off did not work, and that you have therefore been able to speak without the permission of the Presidency."
"I am very sorry."
"– Our position on the Commission is abundantly clear; we voted against it because we object to its profoundly neoliberal agenda, as we have highlighted on many occasions."
"The reasons behind this motion of censure, however, had nothing to do with opposition to such policies."
"Instead it is based on personal relationships and events prior to the current Commission taking office, which we voted against."
"We want more transparency in the Commission."
"We want different policies to address the terrible problems of unemployment and social exclusion."
"We do not base our policies on personal attacks."
"We therefore do not endorse this motion of censure, although we are ready to back motions of censure against the Commission’s appalling policies."
"I have listened to the debate on the motion of censure with increasing disbelief."
"The issue at stake here is not who lodged the motion or the motives of the Independence Democracy Group, it is about whether the Commission President is under a duty to answer questions asked of him by members of this house."
"The people of Europe have a perception that MEPs and Commissioners do not live up to high standards, and whether or not we like it this is the reality which we must acknowledge and remedy, not close ranks and pretend does not exist."
"The need for continued reform of our and the Commission procedures is urgent."
"I deplore the motives of the Independence and Democracy Group, but their actions could have provided an opportunity to strengthen our procedures."
"By attacking them rather than the problem, the leaders of the groups have missed an opportunity today."
"The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Leinen on the revision of the Framework Agreement on relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission [2005/2076(ACI)] (A60147/2005)."
". Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, after what we have just been discussing, which is destructive in its desire to disrupt relations between the institutions, thank heaven we are now going to deal with something constructive and something that is intended to strengthen these relations."
"This fourth framework agreement between the Commission and Parliament embodies a culture of cooperation in which the role of each institution is respected, whilst at the same time an effort is also made to deepen mutual understanding and cooperation. This is set down in writing in the articles of the agreement."
"This is the fourth agreement between the Commission and Parliament."
"I can say that each successive agreement has seen this House’s role as a ‘Chamber of Citizens’ and hence as a body monitoring the European executive progressively reinforced."
"This agreement, too, takes us another few steps further down this road, and so I should like to thank the Conference of Presidents and, in particular, VicePresident Wallström and everyone else who played a part in bringing about this framework agreement."
"Let me mention some of the key aspects of this fourth framework agreement."
"For a start, what we have just been debating finds a place in it; it is unequivocal in specifying the political responsibilities of the President and Members of the Commission when conflicts of interest occur."
"Notwithstanding the Commission’s collegial nature, each of its Members is responsible for what is done in his area of responsibility."
"That all 25 of the Commission’s members are individually responsible for what they do in their own sphere is a most important principle."
"The President of the Commission is responsible for the steps to be taken if Commissioners are involved in conflicts of interest, and for any decisions that need to be taken."
"There are also clear provisions concerning the procedures to be followed when one Member leaves the Commission and is replaced by another, and indeed there were long drawnout negotiations on this point."
"It is clear that a new Commissioner cannot take up office until he has appeared before Parliament, gone through the hearings and been given a vote of confidence by the whole House."
"A second set of provisions relates to cooperation on lawmaking and on budgetary decisions."
"I see that we have managed to ensure that the Commission and Parliament will agree in advance on annual legislative programmes and multiannual programming, and that the Commission will not make public any legislative or other significant initiatives before notifying Parliament."
"This is a crucial step in terms of Parliament’s right of codecision on key EU decisions."
"Furthermore, Parliament is treated as the Council’s equal in this respect."
"We will be kept fully informed at every stage of the legislative process, and at the same time as the Council."
"It has also been agreed that regular dialogue will be established at the highest level, on a threemonthly basis, between the Conference of Presidents and the President of the Commission or the VicePresident responsible for such matters, and it is my belief that this dialogue will result in greater cooperation."
"The Commission has also agreed to provide information on the composition and work of its expert groups, at the request of the relevant committee."
"Furthermore, the agreement contains several provisions concerning Parliament’s position at international conferences."
"The Commission undertakes to keep Parliament’s delegations fully informed of the progress of such conferences, and, wherever possible, to allow them to participate in negotiating delegations."
"The Commission will also provide backing for Parliament in the field of election observation, and regularly update it on the progress of accession negotiations with candidate countries."
"While this agreement does incorporate the Lamfalussy procedure, Parliament would have liked it to go further in this respect, as the relevant provisions apply only to securities, banking and insurance."
"We would have preferred it to have covered other areas as well, but it would appear that we will have to wait until the next stage of the process for this to happen."
"Furthermore, Members have expressed a desire for the framework agreement procedure to become more transparent in the future, and for the relevant parliamentary committees to be involved somewhat earlier in the process."
"All things considered, however, I would recommend this agreement to the House, since it represents real progress. As I said earlier, it symbolises a culture of cooperation that is based on mutual respect and the desire to work constructively towards the EU’s goals."
"After all, this is what the public and the citizens expect of us."
"Mr President, Mr Leinen, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honour and a great pleasure for me to address the House at this crucial juncture, prior to the vote on revision of the framework agreement governing relations between the European Parliament and the Commission."
"Since my investiture as President of the Commission, I have been telling you of my intention to establish constructive collusion and a sustainable strategic partnership with Parliament."
"In the early stages, we experienced some moments of institutional and political tension."
"An undiscerning observer might have concluded that the desire for cooperation proclaimed by myself, by Margot Wallström and by the whole Commission reflected nothing more than our intention to avoid any further friction."
"This interpretation has proved to be fallacious and shortsighted."
"In fact, the desire for cooperation by which we are driven results from an appreciation of the institutional reality of our Union."
"Under the Treaties, Parliament is the depositary of the will of the peoples of Europe; it is the only directly elected institution and the legitimate representative of the citizenry of the Member States."
"No other supranational organisation can rely on such an advanced degree of democracy as the European Union; no other multinational structure has assigned such an important role to the directly elected representatives of the people; no territory in the world except our continent, reunited at long last, has an institution that represents four hundred and fifty million people at the present time."
"The Union is not a remote abstract entity that takes its decisions behind closed doors, disregarding the inclinations and opinions of its peoples."
"On the contrary, it is based on the will of the people and on fully democratic institutions."
"That is the real wealth of our Union."
"That is what makes it unique among the existing structures in an increasingly globalised world."
"We are proud of this profoundly democratic character of the Union, which reflects the historical traditions of its Member States."
"We must act accordingly, and we intend to do so."
"This, then, is the underlying reason why we considered it opportune and necessary to revise the framework agreement, the main instrument governing relations between our institutions."
"This revision has taken place in a climate of excellent cooperation under the direction of the political authorities of both institutions."
"I wish to take this opportunity to thank President Borrell, the heads of the political groups, Mr Leinen, chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and all those who have contributed to this exercise, which is such an important milestone in the history of our bilateral relations."
"The negotiations have enabled considerable progress to be made."
"We have agreed on a wellbalanced text which meets the expectations of both parties and substantially improves cooperation between our institutions."
"Mr Leinen has already pointed to many aspects, but I should like to outline what we consider to be the five main results."
"Firstly, we have enhanced the political dialogue between our institutions."
"Together with VicePresident Wallström, I will on a regular basis attend the meetings of the Conference of Presidents, which will become the main forum for discussing political developments as well as the work and activities of the Parliament and the Commission."
"Furthermore, the timetable for the Commission’s legislative and work programme has been streamlined, and the process leading to the Commission’s legislative and work programme has become more political."
"In this context, Margot Wallström met the Conference of Committee Chairs in February, and will do so again in July."
"Secondly, we have strengthened openness and transparency."
"The Commission commits itself to providing Parliament with a full list of the expert groups assisting us in the exercise of our right of initiative."
"In addition to this, the chairpersons of the relevant Parliamentary committees may ask the Commission to provide information on the activities and composition of these groups."
"When taken in conjunction with the existing rule on transparency relating to the ‘comitology groups’, this new provision is a very useful step."
"It will definitely contribute to enhancing transparency in the context of interinstitutional relations."
"Thirdly, we have reinforced the provisions concerning political responsibility."
"The framework agreement enshrines the key principles of the openness, fairness and consistency of the entire hearing process."
"It ensures that the Commissionersdesignate disclose all relevant information in accordance with the duty of independence laid down in the Treaty itself."
"In addition, we have agreed on the procedure to be followed should Parliament express a lack of confidence in an individual Commissioner."
"In such cases the Commission President will give Parliament’s deliberations all the political attention they deserve."
"That is why we have agreed that I will either ask the individual Commissioner to resign, or I will be prepared to explain before this House the decisions I have taken."
"This procedure safeguards the collegiality of the Commission and the powers and prerogatives of its President."
"If new Commissioners are appointed during the mandate of the Commission, I will ensure, together with the President of the Parliament, that they present themselves immediately to Parliament."
"My fourth point concerns the improvement of our cooperation regarding the negotiation of international agreements and other aspects of our daytoday work."
"We have made provision for the Commission to keep Members of Parliament systematically informed on the conduct of negotiations on multilateral agreements."
"We have agreed on measures for consultation of the budgetary authority on the occasion of the announcement of new financial undertakings made at international donor conferences."
"We have deepened our cooperation in the field of Community election observation missions."
"Finally, we will act within the framework of the existing treaties and safeguard the competences of the other institutions, particularly the Council."
"While the Commission attaches great importance to our cooperation with Parliament, one should not forget that the Community method is based on a triangle."
"The Commission is responsible for proposing legislative and budget proposals, and the two branches of the legislative and budgetary authority are responsible for deciding on these."
"As guardian of the Treaties, the Commission is fully committed to safeguarding this method and to paying all due attention to the balance between the institutions."
"With your permission, Mr President, I would like to give the floor to VicePresident Wallström to comment on specific features of the Leinen report."
"I sincerely hope that this House will support the revised Framework Agreement, thus opening a new dimension to our fruitful relationship."
". Mr President, the Leinen report welcomes the revised framework agreement and approves it."
"I am very pleased by that and I hope that this House will do the same."
"This morning the Commission authorised President Barroso and myself to approve the text on behalf of the whole Commission after the positive vote that I hope will take place tomorrow."
"Following the speech by President Barroso, I wish to respond to a few remarks made in Mr Leinen’s report."
"As regards implementing powers, the Commission has already made use of its right of initiative to place the Council and Parliament on an equal footing as regards supervising comitology decisions and proceedings with regard to instruments adopted under the codecision procedure."
"To this effect, the Commission presented a legislative proposal in 2002, which was amended in April last year, taking into account the large majority of amendments tabled by Parliament."
"This is the only possible legal way to change the current situation."
"I wish to stress that our proposal is based on the existing Treaties and could be adopted without waiting for the entry into force of the Constitution."
"The Commission continues to attach considerable importance to this proposal."
"We are aware that Parliament supports it and we hope that the Council will give it all the attention it deserves."
"For the time being, the Commission will continue to implement the current rules on comitology in full respect of the role of Parliament, as laid down in primary and secondary law and in our bilateral agreements."
"An internal assessment is currently taking place in the Commission to ensure effective and coherent application of these rules."
"As regards providing information to Members of Parliament on the occasion of negotiations on international agreements, the solution found in the revised framework agreement is the only one possible due to the legal context."
"As you have certainly noticed, the Commission has committed itself to keeping Members of Parliament systematically informed."
"Members will be appropriately informed by the Commission in full respect of their role as observers."
"Finally, we have taken note of the request made as regards ensuring proper consultation of Parliament on the integrated guidelines."
"The latest integrated guidelines, which will be endorsed by the European Council in June, cover a period of three years."
"From our point of view, this implies that in 2006 and 2007 the next integrated guidelines will have to be updated rather than drastically modified."
"For the next guidelines, the Commission will have to analyse not only contributions from the Member States but also data and statistics which are normally available only in December or even in January."
"It is a complex process."
"Nevertheless, in that context, the Commission will pay attention to the need to allow Parliament adequate time to deliver its position and will use its best endeavours to facilitate this process."
"In conclusion, I believe that our debate today paves the way for reinforcing constructive relations between Parliament and the Commission."
"As I said, the Commission stands ready to approve and sign the framework agreement."
"It is not just a list of wishes and formal commitments: it is a concrete and detailed instrument to regulate our relations."
"It will be our common responsibility to translate it into concrete facts."
"I am sure that our two institutions will implement it carefully and loyally."
"I am deeply convinced that it will not be only our two institutions that will benefit from the new agreement: the Union as such will benefit from increased cooperation between Parliament and the Commission."
"Europe needs a strong European Parliament exercising its powers."
"Europe equally needs a strong, independent and credible Commission, and through your vote tomorrow you will mark an important step in this direction."
". Mr Barroso, congratulations on your previous speech and on having put things straight and put certain people in their place."
"I believe that Mr Leinen and VicePresident Wallström have laid out the characteristics of this fourth Framework Agreement, and I am not therefore going to deal with the specific issues that they have explained so well."
"But please allow me to express a political consideration on behalf of my group."
"The history of this Parliament is the history of an assembly that wants more power, a consultative assembly, a Parliament elected by universal suffrage, then a Parliament with certain competences in the field of the internal market, a Parliament with codecision powers pursuant to the Maastricht Treaty and, since then, a Parliament which has been playing an increasingly significant role in legislation and political control, and that is extremely important."
"And I believe that, in compliance with the Treaties, this fourth Framework Agreement serves to move us forward in this direction."
"I would like to say that, while moving in that direction, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has always believed the Commission to be at the heart of the system, to be the most innovative element of the institutional architecture and that it is therefore also the most decisive element of that architecture."
"In the debates currently taking place, when we are asked why the European Parliament does not enjoy legislative initiative, we say ‘because it is the job of the Commission to define the Community interest, because it is the job of the Commission to ensure compliance with the Treaties’."
"I am therefore sure that this Framework Agreement is in line with the new European Constitution, which will provide more democracy, more efficiency and more transparency, and that it will achieve those objectives in that same way."
"And when we approve this Agreement tomorrow — and we will approve it tomorrow with the votes of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats — I would urge the European Commission to respond to the need to produce initiatives in Europe and to present them; if it does so, when it carries out its duties, it will always have the support of the Group that it is my honour to represent today."
"Thank you very much, congratulations on this work and please go ahead."
"It is now time to get to work."
"."
"Mr President, ten months after the Commission entered office, we must be pleased by this result, even though I would imagine, Commissioner, that from the point of view of the method, being yourself so to speak the champion for transparency within the Commission, you must not be fully satisfied with the conditions under which this agreement was negotiated and you must think that there are further improvements to be made next time."
"With regard to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, this agreement concerns us in three respects."
"First of all, conflicts of interest: we are waiting for it to be fully implemented with, I hope, complete transparency."
"Then there is comitology and, on this matter, I thank you for your comments."
"In the view of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, implementation of the Lamfalussy process is acceptable only if it operates in accordance with the interinstitutional agreement that we drew up during the previous Parliamentary term, which makes it possible to take full account of the position of the European Parliament to the same extent as the deliberations of the Council."
"My final point relates to the implementation of the new Lisbon Strategy and the way in which this Parliament is involved in the adoption of ‘employment’ guidelines and broad economic and monetary policy guidelines."
"We support the idea that national parliaments must be involved upstream and must take ownership of this process, of this strategy, but this must not be to the detriment of the conditions under which the European Parliament’s position is defined."
"On this matter, as you know, we have a problem with the timing and I am counting on your cooperation and support so that this Parliament can be in a position to adopt its contribution to these broad guidelines under favourable conditions."
". Mr President, my Group fully supports the framework agreement and the amendment by Mrs Berès."
"The framework agreement is a distinct improvement on the one we signed with the Prodi Commission in 2000."
"It strengthens the political accountability of the Commission to Parliament, especially through the commitment of President Barroso that we see in clause 3 with respect to a loss of parliamentary confidence in an individual Commissioner."
"With this revised framework agreement, the Commission itself becomes much more parliamentary in character than it has been in the past."
"Parliament shows itself to become far more capable and responsible for scrutinising and sustaining critically a strong executive authority."
"The comprehensive agreement establishes the ground rules for what promises to become a strong working relationship between us."
"The framework agreement certainly changes the context of CommissionParliament relations from that of the previous debate on the fatuous motion of censure."
". Mr President, I am obliged to the rapporteur."
"My group will be voting in favour of this fourth framework agreement, which it sees as strengthening dialogue and reinforcing the legitimacy of both institutions."
"This applies to the substance of the agreement rather than to its methodology, concerning which I should like to make a number of critical comments."
"There is something special about interinstitutional agreements between constitutional institutions, and, in their totality – there are now several hundred of them – they take on something like a constitutional character."
"Agreements of such a kind can hardly be entered into by secretariesgeneral without reference to the relevant committees, without a political mandate and without the agreements being published."
"I believe, Mr President, that not least the group leaderships should give consideration to a change of method, and, since we want to give added force to the requirement for transparency among ourselves, we should also require the same transparency of the process whereby interinstitutional agreements come into being."
"I also have a demand – or it might be a request – to make of the Commission."
"Neither on our own nor on the Commission’s website is it at all possible to call up the interinstitutional agreements currently in force, for they are not published, and so none of them can be accessed or consulted."
"This amounts to a serious lack of transparency, and I would ask you in strong terms to make all the existing interinstitutional agreements public."
"Mr President, today in this House we have an illustration of the deficiency in the current procedures, with a motion of censure being necessary to try to extract information sufficient to meet suspicions about potential conflicts of interest."
"It was met, of course, with a predictable grovelling response by the majority in this House."
"Yet this report itself accepts those same deficient procedures."
"The report tries to make much of Article 2 of the Framework Agreement, but the flaw therein is that while it bestows on the Commission President the obligation to identify and act upon conflicts of interests affecting Commissioners, nothing is put in place to identify and act upon such conflicts affecting the President himself."
"Thus the same situation which gave rise to today’s debate continues to exist unaddressed by this report."
"What is obviously needed is a wholly independent Commissioner for standards in public life."
"As my second point, I take this opportunity to distance myself from the ritual obeisance to the Constitution that appears in recital A. Alas, this besotted committee feels it cannot speak without showing cringing deference to the illfated Constitution, ever peddling the lie that it will deepen democracy, when in reality it is assetstripping every nation state of more democracy and more power."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there can be no doubt that both Parliament and the Commission are in need of the new Framework Agreement between them."
"I fully subscribe to the view set out in the Decision implementing the Agreement, namely that the deepening of democracy in the European Union calls for close relations between Parliament and the Commission and for more effective parliamentary scrutiny of the work of the executive, in other words, of the Commission."
"I was delighted to see that this Decision includes a reference to the European Constitution in its second citation, even though the Constitution is not yet a binding document."
"What is more, the Agreement’s final provisions include a revision clause that provides for the Agreement to be amended after the Constitution has entered into force."
"This is proof that both Parliament and the Commission are not only aware of the importance and significance of the European Constitution, but also realise that it needs to be put into practice as quickly as possible."
"The second issue I should like to address relates to the status of Commission experts and expert groups."
"Article 16 of the Agreement sets out fundamental principles relating to these expert groups, such as the need for transparency with regard to their membership and activities, and the need to update lists of names and make these lists public."
"This is a step in the right direction."
"I hope that these provisions will have some bearing on transparency in the EU, and that they will in fact ensure that the EU becomes more transparent."
"I also hope that they will prevent conflicts of interest and overhasty accusations of corruption."
". Mr President, I thank Members for all their speeches, the majority of which were in support of this framework agreement."
"I just have two very short comments to make."
"I should like to say to Mr Allister that this agreement is based on the existing Treaties."
"We are not anticipating the Constitution."
"Secondly, on publicity and publicising the results, they are all published in the Official Journal and are available on the Internet."
"If there are any indications to the contrary, we will follow them up."
"But the general rule is that we always make them available in the Official Journal and on the Internet."
"We will, of course, also publish them on the Commission’s website."
"I hope for a positive vote tomorrow."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"– The next item is the debate on the report by Mrs Malmström (Α60135/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on EURussia relations (2004/2170(INI))."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Malmström, on this very comprehensive report covering all aspects of relations between the European Union and Russia."
"It goes without saying that these relations have a particularly important place in the European Union’s external relations, a place that has become even more important since the enlargement of the EU."
"It is also true that this report was, to a large extent, drafted prior to the summit."
"We will therefore have to examine how the analysis and facts set out in this report will need to be supplemented in the light of the conclusions and discussions that took place at the 15th EURussia summit in Moscow on 10 May."
"It was at that summit that the European Union and Russia reached agreement on the terms of a strategic partnership enabling us to improve cooperation in the four Common Spaces: the economic space and the spaces of freedom, security and justice, of external security and, finally, of research, education and culture."
"Of course, the negotiations on the four road maps specifically identifying cooperation in these four spaces encountered some difficulties, given that their aim was to reorganise all of our relations by adopting hundreds of operational points that now need to be implemented."
"We can, however, congratulate ourselves on the result achieved."
"By agreeing, in Moscow, on an overall package including road maps for the four spaces, Russia and the European Union have succeeded in reaching a new stage in relations between them, namely the implementation of a true strategic partnership as decided upon in May 2003 at the Saint Petersburg summit."
"This is an undeniable success which has not been significantly tarnished by the Russians’ reference to certain difficulties connected with the transit of goods to Kaliningrad."
"In the opinion of President Putin, the agreement on the four spaces should make it possible, in his words, ‘to build a greater Europe’."
"I think that is an objective that we can share, provided that this greater Europe is based on values to which we ourselves subscribe."
"With regard to the Economic Space, during the summit, Russia renewed its agreement, given in 2004, to the gradual abolition of payments for Siberian overflight rights, which are no longer justified."
"Negotiations on the exact procedure for this phasing out should be concluded shortly, and its entry into force should not be delayed."
"Russia expressed its wish for greater cooperation in the energy sector, which moves in the direction of our own interests."
"It is presenting itself as a reliable partner for the European Union in this sector, as in others, and it has committed itself to implementing the Kyoto Protocol, even if it is threatening at the same time to withdraw if the system is not reformed by 2012."
"These discussions show that the subject of global warming and the Kyoto Protocol, and particularly what will follow the Kyoto Protocol, is vitally important and we must therefore pursue this line of dialogue with the Russians."
"Russia’s membership of the WTO is also a prospect that must be developed rapidly, as it is once again a matter of fully integrating Russia into the multilateral system by making it subject, in this way, to international disciplines, particularly to disciplines in terms of trade."
"With regard to the space of freedom, security and justice, one of the most important points in this space is certainly the free movement of persons."
"Despite the lack of specific results on this point at the summit, the European Union still views it as extremely important to reach a speedy conclusion to negotiations with the Russians with a view to signing an agreement relaxing, on the basis of strict reciprocity, the conditions for issuing shortstay visas, and also a readmission agreement."
"This latter point is vital for the EU and there can be no relaxation in the visa requirements without a parallel readmission agreement."
"We know that the Russians are reporting difficulties in this respect, but they are no longer rejecting or ruling out the conclusion of such an agreement, which they are now linking to the conclusion of similar agreements with their own neighbours."
"This is therefore a matter that must be developed continuously and a subject on which dialogue with the Russians must be actively pursued."
"I am also pleased that, on 18 May, the Russians signed the agreement fixing the border with Estonia."
"We are, unfortunately, still waiting for an analogous agreement to be signed with Latvia and we must encourage the Russians to sign such an agreement."
"With regard to the space of external security, we agreed with the Russians during the summit that closer cooperation should make it possible to work together to reach a peaceful conclusion to what are known as ‘frozen’ conflicts affecting our common neighbourhood or, rather, to use the wording that was finally used in the conclusions, ‘the regions adjacent to Russia and the European Union’."
"In this context, I am thinking, amongst other things, of the Transnistrian conflict in the Republic of Moldova."
"Adoption of the wording ‘adjacent regions’ enabled us to overcome the initial reservations that Russia expressed on this subject and I think that both the European Union and Russia have much to gain from our cooperation in this region of the world where any developments have direct repercussions for Russia and the EU."
"It is also stipulated in the joint road map that all cooperation processes must be based on the sovereign decisions of States and the text clearly recognises and I think that this is one of the most important points that the European Union and Russia share the same common values."
"It is therefore those common values, including respect for sovereign rights, and also respect for human rights and for the principles of the rule of law, that must guide the development of our relations with Russia."
"Let me take this opportunity to say a word about our common interests concerning the fight against terrorism: the fight against terrorism must be based on these values and on respect for the rule of law."
"The space of research, education and culture is an important space where the people of Russia and Europe can meet and forge closer links, because we have a common cultural and historical heritage."
"In this important space, we need to develop a number of initiatives."
"One in particular has already been decided: a European institute in Moscow is to be opened in 2006."
"By way of conclusion, I would like to stress the importance of all our relations with Russia."
"With this great country, which also holds the key to the stability of our continent, we need to build a longterm trusting relationship based, I would stress again, on democratic principles, on just those values that must characterise the construction of this greater Europe that we want just as much as they seem to."
"In so doing, we cannot ignore the fact that we must also engage in a tough but constructive dialogue on issues of human rights, on issues to do with the freedom of the press, and on other humanitarian issues arising in particular in regions such as Chechnya."
"This dialogue has been launched, particularly on human rights."
"It must be pursued actively as an integral part of our relations with Russia, because it is in the interests of the European Union to have a reliable partner in Russia, to have a partner that contributes to the stability of our continent and that also shares the fundamental values that we are trying to defend on this continent."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr PresidentinOffice of the Council."
"Since the EU was enlarged just over a year ago, our powerful neighbour in the east, Russia, has become more and more important to us."
"The country has been a strategic partner for a long time, and we share many challenges and tasks that require cooperation and common solutions. Trade, the environment, energy and the fight against terrorism and organised crime are just a few of the areas concerned."
"We need good relations in order to be able to achieve stability, security and prosperity throughout the European continent."
"Our partnership has not, however, been without its problems, and it is pleasing that, at the summit on 10 May, we succeeded in agreeing upon cooperation within the Four Common Spaces."
"The relevant summary included approximately 400 practical – although not especially practical – points requiring cooperation, but these are still far from being resolved."
"It is important and gratifying that this much progress has been made, but it also remains to be seen what lies beyond the rhetoric."
"The PresidentinOffice of the Council, Mr Juncker, said that the EU and Russia had still not embarked upon their honeymoon but that there was true love between the two."
"It now remains to be seen what this means for their future marriage plans."
"We are dependent upon each other, but relations have been strained and cooperation made more difficult by internal developments in Russia that have seen a decline in human rights and democracy under Putin."
"Ever more power has been concentrated in the Kremlin and in Putin personally."
"Political parties have been marginalised, and there have been restrictions upon freedom of expression and the free media."
"There is still extensive corruption, and there seems to be no end to the atrocities in the bloody conflict in Chechnya."
"The murder of Maskhadov, Chechnya’s elected president, will not make a political solution any easier."
"Putin and the EU also have different views of developments in the neighbouring countries."
"The situation in our common neighbourhood has in many ways been gratifying."
"In Ukraine and Georgia, people have turned away from authoritarian regimes and instead chosen democracy, openness and renewal."
"This is an area in which we must together realise that we have everything to gain from democratic neighbouring countries, and Russia and Putin must accept that these countries do not belong to the Russian sphere of interest."
"The people of those countries want democracy and see the EU, and not Russia, as a model for the future."
"The problems in terms of cooperation are not, however, only due to Russia."
"Relations have been made more difficult by the fact that the EU and the individual Member States send out different signals."
"The common policy places very strong emphasis upon values such as democracy and human rights but, when individual Heads of Government meet Putin, the common values tend to end up very far down on the agenda."
"Instead, there is a focus on, for example, energy."
"This does not give a helpful picture of the EU and creates confusion on the Russian side."
"In the report we are discussing, the Committee on Foreign Affairs is critical of some aspects of the way in which Russia’s domestic politics have developed and thinks that the EU must be clear."
"The conflict in Chechnya can only be resolved politically."
"The EU must offer to act as a mediator and, as time goes on, also participate in the work of construction."
"Terrible atrocities are taking place against civilians in Chechnya."
"This concerns us all. There is no internal conflict."
"No one denies the terrible acts committed in Russia – I am thinking, for example, of the massacre in Beslan – but these do not justify the atrocities in Chechnya and the unwillingness to put the soldiers responsible on trial."
"Because of its size and geographical position and because it is our neighbour, Russia is an incredibly important partner."
"There is no alternative to active cooperation, but we need to focus on a number of practical areas of cooperation in which the EU and Russia both benefit from results."
"Quality, and not quantity, should be the determining factor behind this work, and the issues relating to democracy must never cease to be integrated."
"The EU must convince Russia that economic development and trade go hand in hand with modernisation, a functioning legal system and democratic reforms."
"We support Russia’s ambitions to join the WTO, together with the reforms that this will entail."
"We look forward both to greater cooperation in the environmental sphere in connection, for example, with maritime safety and with safety in relation to nuclear energy, and we look forward to a continuation of the commitments under the Kyoto Protocol."
"We hope that, together, we shall find a solution to the conflict in Transnistria and that the Russian troops will be withdrawn from Moldova and Georgia."
"Naturally, we must mainly look forwards, but we have a common, and at times dramatic and bloody, history."
"In order to move forwards, we need to be able to put the past behind us, but, in order to do that, a process of reconciliation is required."
"The archives in Europe and Russia from the Second World War must be opened up, and Russia must recognise its occupation of the Baltic states and the atrocities committed by the Soviet Union."
"It is excellent that the border agreement with Estonia has been signed. A similar agreement now remains to be signed with Latvia too."
"We have a limited ability to influence developments."
"That is why it is incredibly important never to retreat from those values on which EU cooperation is based and to make it clear to our large neighbour that we shall not do so."
"The EU and Russia will only ever be able to achieve a true partnership if it is based on the defence of democracy."
"The Russian people is not helped by our remaining silent on important issues of principle."
"A coherent strategy with a common message, instead of oneman shows by individual leaders, is the only way of conducting a credible policy towards Russia."
". Mr President, let me begin by thanking Mrs Malmström for the very useful report."
"Its timing is highly opportune, coming just after the successful EURussia summit that President Barroso, Commissioner Mandelson and I attended in Moscow, together with the Council presidency."
"As we now begin implementing what has been agreed, it is very important to say that Russia is a strategic partner, but at the same time we also have to speak with one voice and we have to address all the questions – both the more difficult and the less difficult questions – which I can assure you we did."
"Many of the issues in your report are highly relevant to the discussions we had in Moscow."
"Let me give you a very short overview from my side."
"Of course, I can only complement what the presidency very eloquently said."
"The major achievement was adopting the four roadmaps for the four ‘common spaces’ that we have been negotiating for many months."
"The last summit meeting in November was more difficult and we were far from coming to an agreement, whereas through the many individual negotiations that we conducted we finally achieved our result in the four areas: the economy; freedom, security and justice; external security; and research and culture."
"They will now provide a good basis for significantly enhancing and strengthening our relations with Russia in the coming years, which is necessary."
"We have the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, but this alone is no longer an adequate basis."
"We had to enhance it by these four common spaces."
"More importantly, we confirmed that the EURussia relationship is based on common values – and I am glad that President Putin himself mentioned that – including respect for human rights and democracy, the rule of law, and a free market economy."
"These values must now also guide us as we turn to implementation."
"President Putin, in a speech he gave in the Duma, very clearly mentioned that, and we are encouraged by this as also by the human rights dialogue that we had with Russia, which was a very frank and open dialogue where all these questions were raised and discussed."
"In the economic sphere, I very much welcome your emphasis on our common interest in seeing Russia become a real partner with an open, dynamic, intensified economy and also – this is equally important – a transparent judicial system."
"This will be at the forefront as Russia comes closer to WTO membership and, as you said, we all support that because we think this is the direction that has to be taken and which will start to create a real common economic space."
"At the summit we also made clear that phasing out noncommercial payments for Siberian overflights is essential for our economic cooperation."
"We also ensured that energy cooperation and the Kyoto Protocol are very high on the list of priorities in our roadmap."
"I can confirm to you that, as requested in your resolution, the Commission will continue to provide financial support for Russia’s implementation of Kyoto and for nuclear safety."
"In the field of freedom, security and justice, we agreed that we must rapidly conclude negotiations on both, on the one hand on readmission and on the other hand on visa facilitation."
"I believe that the agreement on both issues is within reach and we should aim to conclude it as soon as possible."
"Our aim would be the next summit in October."
"I know this is a very ambitious aim but I say as soon as possible."
"The Commission and the Member States remain convinced – we said so clearly and it was part of our difficult negotiations until the very end – that the simultaneous implementation of the two agreements is essential."
"We also raised, as did President Barroso, the issue of human rights and the dialogue with Russia on the Northern Caucasus."
"Following the April factfinding mission by DG Relex, we are now exploring ways and means of providing financial support, especially for socioeconomic recovery, in addition to our considerable humanitarian assistance."
"We have to create a new climate there and we also want to do a lot on the question of technical support."
"We want to bring people out of the Northern Caucasus, out of Chechnya, so that they can also see a different environment."
"This is also very important for a future process designed to lead to reconciliation and to better social and economic conditions."
"Of course all this should lead to free and fair elections."
"This should be the aim."
"We would also like to improve administrative and institutional structures."
"We have to continue our dialogue with the Russian authorities on this point."
"We also agreed that human rights and international obligations must be respected as part of fighting terrorism in an effective and very resolute way."
"Turning to external security, we agreed with the Russian authorities that we both want an integrated Europe without new dividing lines."
"Even if the four common spaces include the notion of adjacent regions, President Putin himself acknowledged that it is a common neighbourhood and we have to work within the common neighbourhood to make it a better, more stable neighbourhood for both of us."
"That means that we want to cooperate on the question of stability and prosperity in neighbouring countries such as Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, without forcing them to choose one camp."
"They should proceed with their internal reforms and find solutions for their very difficult problems."
"Finally, let me underline the importance of our agreement on research, education and culture."
"Those areas, even if they do not seem to be highlighted, are specific areas for peopletopeople contacts."
"We want to promote more exchanges with regard to university studies and also want to work on different cultural projects with Russia."
"Your resolution rightly draws attention to the fact, as I said at the beginning, that Russia is an important strategic partner for us, and all the more so since enlargement."
"This has highlighted the need to further develop cooperation with Russia in the northwestern regions, especially in the ‘Northern Dimension’."
"I must also agree with your suggestion that the Union’s policy on Russia has too often suffered from a lack of coherence."
"I said Member States must stick to the common line and we appealed very often to them to do so during our negotiations."
"Since in the end everybody stuck to this line, we managed to come to an agreement."
"I hope the success of our summit will enable us to strengthen relations on a now broadly agreed basis and in a coherent manner."
"We will be able substantially to deepen our cooperation across a wide range of sectors, and we must use all the possibilities offered by the existing Partnership and Cooperation Agreement."
"I can assure Parliament that the Commission will take full account of all the points made in its resolution and I remain as always at your disposal for further discussions."
"Mr President, Mr PresidentinOffice of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I think that Mrs Malmström has, by dint of a great deal of effort, made a very good job of drafting this report, which makes clear not only the significance of our relations with Russia, but also the fact that Russia is not merely a partner in Europe and an anchor of stability, but has also, as a result of enlargement, become our neighbour, and that it is for that reason that we must, both today and in the future, devote particular attention to our relations with it."
"Russia, though, is not a candidate country; this is not a progress report in which we sit in judgment, saying, ‘that is wrong and that is wrong and there you need to do more’."
"In this instance, we are applying a quite different procedure."
"While drawing attention to violations of human rights or developments in democracy that we regard as undesirable, we should refrain from itemising what is going on in Russia and passing didactic judgment on each individual item."
"It is important that this summit has brought concrete results, laying a foundation on which internal and external security may be established, economic cooperation guaranteed, and joint projects in research, education and culture facilitated."
"What struck me as very important in today’s debate was what Commissioner FerreroWaldner had to say: if the whole thing is to work, Europe must speak with one voice."
"In that case, it will not be acceptable for individual Member States – Germany, France or Spain – to hold separate summits with Russia and pursue a contrary policy, without, moreover, informing either our Baltic friends or the European institutions."
"One might be so bold as to say that Germany will refrain from such things after September of this year, but in the case of France and Spain we will, no doubt, have to live with it for some time yet."
"By way of a final comment, let me say that cooperation in regional conflicts appears to me to be very important."
"Reference has been made to Transnistria, Abkhazia, South Ossetia and NagornoKarabakh, and the EU has offered to help in Chechnya as well."
"Rather than being limited to humanitarian operations, it must also have a political dimension, and Russia would be well advised to respond to this signal from Europe."
". Mr President, I wish to thank Mrs Malmström for her openness and cooperation in working out a balanced and productive parliamentary position."
"Positive developments have recently taken place in EURussia relations."
"We warmly welcome the adoption of the single package of roadmaps for the creation of the four ‘common spaces’ at the last EURussia summit in Moscow."
"We consider this a breakthrough in the EURussia strategic partnership."
"We are both committed to multilateralism, which is the only solution to global problems."
"Therefore, we should work together in reforming the United Nations."
"We as European Socialists regard Russia’s ratification of the Kyoto Protocol as a highly positive step."
"We acknowledge Russia’s constructive role in the fight against terrorism and in nuclear disarmament."
"We look forward to mutually beneficial energy cooperation with no added political motivation."
"We should support the accession of Russia to the WTO."
"However, we should not forget about divergences of opinion or disputes."
"We are deeply worried about the weakening of democracy in Russia."
"We also call on Russia to ensure better protection of national minorities."
"Without a readiness to reach a compromise and start a reconciliation process there can be no chance of ending the suffering and developing a lasting peace in the framework of a wide autonomy for the Republic of Chechnya."
"The European Union and Russia can only develop a real strategic partnership if Russia fully endorses the basic European values and principles of democracy, the rule of law and full protection of human and minority rights."
"It is in our common and vital interest to maintain Russia’s democratisation, modernisation and European orientation."
"There is no alternative to a strategic partnership between the European Union and the Russian Federation that is reliable, sustainable and mutually advantageous."
". It goes without saying that cooperation with Russia is of key importance for the European Union."
"The same also applies to the problem of secure energy supplies, to which Russia can provide a partial solution."
"At the same time, however, there can be no one who is not concerned at the way in which the major energy companies operate in Russia."
"I need only remind the House that the head of Gazprom leads Putin’s cabinet, that his deputy chief of staff, Mr Sechin, runs Rosneft, and that Mr Ivanov, Mr Surkov and Mr Prikhodko are in charge of Transneft, Aeroflot and so on."
"This all begs the question of whether these companies are in fact operating according to market mechanisms, or whether they are instead instruments of Russian foreign policy."
"A great many recent developments, such as the problems experienced with the supply of crude oil to Ukraine, suggest that the latter is the case."
"A further question that needs to be addressed relates to the future direction of Russian policy."
"No one could fail to be alarmed at the bill presented by Mr Dmitri Rogozin to the Duma, which, if it is adopted, will make it possible for Russia to incorporate whole new regions into the Russian Federation without anyone’s permission."
"Those justifying such a move have made it quite clear which regions are involved, and these include Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Transdnistria."
"This leaves us with the problem of whether we should not occasionally alert Russia to our concerns, which are entirely justified."
"Of course, it will be Russia that decides on the future shape of our relations with Russia and on the future face of Russia itself, but I do not believe that there should be any letup in our efforts to highlight certain concerns."
". Mr President, Commissioner FerreroWaldner, Commissioner Wallström, ladies and gentlemen, Russia is very important in terms not only of our security and stability, but also of our economic and ecological development."
"We want close cooperation with it in the widest variety of spheres."
"Notwithstanding the many strategic reasons for this partnership, however, it must be based on respect for the European understanding of values."
"It may well be the case that parts of the EU are dependent on Russian energy and raw materials, but this must not mean that we betray our democratic and human rights principles."
"We must set an example and involve Russia in matters relating to the rights of minorities, in particular with regard to the protection of Russian minorities in the Baltic."
"A comprehensive peace process must be set in motion in Chechnya, with the help of all democratic forces in society."
"Military action is more than merely a dead end; it is a disaster, and not only that, but a crime."
"The Stalin and Brezhnev eras may be things of the past, but the postCommunist tsarist approach of the Kremlin, with its restrictions on freedom of the press and information, renders a peace process in Chechnya impossible."
"Our only hope is the development of civil society."
"What we want is a political solution, and one that is reached with the assistance of the EU. I was present when the handing down of sentences to Mr Khordokovsky and Mr Lebedev began in Moscow, and this sentencing, which is still in progress, is shocking evidence of the contempt with which the EU’s fundamental values – the rule of law, democracy and human rights – are being treated."
"What other explanation can there be for these two people attending the preliminary hearing under heavy guard and in an iron cage, as though they were dangerous predators?"
"Large parts of the indictments were reproduced word for word in the grounds for the ruling, right down to the mistakes."
"The breakup of Yukos is an economic death sentence, and Khordokovsky is not being given a fair chance in this political show trial."
"Is this Russia worthy of being a strategic partner of the EU?"
"Proceedings in accordance with the rule of law are inseparable from human rights under any regime, and that is also the case in empires."
". Commissioner, on behalf of all the members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I should like to welcome the outcome of the EURussia summit."
"Russia has been a source of fascination for all of Europe throughout modern history, or in other words since the Middle Ages."
"On the one hand, we saw it as the successor to Byzantium and a bulwark for Europe against invaders from the East."
"On the other hand, we regarded it as an Asian country, and thought of it primarily in barbarian terms."
"On the one hand we saw its lofty traditions, the golden cupolas of its churches and its culture, whilst on the other we saw the staggering riches of its rulers and the extreme poverty of millions of its citizens."
"Opposing views of this kind are still to be found in today’s motion for a resolution."
"On the one hand, Russia is described as a major supplier of raw materials that are vital to the European Union, as well as an enormous market and a potential ally of European culture and traditions."
"On the other hand, misgivings are voiced regarding the great expanse of Eastern Europe and Russia’s powerful armed forces, which are equipped with modern weapons and which have already been involved in a number of peacekeeping missions with EU troops, for example in the Balkans."
"The authors of the resolution should have reserved attacks of the kind to be found in the part of the resolution demanding common standards of behaviour for the armed forces of another of our partners, if we are to believe the reports from Iraq."
"I am assuming, of course, that the necessary steps have not yet been taken in this respect."
"The contradictions I mentioned previously can also be seen clearly in a number of amendments."
"I would call on the Members of this House to remember who it was that protected Europe from the Nazi terror 60 years ago, and, even as they criticise totalitarianism, to avoid succumbing to Russophobia."
"When voting on this resolution, we should ensure that a spirit of constructive cooperation prevails over mistrust and condescending advice."
"After all, we cannot ignore the fact that millions of Russians died in order to liberate Europe."
"We should never fail to make a clear distinction between the loyal ally which played a large part in liberating most of Europe, and which fulfilled its commitments towards its other allies in Asia 60 years ago, and the country that attacked us."
"This distinction should also be reflected in the relevant parts of our resolutions and debates."
"When fervent advocates of democracy talk in this Chamber about the problems experienced by national minorities in Russia, even though they themselves come from countries where hundreds of thousands of citizens have not been granted citizenship, I find it hard to know whether they are making fun of all of us, or whether they are merely demonstrating barefaced cheek and a shaky grasp of what democracy means."
"We need Russia as the European Union’s closest ally, and we need it as a friend, in order to resolve the everincreasing problems with which the world today confronts us."
"Friends should be asked, not ordered to do things, and Members of this House should remember this when voting on the resolution tomorrow, whilst ensuring that their own personal views take a back seat."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, modernday Russia inherited the historical legacy of the Soviet Union, and regards itself as the rightful heir to the latter."
"It stubbornly refuses to make any kind of attempt to account for its criminal past in its relations with neighbouring countries, including Poland."
"This past includes the MolotovRibbentrop Pact of 23 August 1939 and the genocide such as that committed against Polish officers murdered in Katyn, Kharkov and Mednoe in 1940 and in numerous NKVD dungeons over the following years."
"Another burden that weighs heavy upon present relations between the EU Member States and Russia is the fact that the latter has made no apology for the communist dictatorship that was imposed upon the Central and Eastern European countries after the end of the Second World War."
"When voting on today’s report, we should not forget that the arrogance and hypocrisy displayed by the Russian authorities with regard to the issues I have mentioned, together with Russia’s current policies, on Chechnya, Georgia, Moldova and the Baltic states, blatantly violate democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights, and hence the values to which the European Union so readily subscribes."
". Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is interested in developing good relations with Russia, and this process has to be a bilateral one."
"There are spheres where this has happened successfully, but in other spheres matters have actually worsened."
"The countries of Europe have had differing historical experiences of relations with Russia."
"For Latvia and the other Baltic States the experience was particularly tragic."
"The USSR occupied the Baltic States twice."
"Over 60 000 innocent people were sent from Latvia to Siberia in cattle trucks, without any legal process, and only a few returned."
"To a great extent the deportations were carried out so that the possessions and homes of those expelled could be handed over, lock, stock and barrel, to the new settlers."
"Russia must acknowledge the occupation of the Baltic States."
"This would also make it possible to legally distinguish national minorities from immigrants, whose rights in Europe are regulated by entirely different laws or norms, as my fellow Members have stated here; this is a subject on which Latvia has to listen to unfounded accusations by Russia."
"Our duty in the European Parliament resolution is to send a clear signal to Russia, stating that the retreat from democracy which we have observed recently is unacceptable."
"In order for us to be successful, it is important for the countries of the European Union to speak with one voice to Russia, and also to pull no punches in calling things by their real names."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Malmström report is a balancing act."
"Let me say straight away that the European Union quite obviously always gives priority to countries that are members of the European Union, and that these countries are granted particular protection and support for historical, political and economic reasons."
"In this instance, this applies primarily to Poland and the Baltic states."
"Secondly, we cannot ignore the fact that Russia is undergoing a major transformation, and that throwing off the Soviet system is a key aspect of this process. The success of the latter in many areas means that supporters of the old Soviet system now appear to have no real chance any more of being elected in Russia."
"Thirdly, we must realise that a process of this kind can only work in the long run if it is based on democracy, the rule of law and human rights, and we must acknowledge that there are grounds for criticism in this respect."
"This brings me on to my fourth point, however, which is that we must keep lines of dialogue with Russia open."
"It is for this reason that we are building a strategic partnership, which has been embodied in the four common areas, for example, and the common energy policy, which will be formulated in such a way as to prevent onesided dependence on our part."
"The events that will take place in 2007, and our joint preparations for these events, will also be a focus for this strategic partnership, as 2007 will see the expiry of the partnership and cooperation agreements, the holding of elections in Russia and the planned entry of Russia into the WTO."
"Enlargement will perhaps have been completed by this time, and we may even have a constitution."
"It follows that we must make sensible preparations for 2007, when all these events may take place."
"In my opinion, and even though we must continue to voice our criticisms, it would therefore be useful to emphasise the importance of keeping channels of dialogue open. This would allow us to help ensure that developments in Russia move in a sensible direction, which is in both our interests and our neighbours’ interests, and would help prevent fresh outbreaks of hostility."
"Most importantly, dialogue with Russia is necessary because we need the country’s help on such matters as the Middle East, the UN and the Security Council. Even though criticism is necessary, therefore, we should also maintain a spirit of friendly cooperation, and we should continue to pursue the goal of achieving such a balance."
"Mr President, two weeks ago, after a long preparation period, Russia and the European Union reached agreement on how their strategic partnership should take shape, thus demonstrating that the European Union and Russia can make strides forward in their mutual relations despite the previous impasse."
"Does this agreement mean that all questions surrounding EURussia relations have been answered?"
"The answer is still in the negative."
"While the roadmaps that have been laid down indicate to both partners where they can begin to improve their cooperation in a number of areas, other questions remain unresolved, and I should like to single out three of them."
"Russia and the European Union have a large number of common interests in the areas of the economy, energy, security and the fight against crime."
"At the same time, it can be said that there are worrying developments within Russia as regards the values for which the European Union stands, not least democracy, the rule of law and transparency."
"Commissioner Wallström was right, in her report, to devote a great deal of attention to this."
"In its approach towards Russia, the European Union must try to strike a balance between those values and interests, one that will, at the same time, enable us to have a positive bearing on Russia’s internal developments."
"The establishing of a transparent democracy and economy in Russia is not only a theoretical concept in the longer term; it is also a matter of common concern to the peoples of Europe and Russia."
"In order to be effective on this score, the Member States must manage to keep their ranks closed in the direction of Moscow."
"A second point is the resolution of the deadlocked conflicts in Moldova and Georgia."
"The EU must do everything in its power to persuade Russia to adopt a more cooperative stance, and we must capitalise on the room in the agreements recently concluded."
"Finally, Russia is a crucial factor in the success of the Neighbourhood Policy in the new neighbouring countries, but policymaking and implementation are far too inadequate for the time being."
"The EU’s Russia policy must take greater account of the neighbourhood policy objectives, which should not become secondary to relations between Europe’s capitals and Moscow."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the way in which the European Union has dealt with Russia does not inspire me with very much confidence, certainly not when one considers the terrible war in Chechnya."
"Indeed, in their talks with Putin, most Heads of Government avoid sensitive issues such as the war in Chechnya and observance of human rights."
"If they do say anything at all, their views sometimes conflict."
"In the European journalist Ben van der Velden’s book. ‘European powerlessness’, I read a transcript of an interview between the author and Commissioner Patten."
"On 27 October 2003, Commissioner Patten had the following to say about his contacts with the Russian Government, and I quote: ‘My unusual opinion is that you do not achieve anything with friendly meetings."
"You have to look at what you get from the other party."
"At summits, you must also be prepared to make a nuisance of yourself about an issue such as Chechnya.’"
"This House has always stood for an inclusive peace process, in other words a process that encompasses all layers of Chechen society, inside of Chechnya but also the rebels who renounce terrorism."
"It is true that at summits, the nonobservance of human rights and the fight against international terrorism should be on the agenda, but so should a political solution, which we should try to enforce."
"With all due respect, Commissioner, it is a bad thing to talk about support for socioeconomic recovery on top of the desperately needed humanitarian aid, without there being a serious solution to the conflict."
"I have visited Chechnya and Grozny, and I saw what happened with the funds."
"Either they are used to erect government buildings or they will soon end up in the hands and pockets of criminals such as Ramzan Kadurov."
"That is a reality, and perhaps we should acknowledge that a flexible approach does not work in Russia."
"Maybe we should acknowledge and do what Khrushchev did at one time in a meeting for the United Nations: he took off his shoe, pounded the table and said ‘This is my will’."
"Why does Europe not do this in relation to the war in Chechnya?"
"– Mr President, we need to examine how we look on Russia – from which point of view we look on Russia."
"From the point of view of the Americans, we will look on her as an adversary; from the point of view of the former Warsaw Pact, we will look on her with fear."
"The point is: do we look on her as a country with which we can cooperate?"
"We are laying down conditions here. Let me read in particular condition 24, in which the EU 'asks Russia to reaffirm its commitments to the territorial integrity of Georgia and Moldova and to withdraw its military forces from Georgia and Moldova in accordance with the request of these sovereign states'."
"And rightly so."
"Why did you not impose the same condition on Turkey and ask it to withdraw its military forces from an occupied country which is a Member State of the European Union?"
"Why the double standards?"
"Why are we asking Russia to withdraw its military forces from Georgia and Moldova – and rightly so – but not asking the same of Turkey?"
"You are asking Russia to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on the environment."
"And rightly so. Why did we not ask the same of the Americans, who pollute the environment 16 times more – according to official statistics – than Russia?"
"Mr Barroso made a distinction earlier between demagogy and democracy."
"I greatly fear that the Commission and the Council of Europe are being demagogic on this matter."
"When discussing our relations with Russia, we frequently think in terms of the Russian people, the Russian culture and our dealings with Russian businesses."
"It should come as no surprise that our thoughts on the matter are favourable."
"At the same time, however, President Putin’s policies present us with a problem."
"This is a man who violates human rights, who places restrictions on economic and political freedoms, who has reverted to a Stalinist interpretation of history and who has awarded a medal to General Jaruzelski."
"The latter was joint commander of the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia and in charge of the defeat of Solidarity."
"‘Divide and conquer’ has been one of the guiding principles of the Kremlin’s policies for some time now."
"Russia maintains close, and even friendly, ties with certain EU countries, whilst snubbing others."
"One could say that this is a political strategy that has been employed since time immemorial, but I would ask why the other side should have to sit back and allow it to happen."
"At the same time, of course, we should be asking ourselves who this other side actually is."
"Is it just a few Western countries whose governments believe that friendship with Russia is worth the extra expense, no matter what history has to say, are we referring to the countries of Eastern Europe that are subject to increasing pressure from Russia, or do we in fact mean the EU as a whole?"
"A great deal has been said about the EU’s common foreign policy recently, in particular with regard to the Constitutional Treaty."
"The issue we are now debating will put this policy to the test."
"Now the EU must send out a clear sign of solidarity to Russia, and a sign that we will gauge its good will towards the EU as a whole on the basis of its approach to the new Eastern European Member States."
"Mr President, it is quite clear that cooperation with Russia is immensely important."
"At the same time, however, the kind of Russia with which we cooperate is equally important. As the rapporteur notes, our cooperation should be based on common values, but the fact is that Russia is moving ever further away from such values as democracy and civil liberties."
"Common values are therefore a goal rather than a reality, and both the Council and the Commission should do everything in their power to ensure that this goal is achieved."
"The second point I should like to make is that the agreement signed in Moscow is a real step forward in the dialogue between the European Union and Russia."
"Amongst other things, it will make it possible for us to resolve local conflicts, such as those in Transnistria, Nagorno Karabakh, Abkhazia and South Ossetia."
"At the same time, however, no mention is made in this agreement of the Chechnya issue."
"This is absurd, as how can there be any question of forging a common policy with Russia or establishing a common area of freedom, security and justice if no reference is made to events in Chechnya?"
"The same is true for energy policy, on the subject of which Mr Schmit said that there was a prospect of removing obstacles to energy cooperation."
"I should like to ask the Council and the Commission whether this means that they would be in favour of the Baltic pipeline."
"The latter would run along the bottom of the Baltic Sea, and could facilitate a diversification of energy sources for various EU Member States."
"Thirdly, the success achieved by all of us will depend first and foremost upon the coherence of our common foreign and security policy, and the extent to which it takes into account the interests of all the 25 EU Member States."
"I would stress the word ‘all’, as we cannot afford to allow Russia to play off certain EU Member States against others."
"What kind of EU would we have then, and what kind of community?"
"My country, Poland, is essentially interested in cooperating closely with Russia."
"Yet for many years now, Russia has attempted to prove to the world, and to the European Union, that Poland is holding back dialogue between Russia and the West."
"It should therefore be stated in plain terms that we are emphatically in favour of a pragmatic and coherent approach which involves working as partners, and which takes into account the interests of all the EU Member States."
"Mr President, Mr PresidentinOffice of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by warmly thanking Mrs Malmström for the excellent cooperation."
"We did not see eye to eye on every aspect of the first draft, but Mrs Malmström managed to incorporate a great many of our ideas and to draft compromise amendments."
"This has resulted in a very broad consensus, and I should like to thank her on this score."
"I believe that the report we now have before us achieves a good balance between the views of those who believe that we should regard Russia first and foremost as a strategic partner, and of those who believe that democracy and human rights must be the focus of our relations with the country."
"I see no contradiction between these two approaches; in my opinion, it would be unfeasible to emphasise one and ignore the other."
"Furthermore, I believe that this is the message that emerges from this report."
"There can be no question that Russia is a strategic partner for the EU, but we would have preferred to see it actually acting as such during the events in Ukraine."
"Ukraine would also have been glad had this been the case, but unfortunately it was still too early for such a thing."
"We would be delighted to have Russia as a strategic partner with regard to policies on Belarus, and if this were to happen there would surely be no limit to our success in developing democracy."
"The same applies to South Caucasus, and we would also be glad to have Russia as a strategic partner with regard to Georgia."
"Yet such strategic partnerships must not be conducted on Russia’s terms, or even on Europe’s terms; they must be conducted in accordance with the terms laid down by the peoples of Georgia, Ukraine and Belarus."
"In my opinion, therefore, this is precisely the direction in which we must move."
"We must constantly remind Russia that we want to act as its partner, but the basic requirements for such a partnership must remain unaltered."
"Commissioner, you said that we must speak with one voice, and it is my belief that this House is prepared to do so."
"Should you run into any problems when dealing with the Council, I would advise you to ask this House for its assistance, as we will give you our full backing."
"Thank you, Mr President. We all acknowledge how important relations between the European Union and Russia are for the security and stability of the continent of Europe."
"The peoples of Europe, however, differ in their conceptions of the possibilities and terms of forming relations with Russia, according to their historical experiences."
"The history of relations between Latvia and Russia makes me cautious, in practice, in assessing the processes taking place in Russia now."
"The fact that Russia’s economic growth is closely tied to the rise in energy resource prices on the world market, and has not been accompanied by social and economic reforms, does nothing to engender confidence in longterm and stable growth in that country."
"The parlous state of human rights in Chechnya, the increasingly clear display of authoritarian tendencies, the evergrowing focus on the glorification of Soviet totalitarianism, the return of Soviet symbolism, Russia’s refusal to acknowledge the brutal occupation of the Baltic states carried out by the Soviet Union, and yet more — just as in Chechnya, Russia shows a complete disregard for the fundamental human rights that relatives of the victims of Soviet totalitarianism have to obtain archive information on the Soviet Union’s executioners, coupled with Russia’s delays of almost 10 years in signing the border agreement with Latvia."
"These are the realities of today’s Russia, and they make me worried."
"Mr President, EURussia relations are not at their most cordial at present, after a serious loss of face for Russia following Ukraine’s Orange Revolution six months ago."
"President Putin seriously overestimated his ability to impose his chosen candidate on the Ukrainian people, even if it meant rigging the election."
"He wrongly expected the same reaction as shown by the EU to the flawed election the previous year in Azerbaijan."
"Ukraine has now courageously sorted itself out and started out on an independent path – as has Georgia – and Russia, unsurprisingly, is not happy with this."
"Neither is Russia particularly pleased with the role played by the independent Baltic republics with their enhanced status in foreign affairs as full EU members."
"The statement by President Putin that they voluntarily agreed to be annexed by the Soviet Union is laughable."
"The EU remains deeply critical of the widespread atrocities in Chechnya, including the extrajudicial execution of Aslan Maskhadov."
"Russia, however, is fortunately now making some moves towards punishing those responsible for some of the atrocities."
"There remains strong appreciation of Russia’s internal struggle against fundamentalism and support for the global war against international terrorism."
"I support a strong Russia with its recognised international borders, but say ‘hands off Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova’, and I call upon it to help solve the Transnistria question."
"I am also deeply worried by the rise in Russian antiSemitism."
"Russia remains the EU’s strategic energy supplier and giant immediate neighbour, so we must encourage dialogue and shared values and develop the four ‘common spaces’."
"Russia must not be allowed to turn the clock back to authoritarianism and abandon its respect for democracy and human rights."
"Ladies and gentlemen, one of the greatest challenges the European Union faces is to build relations with Russia, with both parties acting as partners."
"Relations with Russia and the Russian people must be strengthened in order to allow us to engage in economic cooperation and to work together to establish international norms in Eurasia."
"The European Union should pursue the goal of bringing Russia closer to the EU and to its standards and institutions."
"To this end, it is essential that the EU coordinate its external policies on Russia, both at EU institutional level and at Member State level."
"Relations with Russia should not be viewed as secondary to either shortterm economic interests or negative historical experiences."
"Russian civil society should be a key partner for the European Union in its relations with the country, and we should support it in its efforts to promote democracy, media freedom and respect for human rights."
"Modernday Russia is a heterogeneous country."
"On the one hand, it is fighting a postcolonial war in Chechnya and violates the fundamental human rights of those living in this region."
"On the other hand, however, it is a target for ruthless terrorist attacks, and a country that over the past 15 years has undergone impressive democratic transformation."
"Yet this country is under threat from the distinctive and authoritarian presidential system that is currently in place, as well as from state control over the media and violations of the rule of law."
"Even as we level criticism at the system put in place by President Putin, however, we must never forget that there is also another Russia."
"This other Russia found its full expression in the thoughts and activities of Andrei Sakharov, who was both a great European and a great Russian."
"The real Russia today, or in other words the Russia of the Memorial Society and the PEN Club, is defending Russian democracy, and it expects the European Union to support and help it in its efforts to build Russian democracy and to bring Russia and the European Union closer together."
". Ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the Malmström report is the European Parliament’s wish to discern in Russia a partner in practical, prudent and highquality cooperation."
"Russia’s attitude in resolving the boundary issue with Latvia confirms the need for the report."
"Latvia lost part of its territory as a result of its occupation by the USSR."
"President Putin obstinately calls this demagogy."
"In view of this stance by the Russian powers towards historical truth and the fact that discussions about the border agreement between Russia and Latvia, which have lasted ten years, have reached deadlock, the fact that in this report the European Parliament is calling on Russia to settle the border with Latvia fairly and equitably is to be highly valued."
"Unfortunately, Russia is still unable to demonstrate such a will."
"I call on the European Union not to shy away from acting as a mediator in the fair and equitable determination of a border agreement between Latvia and Russia, to refuse to yield in the face of Russia’s strength and blackmail, to assess Russia’s attitude towards those countries once in its sphere of influence from a position of goodwill as testimony to a responsible understanding concerning the need for reconciliation between Russia and the European Union countries, and to Russia’s understanding of democratic values."
"Mr President, there has been no shortage of historical references in this debate; for Germans, too, relations with Russia possess a specifically historical character."
"I believe that all parties could unite in saying that German politicians are glad that, after many decades, good relations with Russia have been restored."
"If one is to calculate quite coldly, on the basis of our own interests and of the security interests of the new Member States, I believe that their security interests benefit more from these good relations than they would do if the situation were reversed."
"It follows, then, that it is negligent or worse to allow the EU to be used as a sort of trampoline, with the help of which one jumps up in the air in order to give the Russian bear a hefty thump on the nose."
"I wholeheartedly endorse Mr Laschet’s earlier criticisms of didactic tendencies, and what Mr Brok had to say about keeping avenues of dialogue open. I have to say, though, to Mr Laschet, that there are two things he should not do."
"For a start, you should not share out the bearskin among the nations before the bear is dead."
"Secondly, you should not make promises that you cannot keep, for I am quite certain that summits would take place between Germany and Russia even if Germany had a CDU government – and who knows, we may even see such a thing in 20 years’ time."
"You should not try to imply that such summits would no longer happen."
"Countries which were in the Soviet Union's sphere of influence, or were part of that Union, maintain rather specific relations with Russia."
"For the first time since the recent enlargement of the EU a resolution on this issue has been worked out, with us taking part in the work of this Parliament, the Parliament of a huge and powerful European Union."
"However, it has nothing to do with the settling of accounts with Russia; this is the recognition of Russia’s importance and a wish to see that country follow the main signposts of the transition to democracy, while searching for its own way."
"Can a country head towards democracy if the opposition in that country is weak and in decline, if freedom of press is restricted and the courts carry out the will of the authorities?"
"The answer is important for the entire European Union, for Russia’s neighbours in particular."
"Immense Asian Russia has been searching for a special road for hundreds of years, either getting closer to or more distant from Europe."
"Now Russia has an excellent opportunity to make a choice."
"It is very important to spell out the things which divide us, and to strive to diminish those differences and outline the things which unite us."
"We would like to cooperate with a neighbouring Russia, which is not just a strategic partner, but a reliable associate sharing our values and focussed in its search for the way ahead."
"I believe this would also be in Russia's interest."
"– Mr President, Russia should become a privileged strategic partner and the development and extension of the partnership in all sectors should be a basic and constant strategic priority of the European Union over coming years."
"Noone can doubt that Russia has a great deal of potential to play a decisive role in consolidating international security, stability, peace and a balanced international order."
"I believe that cooperation is needed in order to resolve international and regional crises within the framework of the UN and to prevent the imposition of unilateral solutions."
"The experience gained from joint participation in the Quartet to resolve the Palestinian problem, which resulted in the roadmap, should be applied to other regional problems, such as Kosovo, the crisis in the Caucasus and the crisis in Central Asia."
"There is, however, a lack of trust between the two sides which the enlargement of the European Union has exacerbated rather than reversed."
"Enlargement should be a bridge for cooperation; it should not create new divisive walls."
"From this point of view, the European Union and the new Member States have a great deal of responsibility."
"We cannot help to build strategic relations with Russia with the syndromes of fear and the experience of a traumatic past."
"The crucial factor for the future of relations between the European Union and Russia is the configuration of a joint European strategy in which all the Member States will talk the same language, not on the basis of national priorities on individual interests."
"We, as the European Union, need a cohesive and integrated strategy with vision and inspiration in our relations with Russia."
". Mr President, I agree that we must strike the right balance, and we also have to address every question very clearly and frankly."
"The important thing is to have a frank dialogue and a dialogue on every question."
"That also means a dialogue on human rights questions and, for instance, on difficult issues like Chechnya."
"I must say that we have had this very clear and frank dialogue."
"President Putin himself has been very open."
"So, I see movement, although it is not yet sufficient or exactly what we want."
"We must continue in this direction."
"This interdependence means that we must go further."
"For instance, on Chechnya, we have spoken clearly about the necessary political solution: there has to be territorial integrity but, at the same time, there must be some sort of autonomy for the people there and then there have to be free and fair elections."
"We in the European Commission feel that we must do something for the population: not only provide humanitarian aid, but also assist in reconstruction."
"We are thinking of technical assistance, as I said: training for medical doctors and teachers in the EU Member States; scholarships for students; the provision of medical and teaching equipment."
"There must be job creation and new activities for the future generation."
"These are concrete actions."
"On the question of history, we know that there are still some very difficult, delicate issues between the Baltic States and Russia."
"It is really up to the historians to clarify the past so that our people can then reflect on the dark pages of European history."
"But our priority must be to look to the future and, in this regard, I repeat exactly what I said: we have to raise every question openly, whatever it may be."
"On the BakuTbilisiCeyhan pipeline, I can only say that it has been inaugurated today with the strong support of the European Union."
"Finally, we will go on taking implementing action and we will take your comments into account, including comments on the need to guarantee human rights, democracy and stability."
"However, at the same time, we must also look to Russia, our strategic partner, for solutions to problems in its neighbourhood and for solutions to problems with ourselves."
"I should like to thank the Commissioner for her answer, or rather for her attempt to answer my question, as I did not ask about the Caucasus pipeline."
"I was asking about the Baltic pipeline, which is intended to run along the bottom of the Baltic Sea."
". Mr President, I wish to tell the honourable Member that there seems to have been a mistake."
"I have heard this in a different way."
"I can only say that this is a commercial project and have nothing else to add at the moment."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the report by Mrs Gál, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on promotion and protection of fundamental rights [2005/2007(INI)] (A60144/2005)."
". Mr President, during the present period of debates, referenda and parliamentary ratifications of the EU Constitution, we have all heard the arguments about the reasons for democratic deficit within the Union, and we are well aware of the need to make the work of community institutions transparent and to bring it closer to the people."
"At present, the work of the Union’s legislative bodies is often shrouded in scepticism and lack of concern."
"It is our especial duty and obligation to change this."
"This aim could be accomplished by means of the careful definition of the mandate and function of the Fundamental Rights Agency, the guarantee of its efficient operation and for its role to be known as widely as possible."
"The Union’s announcement, that development has shifted from an economic community to a political community of common interests, is timely and if the Union is to have a Constitution that includes the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the human rights dimension must also become stronger."
"Since it is one of the principles of the Union that fundamental rights should be treated with priority in its policy, an Agency should be set up to monitor whether these highsounding fundamental principles are being observed and to ensure that exercising fundamental human rights becomes a peopleoriented, everyday practice instead of just bare legislation."
"And now, Mr President, let me continue in English."
"Mr President, following the decision of the European Council in December 2003, this owninitiative report seeks to set out the means towards the aim of extending the remit of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia and converting it into a Fundamental Rights Agency."
"The committee and the groups agreed on my approach and although 120 amendments were tabled to the report, we managed to achieve 25 compromise amendments by which all the members of our committee have contributed to the development of fundamental rights within the Union."
"This led to an absolute majority with only three votes against."
"The core issues during the debate on the report in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs focused around certain problems."
"One was whether a new agency should be established at all."
"The main argument here, especially on the side of the PPEDE Group, was that there are already too many agencies that are not sufficiently costeffective and that thereby many of the tasks of the European institutions, such as Parliament or the Commission, would be delegated to agencies."
"I tried to make a clear point in this respect in my report."
"The credibility of the Agency, and our credibility, will be ensured by its welldefined mandate and structure."
"The committee also asked that Parliament should have a more important role in the structure, mandate and work of this body."
"As a main legal basis had to be found, we invoked Article 13. But I must emphasise that this Agency has to have a broader mandate, covering the Charter of Fundamental Rights in its totality."
"Therefore I ask the Commissioner not to interpret this article only in a restrictive sense."
"We have to make the hardly understandable legal language and structures clear, effective and operational and we need even more active cooperation between Council, Commission and Parliament."
"I can see this Agency cooperating, building the information it gathers on a network of networks, in which we can find a clear way through the jungle of European, national and regional institutions and centres dealing with human rights throughout Europe."
"Cooperation has to be a keyword in this field when we look at the Council of Europe."
"It is important to use and build upon what has been achieved so far in the Council of Europe, not only symbolically but also in practical daybyday terms."
"It is important that a functional model of cooperation be developed, as was emphasised at the Warsaw Summit."
"I think that the Agency could be a means towards this end."
"The protection of national minorities has become a very important issue since EU enlargement and it has also become clear that combating xenophobia and discrimination is not enough in itself to guarantee minority rights."
"It is certainly a crucial move to create equality of rights and not to tolerate discrimination."
"However, this is only one, surface treatment of the subject."
"In order to get a firm grip on tackling this problem, it is not enough to treat the symptoms, but we must dig to the roots and treat the malady in order to create equal opportunities."
"This complicated subject must be examined from various perspectives."
"Therefore, a separate section of the Agency must deal with traditional national minorities."
"It is a very sensitive task, and a great challenge today, to monitor the implementation of rights and to find a balance between the granting of individual freedoms and achieving collective security."
"Therefore, the Agency must stand in the centre of a European movement striving towards better observance of fundamental rights and it must apply all the knowledge from previous experience in this process."
"The goal is to be able to put the fundamental rights into the centre of all possible policies and provisions, so that we can really think of Europe as a symbol of these basic freedoms."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Gál."
"Both myself and the Commission are in agreement with the outlook, the spirit and the aims of the report, which have just been mentioned."
"Within the sphere of justice, security and freedom, the Commission has centred its operations on the promotion and protection of people’s fundamental rights."
"Following the decision made by President Barroso before this House, we formed a group of Commissioners who are precisely responsible for coordinating the Commission’s policies aimed at promoting and protecting fundamental rights."
"My proposal to the Commission to carry out an impact assessment on each of its proposals ensuring the protection and promotion of fundamental rights has already been adopted."
"It is a precautionary impact assessment, which allows the Commission to only adopt measures that will enable us to make progress in our attempts to better protect fundamental rights."
"The request came from Parliament, and I was in full agreement."
"Among the 10 priority measures included in the action plan implementing the socalled ‘Hague Programme’ for a European area of freedom, security and justice, which was approved by the Commission on 6 May, I have placed the principle of Europe’s promotion and protection of fundamental rights at the very top."
"This emphasis clearly demonstrates how, in my opinion, the protection of fundamental rights is a priority that cuts across all of the Union’s policy areas, particularly when, as has been stressed a number of times, including in front of this House, it is a case of balancing citizens’ strong calls for security with respect for people’s fundamental rights."
"I entirely agree with the rapporteur’s calls for a European agency equipped with a broad remit, which is able to truly take charge of promoting and protecting all fundamental rights."
"A broad remit, which would justify a new agency being created."
"I too am convinced that there is a need to very clearly state that only a strong and effective agency can justify the conversion of the Vienna Observatory, as decided by the European Council and approved by this House, into a genuine European agency."
"I would add that this is, however, on the understanding that the agency’s objectives are the protection and promotion of fundamental rights."
"On behalf of the Commission, I can state that the report presented today meets with our full approval."
"It is clear that Parliament must have an important role."
"I agree, in fact, that it should participate in the agency’s governing body – this is a symbolic aspect, but also an important one."
"I also agree that Parliament should have its say in appointing the agency’s director, but we obviously have to resolve any strictly legal issues, which do exist and which we must take into consideration."
"They are issues concerning one or other legal basis, according to the remit that we wish to grant to it."
"Beyond the choice of legal basis, which will correspond to the remit assigned to the agency, I can confirm once again the political commitment of the Commission to take full account of Parliament’s proposals, amendments and guidelines, irrespective of the legal basis selected."
"There are clearly many possibilities: the possibility of a formal codecision process, which would be restricted, however, as many of you already know from a legal analysis, to only certain fundamental rights, or else a different procedure."
"Even if this different procedure were finally adopted, the political solution would not change in my opinion, that is to say, that it would remain the duty of the Commission to defend the proposals of this House and to take them before the Council."
"Its duty would be to defend them in substance, even if the legal basis were to be different."
"I therefore confirm this commitment, by once again thanking the rapporteur for her report."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, first I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Gál, on her exceptional work."
"I consider that the report is complete and that its contents create preconditions for the protection of citizens' personal data and fundamental rights in general."
"The incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Constitutional Treaty and the future accession of the European Union to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms will certainly create a legal obligation for the Union to promote the protection of human rights in all policy sectors."
"International cooperation by the European Union in this sensitive sector must be strengthened."
"At this point, I should like to comment on paragraphs 24 and 25 of the report and on paragraph 3 of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education, where it says that collaboration between the Council of Europe and the Agency should assume an institutional form."
"Consequently, in order for the collaboration in question to be effective, the states should apply the harmonisation for which provision is made in the resolutions of the Council of Europe."
"Creating a culture of respect for fundamental rights should be the Agency's priority and should be implemented, among other things, by developing a communication strategy."
"The structure of the Agency should, in my opinion, also support special departments to deal with mass media communication issues, such as, for example, the concentration of the media, transparency and freedom of the press and expression."
"I consider that a 'yes' vote for this report will be a fundamental step and tool within the framework of freedoms and human rights."
"Finally, the objective of the Agency is to develop a communication strategy which will help to create a culture of respect for fundamental rights and I think, despite any opinions voiced to the contrary, that this is a very important issue, as is its proposed structure."
"That is why I believe that a more attentive reading of the specific point of the creation of the Agency would be constructive. The rapporteur insists on and analyses this in her report."
". Mr President, the old Vienna Agency has had something of a chequered career."
"I myself was involved in one example where a very important report on antiSemitism seemed either to have been suppressed or improperly handled by that Agency, and it was my view then that far too much politics had been allowed to enter into the activities of the Agency in respect of that matter."
"Therefore, I would like to have clear assurances, with regard to the new arrangements, that first of all the new Agency with these wider and different roles will be objective, that it will behave in a sensitive manner and not allow any politics to enter into its work."
"On top of that I would also want assurances that it will be properly accountable through parliamentary control."
"What disappoints me is that quite often we say this is intended, but in practice it does not occur."
"So this time we must insist on these provisions and insist on these matters being secured."
"The only other matter I would like to raise is the issue of the need for a separate gender institute."
"I believe that it is totally unnecessary: we always have to careful about bureaucracy."
"I am very satisfied that this Agency will do its work in such an objective manner that it will be able to cope with the extra burdens that will be put upon it by dealing with the issues that would otherwise be dealt with by a separate institute."
"I congratulate Mrs Gál on her report and I certainly believe that with the kind of assurances that I am asking for it will have a successful start and a successful period of operation."
"."
"Mr President, Mrs Gál’s report enables us to establish the European Parliament’s priorities regarding the extension of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia’s remit to convert it into a Fundamental Rights Agency."
"We hope that the creation of this agency will make it possible to establish a real policy on fundamental rights."
"It is worth repeating that our top priority for the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice is the active promotion of fundamental rights."
"I would like to remind you that the inclusion of human dignity in Article 1 of the Charter on Fundamental Rights was a real change of direction."
"We, and governments, must take an approach that takes account of the honour of each and every person, the basis for the dignity of every citizen."
"People will be free if they have a place and rights in our society that we have organised to this end."
"And we all know that the rights to speak and write freely, to elect one’s representatives and to live as one wishes have no real meaning for people who, in their daily lives, do not have the necessary material means to ensure their dignity."
"We all know that, without the necessary dignity, there is a risk that universal rights will benefit only some."
"Commissioner Frattini has made a commitment to present the report on the creation of the Fundamental Rights Agency under the codecision procedure."
"We have listened to what you have just said, Commissioner, but we would restate that we absolutely insist on this procedure."
"MEPs are the elected representatives of the citizens of Europe."
"As the creation of a Fundamental Rights Agency would have a direct effect on the daily lives of citizens, the opinion of the European Parliament must be clearly heard."
". Mr President, let me thank Mrs Gál for a very good report and very good cooperation on all the amendments."
"I am very pleased we are voting on this tomorrow."
"Our Union is entering a new phase."
"We are in the process of creating a legal obligation for the Union to ensure that fundamental rights are actively promoted across all policy areas."
"The proposed Fundamental Rights Agency would be the practical tool in this work."
"Its main mandate covers what happens inside the Union."
"At the same time we know that just outside the Union’s borders there are literally slave markets, where young women and girls are sold to be trafficked into the sex industry in different parts of our Union."
"For instance, it is estimated that every day about 40 girls are sold from these kinds of slave markets in Moldova."
"This is the worst case of human rights violation occurring in our part of the world and the Fundamental Rights Agency should be able to confront it."
"Therefore I hope that this House will confirm the vote of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to the effect that the Agency should also be able to cover third countries when they are involved in human rights issues affecting the Union."
"I also hope that this House will state clearly that the future gender institute at the very least should work closely with and be situated in the same location as the Fundamental Rights Agency."
"This is rational and costeffective, but more importantly it should be the obvious line of thinking for anyone who believes that women’s rights are human rights."
". Mr President, the European Union promises its citizens an area of freedom, security and justice."
"The many threats to which we are exposed on a daily basis teach us that positive and proactive policies are needed not only to guarantee security, but also to secure freedom, as the latter is not merely a matter of justice."
"The rapporteur is aware of this fact, and has based her report upon it."
"I should like to thank her for doing so and to congratulate her, as this really is an eminently suitable basis for such a key decision."
"I am well aware of how difficult this decision was, because I too, in my capacity as rapporteur on the Article 7 procedure, have had a brief taster of the intragroup disputes that Mr Kirkhope also mentioned in passing."
"It is my firm belief that these stem primarily from the perpetual fear that the European Union could regain authority in certain fields, rather than from any other fears."
"My group is absolutely delighted that a number of principles have been agreed on in the course of these disputes."
"This agency is intended to act in support of the Member States, rather than to take decisions on their behalf."
"The aim is not to put in place blanket surveillance systems, but to provide institutional support, an earlywarning system and an instrument for awareness raising and dialogue."
"Information and activities will be linked up by this agency rather than bureaucratised, and I believe that anyone working in this field will be aware of the urgent need for a European network of networks, as mentioned by the rapporteur."
"The intention is not that courts should compete among themselves, but that legal disputes over the prevention of human rights violations in Europe should be avoided."
"No one wants to see Europe assuming the role of Big Brother to the rest of the world, or for it to be overeager to see motes in the eyes of its neighbours; what we want is for it to take a critical look at itself, and to carry out continual and critical assessments of the human rights situation within its own borders."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur, and to assure her of our support."
"I hope that the Commission will give due consideration to Parliament’s special role as an advocate of fundamental rights, human rights and civil liberties, and that it will also comply with this House’s wishes by providing an appropriate legal basis for this report."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mrs Gál on the important work she has carried out, because the creation of this agency for the protection and promotion of fundamental rights is a valuable body both to this Institution and to the European Union."
"An independent body is required, which also has strong links with the European Parliament."
"It is also important that, on this issue, codecision processes can be arrived at between Council and Parliament."
"Another important aspect, moreover, is monitoring the situation with regard to fundamental rights violations in third countries."
"All too often we are helpless bystanders and all too often our cooperation links pave the way for fundamental rights violations to take place in third countries."
"I believe that the difference between this agency and the European Court of Human Rights should be highlighted."
"The European Court intervenes in individual cases, whereas the remit of this agency will be to monitor a political system in its entirety, and to also monitor the legal instruments that may not comply with universally recognised standards in the area of human rights."
"I believe that we are dealing with an extremely important matter, because all too often we, as Members of the European Parliament, report instances of human rights violations without having the means to prevent them from recurring."
"Today, for instance, a boat sank off the coast of Lampedusa."
"If it had been the first time, we could have considered it to be an isolated incident."
"In contrast, such incidents occur all too often and it is necessary, therefore, to carefully assess the legislation in force."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is nothing more splendid than human rights, or in other words the right to freedom and the right to truth."
"Broadly speaking, genuine freedom is the most important of all human rights."
"What this House is debating, however, is yet another new agency which is to be given institutional form, and which has been clothed in fine rhetoric."
"This agency will of course be set up at the expense of European taxpayers."
"A new law is being introduced that will prevail in the European Union, and this supreme law, my dear friends, is Parkinson’s Law."
"What this stands for is yet another desk, yet another few dozen secretaries and yet another few dozen policymakers, whose job will presumably be to cover up the truth."
"This is a misguided way of doing politics, and it will get us nowhere."
"What is needed is equality before the law and honest information."
"This would guarantee the existence of a genuine democracy, in which people would choose what they needed and turn their backs on those who violated real human rights."
"I protest at such an interpretation of human rights and at the establishment of yet another agency."
"Mr President, one of the EU’s key tasks is to protect fundamental rights."
"At the same time, since these fundamental rights serve as a calling card for the EU, both inside and outside its borders, priority should be given to all measures that could lead to improvements in this crucial field, and we should lend our support to a human rights agency with a wideranging remit."
"I would, however, add one important caveat."
"The main EU institutions bear the brunt of the responsibility for protecting fundamental rights, since the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties, Parliament represents the interests of citizens, the Council represents the interests of the Member States, and, most importantly, the European Court of Justice is the supreme body of legal protection."
"This responsibility must not be disputed or otherwise jeopardised, and so there must be clear guidelines for the agency, which needs to play a subordinate role."
"A broader exchange of knowhow and experience would allow overall improvements to be made to EU standards, and useful improvements could be made in this field if existing institutions, instruments and procedures were networked."
"The latter must not be duplicated, however, and we must also avoid any increase in bureaucracy."
"What is particularly important is that this agency should not be set up as a forum for bureaucratic carping."
"It is for this reason, and not for the reason given previously, that paragraph 47 of Mrs Gál’s otherwise excellent report should be rejected."
"If the agency adheres to these guidelines, there is every chance that it will play a valuable part in protecting European fundamental rights, a task that – after all – falls to all of us."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the Gál report deserves our support."
"Since the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Union has legislated in sectors which touch more directly and indirectly on human rights."
"The protection of personal data, the right to asylum, equal and transparent access to justice, the fight against every form of discrimination or the protection of minorities are central components of the promotion of human dignity in a Europe of the citizens and not simply of trade or of unilateral emphasis on security at any cost."
"Now that it intervenes legislatively in these – and in all – sectors, the effect of future decisions by the Union on the fundamental rights of its citizens needs to be evaluated if the legislator is to be able to do his job properly."
"However, paradoxically, no harmonising mechanisms or procedures have yet been provided for the European Union institutions, so that this evaluation can be carried out adequately."
"Consequently, if we want to do our job properly, we need to acquire an agency, internal assistance if you like, which will support us in our job, such as the future Fundamental Rights Agency."
"This organisation should not be a study centre; it should be an independent and particularly sensitive antenna which collects information and which evaluates and jointly assists with authority and independence the development and protection of fundamental rights, especially in the Member States."
"Finally, it goes without saying that the credentials and structure of this agency must be predefined by the legislator, with the European Parliament therefore as colegislator."
"This is the reason why the Commission's future proposal also needs to adhere to the codecision procedure."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to thank my honourable friend, Mrs Gál, for her report and to say that we are delighted to see that the question of promoting and protecting human rights is increasingly the subject of consultation between the Union's institutions."
"The establishment of the Fundamental Rights Agency could certainly be dealt with positively and without too many problems, if we considered that it really might help to serve the purpose for which it is being created."
"Nonetheless, we believe that there is always the real risk, on account of its plethora of duties, of the Agency's becoming nonoperational and inefficient."
"The proposal to transfer the Centre on Racism and Xenophobia to this Agency may weaken its present remit."
"It will not be easy to achieve the independence of the Agency, which must always be in a position to safeguard the balance between security and human rights."
"However, the protection of human rights can be achieved not merely by creating competent agencies but, above all, through a real change of policies in a way such that racism against foreigners is not fostered, the strengthening of a police regime is not supported and, in general, its citizens' and everyone's rights are not undermined in the name of security."
"In the hope that this will be guaranteed, we shall vote in favour of the proposal."
"Mr President, the proposal for an EU fundamental rights agency is the height of folly, even by the standards of this place."
"It also anticipates ratification of the Constitution, which is unlawful."
"Leaving aside the monumental waste of public money, it will ensure that human rights become a permanent source of conflict across Member States as the bureaucrats seek to keep themselves busy."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights was included in the new Constitution as one of the most misconceived documents of recent years."
"A passing parade of political nonentities have given themselves the power to grant rights and freedoms to other people."
"Far worse, they have given themselves the power to remove those rights and freedoms when it suits them or their successors."
"These are not the actions of democrats."
"My rights and freedoms, Mr President, are not in your gift and they are not at your discretion, they are my birthright."
"This Charter and this proposal profoundly misunderstand the nature of human rights and they reflect this House’s obsession with social engineering."
"Mr President, I am pleased to follow the honourable gentleman, Mr Mote."
"With that contribution, he gives us evidence that he is an expert on political folly."
"As a member of UKIP, he gives us a double affirmation of that."
"Let me say Mr President, that discrimination diminishes every single one of us and if we stand by and do nothing, we endorse it."
"That is why I welcome Mrs Gál’s report and the establishment of the fundamental rights agency."
"However, we must not make too many demands upon the agency or it will fail in the beginning."
"It needs to work in conjunction with the three institutions and ensure that the proposals coming from those institutions are compatible with and not in contradiction of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and our international obligations."
"Its focus should be within the EU, but at the same time it should have a role in the formulation of our EU Association agreement."
"I welcome this consultation process but I will pay more heed to the concrete proposals that will follow."
"Let me say two things."
"Mr Kirkhope, who is no longer in the Chamber, said that politics should not enter the work of the agency."
"It seems to me that he wants to neuter the organisation before it begins."
"Decisions to end infringement of fundamental rights must be taken in the political context and cannot be taken regardless of those consequences."
"Indeed, some political delegations in this House have never voted in favour of nondiscrimination measures."
"That in itself party politicises nondiscrimination measures and fundamental rights."
"Mr Pęk was vehemently against this: European taxpayers will pay."
"If European taxpayers had not paid, we would still be under the stranglehold of the demonisation that followed the Second World War and Soviet domination."
"We must have the guts to pay for our freedoms and defend them."
"If Mr Pęk and Mr Mote are against it, Mrs Gál must have taken the right route and I recommend this report to the House."
"Mr President, the introduction of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the European Constitution is a step forward in the Union’s political dimension towards a more democratic and more social Europe."
"This commitment to human rights must be given concrete form from now on and it must be obligatory for the fundamental rights dimension to be incorporated into any new legislative proposals."
"As Socialist coordinator in this Parliament’s SubCommittee on Human Rights, I am in favour of the creation of the Fundamental Rights Agency."
"I understand the concerns expressed by certain Members, but I entirely disagree with their opinion; this is one of the most important agencies."
"By means of the powers proposed in the report, the Agency will ensure that we act consistently in terms of promoting and protecting human rights."
"We therefore support the decision that this initiative should be treated as a legislative initiative by the European Parliament."
"I believe that it is very important for the House to demonstrate its support and to be heard where initiative on fundamental rights are concerned."
"This democratic platform that we are going to create will benefit everybody: Member States, international bodies, civil society and third countries."
"The request for transversality of fundamental and human rights must also, and especially, be taken into account in the Union’s foreign policy."
"Finally, this decision can only lead to greater and better promotion and protection of human rights, inside and outside the European Union."
"Mr President, I agree with many who have spoken before me, that we are witnessing a process of historic importance when we see that the EU has overcome its previous obstacles and has set the goal of representing and protecting human rights."
"Its institutional structure should not frighten us, but we should rather give our congratulations for this initiative."
"I certainly agree with people who believe that the protection of human rights must be viewed in a political context, there is no other way."
"I would, however, like to emphasise the issue of cooperation between the institutions."
"I believe that the various institutions that the EU has recently established, or will establish in the future, must prove that they are able to cooperate in an ideal fashion, strengthen each other, and really carry out effective work with the help of civil organisations and civil initiatives."
"I, myself, am a member of an equal opportunities working group and believe that the Institute for Equal Opportunities, which is soon to be established, will need to participate in this work."
"The work of the European Roma Forum, that ‘specialises’ in monitoring discrimination, may also contribute to the success of this future Institute."
"I congratulate the rapporteur."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank all those who have spoken and who have offered important contributions to the excellent work of the rapporteur."
"I believe that EU action on fundamental rights and freedoms requires positive intervention and not only protection."
"On behalf of the Commission, I would like to illustrate what the agency must not represent."
"It must not and cannot be a super court of law, or a new legislator, because the legislative function is entrusted to you, to the Commission and to the Council, and certainly not to the agency."
"The agency must not and cannot be a bureaucratic structure for accusing the Member States, but rather an organisation serving all of the EU institutions, an effective organisation providing assistance to Member States and support for their policies."
"It must not be an organisation for solving isolated issues or for spreading controversy, as someone said."
"The agency can be none of those things."
"I fully agree with those who said that we need European awareness directed towards the respect of fundamental rights and freedoms."
"Duplications with other organisations and bureaucratic inefficiencies must therefore be avoided."
"On this point, I believe that the work of the Council of Europe must be taken into consideration in the light of its farreaching importance."
"We intend to agree upon a common line with the Council of Europe in order to avoid overlaps and to utilise its crucial experience."
"Some people have reintroduced the subject of geographical competence: should its mandate be only inside the Member States or also outside them?"
"We will devote particular attention to the debate and to the decision that will be adopted by Parliament, but I believe that, to begin with, the agency certainly can and must have geographical competence inside the Member States."
"This does not, however, exclude – with reference to candidate countries, for instance, or to those countries linked to Europe by the socalled neighbourhood policies – the possibility of action that does not consist of intervention, but of important monitoring efforts and of communicating information to this House."
"I will conclude my speech by stressing the wholehearted desire of the Commission to maintain ongoing dialogue with Parliament, because it is unthinkable that, on such an important issue as fundamental rights, action should not be taken in direct and continuous contact with this House, paying attention to its opinions."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the oneminute speeches on matters of political importance."
"Mr President, vigorous protests have been voiced against offshoring on many occasions, both in this Chamber and elsewhere."
"They are heard most frequently at times when businesses based in the old EU decide to move part of their production to the new Member States."
"At the same time, however, the new Member States themselves are now starting to experience this problem."
"The French company Thomson is relocating from Poland to China, and Vistula, a homegrown Polish manufacturer of brandname suits, is relocating to Ukraine."
"This is only the thin end of the wedge, as the number of cases of this kind will continue to rise."
"It is telling, however, that no one in Poland is demanding that rigid legal obstacles be put in place to stop this process, even though unemployment is currently very high, and neither is the phenomenon of offshoring being used as a bargaining chip in political disputes."
"In fact, quite the reverse is true, as everyone agrees that entirely different measures should be taken to prevent offshoring."
"First and foremost, these measures should involve reducing labour costs and increasing the competitiveness of goods that are produced."
"I believe that the Polish approach merits closer inspection, and I would recommend it to any country that is proposing to introduce draconian measures to the detriment of entrepreneurs who have taken the guiding principle of the common European market seriously."
"This applies particularly to France and Germany."
"Mr President, the majority of the new Member States, unlike the old ones, do not enjoy a visa free regime with the United States."
"The Washington administration has offered a roadmap to the new EU Member States to facilitate their qualification for a visa free regime."
"The European Union could make a more significant contribution to the resolution of this issue."
"This is also an issue of Washington’s political will, and this will is to a large extent shaped by the US Congress."
"I would suggest that the European Parliament or the Committee on Foreign Affairs should address the US Congress to express the wish of MEPs that Congressmen should consider this problem in a constructive manner and in a spirit of goodwill."
"A visa free regime for the new EU Member States would contribute to the strengthening of transatlantic links and would promote political, economic and human change."
"This would once again demonstrate that all EU Member States are equal."
"Mr President, I just want to raise a case of the need for fair treatment of someone who has been arrested in Spain on an extradition warrant from Morocco."
"I will not go into the details of the background, but it is the contention of myself, those people supporting him and the Fair Trials Abroad organisation that he is completely innocent of any charges."
"Briefly, he helped deliver a boat to Morocco; several months later people using the boat were arrested for drug smuggling."
"He had absolutely nothing to do with that."
"However, he is detained under an extradition agreement between Spain and Morocco under which Spain and Morocco have agreed not to extradite their own nationals."
"How, therefore, can it be that Spain could contemplate extraditing another EU national?"
"It is surely a breach of EU law, which requires nondiscrimination on the grounds of nationality."
"I will therefore be pursuing this with President Borrell and asking him to take it up with the Spanish Government."
"I wish to lodge a protest on behalf of Polish nurses and midwives about the European Commission’s plans to introduce legislation that would discriminate against Polish nurses to the advantage of nurses from other Member States."
"The Polish authorities competent in such matters have the right and duty to determine the length of training in accordance with the requirements set out in the Directive, and to recognise qualifications on the basis of standard acquired rights."
"Polish nurses are demanding that Article 4(b) of Directive 77/452/EEC be deleted, and that Article 31(2) of the new proposal, which is intended to replace it, also be deleted, as they both contradict the fundamental tenets of Community law."
"They have proposed that professional degrees and bachelor degrees be added to the list of qualifications in the Annex to the Directive."
"Polish nurses should of course work in their home country, where they were trained."
"Yet the country has been left in such a disastrous state, firstly by the totalitarian and communist regime, and then by the present liberal government, that some Poles have been forced to emigrate as a result of unemployment, or because even those who find employment are paid starvation wages of EUR 200, with prices in Poland being comparable to those elsewhere in the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, several days have now passed since a young Italian woman, assisting in child support efforts, was kidnapped in Afghanistan."
"I therefore call on my fellow Members to sign an appeal for her release."
"Several Members, including Mr Brok, ViceChairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, have already signed the appeal calling on the Afghan people to isolate the kidnappers and contribute to the release of young Clementina."
"I call on all Members to help us by signing the appeal or, if they prefer, to send an email independently to the Embassy of Afghanistan in Brussels and to the largest news agencies in Kabul."
"I believe that the European Parliament, which received President Karzai during the last partsession in Strasbourg and which is helping the Afghan people in their return to normality, has the duty, in this tragic affair, to make its voice heard and its solidarity towards this young woman felt."
"Mr President, on 18 May I travelled to Cuba with Mr Protasiewicz."
"The European Union suspended diplomatic sanctions against the Havana regime a few months ago, so that consideration could be given to the future shape of relations between Havana and Brussels."
"Several weeks ago, my colleagues from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament visited the country."
"Mr Protasiewicz and I decided to visit Cuba together in order to take part in a meeting of the Cuban opposition on 20 May."
"Unfortunately, we did not succeed in doing so."
"We were deported before leaving the airport, because our names were on the Castro regime’s blacklist."
"We were not allowed to cross the border, and were instead flown to Mexico, and from there to Europe."
"I would ask the President of the European Parliament to lodge a protest with the Cuban authorities and to demand an explanation."
"I would also ask him to include a debate on the situation in Cuba and relations with the Castro regime on the agenda for the next Strasbourg session."
"Our relations with this regime must be based on respect for human rights and demands for the release of political prisoners in Cuba."
"Mr President, I take this opportunity to convey my deepest sympathy to the families of five young teenage girls who tragically lost their lives two days ago in Ireland in an accident involving a school bus in which they were travelling. I wish those still in hospital a speedy recovery."
"This matter is relevant to us obviously because of the horrific tragedy involving the loss of these young lives, but also because we have dealt with the use of seatbelts in public transport many times in this House with, I have to say, only limited success."
"The deaths involved in such tragedies are often preventable, but we have to convince our Member States that when it comes to seatbelts, our children’s lives are not negotiable."
"In Ireland there is no legal requirement for seatbelts on school buses."
"Indeed, as a moneysaving device, companies providing school transport under government contracts are obliged to permit three children to use a twoperson seat."
"I ask you, Mr President, to convey our sympathy to the bereaved families and the families of those injured."
"To the Irish Government, please convey our concerns on the safety of children using school transport in Ireland."
"Mr President, it is fortunate that a Polish Member is in the chair, as I wish to inform the House that the European Union tolerates certain practices in the Republic of Poland that blatantly contradict EU economic policy."
"I refer to the fact that Poland imposes an excise duty of 3.1% on all cars with engine sizes up to 2 litres that have been purchased in EU Member States, and of 13.6% on all such cars with engine sizes over 2 litres."
"The Polish parliament recently failed to pass a bill aimed at changing this law into one concerned with environmental protection, and this means that such dubious practices will continue."
"The victims are potential Polish car buyers, and these practices brazenly flout all the rules that apply in the European Union, one of which is equality, or so we are told."
"I would therefore ask for pressure to be brought to bear on Poland to ensure that it abandons such dubious practices, as they are detrimental to both Polish taxpayers and the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is currently debating a compromise package for the 20072013 Financial Perspective."
"The Luxembourg presidency recently sent a proposal regarding spending cuts to the governments of all the Member States."
"If this proposal were to be adopted, total EU expenditure would fall by between 4% and 7% in comparison with the Commission’s original proposal."
"It is plain for all to see that the aim behind this proposal is to weaken cohesion policy."
"A smaller budget would necessarily entail looking for ways to save money, and the Structural and Cohesion Funds, or in other words those targeted at the poorest EU Member States, would be hit hardest by such costsaving measures."
"Regional aid, which mainly benefits the new Member States, is hence to suffer cutbacks as a result of pressure from the largest contributors to the EU budget."
"It should not be forgotten that support for social, economic and territorial cohesion and solidarity between Member States are objectives that are enshrined in the European Union’s Treaties."
"We must be aware that it will be impossible to close the gap in standards of living which exists between the 15 old Member States and the new Member States, and which came about as a result of the postwar division of Europe, unless we adhere to the principle of solidarity within the EU."
"It also needs to be made quite clear that the cuts proposed by the richest countries are incompatible with the European Union’s ambitious postenlargement goals."
"Mr President, this weekend there will be a vote on the European Constitution, and it is in our interests and in the interests of this House that even more information should be made available on the subject."
"After all, we will all, on Monday, or very late on Sunday evening, be facing demands for statements on how we assess the Constitution."
"With this in mind, perhaps it might be possible to have the House’s Press Service prepare statements on the subject for our President and other interested parties."
"This Constitution is of particular importance to the public, and we are very keen that the vote should be in its favour and, above all, that the subsequent debate should also present a consistently positive view of it."
"Mr President, along with several other Members of this House, I spent Monday in Belarus."
"Our visit was connected with this country’s violation of the right of national minorities to selfdetermination and the right to representation of the Association of Poles in Belarus."
"Mr President, I should like to remind the House that presidential elections will take place in Belarus in less than a year."
"In totalitarian countries ruled by dictatorships, such as Belarus, finding a scapegoat and pinning the principal blame for failure on national minorities is a tried and tested solution."
"This is what has happened in Belarus."
"The Association of Poles has become a scapegoat, and Poland and Polish diplomats have become public enemy number one in the country."
"A programme being broadcast several times a day on two state television channels uses slander and lies to imply that Poland wishes to bring about the collapse of Belarus and to interfere in its domestic affairs."
"The Belarussian Government did not recognise the democratic elections held by the Association of Poles."
"Mr President, the only effective way in which the EU can gain any influence over what is happening in Belarus is for the European Union, the Members of this House and politicians to intervene and to provide support."
"This would force the Belarussian authorities to recognise the elections held by the Association of Poles in Belarus."
"I would ask for a debate to be held in the House on this issue."
"It is a controversial issue that ..."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the report (A60137/2005) by Mr Nassauer, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering, including terrorist financing (COM(2004)0448 – C60143/2004 – 2004/0137(COD))."
". Mr President, the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing is a political priority for the European Union."
"The Commission adopted this proposal for a third directive on the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing less than a year ago!"
"And today it is before this House."
"This testifies to the importance of this text."
"Work has progressed fast because all the institutions of the European Union have been fully dedicated to ensuring that the European Union is equipped with stateoftheart defences in the field."
"This directive builds on existing Community texts and incorporates into Community law the revised 40 recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force on money laundering and terrorist financing."
"The directive tightens the controls in the financial sector against money launderers and terrorist financers and strengthens cooperation between countries."
"Not only will the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing benefit from this, but so will the integrity and stability of the financial sector."
"The EU is also setting an example for other countries in the world to follow and match."
"The third antimoney laundering directive will prohibit money laundering as well as terrorist financing."
"It is applicable to the financial sector as well as to lawyers, notaries, accountants, real estate agents and casinos, trust and company service providers as well as all providers of goods when payments are made in cash in excess of EUR 15 000."
"These people need, firstly, to identify and verify the identity of their customer and of its beneficial owner and to monitor transactions with the customer, while taking into account a riskbased approach; secondly, to report suspicions on money laundering and terrorist financing to the national financial intelligence unit; and, thirdly, to take supporting measures, such as record keeping, training of personnel and the establishment of internal policies and procedures."
"The directive is completed with a section on supervision and offers the possibility to take implementing measures."
"With this updated system we have progressed enormously."
"I should like in particular to underline the following elements."
"The cooperation between the European Parliament, the presidency and the Commission on this directive has been extremely constructive."
"This shows not only the willingness to have a fasttrack adoption at first reading, but also the priority that all of us give to combating money laundering and fighting terrorist financing."
"Furthermore, I especially appreciated the fact that we have all shown a sincere desire to achieve a compromise on the main issues, i.e. the definition of the beneficial owner, the definition of and the application of enhanced due diligence in respect of politically exposed persons, the coverage of trusts and lawyers and last, but not least, comitology."
"In respect of comitology, I underline that in the actual situation the Commission as a maximum is willing to accept a sunset clause."
"This clause provides for the suspension of the comitology procedure four years after the entry into force of the directive."
"In accordance with Article 251 of the Treaty, these measures may be renewed by Parliament and the Council on a proposal from the Commission."
"I would like to thank Parliament in advance for making a first reading agreement possible and in particular I would like to congratulate warmly Mr Nassauer, Mr Muscat and the shadow rapporteurs on the quality of their work and thank them for the extremely constructive spirit in which they have produced their report."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union first adopted regulations aimed at combating money laundering in 1991."
"These prohibited the laundering of money from drug trafficking, and obligations were imposed primarily on financial service providers, or in other words on banks."
"In 2001, the scope of the Money Laundering Directive was expanded to cover a much broader range of offences."
"Most importantly, its obligations were extended to cover a much larger number of professions, in particular lawyers and notaries. This gave rise to considerable controversy at the time, and rightly so, because it raised questions such as whether lawyers would have to disclose confidential information they had learnt from their clients."
"A compromise was reached at the time, which remains in force today."
"The EU’s rules are based on recommendations from the ominoussounding FATF – the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering – which is a G7 body."
"These recommendations set out harmonised rules on combating money laundering, and are especially useful in that they are also applied in other countries outside the EU. It is, therefore, only sensible for us to incorporate these rules into our legislation."
"The task now before us is to amend the money laundering regulations for the third time."
"There are three reasons for this; firstly, the FATF – to which I have already referred – altered its recommendations in the summer of 2003, and these changes must now be transposed into law."
"Secondly, the Commission had in any case been asked to provide a definition of the term ‘serious offence’, which it had failed to do last time."
"The third reason, and perhaps the most important, is that the Directive will now also prohibit the financing of terrorism."
"No one would dispute the need for this instrument in the fight against terrorism."
"We agreed to adopt this Directive in a single reading."
"Of course, this meant that intense and complex negotiations were necessary in order to accommodate the interests not only of Parliament, but also of the Commission and the Council before today’s deadline."
"I am glad to say that we achieved this goal, but we were forced to make compromises in order to do so."
"What I am presenting to the House does not therefore correspond entirely to my own ideas, but unfortunately that is the nature of compromise."
"Parliament was prepared to play its part to ensure that the Directive could be adopted as speedily as possible, so that instruments for combating money laundering and terrorism could be made available without delay."
"Turning to the issue of impact assessment, there can be no disputing the fact that we must do something to stop money laundering and the financing of terrorism."
"I should like to point out, however, that we have been presented with this Directive before we have had a chance to assess properly how effective the Second Directive has been."
"It goes without saying that the new Directive will mean more bureaucracy and extra costs for financial service providers, lawyers and tax consultants, and in this day and age we must make quite sure that the demands we make of those concerned bear a reasonable relationship to the benefit we expect to derive."
"It has not yet been possible to verify whether this is the case, and the conclusion I would draw from this is that no further amendments should be tabled before this House for the foreseeable future, or until the issue of whether our endeavours in this field serve any real purpose has been settled."
"A number of improvements have been made to the Directive, and these include the incorporation of a riskbased approach, which will make it possible to refrain from further measures if the latter are not mandatory from the outset."
"This approach is now enshrined in the Directive."
"I should briefly like to touch upon three points of contention."
"As a general rule, the Directive requires clients, for example of a bank, to be identified. It further stipulates that a bank must inform the authorities if it suspects that money laundering is taking place."
"It follows from this that the beneficial owners of legal entities must also be identified, and the question arises, with regard to public limited companies for example, of the number of shares that must be held in order to be regarded as a beneficial owner."
"We agreed on a compromise of 25%."
"As was to be expected, problems relating to politically exposed persons, or PEPs, caused somewhat of a stir in the House."
"I would note, however, that this Directive is not in actual fact aimed at MEPs, but at persons who are guilty of money laundering or similar offences, and we were forced to find a way of making this rule workable."
"We therefore came to a compromise whereby the residents of a Member State will be exempt from special surveillance measures, but that the latter will apply to residents of other Member States."
"It is open to debate as to whether this is a good idea, but that was the compromise that was reached."
"As a final point, I have every sympathy for the attempts that lawyers naturally made to gain exemption from this Directive, particularly in view of the fact that it was only when the latter was amended for the second time that they were included in its scope."
"I myself would have been prepared to make the relevant changes, but I must admit that my pleas to both the Commission and the Council in this regard fell on deaf ears, and so the rules in question have essentially stayed the same."
"At least some progress has been made, however, in that it has now been made clear that lawyers do not have to disclose information to which they become privy during confidential legal consultations or legal representation."
"I should like to thank Mr Peillon and Mr Muscat, as well as Baroness Ludford, for their cooperation, which made it possible for us to conclude the matter at first reading. I would ask Members to vote in favour of this draft report tomorrow."
"It is a report about the Directive which for the first time speaks in a direct way about the concept of the financing of terrorism, as apart from money laundering."
"In fact we are speaking about two totally different processes."
"Money laundering …"
"There is no interpretation!"
"That is what we get when we are told that Maltese is an official language of the European Union!"
"So there are no interpreters here; we have no interpreters in committee; we have no translations of documents; and now we are not even able to speak our language in plenary."
"I am not going to continue to deliver my speech, Mr President."
"No way."
"You should take the necessary action on this."
"What is the use of having it down on paper that Maltese is an official language?"
"I thank the Commission and the Council;"
"I thank Mr Nassauer for his sterling work on the report, but either give us our language, or it is thank you and goodbye."
"I apologise, but there are technical issues involved."
"I will try to see to it that it does not happen again."
". Mr President, I happen to be the chairman of the committee on which the rapporteur and Mr Muscat sit."
"I wish to begin by endorsing what Mr Muscat said."
"In our committee it is always very difficult to get interpretation into the mother tongue from even large countries – Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic; countries that are now at the heart of our European Union."
"However, if we cannot speak in mother tongue languages in this Chamber, where it is known that we have an interest in the debate taking place, what kind of European Union do we have?"
"I just want to endorse in the strongest terms what has been said here today by Mr Muscat."
"I hope I will get injury time on Mr Muscat’s behalf for saying that, because I now want to make some warm remarks about the rapporteur, Mr Nassauer. I want to thank him for the work he has done at a time when he was enormously engaged in the REACH proposals, which are now before our committee."
"He has taken a subject of real public relevance: the security of the citizen and how best we ensure it."
"He has found an effective compromise and I hope our own amendments in the IMCO Committee, of which he is also a distinguished member, will support that."
"He has been able to tread the perilous path between alarmism on the one hand and complacency on the other."
"My main concern with the amendments we tabled was to ensure that ordinary consumers would not be disproportionately inconvenienced in carrying out financial transactions, whilst we know that we need to combat money laundering."
"This, of course, is not the first money laundering definition."
"I do not know whether Thomas Jefferson would approve, but the times in which we live need a balance to be struck between liberty and security."
"However, we do not want to exchange one category of vulnerability for another."
"The vulnerable citizen can be made vulnerable by excessive security measures, as well as by the processes of terrorists themselves."
"Just at the time that our committee was describing these matters, a terrorist bank raid took place in Northern Ireland – the largest bank raid in the history of that province."
"That shows the importance today of stopping up the areas where terrorists operate and finance themselves."
"The various draftsmen of opinions from the different committees have all provided the expertise which was properly supportive of what Mr Nassauer has done."
"This is a compromise to which the banks, the lawyers, the accountants, the notaries and the ordinary citizen can look with confidence."
"I hope this dossier will, therefore, be concluded at first reading."
"Terrorists cannot succeed unless they have the financial means with which to do so."
"We, however, need to measure our response to this unprecedented terrorism with the needs of the citizens’ own defences for the sake of civil liberties."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Nassauer and everyone else involved in what we hope will be a first reading agreement."
"I was responsible for drafting the opinion of the Legal Affairs Committee, which concentrated on two aspects: the position of lawyers and the process regarding, in particular, the review under the second directive."
"When I say the position of lawyers, I mean not just lawyers but also their clients and their clients’ access to justice."
"All of us know that Parliament has received a number of petitions from bar organisations around Europe."
"There have been legal challenges in Member States and, indeed, similar legislation had to be repealed in Canada because of a constitutional challenge."
"There are therefore concerns about the position of lawyers."
"It is with some sadness that we note that not all the amendments tabled by the Legal Affairs Committee in this regard were adopted."
"Having said that, we are happy to accept the compromises."
"However, with regard to the review, I asked the Commissioner in a written question if the review could still go ahead."
"He assured me that it would be completed by 2006."
"I would ask him to reiterate that assurance tonight and, if possible, tomorrow morning before we vote, so that lawyers at least know their position will be subject to review."
"– I should first like to commend Mr Nassauer on his excellent report, which received the backing of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"The Union, the Member States and the citizens must be protected by stepping up the fight against money laundering."
"The perpetrators of this crime must not be allowed to take advantage of the free movement of capital and the free provision of financial services."
"We must also address the issue of terrorist financing. We are aware that these are two different crimes."
"Money laundering is the concealment of the proceeds of criminal activity and lies at the heart of organised crime."
"If we succeed in combating it, we will substantially weaken international organised crime networks."
"Terrorist financing can also involve the use of goods acquired legally to finance terrorism; in other words, it does not necessarily follow that a crime has been committed but the act of financing, in and of itself, constitutes a crime."
"A further objective is to widen the scope of the directive to cover other categories of profession, whilst ensuring that measures remain proportionate."
"I welcome the fact that the compromise reached in the second directive, preserving the relationship of trust between lawyers and clients, has been retained."
"The principle of confidentiality between lawyer and client is fundamental to an effective legal defence."
"I should therefore like to raise three key issues: firstly, coordination and cooperation between financial intelligence units, which must be provided with adequate resources to carry out their work; secondly, those Member States that have yet to transpose the second directive on money laundering must do so at the earliest opportunity; thirdly and lastly, current legislation on money laundering must, as a matter of urgency, be assessed to monitor its relevance and its practical impact."
"."
"Mr President, Mr Nassauer’s report enables us to extend the fight against money laundering to terrorist financing by complying with the new international requirements."
"Our work with the rapporteur was very constructive, for which I thank him quite particularly."
"Parliament’s positions have been heard by the Council, which has made it possible to reach a compromise, particularly with regard to three essential points that we support."
"For the legal professions, we did not want to go back on the experience of the previous directive."
"That enables us to retain a balance between the obligations regarding verification and identification requirements and the preservation of the right to a fair hearing and of individual freedom."
"We very much regret, nevertheless, that the threshold for cash payments was not reduced to EUR 10 000 and that the threshold for percentage share holdings remains at 10%."
"Similarly, we think it would have been preferable for casino customers to be identified and their identity verified for a sum of EUR 1 000."
"One problem remains, namely that of tax and banking havens, some of which are still active on European territory."
"In this respect, we find it regrettable that the amendment put forward in committee by Mr Costa and Mr Peillon was not retained."
"I would like to add that the issue of judicial and police cooperation remains central and decisive in the context of the fight against money laundering, even though it is not covered by this directive."
"Currently, the Member States still create too many obstacles for this cooperation to operate satisfactorily and to be effective."
"We find this regrettable."
"Mr President, the fact that the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing is a political priority for the European Union is shown by the speedy progress of this measure."
"The Commission adopted the proposal for the third directive only about a year ago and today it is before us for decision."
"We have cooperated closely with the other institutions to complete it all in one reading."
"I pay a very sincere tribute to the skill and cooperative attitude of Mr Nassauer as the rapporteur."
"He has done a very good job."
"The third directive brings in limited but useful changes from the second directive."
"The great improvement – the theme of this directive – is the clear emphasis on a risksensitive approach, so that there is a ‘knowthecustomer’ obligation, including identifying the true owners of companies – the beneficial owners – which is higher if there is a higher risk of tainted funds."
"Obviously, it is necessary to apply stricter moneylaundering controls in situations of higher risk, but I hope this will also mean slimming down with a simplified due diligence, as it is called, when possible."
"At present, there are thousands – perhaps even hundreds of thousands – of alerts of suspicious transactions every year across the EU."
"However, I fear that watchdogs often lose sight of the wood for the trees, and there needs to be more concentration on the really serious, suspicious transactions and breaking the criminal and terrorist financing networks."
"I hope that in implementing the directive it will be possible for banks to be more proportionate and targeted in their checks so that individual honest citizens trying to open a bank account are not swamped in red tape, while the arms traffickers, criminal gangs and greedy dictators slip through the net."
"The one, also useful, improvement is that this new directive will simplify the process, hopefully, for European citizens wanting to open a bank account in another EU country, as that bank will not have to carry out further identity checks."
"Therefore, it reduces bureaucratic burdens on EU citizens and marks a practical step in making a reality of living in Europe and crossing boundaries."
"Finally, we reached a satisfactory solution on trusts, making clear that the widespread and valuable use of this AngloSaxon vehicle in commercial and financial markets will not be prejudiced so that the City of London can sleep peacefully at night knowing that markets like the International Bond Market will continue to innovate and prosper for the benefit of the European Union as a whole."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Nassauer has undoubtedly produced a good report, to the extent that a decision has already been reached with the Council at first reading."
"I would like, however, to highlight certain aspects that give rise to further thought."
"We are debating the third directive without a clear insight into what have been the effects of the second directive."
"This excessive and erratic haste, which should have led us to assess money laundering also in terms of the fight against terrorism, has, in my opinion, led us to rush through the process, when further reflection was required."
"In particular, I believe that excessive attention has been paid to the matter of suspicion, when perhaps we should concentrate more on certainties, by ensuring individual guarantees."
"The second aspect, which, in my opinion, remains unresolved, concerns the thorny question of lawyers."
"On this matter, I believe that the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs forcefully lays down some points for reflection that Parliament must consider further."
". Mr President, I find it hard to believe that nobody questions the need for this legislation."
"As Mr Nassauer says, we do not actually have any evidence that the existing legislation works, so making it tighter is hardly justifiable at this time."
"The European Union is going out of its way, as usual, to make life difficult for ordinary businesses and citizens, and hindering business activity."
"Much more sinister, in my opinion, is the obligation on professional advisers not to inform their clients when they report suspicious transactions to the authorities."
"Turning professionals into secret informers erodes trust within society and marks the beginning of a police state."
"A better way to address terrorism is to know who is entering and leaving our countries."
"Alas, with the ongoing disagreements about how to police our borders and the drive for indefinite expansion of the Union, the prospect of reliable border controls is becoming ever more remote."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the proposed directive being debated imposes an obligation in law upon independent legal professionals to record, register and declare confidential information provided by clients receiving legal advice to the financial services in the Member States."
"As a practising barrister, I can state without any hesitation whatsoever that this would have a major impact on the independence of the legal professions, and that it would violate the code of confidentiality that is one of the fundamental principles of these professions."
"A barrister who is required to work for a third party from the moment he comes into contact with a client would turn into a key witness, or in other words his own client’s worst enemy."
"To sum up, the scope of the proposed directive is such that it represents an unacceptable intrusion into the activities of independent legal professionals."
"Derogations from antimoneylaundering measures must be granted for activities covered by professional confidentiality, in order to safeguard the proper administration of justice and the existence of a meaningful defence, rather than a sham one."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to take this opportunity to express my particular thanks to Mr Nassauer for having drafted this report, and to congratulate him on it."
"It was no mean feat to coordinate all these amendments and to conduct negotiations."
"The reason why this report is so important is that money laundering is not a trivial offence, and this is a point I should like to make to a number of previous speakers; it is a criminal act, and in fact one of the most serious, as it is both economically damaging and associated with extortion, drug trafficking and suchlike."
"These are all facts that must not be forgotten."
"It goes without saying that there are certain things that could have been added or left out, and that people will always find something to quibble about."
"My hope now is that our decisions will finally be put into practice, and that in two or three years’ time we will then be able to assess their real impact."
"It is for this reason that I regard it as so important that a report be tabled in this House in two years’ time to explain how effective these measures have in fact been."
"I will admit that I would be delighted if the Member States were to rigorously implement even half of the report’s proposals, as this would obviate the need for us to discuss a great many issues."
"Many thanks, Mr Nassauer."
"Mr President, Commissioner McCreevy, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank the rapporteur for the fact that we now have a report and for the fact that the European Parliament too is getting to overall grips with combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism."
"In the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on which I sit, we have agreed that it is not enough for us to work at combating terrorism as a crime, but that we must also look into the causes of the global spread of terrorism and into where the money comes from."
"To myself, as a former member of the Swedish parliament, it has long been clear that not only terrorism but also much of the criminal activity in our countries is financed on the basis of everything from the drug trade, legal and illicit gambling, prostitution and the trade in sex slaves to transfers of funds between banks and countries."
"Obviously, we MEPs too have to be monitored like any other citizens."
"I hope that the directive will lead to wider discussion in our home countries of what is known as dirty money."
"The fact is that money laundering does not only finance terrorism. It also corrupts our societies and is thus a threat to democracy."
"That is why today’s debate and directives are so important for the future, as well as for the European Parliament and the EU."
". Mr President, I wish to thank Members for their contributions."
"The adoption of Parliament’s opinion in line with the agreement reached with the Council will pave the way for the early adoption of this directive."
"This would not have been possible without a spirit of cooperation and compromise on all sides and the political will to make it happen."
"I would like to thank you warmly for this."
"The European Union is in the vanguard of the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing, adding to its credibility and weight in its bilateral relations with its main diplomatic partners as well as in the different international fora dealing with these matters."
"Mrs Wallis raised the issue of the treatment of lawyers."
"The Commission is favourable to the amendment to Article 39, which foresees that within two years of the expiry of the deadline for transposition of the directive the Commission will draw up a report on its implementation, which will include the specific examination of the treatment of lawyers and other professions."
"But, in any case, I reiterate my firm intention, as also expressed in replies to parliamentary questions, to carry out by mid2006 an examination of the treatment of lawyers and other legal professions, amongst others, as foreseen in the second directive, which is still applicable."
"Let me once again thank Mr Nassauer, Mr Muscat and all the others who have contributed to this positive outcome."
"The Commission fully endorses the agreement and accepts all amendments that form part of the compromise package agreed with the Council."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote on the report will take place on Thursday at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the report (A60132/2005) by Mrs KratsaTsagaropoulou, on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Decision 2001/51/EC establishing a Programme relating to the Community framework strategy on gender equality and Decision No 848/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community action programme to promote organisations active at European level in the field of equality between men and women (COM(2004)0551 – C60107/2004 – 2004/0194(COD))."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is delighted that Parliament has been able to approve, without amendment, the proposal seeking to extend the two Community action programmes in the field of equality between men and women until the end of 2006."
"This is a significant contribution to the Community’s efforts to promote equality between men and women, and I should like to thank the House for its support."
"In view of the fact that the Council adopted the general guideline in December 2004, also without amendment, Parliament’s backing will make it possible to take decisions in the very near future, and probably before the end of the Luxembourg presidency."
"These decisions will greatly facilitate the planning and successful implementation of programmes over coming years."
"Ladies and gentlemen, although to all appearances this is a simple technical solution, its impact will nevertheless be great."
"I am therefore delighted that after considering the Commission’s proposal, the House has tabled it without any additional comments."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report which we are debating proposes the annual extension of the funding for the two Community action programmes on the application of gender equality in the European Union, both of which come to an end on 31 December 2005."
"These two programmes form the nucleus of our action in the field of the European strategy for gender equality and for the strategy of the civil society organisations working in the field of gender equality."
"The first programme is the action programme on the Community strategy on gender equality, which was adopted in 2000 and helps to incorporate the gender dimension in all Community policies, in order to promote gender equality while, at the same time, safeguarding cooperation and partnerships between national authorities, organisations working to promote equality, social partners and nongovernmental organisations."
"The European Commission is proposing a total budget of EUR 61.5 million, compared with EUR 50 million in the previous budget."
"The second Community action programme concerns the promotion of organisations at European level in the field of equality."
"It was adopted in 2004 and supports the operation and activities of women's organisations with a budget of EUR 3.3 million, compared with EUR 2.2 million in the previous budget."
"The harmonisation of these programmes in the past was – and will continue to be – successful. It gave positive results in various sectors within the scope of its field of action and activity, such as equal pay, reconciling work and family life, the participation of women in decisionmaking and raising social awareness about changing stereotypes relating to men's and women's roles."
"We also make a very important step towards pluralism and the more democratic participation of civil society; in other words, by opening up Community funding to all women's organisations, rather than just to certain privileged partners, as was the case in previous years."
"However, the situation as regards equality in the European Union, including as a result of enlargement and the particular problems which are arising in the new Member States, the lack of participation by women in the productive, economic, political and social process and the discrimination which is faced today by women in particular are forcing us to be bolder in our next moves."
"In adopting this report, we are successfully and promptly safeguarding continuing financial assistance for the transitional period next year (2006), pending approval of the new financial perspectives, for actions which help to promote equality and incorporate it in all European Union policies."
"In adopting this report, we are preventing the gap which existed in the Community financial perspectives and speeding up the legislative procedures between the institutions – the European Commission, Council and European Parliament – for the approval of a final decision, as the competent Commissioner, Mr Figel, said earlier."
"In this way, we shall avoid the bad experiences of the past, by which I mean the amount of time taken to adopt programmes, the consequence of which is failure on the part of the European Commission to prepare proposals for the submission of tenders and for civil society to participate and respond to the European Commission's proposals in time."
"This is particularly important in this period, when we are all working to strengthen the Lisbon Strategy and economic and social cohesion."
"Our motion for a resolution also points out that, within the framework of the new financial perspectives for the 20072013 programming period, we need to ensure that there is satisfactory and discriminate financing of these programmes, which will allow the effective promotion of equality and the development of a fundamental role and the contribution of civil society working for equality in our democratic life."
"I thank the political groups which worked with me to achieve this agreed motion for a resolution and to speed up the procedures which will extend the life and the implementation of these Community programmes."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to address Commissioner Špidla more directly."
"The two action programmes will make it possible to provide effective support to the NGOs working in the field of equality between men and women."
"I congratulate the Commission on its work in this field."
"Above all, though, let us congratulate the goodfaith NGOs for using their useful expertise to enlighten the European institutions, which are too often cut off from the daily lives of the citizens."
"Let us emphasise, however, the extent to which most of them are lacking one important aspect: the financial resources needed to carry out their activities."
"The expertise of the NGOs is indispensable to enable us to draft balanced, specific legislation."
"If the European institutions want to be taken seriously, the political desire for a Union closer to its citizens must be translated into actions."
"We have much to do in the field of equality."
"We cannot allow ourselves to exclude some NGOs from the financing."
"Commissioner, it is my wish that this muchdemanded equality between men and women should ultimately apply to all the NGOs active in this field."
"All the NGOs must be eligible for financing regardless of their size, their experience and where in the Member States they are set up."
"I would like the services of the European Commission to simplify the procedures, to make them more approachable and more transparent, to expand the possibility of financial support to a larger number of NGOs."
"Gender equality will not be achieved by large centralised organisations, but by the actions of NGOs on the ground, close to the citizens."
"Mr President, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament strongly supports the new proposal to extend the framework programme on gender equality by one year and to secure funding for women’s organisations active at European level, as well as the moderate increase in funding of EUR 1.5 million."
"The Commission has put forward proposals in the 20072013 Financial Perspective for a new programme for employment and social policy under the name of PROGRESS, however, and this is where our views diverge."
"PROGRESS provides for substantial cuts to the budget for equal opportunities, which is the fifth pillar of this programme."
"At the same time, however, the equality of men and women is given pride of place as one of the EU’s values and objectives in Articles 1 to 3 of the Constitutional Treaty that is currently being put to popular vote."
"The Constitution also sets out the measures that we should take, and so it would be a serious mistake to consign women’s issues to the field of social policy."
"Women account for 52% of the EU’s population, which means that this is not a question of minority rights, or of social or employment policy."
"While gender mainstreaming must be implemented in all these fields, for example antidiscrimination and employment, equal opportunities must continue to be an issue in its own right, and one that is visible to women."
"Our main priority is that we should work together towards this goal and use the time remaining until 2007 to present a separate programme. We need to understand – and this is a point I should like to make to Commissioner Špidla and the House – that women are watching us."
"We have always said that our strategy was twofold, namely gender mainstreaming in all policy areas and separate EUsponsored programmes to promote women’s interests, until such a time as equal opportunities become a reality."
"I would urge you to take this factor into consideration, and to help ensure that a separate programme is drawn up."
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur and also thank her for this report."
"It was to the report’s credit that the committee voted unanimously in favour of the report."
"Its main reason for doing so was that the proposal gives us the continuity needed for promoting equality, and continuity is necessary if the measures are to have the effect, and indeed longterm effect, intended."
"Naturally, this is extremely significant because there is still such an incredible amount to do in the area of equality."
"It is sometimes stated that, at the rate at which the work on equality is going at present, we shall still have hundreds of years to go before we feel that we live in an equal society. In addition to continuity, to which attention is also drawn by the report, it is also necessary to integrate the equality perspective into all policy areas."
"I also want just to take this opportunity strongly to request that those organisations and projects that are to receive aid should be carefully evaluated and inspected so that the results are as constructive as possible."
". As I only have one minute to speak, I should like to make it clear that we are opposed to the implementation of a programme that seeks to promote equal opportunities by breeding hostility between the sexes, or in other words by encouraging women to regard men as the enemy in their fight for better treatment."
"All that this will achieve is rivalry between the sexes, and this is in fact something we have seen recently in the European Union."
"Attempts to play down the differences between the sexes are another dangerous trend, which has an impact on various aspects of life, sometimes with disastrous results."
"It would therefore be advisable to make allowance for these differences, and for men and women to cooperate effectively on the basis of an understanding of them."
"All human beings are equal, but gender means that men and women are different not only in physical terms, but also in mental and spiritual terms."
"Women play an irreplaceable role in every aspect of family and social life."
"The Holy Father, the late John Paul II, gave a very accurate and faithful description of this unique type of care and selfsacrifice by calling it the genius of women."
"It is an unfortunate fact that some people wish to belittle this genius."
"Mr President, this report, which has the merit of calling for the extension of two Community action programmes regarding equality between men and women that I fully support, gives me an opportunity to draw attention to the gaps and deficiencies in this field."
"Why are there such gaps with regard to respect for the rights of women and what are the reasons for them?"
"We could mention, in particular, ignorance, archaic and sometimes barbaric notions regarding the place of women in society, machismo in the workplace, the guilt of women in this matter."
"Indeed, when women stand up for gender equality, they are accused of feminism or of hating men."
"This battle for equality is a tough one, then, and the EUR 50 million or so allocated for 20012005 seem derisory in the face of rigid mentalities and existing inertia."
"Because what do we find?"
"The gap between the salaries of equally qualified men and women is still huge, violence is continuing to increase, gender discrimination in terms of access to education, training and employment persists and it is still just as difficult for a woman to reconcile work and family life."
"One last word on the European Constitution that we in France are being asked to approve or reject."
"It contains nothing that will make a real contribution to the rights of women, but simply general principles on nondiscrimination and gender equality."
"Even if only for women’s rights, therefore, let us begin by making a stand by voting ‘no’ to this draft Constitution."
"Mr President, I should just like to make an observation about the law of unintended consequences."
"A lot of the legislation that we adopt in this place does not actually work in the way that it should."
"A recent example in the United Kingdom involved a female pilot, Mrs Starmer, who has one child and, I think, has another on the way."
"She took British Airways to an industrial tribunal because it did not allow her to have parttime flying responsibility."
"British Airways suggested that she did not have enough hours or experience to take on that role."
"I think – and I have never heard anybody suggest otherwise – that British airmanship is the best in the world, even the Americans concede that."
"British Airways, as I think you will agree, is a benchmark across the globe for high standards of airmanship."
"Mrs Starmer won at a tribunal on the basis of legislation, and nobody knows when they get on a plane whether the pilot is actually competent to fly that aeroplane, or somebody who is a young mum just having fun."
"I think that is a great shame."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A60118/2005) by Mrs Britta Thomsen, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Decision 2000/819/EC on a multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, and in particular for small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) (20012005) (COM(2004)0781 – C60242/2004 – 2004/0272(COD))."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the speedy agreement reached by the colegislators on extending the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, and in particular for small and mediumsized enterprises."
"This extension will ensure that support continues to be provided to such enterprises until the end of the current Financial Perspective, and indeed the debate has already begun on the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme, which is intended to replace the current programme and is due to be launched in 2007."
"I am delighted that the colegislators have approved additional funding, and I can assure you that we will be able to put these funds to effective use in order to provide small and mediumsized enterprises with access to loan and equity finance."
"Access to financial instruments continues to be a major problem for around 1020% of European small and mediumsized enterprises."
"Our Eurobarometer surveys reveal time and time again that financing problems are the greatest obstacle to business startups, and the Community financing instruments deployed under the multiannual programme have proved very successful in overcoming this problem."
"External evaluators have agreed that our marketoriented concept is exemplary, and Parliament has also acknowledged this success by approving annual increases in the funds made available for these instruments."
"Cooperation with the European Investment Fund and use of the financial markets allow us to mobilise funds at a rate of up to 1:40 with guarantee instruments and of an average of 1:4 with the more specialised equity capital instrument, which is targeted at a smaller number of enterprises."
"The additional EUR 7 million proposed by Mrs Thomsen and approved by the House today will therefore mobilise many times this sum in investment capital for existing small and mediumsized enterprises and business startups."
"The Commission drafted its proposal in mid2004, when the European Investment Fund was extremely pessimistic about the financing instruments’ chances of success in the 20052006 period, and when there was a lack of certainty over the amount of funding that would be available in the last year of the present Financial Perspective."
"It was for this reason that we were cautious when deciding on the figure that appears in our proposal on the financing instruments."
"Positive feedback from the European Investment Fund means that we now have a better idea of the market chances of these instruments, as well as a clear idea of the funds that will be available under the 2006 Community budget."
"The Commission wishes to build on this success in the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme, and over EUR 1 billion of the Programme’s total proposed budget, which has been set at EUR 4.2 billion for the 20072013 period, has been earmarked for financing instruments."
"We have put forward proposals for two new financing instruments that will operate alongside the existing ones. The first of these is a new risk capital instrument, which is a facility for highgrowth and innovative small and mediumsized enterprises, and which is specially targeted at innovative small and mediumsized enterprises that require funding of between EUR 200 000 and EUR 2.5 million at the most crucial stage of their development."
"Finally, a new securitisation window has been proposed, the aim of which is to make it easier for local and regional banks to lend more to small and mediumsized enterprises."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the framework programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship for small and mediumsized enterprises is an important programme for every smaller enterprise in search of information or funding."
"In particular, the programme’s financing component has always been very close to the heart of the European Parliament and has consequently been increased each year by Parliament and the Council during the annual budget procedure."
"The background to the proposal to extend the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship by one year is that the functions of the programme will in future be performed by its successor programme, the ‘Framework Programme for Competitiveness and Innovation’, which is planned to run from 20072013 to coincide with the financial perspective."
"The timeframe will therefore also coincide with the Seventh Research Framework Programme, which creates scope for better coordination between the programmes."
"It was initially disappointing for me to learn that the Commission’s proposal to extend the programme by a year involved returning to the level originally budgeted for in the framework programme."
"I therefore proposed to increase the budget for extension by EUR 9.5 million more than the figure in the Commission’s proposal."
"That amount was proposed partly because it would correspond to the actual expenditure on the programme in 2004 and partly because it would make the budget for 2006 the extension year level with the average for the previous years."
"At the same time, it should be pointed out that what we have here is a programme that both users and evaluation experts regard as operating smoothly and achieving its objectives."
"It is important to maintain and extend aid to entrepreneurs and small and mediumsized enterprises in Europe."
"They are the backbone of the European economy, and their continued growth is a condition of achieving the Lisbon objectives."
"Finally, the external evaluation report has stressed that the financial instruments in the existing programme in large measure cover the needs of the new Member States."
"Restricting funds would therefore impede the integration of those countries into the European economy."
"In the programme’s financing component, the most frequently used financial instrument, the ‘SMEs’ Guarantee Facility’, had provided aid to 112 000 small and mediumsized enterprises in Europe by the end of 2002."
"Ninetythree per cent of these 112 000 enterprises had fewer than ten employees, but six per cent had fewer than 50 employees."
"The programme operates smoothly and is wideranging, and I was therefore very pleased when a unified Committee on Industry, Research and Energy backed my proposal for an increase in the budget."
"Since the extension is to enter into force on 1 January 2006, an agreement at first reading was important for both Parliament and the Council."
"My colleague, Mr Březina, and I met with the Council and the Commission on several occasions and now concur with the Council about an agreement at first reading involving an increase in the budget of EUR 7 million instead of the EUR 9.5 million I originally proposed."
"This constitutes a compromise, ensuring that the activities of the programme’s InfoCentre, together with similar activities, can be continued without a break from 1 January 2006, at the same time as the financial instruments are developed and strengthened in order to meet the growing demand from small and mediumsized enterprises throughout Europe."
"I should like to take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude to the Luxembourg Presidency, which has demonstrated great political flair and a tireless willingness to compromise; to the Commission, which has provided technical analyses and guidance in support of the negotiations; and, finally, to my fellow MEP Mr Březina, whose active participation in the meetings and unfailing support I valued very highly."
". Madam President, as shadow rapporteur for the report on the Commission proposal amending the Council Decision on the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, and in particular for SMEs, I would like to make several comments on the importance of the extension of this programme."
"Although we are extending the programme primarily supporting entrepreneurs, and especially SMEs, by just one year until the end of 2006, this is a significant tool which should, in the context of the Lisbon objectives, contribute to and enhance the growth and competitiveness of enterprises in a knowledgebased and internationalised economy."
"The importance of this decision lies above all in creating a bridge between the current programme and the Framework Programme for Competitiveness and Innovation for the years 20072013."
"This extension will give businesses easier access to Community support services, programmes and networks, and help to improve the coordination of these facilities."
"Focusing on the new Competitiveness and Innovation Programme, we are to look into the evaluation of the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship prepared for the Commission in November last year, in order to tailor the new programme more effectively and promote entrepreneurship in the EU."
"Last but not least, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Thomsen, for the excellent job she has done, not least in smoothly securing this extension and negotiating with the Council an increase in funding from EUR 81.5 million to EUR 88.5 million for 2006."
". Madam President, I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, who, by focussing on the right issues, has secured an increase in funding."
"It must not be assumed, however, that more money automatically means a better programme."
"I was present at the special meeting held in Strasbourg when the Commissioner spoke for the first time about his personal experience of this multiannual programme for SMEs, and I paid very close attention to what he had to say on the matter."
"In a nutshell, he said that he had been shocked to learn of the cumbersome application process, particularly in view of the fact that the programme was intended to boost innovation."
"He had also been shocked to discover that the main recipients of funding were not the small and mediumsized enterprises that needed it most, but resourceful enterprises that knew the ins and outs of the programmes and were therefore granted money."
"In his opinion, it is for this reason that the programmes ought to be made more rigorous."
"I should like to congratulate the Commissioner, as his analysis is entirely correct."
"I am glad to see that there appears to have been a shift in thinking on this matter, and he deserves thanks for having made SMEs the focus of initiatives for growth and increased competitiveness."
"We will be right behind him if he goes on to demand of his officials that programmes should exist not merely for bureaucratic reasons or because they have impressive names, but only if they concentrate on SMEs, or in other words on those enterprises that are in need of help."
"We have had enough of programmes that are nothing more than fancy names; what we need now are clear and innovative strategies for SMEs and new forms of financing."
"In future, these programmes will be combined in the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme."
"This is both a consistent approach and a step in the right direction, and I particularly welcome the fact that parallels will exist between this Programme and the Seventh Research Framework Programme."
"We must not repeat past mistakes, however, even if everything is now to be combined in a new document."
"What matters is that growth and jobs are the ultimate goals, rather than the ideological gratification of political groups."
"Yet we are running the risk of this being precisely what happens in the case of the CIP; one need only look at the heavy emphasis on ecoinnovations and energy efficiency for proof of this."
"More questions need to be asked in this respect, and I will be able to ask some of these in my capacity as rapporteur."
"We are about to adopt a new Financial Perspective, at a time when the citizens of all the EU Member States are being increasingly careful with their money."
"They will regard it as unforgivable if we, their legislator, miss the opportunity now available to us to opt for the provision of real support to SMEs and for priority to be given to creating more jobs, and if we instead indulge in ideological disputes."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I can congratulate the small and mediumsized enterprise that is present in the Chamber this evening."
"Our reaction has been both rapid and extremely flexible, thus meeting market expectations."
"I can see six Commission representatives in the Chamber, and I would congratulate every one of them."
"This piece of legislation has taken less time to adopt than nearly any other in the history of the EU."
"I should like to congratulate Commissioner Verheugen, as he not only talks about better regulation, but also puts his money where his mouth is. This is what really matters: ‘just do it’, to quote one company’s constant refrain."
"I should also like to offer my warm congratulations to Mrs Thomsen."
"Although she is a new Member of this House, she has helped us to set a record, as it can by no means be taken for granted that legislation will be adopted in such a short space of time."
"We are all aware that negotiations on the European company went on for over 30 years, and that we have still not achieved our ultimate goal."
"What it comes down to is that we wish to shape the Lisbon process, and in order to do so we need this programme."
"What Lisbon means, of course, is employment and growth, and we have already established that small and mediumsized enterprises have accounted for 75% of new jobs created in recent years."
"The question we must ask ourselves is what growth really means."
"The hope of every employee, every pensioner and every child is to see a small improvement, in net terms, in their personal finances at the end of each year."
"We must therefore fight to ensure that we all have a little bit more money in our accounts at the end of future years, as has been the case over the past 50 years."
"It is our duty to provide as many people as possible with this opportunity, and those who have jobs and are in employment obviously have more money in the bank than those who are unemployed."
"Even though a speedy and welcome decision has been taken on this programme, which has even allowed for an increase in funding, Parliament, the Council and the Commission should therefore make every effort to ensure that we do in fact achieve the Lisbon goals, in particular when debating the Financial Perspective."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow."
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the recommendation for second reading (A60115/2005) by Mr DieterLebrecht Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on motor vehicle seats and head restraints (11935/3/2004 – C60031/2005 – 2003/0128(COD));"
"the recommendation for second reading (A60120/2005) by Mr Paolo Costa, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on motor vehicle safety belts and restraint systems (11934/3/2004 – C60029/2005 – 2003/0130(COD));"
"the recommendation for second reading (A60117/2005) by Mr Paolo Costa, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on anchorages for motor vehicle safety belts (11933/3/2004 – C60030/2005 – 2003/0136(COD));"
"and the report (A6053/2005) by Mrs Ewa Hedkvist Petersen, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on frontal protection systems on motor vehicles (COM(2003)0586 – C50473/2003 – 2003/0226(COD))."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take this opportunity first of all to extend our sympathies to the relatives of the schoolchildren killed in the dreadful road accident in Kentstown in Ireland."
"This accident, in which five schoolchildren were killed and 46 injured, shows once again that we need to do all we can to mitigate the consequences of such accidents for passengers."
"The proposals being debated today seek to do precisely that."
"Three of the proposals concern the safety of passengers in commercial vehicles, in particular on buses."
"The fourth proposal concerns the safety of particularly vulnerable road users in the case of collisions with vehicles that are fitted with socalled bull bars."
"I should like to mention at this point that I have set up a highlevel group under the name of ‘CARS 21’, which, by the end of this year, will be making recommendations on the shape of future legislation in the automobile sector."
"This will include an overview of those measures that should be taken on vehicle safety in the course of the next ten years."
"As far as the three directives on the safety belt are concerned, I should like to thank Mr Costa and Mr Koch for their reports and for their efforts at getting these three proposals for directives adopted at the second reading."
"All three directives ultimately seek to make it compulsory for safety belts to be installed in all vehicles apart from passenger cars, where, as you know, this has already been the case for several years."
"This extension primarily concerns coaches."
"In the event of an accident, this provision should prevent passengers from being hurled out of the bus, which is precisely how the most serious injuries occur."
"This is only possible if safety belts are fitted and there is a requirement to wear them."
"The Commission stresses once again that it is all the more urgent for these three directives to be adopted, given that the installation of safety belts in new vehicles must of course be made mandatory before we can introduce a requirement to wear them."
"The only difference of opinion between the Council and the Committee on Transport and Tourism concerns seat arrangements."
"If we wish to make it mandatory for seat belts to be installed in all seats, then we find ourselves obliged to ban sidefacing seats in coaches, because the types of belts currently available for such seats do not offer passengers optimal protection."
"However, if we were to ban them straight away, the market segment of socalled conference buses would be condemned to extinction."
"The proposed transitional period of five years will undoubtedly enable the industry to develop technical solutions that are better adapted to the various different accident scenarios."
"The Commission welcomes the fact that the two rapporteurs, Mr Costa and Mr Koch, have managed to reach a compromise with the other bodies."
"The Commission can accept the amendments that have been proposed in their current form."
"This will, I hope, make it possible for the package to be adopted at the second reading."
"On the question of frontal protection systems on motor vehicles – the socalled bull bars – I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Petersen, and the draftsman of the opinion of the second committee to which the proposal was referred, Mr Harbour, for their efforts to carry out a thorough and coordinated examination of this proposal."
"I should particularly like to thank the rapporteur for successfully building a broad consensus in favour of this proposal at an early stage within the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"Some years ago, the Commission sent Parliament a communication on pedestrian protection."
"It contained the voluntary commitment of European, Japanese and Korean car manufacturers, on the one hand to carry out a series of checks on new cars to make them more pedestrianfriendly, and on the other to stop fitting them with rigid frontal protection systems."
"In its resolution on this voluntary agreement, Parliament called for legislation to be introduced to regulate the use of these frontal protection systems."
"The Commission’s proposal of October 2003 complied with Parliament’s demand, and I am delighted to note that the report of the Committee on Transport and Tourism comes to the same conclusion."
"The Commission can accept all of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"I am therefore confident that this proposal can also be adopted, and at the first reading."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I am standing in today for our colleague, Dr Koch, who, as chairman of the European Movement in Thuringia, is chairing an international symposium on the Constitutional Treaty there, which is of course also an important matter."
"The first part of my contribution to this debate will be concerned with three closely connected proposals for directives, for which Dr Koch and Mr Costa are the rapporteurs."
"At issue, as the Commissioner has already explained, are seats, safety belts and head restraints, with their respective anchorages in vehicles."
"In the second part, I should like to address the issue of frontal protection systems, or bull bars, on passenger cars, again on behalf of Dr Koch, but this time in his capacity as shadow rapporteur."
"This is important for protecting pedestrians, and in particular children, cyclists and wheelchair users."
"On the first part: tomorrow, when we adopt the Koch report, we will take a major step towards improving road safety."
"In so doing we will also help to reduce bureaucracy and secure jobs."
"We know that a properly fitted safety belt can reduce the severity of injuries and save lives, which is why it is right to require all seats in vehicles to be equipped with safety belts."
"It will therefore become mandatory for seat belts to be fitted, not only in passenger cars, as has been the case up until now, but also in other categories of vehicles, in particular minibuses and certain other buses, as well as light and heavy goods vehicles."
"The ban on the use of sidefacing seats in passenger cars, goods vehicles and certain categories of buses is also to be welcomed."
"However, we should allow an exemption for such seats in large conference buses of category M3, and I am pleased that the Commission agrees."
"Nevertheless, these seats should only be permitted if they are fitted with suitable safety belts and are grouped together at the back of the vehicle, preferably in a Ushape, around a table."
"This arrangement should apply for at least five years."
"On the basis of the actual accident data available at that time and taking into account developments in safetybelt systems, this arrangement will then have to be extended, preferably as part of a Community type approval for all categories of vehicle."
"I am pleased that the Council and the Commission have revised their original opinion and now also see this as a workable basis for future type approvals."
"After all, neither the available accident statistics nor studies or tests suggest that passengers travelling in sidefacing seats in large conference buses are at increased risk."
"This is due in part to different vehicles being susceptible to different types of accidents, which affect them in different ways."
"In the case of passenger cars and minibuses, a frontal impact is typical."
"This means that significant forwards forces are exerted on the passengers, but also of course on the seats and restraint systems."
"Large buses are quite different: in the event of an accident they tend to overturn."
"The belts’ function in this case is not to absorb horizontal forces; instead they serve primarily to keep passengers in their seats and prevent them from being hurled out of the vehicle."
"These requirements can be met just as effectively – if not better – by belts fitted to sidefacing seats as those fitted to forwardsor backwardsfacing ones."
"The compromise that has been reached, with which the Commission and the Council have indicated that they can agree, will help to bring down bureaucratic barriers in the Member States."
"This is because national exemptions can already be granted today for buses produced in small series, with the bureaucratic effort that this entails."
"But this stands in contradiction to the internal market strategy and even allows sidefacing seats without belts to be authorised."
"In making this decision, we are therefore in any case contributing to improving safety, not only on the roads, but also in the internal market."
"In addition, we are determining the future viability of a typically European product in the tourism sector, the VIP or conference bus."
"This means that jobs in manufacturing and bus companies will be secured and passengers will continue to enjoy high, or even higher, standards of comfort."
"An agreement with the Council and the Commission makes it likely that the directive will be adopted quickly, even this year, and at the same time the Koch report of course also paves the way for the two Costa reports to be adopted."
"In this context, I should like to thank Mr Costa and the other shadow rapporteurs, as well as Mrs Hedkvist Petersen for her skilful negotiating as rapporteur on the frontal protection systems on passenger cars, which really do pose a huge danger in accidents involving unprotected road users, principally in urban areas."
"We are now ensuring that rigid frontal protection systems are banned on new vehicles of up to 3.5 tonnes. In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the Member States may also subject existing vehicles to these rules and authorise flexible frontal protection systems, but only if they have passed a harmonised test procedure."
"I think that this will improve pedestrian protection and benefit all of those who, particularly in cities, really are the weakest on our roads."
". Madam President, Commissioner, I wish to thank all those fellow MEPs of mine who have been involved in these matters and, in particular, the matter for which I myself am responsible, namely bull bars."
"These two reports are important because they are about ensuring that vehicles in Europe are improved."
"This is an area in which we can genuinely do something at European level because vehicles are sold throughout Europe and not only within individual countries."
"European measures are therefore required."
"Bull bars, which are my area of responsibility, are dangerous at present, especially in urban areas if a child, pedestrian or cyclist is collided with."
"That is why this matter has come to the fore."
"Why do we need legislation?"
"There is an agreement between Japanese, European and Korean car manufacturers not to fit rigid bull bars."
"That agreement is not enough, however."
"Firstly, it does not apply to bull bars in the aftermarket, that is to say those that are fitted subsequently to cars."
"Nor does it define what is meant by rigid bull bars."
"We must therefore have tests."
"The procedure involving a directive creates legal certainty, then, both for the motor trade and for manufacturers of accessories."
"Everyone will know what applies when we obtain this directive. Why, then, should we not completely ban bull bars?"
"Discussions along those lines are of course being conducted in a number of countries."
"Bull bars can be valuable in wild landscapes."
"We no longer have very much in the way of wilderness, but bull bars can be of value in such landscapes, and it is of course for just such conditions that they are intended. They are of no value in cities, however."
"We do not wish to ban them completely because they can, in actual fact, make the fronts of cars softer and therefore safer."
"What is more, I am convinced that we should not have the support of the European public if we were completely to ban all bull bars at European level."
"Britain’s Transport Research Laboratory(TRL) has published a report that in actual fact shows that what are known as smart barsdo exist, that is to say bull bars or frontal protection systems that are flexible and that also protect pedestrians in collisions with cars equipped with this type of frontal protection system."
"In the committee, we looked, of course, at the Commission’s proposal, debated it and, in time, had an informal tripartite discussion with a view to reaching agreement."
"We have of course heard the Commissioner comment on the matter and say that he is satisfied with the informal tripartite discussion."
"During the discussions, we said something that was controversial but on which we eventually agreed and compromised, namely that, in our view, the four tests proposed by the Commission to begin with were too farreaching."
"Our view was based on our knowledge that rapid technological development was taking place whereby we may perhaps, in the future, devise new forms of bull bar and frontal protection systems, as well as new tests."
"That is why the tests we initially propose will be rather less stringent than those originally proposed by the Commission."
"In this area, we are now in complete agreement with the Commission, however."
"After a number of years, the Commission will, moreover, review the technical regulations and other tests that might be used."
"The directive applies to the new bull bars of the future, both those already in place on cars and those that are fitted subsequently."
"They are to be approved as part of a typeapproval procedure."
"Broadly speaking, this means a type approval as from a certain date for those frontal protection systems that comply with the new requirements and which, alone, it will be permitted to market."
"Bull bars put on the market before the date concerned come under the responsibility of the Member States."
"Specifically on this issue of the old bull bars on the market, we have together proposed a new article of legislation whereby the Member States would be allowed to decide what they wanted to do with these."
"This is something on which we now have an agreement, a fact I am extremely pleased about."
"This is an important road safety measure, and I would thank everyone for their work and for the agreement we have reached."
"Finally, another subject that I think is very important and that was dealt with in the Koch and Costa reports: that of seat belts in buses and in vehicles other than cars."
"I agree with what the Commissioner and Mrs Sommer said."
"I wish to emphasise that it is important for everyone that we obtain, and use, seat belts in buses."
"Seat belts in buses are of benefit to me if I make use of mine; but they are also of benefit to me if my neighbours use theirs."
"Anyone who, in a bus accident, does not have their seat belt fastened, with the result that they are thrown around the bus, will also injure their fellow passengers."
"That is something we do not often think about, which is why it is important for us now to obtain this directive whereby seat belts must be fitted in buses and lorries too."
"We must have them in all vehicles, and they must be used."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I apologise as I was misinformed about the times, but I believe that I will be able to catch up very quickly."
"There are few of us in the House this evening and we are debating issues that are of an apparently minor nature, but I am convinced that Europe is built on details, and these are important details."
"The two reports on which I have worked, and which are linked to Mr Koch’s report, fundamentally address small aspects: the issue of safety belts, in the case of Mr Koch’s report, and, in my case, the technical implications of anchorages and head restraint systems for bus passengers."
"It would seem to be a very simple matter, and in essence it is, because we have finally decided to follow the Commission’s proposal, which consists of no longer allowing the installation of sidefacing seats in buses since their safety belts cannot be fixed with the same standards of certainty and safety as those of frontfacing bus seats."
"We came across a small problem, however, which relates to innovation."
"In some countries, particularly in Germany, the concept of conference buses is actually gaining ground."
"In other words, people can sit around a table even inside a bus."
"That posed the twin problem of safety, which must nevertheless be guaranteed, and of possibly allowing an alternative service."
"The solution reached was to allow a trial, permitting the use of these conference buses for five years."
"At the end of this period, we will carry out an assessment of the percentage of accidents – which we hope will be as low as possible – as already assessed by the Commission, but in relation to a Swiss experiment, in order to roll it out throughout the EU."
"Such a process will enable us, in a few years from now, to decide whether – and how – we must scrap sidefacing seats in instances where speeds are greater than those normally reached in town centres, or whether, in contrast, this new service can continue."
"Although it was more difficult than we had imagined, I believe that the compromise reached with the Council on the Commission’s proposal is a good solution, and that tomorrow it can allow us to vote on the reports presented positively and with peace of mind."
"I hope that my fellow Members do so."
". Madam President, it gives me special pleasure to be here as draftsman of the opinion on the Directive on Frontal Protection Systems, which Mrs Hedkvist Petersen has taken through Parliament so ably."
"Reflecting on the recommendations made by my Committee, I realise that almost all of these were taken up, which is an unusual situation."
"We worked together on this proposal for over a year, beginning in the last Parliament."
"One of the things that triggered my interest was that the original proposal presented by your predecessor, Mr Liikanen, was significantly flawed."
"I want to pay tribute to your team for having fundamentally reshaped it."
"The flaw lay in the approach to the soft bull bar."
"I would like to present you with a little souvenir, Commissioner, in the form of a sample which I took to committee meetings to convince colleagues the proposal needed to be fundamentally revised."
"The original proposal would have seen such bull bars taken off the market."
"The testing standards were unrealistic and there were no separate provisions, as Mrs Hedkvist Petersen pointed out, for a separate test enabling these bars to be made available on the aftermarket."
"As you can see, Commissioner, this is a customdesigned soft bull bar far more resilient than the old type of bull bar."
"It is thanks to you that these new bars can be kept on the market."
"I also want to pay tribute to a small company in my constituency called Concept Mouldings, which employs 100 people making these bars and which you have kept in business."
"I wish to thank you on their behalf."
"I also want to thank you on behalf of other accessory manufacturers and on behalf of road users, who will now be able to benefit from these bars – though not too often, we hope, as we want to eliminate pedestrian collisions."
"It is thanks to you that this type of resilient device will now be available on the market."
"This overall proposal is an excellent example of how Parliament can make a real contribution to practical legislative improvements when it works together with a Commission that is open and sympathetic."
"The bulk of the work was done by Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, with me simply acting as a catalyst, and I pay tribute to her persistence in working with your services, Commissioner, to secure a first reading agreement that I am delighted to support."
". – Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take this opportunity to underpin what has been said with a few figures."
"I have discovered that in Austria, the number of offroad vehicles has increased from 117 000 to 170 000 since the year 2000."
"In 2004, every 14th new car purchased in Europe was an offroad vehicle."
"On top of that, these allwheeldrive vehicles are actually hardly ever used offroad any more, but rather, for various reasons, mainly on the streets of our cities."
"It was therefore high time for the European legislator to respond to this trend, because accidents involving offroad vehicles put other road users at far greater risk than accidents involving other, smaller vehicles."
"Accidents involving these kinds of vehicles prove fatal in more than twice as many cases as accidents involving standard motor vehicles."
"We should also bear in mind that one in 22 accidents involving standard passenger cars proves fatal, whereas for offroad vehicles fitted with this kind of frontal protection system, it is one in every eight accidents."
"The solution that has now been found is a very good one."
"I should like to congratulate the rapporteur very warmly and reiterate my strong support for higher safety standards being adopted across Europe in this sector."
"I should also like to suggest that, as we take this issue forward, we might perhaps reconsider whether in the long term it makes sense for such frontal protection systems to continue to be used at all, particularly in urban areas."
"However, I also understand the arguments put forward by another Member, which at the moment undoubtedly still speak in their favour."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the report (A60124/2005) by Mrs Karin Scheele, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the addition of vitamins and minerals and of certain other substances to foods (COM(2003)0671 – C50538/2003 – 2003/0262(COD))."
". I would like to thank those present for being here on what is perhaps the first night of summer, but I must admit that I am one of the victims of this summer night because of my hay fever, so I would like to ask for your patience."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to take advantage of the opportunity which I have to speak to Parliament in Greek, because this is an opportunity which, unfortunately, I do not have in the Commission, and to comment briefly, of course, on today's subject."
"When I appeared before you during my hearing, I assured you that I would promote health issues and, above all, consumer safety."
"The subject of debate now, and the next subject, are achieving precisely this objective: they combine the promotion of health and, of course, consumer protection."
"This is a proposal which makes a very significant contribution to health, but also takes account of the needs of industry for a clear, clarified, common European regulatory framework, which still allows for innovation and competitiveness and strengthens the internal market, while at the same time providing consumer protection."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Scheele, and the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Mr Stubb."
"Of course, in an ideal world, consumers would get all the necessary nourishment from a healthy, standard diet."
"They would get all their nutrients through their normal diet."
"Unfortunately, however, this is no longer the case."
"Under today's conditions, with today's way of life, consumers need an additional boost to their diet, which is why it is useful to add both vitamins and inorganic salts – what we call minerals – to food."
"Consumers themselves want this, because the addition of these ingredients to food helps consumers to get satisfactory levels of these nutrients and to reduce the risks inherent in their deficiency as a result of insufficient consumption."
"This particular proposal fully harmonises rules for the voluntary addition of nutrients, but does not affect provisions at national level – usually for public health reasons – or at Community level on the compulsory addition of nutrients."
"The usual nutrients added are vitamins and minerals, which is why it is useful that the proposal specifically regulates these ingredients."
"However, use has increased over recent years not just of vitamins and minerals, but also of substances and ingredients which are used in an innovative way."
"That is why it is right that the proposal covers the safe use of these substances and, where considered necessary, brings them under the regulatory regime."
". – Madam President, the intention of the proposed regulation is to harmonise the different national provisions on the addition of vitamins and minerals and of certain other substances to foods."
"Discussions have shown, and will do so again today, that this is a very, very difficult task, firstly because we have different opinions on the extent to which the addition of such nutrients is necessary for a balanced diet, and secondly because traditions in the Member States of the European Union vary considerably."
"In one Member State, for example, unlimited additions are permitted, provided that the end product does not present a health risk."
"In another Member State, additions are permitted only if it can be proved that they are necessary for a balanced and adequate diet."
"In between there are various different nuances, such as the Member States that permit the addition of those vitamins and minerals that are listed in a particular register."
"A variety of upper limits are also stipulated."
"I should also like to underline that this regulation only regulates the voluntary addition of vitamins and minerals, and that national provisions on the mandatory addition of nutrients to foods are therefore not affected."
"According to Article 3 of this regulation, there are three reasons why vitamins and minerals may be added to foods: firstly, to restore nutrient levels in the end product, as the various stages in the storage and manufacturing process cause nutrients to be lost; secondly, when producing substitute foods, the most wellknown example here being undoubtedly margarine, which was originally manufactured as a substitute for butter, and thirdly, the addition of vitamins and minerals to fortify the food, regardless of whether the nutrient was present in it originally or not."
"The basic premise on which my report is based is that the Community should work towards a situation in which manufacturers add vitamins and minerals to food for nutritional and health reasons."
"I am therefore delighted that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted my amendments stating that all vitamins and minerals that are added to food must also be able to be absorbed by the body."
"Otherwise consumers are being misled and in extreme cases there may even be adverse effects on health, such as diarrhoea or reduced absorption of other nutrients."
"The two issues in this report that gave raise to the most heated discussion were without a doubt the nutrient profiles and the question of whether the socalled other substances should be regulated by means of a positive or a negative list."
"I think that the proper place for nutrient profiles is in the Poli Bortone report on health claims, and I hope that the amendments about nutrient profiles that have been tabled to that proposal – as you now the report will be debated next – also receive majority support."
"However, I believe that it would be wrong to establish nutrient profiles in my report."
"It is not a question of being consistent or saying that we need nutrient profiles in both reports or in neither of them."
"If we establish the nutrient profiles here, then we will not only be banning the health claims, but also the product itself."
"This seems to me to be wrong, although I am aware that some of my colleagues in my group will be supporting these amendments."
"On the issue of the certain other substances, I propose a definition of the other substances, as the vitamins and minerals allowed for fortification are listed and thus defined in Annexes I and II."
"Article 9a is an important contribution, enabling adequate information to be gained about the certain other substances that are being added."
"Within 18 months of the regulation’s entry into force, the Member States will have to notify the Commission of the other substances used in their territory to enrich foodstuffs."
"Annex III regulates the use of the other substances."
"The Commission is proposing a negative list, which I, as rapporteur, support."
"This means that at the request of the Commission or a Member State, the other substances are subject to a risk assessment by the EFSA and are then placed in one of the following categories: prohibited substances and substances whose use is restricted."
". Madam President, as a fan of Liverpool football club I must say that I was happy to come over here after the first half, because AC Milan is currently 30 ahead in the Champions’ League final."
"Commissioner, I would like to raise three points for you."
"First, I welcome the Commission’s proposal."
"It strikes a good balance on two accounts: it pushes forward the internal market by making it easier for food manufacturers to trade across borders; and it enhances consumer protection and gives us more safety and confidence."
"My second point is perhaps a slight criticism of the Commission relating to the part of the proposal where the Commission says it should apply to matters that are as yet undefined."
"In my mind that would amount to giving a blank cheque."
"My argument would be that if you know the substances, tell us. If you do not know, come back."
"Perhaps that is something you could rectify at second reading, Commissioner."
"Finally, it is important to harmonise those vitamins and minerals that can and cannot be added and the quantities involved."
"At the same time, it is important that Member States be able to impose some restrictions, as long as they are based on scientific evidence that there is a real risk to public health."
"I think the proposal is sound, especially in the light of the European Parliament’s amendments."
"."
"Madam President, first of all I would like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Scheele, for the quality of this report on a very meaningful subject for the citizens of Europe."
"The addition of vitamins and minerals to a very wide variety of foods is a response to a reality – this needs to be stated – much more than simply to a fashion, the reality of a general change in our eating habits."
"For example, ironenriched breakfast cereals have in many cases replaced meat as the principal source of iron in children’s food, and that is just one example among many."
"That is why we must, in my view, show flexibility on this subject."
"Let us, therefore, say ‘yes’ to better labelling, but ‘no’ to protectionism and to certain derogations as proposed in Amendment 39."
"‘No’, finally, to drawing up a positive list for the whole range of new substances."
"I would like to finish, but I could have started with this, by asking Commissioner Kyprianou a question: when do you expect to implement the better regulation advocated by several members of the Commission, including you and Commissioner Verheugen?"
"Let me explain."
"Slicing legislation up like salami – fortifications, health and nutrition claims, food supplements, directives on labelling and more besides – brings nothing but restrictions to us as legislators."
"Technical aspects are increasingly taking over from policy ones."
"Therefore, particularly in the interests of SMEs and consumers who, if they are going to believe in Europe, need clear, transparent and effective legislation, I hope that the Commission will very soon adopt this overall, consistent approach that we need in the field of food sector legislation."
"I welcome the report by Mrs Scheele concerning the addition of vitamins, minerals, and certain other substances to foods."
"Differences among countries in legislative provisions governing this issue create barriers to the free movement of goods."
"Moreover, regulation at the European level would ensure that the same standards be applied in all Member States."
"The addition of vitamins, minerals, and additives to foodstuffs is often abused."
"Food producers use them to increase the attractiveness of their products by claiming that they contain more vitamins than other products, which is often not true."
"This creates the danger that consumers may increase their consumption of certain foods in the false belief that they are healthier and safer than other foods."
"We are often exposed to misleading advertisements claiming that the addition of a vitamin or another substance to a food product protects consumers from cancer or other diseases of ‘civilisation’."
"Foodstuffs that have a high content of calories, fats, or sugar do not, however, become healthier solely because they contain added vitamins or other substances."
"To ensure legal certainty and transparency, a positive list of substances whose addition to foods is permitted should be drawn up in order to avoid the enrichment of foods with substances that may be dangerous."
"At the same time, recommended minimum and maximum daily doses should be specified for certain substances."
"I therefore support the introduction of nutrition profiles."
"I believe it is the best way to secure the uniform control of food safety for different groups of consumers, be they children, pregnant women, or the elderly."
"– Madam President, I should first like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and her constructive cooperation."
"I also believe that this report constitutes a further step towards creating a European single market, precisely in the food sector, and that it also brings us a step closer to providing comprehensive consumer protection."
"I should now like to focus on the other substances because, given their different nature and function, they cannot be treated in the same way as vitamins and minerals."
"That is why I believe it is wrong to wish also to apply all of the provisions for minerals and vitamins to these other substances at all costs."
"We need to consider which of the provisions that are foreseen for vitamins and minerals would also make sense for these other substances."
"However, this regulation should not take on the mammoth task of harmonising the thousand other substances that are currently used in the European food industry."
"In taking on such a project, we would, for years, be tying up the European institutions and above all the European Food Safety Authority with the complex task of drawing up detailed risk assessments for substances, which for the most part have never given cause for health concerns, and this would hamper them in the other work they do."
"I believe, therefore, that our priorities should lie elsewhere."
"That is why I support the approach chosen by the Commission, which simply wants to create a legal instrument for other substances that can serve, if required, to regulate certain other substances across the Community, if they are classified as possibly raising health concerns by the European Food Safety Authority, and thus to guarantee a uniform level of protection for all European consumers."
"For everything else we can confidently live with the present system, which leaves authorisation of other substances to the Member States."
"From this point of view, the ‘positive list’ proposed by some Members does not make much sense either."
"Such a list would go way beyond our objectives and in practice would simply not be feasible."
"In the short term, we should therefore consider which of the thousand other substances should be included in such a list from the outset."
"I wish to inform the House that the rise in the use of harmful chemicals in agriculture and food processing has been the subject of growing criticism in Poland, as well as in many of the other new Member States."
"CAP mechanisms have necessitated their use and familyrun farms, which could have moved over to certified organic food production, have been the ones to suffer from this common agricultural policy."
"Numerous studies have shown that, in comparison to food produced by industrial agriculture, organic food has higher levels of easilyabsorbed vitamins, minerals and other healthpromoting substances."
"Our aim should therefore be to reduce the demand for artificial additives, which has been created by advertising and pseudoscientific lobbying, at the same time as ensuring that consumers have access to a wide range of genuinely safe and highquality organic food."
"I believe that it would be appropriate at this point to highlight the achievements and work of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and of this House as a whole."
"A balance has been achieved in the new regulation between healthrelated arguments and business arguments."
"At the same time, the fraudulent practices of the food industry, which conquers markets in order to sell products that are harmful to health, will be curbed."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must begin by saying that the proposal the Commission has presented to us is a good and balanced proposal and that the rapporteur has done good work; I therefore congratulate her."
"Research has shown that the consumption of fortified foodstuffs within a varied diet can contribute significantly to the ingestion of nutrients."
"The important thing is that fortification be based on scientific criteria and that the agrifood industries operating in the European Union be subject to common rules, and that is precisely the objective of this proposal: the harmonisation of the differing national provisions on fortifications, within the limits required in order to guarantee food safety, of course."
"We in the PPE-DE, therefore, cannot agree with the inclusion of provisions allowing for the existence of stricter rules in the States, unless they can be justified on the grounds of a proven risk to public health."
"Neither do we in my group agree with the introduction of nutrient profiles, and, in fact, the Commission has not introduced them into the proposal."
"They are neither necessary nor appropriate in this proposal."
"We enjoy a very varied food supply in the European Union and we cannot imagine that we can put an end to obesity and persuade the Europeans to eat properly by means of standards and labelling."
"The solution is much more complex."
"Foodstuffs must be healthy, of course, and the consumer must be provided with reliable information, but the really important thing is the diet that each person chooses and the lifestyle they live."
"Consumer education, therefore, is more effective than rules, so that consumers can exercise their freedom of choice on the basis of reliable criteria."
"With regard to the other substances in Annex 3, I must say that their potential restriction must be based solely on safety criteria and we do not, therefore, support the amendments aimed at introducing positive lists to regulate these substances."
"Finally, I believe that manufacturers, particularly small and mediumsized businesses, must be given sufficient time to adapt to the new provisions laid down in the Regulation."
". Madam President, first I should like to say that, in order to keep the procedure brief and save time, I have put at Parliament's disposal a full list with the Commission's position on all the proposed amendments, with the request that it be included in the Minutes of this partsession(1)."
"The proposal which exists today basically covers three issues."
"Firstly, it regulates the composition of foods by creating a list of acceptable vitamins and minerals with upper and lower limits, in order to ensure, of course, that products are safe."
"There are provisions relating to labelling, advertising and the presentation of fortified foods which provide a basis for analysis and, where judged necessary, for regulating the addition of certain other substances."
"As far as food supplements are concerned, I would reiterate that they are foods; other relevant legislation only regulates their vitamin and mineral content, but not other substances which they may contain."
"That is why they should not be completely excluded from this proposal."
"As far as the question of vitamins and minerals is concerned, the proposal is aiming for their full harmonisation and I think that this covers the question of better regulation, because better regulation does not mean no regulation."
"This is something which is dealt with precisely by having Community legislation."
"I agree on this point with Mrs Belohorská, who said that uniform Community legislation helps both industry and consumers in the most effective way possible and we do not have 25 different, fragmented sets of rules at various levels."
"As far as other substances are concerned, there is limited harmonisation here in order precisely to take account of the peculiarities of these elements."
"However, Annex III to the proposal provides the possibility, if and where needed, for a rapid response if, of course, it is considered that the consumption of these substances in such quantities might be a health risk."
"That is why I could accept amendments which clarify the question of other substances, but not excessive additions to the number of substances examined and I believe that this approach, as set out in the proposal for Annex III, which will include substances which are considered to be a risk to human health, is the best approach, instead of having a positive list, and I am delighted that the majority tends in this direction."
"Finally, I wish to say that, for me, the recommendation on better information for industry and, of course, for consumers through increased notifications to the Commission, which will also be published, is a good thing."
"However, we need to find the most correct and effective way of achieving this without creating an excessive administrative burden."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Overall the Commission can accept 25 amendments, either completely, subject to redrafting, in part or in principle."
"The Commission rejects 29 out of a total of 55 (one amendment is linguistic and does not affect the EN version)."
"Two amendments are acceptable: Amendments 11 and 44."
"Two amendments are acceptable partially: Amendments 2 and 40."
"Four amendments are acceptable partially and subject to redrafting: Amendments 33, 38, 42 and 55."
"Six amendments are acceptable in principle: Amendments 13, 22, 28, 31, 34 and 35."
"11 amendments are acceptable in principle and subject to redrafting: Amendments 4, 12, 16, 17, 18, 39, 41, 45, 46, 49 and 54."
"29 amendments cannot be accepted: Amendments 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 14, 15, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30, 32, 36, 37, 43, 47, 48, 50, 51, 52 and 53."
"– The next item is the report (A60128/2005) by Mrs Poli Bortone, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on nutrition and health claims made on foods (COM(2003)0424 – C50329/2003 – 2003/0165(COD))."
". Madam President, we all agree that we want an informed consumer in the European Union; that we want the consumer to be able to decide for himself or herself and not to have a nanny state."
"It is something we all tend to agree on."
"However, in order for the consumer to achieve that, we need to provide the consumer with accurate, exact, correct, scientifically justified information."
"That is very important."
"We must not forget that in Europe the consumer assumes and expects that any label that reaches him or her has been checked and approved by an authority."
"Therefore, there is a responsibility here to do so."
"I would also like to remind you of something I mentioned earlier, that any vacuum that may be left in Community legislation will be filled in by the Member States and therefore will defeat the purpose of having this harmonised legislation and will mean a return to a fragmented set of rules and regulations that harm the industry, consumer confidence, cause problems for the internal market and of course do not achieve the level of protection that we would all like to have."
"That is why we presented this proposal."
"I would like to thank the committee for all the work it has done on such an important issue, the rapporteur, Mrs Poli Bortone and of course the shadow rapporteurs."
"I would also like to thank Mrs Niebler and Mr Stubb, the draftsmen of the opinions of the two other committees, and the committees themselves, for the work they have done."
"The proposal says something very simple."
"It says that no one can make a voluntary claim without having the scientific justification for doing so."
"We must not forget that these are voluntary claims with the sole aim of profit, it is a marketing tool."
"Therefore, in order to allow the use of this marketing tool for profit, we must make sure that it has the correct scientific justification and that it is substantiated scientifically."
"Consumers, as I said earlier, have to be able to make their own decisions, but they must not be misled."
"They must not be convinced by products sold on unsubstantiated claims."
"The adoption of the proposal meets the purposes I would like it to."
"It protects the consumer; it advances health considerations; it helps the industry, competition and the internal market and it allows innovation."
"Having a common set of rules in a unique legal environment also helps in the internal market and competitiveness."
"Some claims that may have adverse effects will need to remain prohibited."
"It is also very important to maintain the link between claims and nutritional profiles."
"Once again I have to remind you that these are voluntary claims and if they are going to be made, they have to based on a nutritional balance."
"If the nutritional balance is questionable then the use as a marketing tool of a specific characteristic of a foodstuff must not be allowed as it will eventually mislead the consumer."
"The nutritional profile is a key element of the proposal and therefore it should remain."
". Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s proposal on nutrition and health claims has arisen from the possibility of building on the consumer’s growing interest in receiving clear information on the nutritional and health value of foods, and from the need for the food industry to respond to this urgent request with clear, accurate and significant information, which is substantiated scientifically."
"All of this should take place within a framework of harmonised market regulations, in order to enable food business operators to be competitive according to fair and equitable regulatory criteria."
"Healthy food and good health go hand in hand as benchmarks for the behaviour of consumers, who have a much greater awareness of their diet these days and who are increasingly concerned to know what they are eating and to understand how food products impact on their health."
"This is the behaviour of the average consumer, and the food industry has attempted to respond to this behaviour by means of more detailed nutritional labelling, providing claims on the positive benefits, or alleged benefits, of some foods."
"It is a fact that the two basic EU directives in force – Directives 2000/13 and 90/496, relating to the labelling and nutrition labelling of foodstuffs respectively – are not only inadequately enforced in the majority of cases, but they also respond poorly to the presentday demands of consumers, since they do not allow any data to be given on the alleged health benefits, and they do not clearly define the conditions of use of the nutrition claims."
"The absence of specific provisions at European level has given rise, moreover, to a real proliferation of claims on the labels of food products – claims varying in number and type."
"The Member States have adopted independent provisions and standards to regulate the use of the various claims."
"This results in a regulatory mess, with different approaches to the same subjectmatter, which has given rise to a state of confusion that leads to neither the effective running of the internal market, nor the safeguarding of public health and consumer health."
"Faced with such legal uncertainty, there is a need to harmonise the regulations relating to foodstuffs at Community level and, therefore, a need for a regulation which, without banning any foods, will clearly set out the fundamental conditions to ensure that the claims on foodstuffs are completely accurate for consumers."
"That is one further step forwards in implementing the nutrition policy included in the objectives proposed by the Commission in 1999 with the White Paper on food safety."
"In this White Paper it is expressly stated that the Union’s food policy should be built around strict food safety standards that protect and promote the health of the consumer."
"To these objectives must be added that of increasing the free movement of food products, in that the creation of a regulation will enable food business operators to be competitive on a fair and equal footing throughout the Member States."
"With the document that we are studying, the Commission has proposed the introduction of a new regulatory framework for nutrition and health claims, authorising the use of nutrition claims provided that they comply with the provisions set out in the annex,which contains a list of nutrition claims and specific conditions for the use thereof:the use of health claims will be subject to an authorisation or notification procedure (if the Commission’s text were to remain unchanged)."
"Through the procedures laid down by Article 93(2), the Commission proposes to draw up specific nutrient profiles for foods or categories of foods within a period of 18 months, which could rise to as much as 30 months, and, subject to consultation of the Food Safety Agency, specific nutrient profiles for foods or categories of foods, and the adoption of a Community list of health claims which describe the generally accepted role of a nutrient or other substances on the basis of proposals submitted by the Member States."
"In setting the nutrient profiles, the Commission will consult both food business operators and consumer groups, in addition to the Agency, which will see its role strengthened as a result of its involvement in the various stages and procedures."
"It must be acknowledged, at this stage, that the two years that have passed since the presentation have not been in vain, since all the interested parties – the Commission itself, the Council, Parliament, industry, consumers and the Economic and Social Committee – have recorded significant progress."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has made many amendments to the Commission’s text, however, in particular by removing Article 4, which, in my opinion, is an extremely important article because it sets out the nutrient profiles."
"The coherence and complexity of the regulation would, moreover, be of truly little significance if this article were not reintroduced."
"It is an article that I hope my fellow Members will wish to reintroduce."
". – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I should like to thank the rapporteur and all of the shadow rapporteurs."
"What is this regulation about?"
"It is about regulating food advertising."
"The Commission’s view is that everything should be regulated: nutrition claims (such as fat content, high energy, low energy); health claims (such as ‘a food strengthens the body’s defences’, ‘a food helps concentration’, and so on) and pure ‘feelgood’ claims (such as ‘a food keeps you fit, gives you a boost, gives you energy’, and so on)."
"‘Feelgood’ claims are to be banned completely and health claims will in future have to be authorised by the European Food Safety Authority."
"How this proposal for a regulation is supposed to be compatible with the Lisbon strategy, heaven knows."
"Neither is there any justification for these provisions, with the exception of those harmonising nutrition claims."
"In all of the discussions in the various different committees we have heard people say time and again that we in Europe have to do something to combat widespread child obesity."
"That is of course true, but we will not achieve this by banning advertising claims!"
"If people want to take action against child obesity, they need to see to it that eating habits are changed, that our children do more sport and that they spend less time in front of the television and the computer."
"Incidentally, why should mood and fitnessrelated claims be banned, when they express an individual feeling and are easily recognisable as advertising?"
"I believe that the approach that the Commission has adopted here is wrong."
"What we have here is the philosophy of ‘Everything is banned unless it is allowed’, and the Commissioner argued for it when he said that consumers expect every label to have first been checked by the authority."
"If you will forgive my saying so, this is not only about labels: it is about advertising claims."
"I do not think that this is a good approach, and I am grateful that the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has also given it as its opinion that Articles 4 and 11, in particular, should be deleted."
"I hope that we will also achieve this result at tomorrow’s vote: the modification of Article 11 and the deletion of Article 4."
". Madam President, for the Italian and the English booths: the match is now 33, with about ten minutes to go."
"I knew that the chairman of the Committee on the Internal Market would be happy about that, not probably as a Liverpudlian but otherwise."
"I have three points."
"First, I will tell the Commission right off the bat that I am a federalist, but what the Commission is proposing here is simply going too far."
"It is overregulation."
"I wish to focus especially on Article 4, which is one of the most illiberal proposals to pass through this House."
"It is not our job to tell the consumer what is good or what is bad."
"That is up to the consumer himself or herself to decide."
"I have quite a lot of faith in the individual to be able to make his or her own decisions on what food should or should not be eaten."
"The key is to know the content and then you can make your own choice."
"If we put in nutrient profiles, it might prevent the consumers from getting the right information."
"My second point is that I believe diets themselves are more important than the nutrient profiles of individual foods."
"Different people have different dietary needs, just as Mrs Niebler told us earlier."
"My third and final point is that it is very important to have clear labels and better information."
"However, I cannot support needless legislation or the assumption that people do not understand what is said on the label."
"Therefore, I would argue very strongly that we should remove Article 4 from the original Commission proposal and we adopt Article 11 along the lines that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has suggested."
". – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, we have now spent two years struggling with the Commission proposal on food advertising."
"In tabling it, the Commission is clearly going beyond its competences."
"It is not pursuing consumer protection, but is trying to nanny and gag consumers, for it sees the citizens of Europe as stupid, fat and gluttonous, and so nutrient profiles are to be used to divide foods into good and bad products, and this in accordance with a procedure that is scientifically untenable."
"Above all, this is to be done on the quite simply erroneous premise that advertising alone is to blame for Europeans’ expanding waistlines."
"Let me tell the Commission that this bears no relation to the real world!"
"I wonder more and more frequently which planet you come from."
"Advertising that is not expressly permitted is then to be banned in the future."
"Of course advertisements must not lie!"
"No one wants that."
"But we do not need advertising censorship."
"After all, we already have a law that protects consumers from misleading advertising."
"And of course advertising is the elixir of life for the food sector in this overcrowded food market."
"Innovation in this sector is only possible if one product can distinguish itself from another."
"Only in this way can it be successfully promoted and marketed."
"And innovation is ultimately also of benefit to consumers, who consequently have access to better and better products."
"Innovation is key to a company’s success and thus secures jobs."
"Do you have any idea how many jobs a law like this would destroy?"
"You are creating a bureaucratic monster: a laborious and lengthy authorisation procedure for every single advertising slogan from 25 Member States, obviously to be submitted translated word for word into all 20 official languages!"
"This would deal the last deathblow to our SMEs."
"But they would of course already be overstretched by the ongoing need to provide uptodate scientific proof."
"Why should people no longer be allowed to say, ‘Fruit is healthy’?"
"Because there may be a type of fruit that is too sweet for the Commission?"
"We are making ourselves a laughing stock."
"This is the kind of thing that fosters political apathy and euroscepticism."
"I urge you, Commissioner, to withdraw this proposal for good."
"I would have said this to you earlier, but you do not seem so keen to talk to us troublesome parliamentarians."
"Perhaps you should have come down from the glass tower of the Berlaymont building into the depths of our offices and attended a meeting of our committee."
"Then you would know that we will also be mobilising all of our resources tomorrow in the plenary to put a stop to this nonsense of the nutrient profiles in Article 4 and several other things besides."
". Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many consumers are worried about their health, cholesterol, blood pressure or have a weight problem."
"The food industry takes advantage of this."
"There is a proliferation of all kinds of claims."
"This morning, I had a sandwich that is good for my intestinal flora, the butter in which reduces my cholesterol level; I also had an egg that is high in Omega 3."
"This afternoon, I had a lowcalorie drink. I, at any rate, think this is terrific, for I have no knowledge of these things."
"That is why it is so important that this legislative proposal should require scientific proof for the claims made by the food manufacturers."
"We must prevent the consumer from being misled."
"Consumers are often prepared to pay more for a product that claims to benefit their health, but they should then be able to rely on that."
"Deception comes in many forms."
"In accordance with Article 4, health claims can only be made about products that meet a certain profile."
"That is right, for you cannot turn greasy croquet potatoes into a healthy food by adding a few vitamins."
"Yoghurt with 0% fat is not good for the figure if a good measure of sugar has been added."
"A lollipop that is high in sugar is not a healthy snack even if it also contains Vitamin A. That is why Article 4 is vital."
"I cannot identify with the argument by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that SMEs struggle with Article 4."
"Even a small food company must know what ingredients they use in bread or snacks."
"My group is behind the consumers and supports wellintentioned companies."
"I hope that a majority in this House will take this line and will not repeal Article 4."
"In all honesty, the request for a study made by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is equally beyond me."
"It is clear that it is not easy to draft those profiles, but it is equally clear that in the United States and in some companies, nutrient profiles have been used for a long time."
"I would therefore urge the Liberals not to ask for studies every turn around, but to take a decision and not to leave the consumers out in the cold."
"I would like to draw your attention to three other points."
"The first one is health claims in respect of children."
"We cannot see why health claims for children should be banned, as long as those claims are scientifically underpinned."
"It is, indeed, a good thing to carry out research into good food for children, but we do want to control advertising that is geared towards children, even if this is, strictly speaking, outside of this proposal’s remit."
"The second point concerns alcohol."
"I find it disappointing that some people, even within our group, are against the ban on claims for alcoholic drinks."
"If you consider all the problems involving alcoholism, damage to the liver and brain, you can hardly condone health claims for alcohol."
"In the case of alcohol, warnings are what are needed."
"We should not encourage the use of alcohol."
"A third and very important point is the question whether claims should be subjected to the licensing procedure or whether notification would suffice."
"In the case of a licence, manufacturers must be able to demonstrate convincingly that their claim is justified."
"In the case of notification, the onus of proof falls on the authorities, which means that a claim is permitted until such time as the authorities have managed to prove otherwise. That is what is at the heart of the legislative proposal and what our group is in any event against."
"I would urge everyone in this House to vote in favour of consumers and wellintentioned companies."
"We must not now bow to the pressure of companies that are frightened about being unmasked."
"The internal market is not a licence for misleading consumers."
"Let tomorrow’s outcome demonstrate to Europeans that Europe is there for them."
". Madam President, the Commissioner has presented us with a legacy that was passed on by his predecessor and it is to his credit that he is showing some enthusiasm in defending it."
"After all, it is the consumer who is central in this proposal, and that is important too."
"It is important that the consumer knows that claims about health, nutritional values or food cannot be untrue or misleading."
"That is what this proposal brings across and that is what the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe wholehearted supports."
"Conversely, it is of course the case that those claims that are scientifically proven – those that are true – are useful to consumers."
"I do not want to talk about those in terms of advertising, for that, being profitdriven, has a nasty ring to it, but that too is important for consumers."
"Consumers want to be able to make a choice, and that choice has to be offered to them."
"It must be possible, though, to provide scientific proof."
"This is something we should not just accept reluctantly, but, I think, should welcome as enhancing the consumers’ freedom of choice and promoting innovation, and that too is of importance."
"I am aware of there being a grey area around what should be done about those health claims about products that are, in fact, intrinsically unhealthy."
"As far as I am concerned, I would say that this falls within the scope of misconception, and Article 7 already provides for safeguards against this; we are not entirely convinced that we need European nutrient profiles for this."
"Nutrient profiles can be very useful."
"I know that Member States use them."
"They may work nationally, but whether they work at European level is something of which the Commission has not yet managed to convince us."
"At the moment, I am campaigning in favour of the Constitutional Treaty in the Netherlands."
"I do not know if Mrs Corbey is doing the same – obviously not – but if I were to tell people in my country not to worry, for Brussels would soon tell them what they can and cannot eat, then this Treaty would be voted down completely."
"That is really not the message we can send out on the basis of arguments we have heard so far."
"I therefore want more specific arguments."
"The majority of our group will not be voting for the deletion of Article 4, but we do think that the Commission should present better arguments, and our Amendment 107 contains a request to that effect."
"Finally, and – as I notice that my time is up – very briefly, since we are for reducing bureaucracy to a minimum, we have opted in favour of the notification procedure which we think offers sufficient guarantees for consumers and entails less mothering."
"On a final note, I agree that obesity must be discussed and tackled, but not in the context of this directive but much more in relation to the food labelling directive which we would have liked to have seen tabled by now."
"When you present it to us, Commissioner, then I think it will be much easier to talk about obesity as a problem."
". – Madam President, tomorrow’s vote will be a litmus test of how seriously Parliament is going to take consumer protection in the future."
"We all know that the number of people, especially children and young people, who are overweight or obese is increasing rapidly."
"Scientists are sounding the alarm, because costs are exploding and will soon go off the chart."
"In Germany alone, diabetes costs us EUR 20 billion a year."
"We also know that voluntary agreements do not help. That is why we need clear legislation."
"Article 4 is key to protecting consumers from misleading advertising. That is also why we must not dispense with Article 4, the nutrient profiles."
"We must not rip the heart out of the bill. We should also correct the public’s misconceptions."
"This is not about banning products or advertising."
"It is about transparency and clarity for consumers, and innovation and competitiveness for industry."
"We have to be credible here. We cannot lament the exploding costs on the one hand, and then on the other quite openly become the mouthpiece for, say, a confectionary manufacturer and forget about consumer protection."
"We must not allow food with undesirable characteristics, food which is too sweet, too fat or too salty, to put on a cloak of good health."
"I hope that you will not give way on consumer protection tomorrow, but that the European Parliament will again demonstrate that we want the nutrient profiles – the heart of the proposal – to be left in, and that we want them once again to blaze a trail for transparency and consumer protection."
"."
"The Commission proposal is, I think, in itself a sound one, although I regard Mrs Bortone’s original report as being even better in a number of areas."
"This issue has been on the agenda for a few years and this is the second time that someone has produced a report on it."
"That this is a tricky subject is illustrated, moreover, by the outcome of the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"For a split second, I thought that Mrs Bortone would now also throw in the towel, for the Committee’s vote completely undermined the Commission proposal and also the rapporteur’s report."
"Article 4 on nutrient profiles, which is crucial, was simply wiped away by one amendment."
"This article had to avoid foodstuffs such as crisps, chocolate and alcohol, which are intrinsically unhealthy foodstuffs, being labelled with health claims from which the consumer could deduce that they are healthy because they contain calcium, for example."
"Public health is thus really being taken for a ride and the food industry’s lobbying has won it the battle."
"In order to defend its position that a claim need not be based on a product’s real nutrient values, the Committee has used the same argument as the food industry, namely that there is no such thing as good or bad foods, only bad diets or customs."
"In the same breath, the Committee has brushed off the table the proposed licensing procedure and replaced it by a duty of notification."
"That means that the producer or importer of foodstuffs is only required to notify to a food agency that they use this or that claim without there being the need for scientific proof."
"My group has tabled a number of amendments to rectify a situation that we find unacceptable."
"We want Article 4 reinstated, and let me finish off by saying that if it is not – not even in a diluted form – then we will be voting against the proposal."
"Madam President, I do not know whether the average European now lives more healthily than they once did, but it is a fact that many people are tending, in certain ways, to become more healthy, and I do not think that that is such a bad thing."
"Needless to say, this has not escaped the attention of the food industry in its zeal for sales, which, we have also noticed, manages at times to find very innovative and positive ways of accommodating the consumer’s sensitivities."
"What we establish today and what we have, in fact, known for years, is that summary legislation that exists at European level in this area is lagging behind and that it is therefore high time we adapted the legislative framework in a bid to protect the consumer effectively, provide them with useful information, offer sufficient legal certainty, which will, in turn, stimulate innovation and really harmonise the rules within the internal market."
"The Commission proposal meets these criteria in the sense that it allows for more fact, more benefit, better scientific underpinning and more harmonisation, but a number of changes, as already mentioned by fellow Members, must be carried out."
"An area which would benefit from cutting back is notification, at least the admission procedure for admitting certain individual claims."
"In our opinion, control is possible via notification, and a bureaucratic admission procedure is really a bridge too far."
"Also, we consider the nutrient profiles that are proposed in a proposal for a directive, to carry at least one claim, to be superfluous."
"That too is taking matters too far and other Members have indicated the reasons why."
"Finally, I think that we should say that there is no justification for ruling out alcoholic products from any possible claim from the word go."
"We know that nothing has been left to chance, and that the Commission, the competent or representative organisations from all quarters, and also this House, have put an enormous amount of preparatory work into this."
"Thirteen years ago, I was a very green Member of this House."
"My first telephone call to the Commission was one to enquire about the progress made with the health claims, which were an issue as long ago as that."
"I am pleased that we are, at last, voting on them tomorrow, and I hope that the outcome will be a satisfactory one."
"Madam President, I too congratulate the rapporteur after her travails and the dedication she has shown to this task, from which she has emerged with more success than her predecessor in the last Parliament."
"She said that we ought to talk to the consumer groups in Europe and see what they think."
"Well, many of us have done so."
"I have a letter here, on behalf of 28 consumer groups in all of the Member States, and what do they say?"
"They ask us to vote for Article 4 and for a sensible version of Article 11."
"I heard what Mrs Niebler said earlier on in the debate and I was astonished by it."
"What in God’s name has all this to do with the Lisbon Process?"
"I do not know about God – he has been around for a long time so he obviously has a healthy diet – but I know what I think and that is that the Lisbon Process, among other things, requires us to have wellinformed consumers who make real choices which increase the marketability of the products they buy."
"Everybody benefits from that, it is a benign circle, and to have it denounced as though it is simply an instrument of the nanny state and so on, as we have heard in the course of this debate, is absolute rubbish."
"I personally hope that we vote to retain Article 4."
"We need to have some way of dealing with the misleading claims which are made, which balance one substance against another, and only tell you about the one for which the claim could be made."
"The only way to do that is to have some effective template from which this can be made."
"The Commission has worked long and hard on this."
"I have many representatives of the food industry in my own constituency who have said that provided we just have that template within the Poli Bortone report, we do not then need it in Mrs Scheele’s proposals, we do not need it for fortification, but we should have it somewhere."
"And so we should."
"I cannot vote for this proposal tomorrow if the emasculation of Article 4 takes place."
"Madam President, ‘no added sugar’, ‘high in iron’, ‘low in cholesterol’ or else a current bestseller, ‘high in omega3s’, health claims nowadays adorn almost all packaging, and quite naturally influence our choices as consumers."
"We therefore need to guide the consumer through this veritable jungle, and that is the aim of this excellent proposal for a regulation: first to ensure that the claims are accurate, as a minimum, and then to put an end to those that cause misunderstandings."
"I will return to my example: high in omega3s."
"In principle, this is very good, but obviously not for products too high in fat, sugar or salt."
"The text refers to health and nutrition claims, not to advertising, as we heard here today."
"No product will be banned, and neither will advertising."
"Quite simply, the honest thing for these products would be to focus the advertising on pleasure, if manufacturers wish, and not on health."
"That is why it is vital, tomorrow, that we reinstate nutritional benefit at the heart of the text, a criterion that is recognised by the WHO, in particular to combat the disease of this century, obesity, which affects 40% of children in Europe."
"A criterion that will also ban any form of health claim for alcoholic drinks, which is the least we can do, you will agree."
"In conclusion, if tomorrow we follow the excellent work of our rapporteur, Mrs Bortone, and change direction, it will prove that this Parliament truly cares about the interests of goodfaith manufacturers, I would say, and of European consumers."
"Madam President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur, who has had a tremendous job of work to do."
"Recent research carried out by ‘Which?’, the UK consumer association, has shown that 98 per cent of people that it spoke to want health and nutrition claims on food to be authorised so that they can be certain that the food they buy is indeed the product described on the packaging with the qualities that are attributed to that product."
"In my Group we agree that there is a need for authorisation, not notification, because selfregulation does not work."
"We need an authorisation procedure and, as others have said, we need to maintain the nutrient profiles – Article 4 – not least to protect children from being the targets of misleading advertising."
"Sixteen per cent of children in the UK between the ages of two and fifteen are obese, and the problem is getting worse."
"This demands a very strong response."
"We cannot allow foods that are high in salt or sugar to be marketed as being good for children’s health."
"Finally, we have to ensure better and clearer information for the public so that this important new legislation is as effective as possible."
"Madam President, there are many people who are anxious about the increase in obesity and the ill health it causes to many people and, in particular, to already vulnerable groups: those on very low incomes."
"This is a major social problem but, perhaps above all, a major problem for the individuals affected."
"That is why there are also many individuals who try to shop more healthily and to choose healthier food."
"Unfortunately, their attempts are unscrupulously exploited by companies that try to make products such as cornflakes, soft drinks and suchlike appear more beneficial than they really are."
"As a representative of the people, I do in actual fact think that those of us here in the European Parliament need to ensure that no consumer is duped into buying products they really do not want."
"We must therefore demand that the whole of a product’s content be taken account of when health claims are made."
"Otherwise, I for one shall not be able to support this report."
"It is obviously especially important that no one be duped into buying drinks containing alcohol, with the problems we know they cause, in the belief that these drinks are beneficial."
"Health claims should not, therefore, be used on alcoholic drinks."
"In no respect is this, of course, a matter of prescribing what people should eat. Rather, it is about giving people the right and the opportunities to make wellinformed choices for themselves."
"That is why I in actual fact find it hard to understand how, for example, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats can think that companies should be entitled to mislead consumers."
"Do you really not believe that companies can manufacture products that consumers want, but that they have to dupe people into buying them?"
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when the Commissioner listed the advantages of this proposal just now – let me repeat them once more: a high level of consumer protection, facilitating the free movement of goods in the internal market, enhancing legal security for economic agents, creating fair competition in the food sector, promoting and protecting innovation in the field of foodstuffs, all laudable objectives – I nodded, because yes, that is quite right!"
"But in the regulation this is to be achieved by restricting market principles, degrading citizens to sheeplike consumers and introducing a great deal of bureaucracy."
"The basic approach of doing more to promote a healthy diet and lifestyle is something that I support unreservedly. We must take action here."
"But the proposed means of doing so is inappropriate; it does nothing more than create the opportunity for an alibi, enabling us, in a few years’ time, to say: ‘We did something."
"It didn’t help, but we can wash our hands of it’."
"Restricting advertising to the point of banning it surely also flies in the face of a whole series of scientific and political arguments."
"The idea of prohibiting the making of such claims about the nutrient profile on particular foods goes against the principle of food science, according to which there are no good or bad foods, but only a good or bad diet."
"Across all of its committees, Parliament has sought to reduce consumer nannying, observe market principles and cut red tape."
"The elimination of Article 4 is the core of or basis for these changes."
"It is high time that you in the Commission also had a radical rethink of your procedures."
"Let us concentrate on informing consumers; let us close loopholes in the law to put a stop to the dishonest practices of a few economic agents, and let us create a climate in which it is acceptable to strive for a healthy lifestyle, which in itself has to be presented differently to each individual generation."
"You cannot live without salt or sugar."
"Mrs Corbey, I heard your first comments and am very concerned about your lifestyle. Soon there will be nothing left that you can eat!"
"I should like to make another proposal, which could be a followup to yours."
"Why not determine human beings’ nutritional requirements on the basis of their body structure, with a computer chip inserted in the head, so that they can only go in certain directions in the supermarket and can only go to certain foods."
"That would be the epitome of consumer nannying, and then we would have only slim people in Europe."
"This is good advice I am giving you, so please take note of it!"
"Madam President, I should like to welcome Commissioner Kyprianou here this evening and say that we look forward to welcoming him to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"We have been inviting him for over six months and apparently he is far too busy to join us, but he would be very welcome."
"Some weeks ago President Barroso assured us that he would ‘Lisbonproof’ all legislation coming from the Commission."
"He mentioned REACH and the Services Directive."
"Could I ask that Commissioner Kyprianou bring this particular piece of legislation to his attention and immediately ‘Lisbonproof’ it?"
"There is far too much unnecessary red tape involved in it and it will place a very onerous and disproportionate burden on SMEs in particular."
"I agree with the basic principle behind the proposal before us that consumers should not be misinformed, but I have serious doubts about the Commission’s approach, especially in relation to nutrient profiles and implied health claims, i.e. Articles 4 and 11."
"This legislation smacks of the nanny state and verges on the patronising in its current form."
"Consumers bear the ultimate responsibility for their own food choices."
"Almost no foodstuffs are inherently bad."
"Food consumption patterns are what is important."
"The emphasis should be on encouraging healthy lifestyles and healthy diets, not on censoring information, as is the case in relation to the socalled nutrient profiles in Article 4 of this proposal."
"Having consulted with nutrition experts from the University of Ghent and from Trinity College Dublin, I am convinced that the concept is not grounded in solid science and will have the adverse effect of depriving consumers of a great deal of information."
"Reference intake values are the accepted scientific norm today and should be used to ensure that labelling is clear, unambiguous and meaningful; they would greatly facilitate consumer choice, not least as a tool to fight obesity."
"Having made this point, I fully support the proposal to delete Article 4."
"As a fallback position, I support the proposal put forward by the PPEDE Group and others at committee stage and now resubmitted by the ALDE, namely to decouple Article 4 by requiring a study into the scientific basis of nutrient profiles before making a decision on their implementation."
"This is a very sensible option."
"All nutritional health claims should be scientifically substantiated according to scientific best practice."
"In particular, I would refer to the inclusion of a positive list of allowed nutritional health claims."
"I question whether this is legally sound, and it is a poor approach to legislation."
"It could lead to certain claims being banned by default because legislators were not aware of them at the time of drafting."
"Such an approach does not allow enough flexibility to take account of new products placed on the market."
"In addition, just last month the Food Supplements Directive, which had a positive list of allowed substances, was found to be illegal by the Advocate General in Luxembourg."
"It is not yet clear what impact that will have on this nutritional health claims proposal."
"I would like the Commission to clarify this particular matter this evening."
"Will this proposal for a regulation also end up in a fourth reading in Luxembourg?"
". Madam President, I wish to remind honourable Members of two facts."
"We are talking about health, the health of European citizens."
"We are talking at the same time of a marketing tool, of a means of making profit on the part of industry, voluntarily, without being obliged to do so."
"The industry chooses to use a health claim in order to sell a product."
"It is only logical that this claim should be based on science, should be accurate, truthful and correct."
"That is a very simple matter."
"It is one thing to say consumers should decide."
"Do we expect every single consumer to have a PhD in chemistry or in biotechnology, or to set up a little lab in their house so that they can analyse every claim and test it to see if it is accurate or not?"
"That is impossible; it is ridiculous; it will not happen."
"That is why we must make sure that the industry that chooses to use this marketing tool carries out the requisite tests to ensure it is providing correct information."
"As I said earlier, nobody wants a nanny state, but in our efforts not to have a nanny state, we must not go to the other extreme and abandon consumers, allowing them to be bombarded with inaccurate or misleading information."
"The result will be exactly the opposite of what was intended: it will be that the consumer will not trust any claim."
"Consumers will ignore even truthful ones, even scientifically based claims, because they cannot choose between the good and the bad claim, the correct and the incorrect claim."
"Therefore the tendency will be – and you heard earlier from Mr Whitehead about the consumers’ position – for them to ignore all claims."
"I am sure the industry does not want this."
"Yes, we support innovation, there is no question about that, but innovation based on science, not based on misleading information."
"We are not banning advertising."
"This is a misunderstanding and I have to make it clear that there is no question of banning advertising."
"We are concerned with the message the advertising contains."
"If it cannot be proved scientifically that a certain product helps health, the advertisement should just say the product tastes good, following the good old way of advertising a product."
"Not everything has to based on health claims if there is no scientific evidence for them."
"Of course, a correct diet is good, but for consumers to decide their diets they have to have the right information."
"Regarding the list, I think again there may be a misunderstanding."
"The list is not an exclusive list, its aim is to harmonise."
"Therefore, claims that have been approved will be able to be used by everybody, which will help the smaller industries because they will be able to draw on the list and use it without having to go through the approval procedure themselves."
"Regarding SMEs, when it comes to health they have the same obligations as the larger industries."
"We just have to make it easier for them to meet these obligations."
"I agree that we have to simplify the authorisation procedures, but that does not mean that SMEs can make a claim that is not correct."
"There is no intention to withdraw this proposal; it is very important."
"We have an obligation to the European citizens, a responsibility towards them to maintain this level of consumer protection."
"What we are trying to do is to empower consumers so they can use information that is correct."
"Nutritional profiles are important, they have to remain."
"They will help ensure that claims are accurate and do not mislead the consumer."
"Also, the authorisation procedure is very important."
"Notification is not enough."
"It would not offer the necessary consumer protection, nor would it offer fair competition in the industry."
"However, we can discuss simplifying the procedures to make it easier for smaller businesses to meet the authorisation requirements."
"Article 11, on prohibited claims, can be softened."
"We can discuss which claims can be allowed and which ones not."
"There are a number of claims that could lead to an adverse effect, and they should not be allowed."
"But this is something which is open to discussion."
"As for children, we all agree that there is a need to protect them."
"The question is whether this is the most appropriate legislation for doing so."
"We have other legislation, we have the directive on unfair commercial practices, which was approved recently."
"We also have nonregulatory procedures like the platform on obesity, which we launched recently."
"Through these legislative and nonlegislative procedures we can offer protection to children."
"Applying this particular legislation to the protection of children would only complicate matters and not achieve the target."
"Finally, Madam President, I apologise for exceeding my speaking time and I would like to say that a complete list of the Commission’s position on all the amendments is available to Parliament."
"I would request that it be included in the record of this partsession(1)."
"Madam President, I wanted to know if the Commissioner could answer my question on the positive list, please, and whether it will survive the fourth reading in the European Court of Justice."
"–That was not a point of order in the true sense of the term."
". Madam President, I am informed that the Court did not contest the existence of the positive list."
"It contested the procedure. Therefore, we will adjust accordingly on the procedure."
"Second, it is not an exclusive list, so that also avoids any problem."
"We therefore believe that this form of positive list will survive."
"While I have the floor I should mention something I forgot to point out to the honourable Member."
"For some time now we have been trying to arrange a date on which I can visit the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in order to introduce the health and consumer programme and answer other questions."
"Owing to various problems affecting the committee and myself, it has taken longer than I would have wished."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"18 amendments can be accepted: Amendments 6, 12, 14, 20, 21, 26, 27, 31, 32, 33, 41, 50, 62, 74, 80, 87, 88 and 91."
"Nine amendments are acceptable, subject to redrafting: 7, 18, 28, 42, 45, 52, 61, 76 and 84."
"Seven amendments are acceptable in principle: Amendments 10, 13, 15, 37, 38, 51 and 101."
"One amendment is acceptable in principle, subject to redrafting: Amendment 54."
"14 amendments are partially acceptable: Amendments 1, 2, 4, 9, 16, 17, 30, 43, 44, 67, 71, 72, 78 and 93."
"Six amendments are partially acceptable, subject to redrafting: 8, 36, 59, 73, 92 and 102."
"51 amendments should be rejected: 3, 5, 11, 19, 23, 24, 25, 29, 34, 35, 39, 40, 46, 47, 48, 49, 53, 55, 56, 57, 58, 60, 63, 64, 65, 66, 68, 69, 70, 75, 77, 79, 81, 82, 83, 85, 86, 89, 90, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 103, 104, 105, 106 and 107."
"No position on Amendment 22 which will not be voted (linguistic issue)."
"– The next item is the report (A60127/2005) by Mrs Agnes Schierhuber, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the financing of the common agricultural policy (COM(2004)0489 – C60166/2004 – 2004/0164(CNS))."
". Madam President, I would like to thank Mrs Schierhuber for the quality of her report, as well as for the amendments tabled."
"This draft regulation is of great importance."
"It is included in the package of proposals made by the Commission in the scope of the financial perspectives and defines the rules for financing the common agricultural policy."
"The purpose of this regulation is to clarify and simplify these financing rules, to improve our management and control system and to adapt and reinforce our rules on budget discipline, taking into account the reform of the CAP decided in 2003."
"The bringing together of the rules relating to the two new funds in one single regulation must be considered as a major simplification concerning the rural development policy where we stop using different financial rules for the same measures depending on the region where they apply."
"The single management and control system chosen for both funds takes advantage of the good experience we have acquired in the field of the EAGGF Guarantee Section."
"However, this system needed some reinforcement in order to constitute a modern management and control system."
"A major new element in it is the declaration of assurance given by the head of the paying agencies."
"I would also like to draw your attention to the new system for the followup of irregularities and recoveries."
"This system should ensure that major amounts will not be outstanding indefinitely."
"Both these elements are in line with Parliament’s 2003 discharge recommendations."
"This regulation on the financing of the CAP would not be complete without the relevant rules on budget discipline."
"These rules are, however, also reinforced where needed and adapted to the new rules we decided upon in the reform adopted back in 2003."
"My position on the amendments is as follows."
"Although I can agree with the purpose of Amendment 1, I do not consider it legally necessary or even good legal practice to follow it."
"The exception of expenditure stated in Article 13 will apply."
"It is not necessary to state this again in Article 5."
"I can accept Amendment 2 and Amendment 7 with, however, some small drafting changes."
"Amendments 3, 4 and 5 are all reducing the 36month period used in clearance of accounts to determine the expenses which can be the subject of a clearance decision."
"I have to inform you that this proposal was based on a recommendation from the Court of Auditors, as well as from Parliament."
"However, if you adopt these amendments, taking into account the fact that all Member States also ask for this time limit to be reduced to 24 months, I will accept them."
"I regret I cannot accept Amendment 6."
"The proposal for a flatrate approach on recoveries in the event of irregularities is a fundamental part of the Commission’s proposal."
"We cannot justify to the European taxpayers that more than EUR 2 billion is outstanding and for which we cannot put into place a manageable followup system."
"The past has proven that the existing system which needs a casebycase, yearly examination of the more than 10 000 outstanding recovery files is impossible."
"The flatrate approach shares out the financial responsibility equally between Member States and Commission, once the normal period for the recovery has elapsed."
"For cases in which recovery action is taken in courts, we now propose to allow for a normal period of eight years."
"Your proposal would be to wait for the final judicial decision."
"This would take away all the benefits that are actually being sought."
"Furthermore, it makes the whole system superfluous as once a final judicial decision is taken, there is no reason to apply the provisional flatrate solution of sharing the financial burden between Member States and the Community budget."
". – Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen – those of you who are still here despite the late hour – first and foremost, I should like to express my thanks for the good cooperation, not only with all of the groups in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, but also and above all with the Commission and its officials, as well as with the Council Presidency and all of the staff in Parliament and in our groups."
"It was this that made it possible for this really very constructive report to become a reality."
"Commissioner, you said just now that you cannot accept all of our amendments."
"You will be aware, however, that they were adopted unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture."
"I nevertheless hope that Parliament will vote in favour of this report tomorrow by a very large majority."
"This report on the financing of the common agricultural policy is also – as you have already mentioned, Commissioner – closely connected to the report on rural development."
"I am delighted that we have managed to keep to the timetable that we set ourselves when I was appointed to draft this report, and that we are going to be able to vote on it in the plenary while we are still under the Luxembourg Presidency."
"This was the only way to make it possible for the rural development programmes to continue seamlessly in the new planning period."
"As has been said, this is a very technical administrative dossier."
"On the positive side, it should be noted that this proposal genuinely simplifies the structure of the current legal bases for financing, in particular in respect of rural development policy in the period 2007 to 2013."
"The political objective is to simplify the system and make it easier to understand, and of course also to have better and more efficient controls, disbursement of funds and transparency, which all of us here can only welcome."
"In the future, these two funds – the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development – will be able to work very well."
"I also welcome the fact that the Commission intends to introduce stricter monitoring, evaluation and reporting mechanisms, to ensure that the agreed ceilings are complied with."
"We all know how complicated accounting procedures for EU funds are in the farming sector, and so the proposed increase in efficiency and transparency is also to be welcomed."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is using the corresponding Commission proposal to create a common legal framework for financing these two components of the common agricultural policy."
"In the committee, the seven amendments were adopted that the Commission is now unfortunately not able to accept in full."
"Although this report only lays down the technical arrangements for implementing the financing, one point has to be mentioned in this context: if the European Union is really to achieve its ambitious goals on rural development, then adequate financial resources must be allocated to the Rural Development Fund."
"Rural areas have a high status in the European Union, particularly in the ten new Member States."
"More than half of our EU citizens live in rural areas, which make up around 90% of EU territory."
"The issue is to ensure that these regions remain worthwhile places to live – attractive and active – thus creating a viable world in which people can live and work."
"The development and implementation of positive strategies and prospects for the future are a top priority."
"The 2003 reform of the common agricultural policy brought permanent changes for the European agriculture and forestry sectors, and in the process of this reform rural areas have become even more important, so as to meet the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives."
"Rural development policy is a policy for people everywhere in the European Union."
"It cannot be said often enough that in the battle over the EU budget, our ambitious aim must be to ensure that appropriate resources are allocated to rural development, the second pillar."
"Commissioner, you have my support in this fight for a balanced budget for the future of rural development."
". Mrs Schierhuber has done an excellent job of drafting this report, and there is very little room for improvement."
"I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on this score, and indeed the draft regulation itself is of a very high standard."
"If I may, however, I should like to make a number of general comments."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is crucial that the necessary checks be carried out on the billions of euro that the European Union spends on the common agricultural policy and on other Community policies."
"The EU should set an example to the rest of the world in the way it disburses funds, and, most importantly of all, it should meet all the standards for counteracting corruption."
"EU funds should be distributed according to objective criteria, with the use of transparent procedures and systematic checks."
"Unfortunately, the reality falls somewhat short of this ideal."
"All too often, the way in which EU funds are disbursed is anything but clear and transparent, and the necessary checks are lacking."
"The most stringent checks should not be carried out on the recipients of funds, or in other words on farmers or selfgovernment bodies, but on the institutions responsible for distributing EU money."
"The checks carried out by the European Commission do not ensure adequate scrutiny of EU spending."
"They are not entirely objective, as it is sometimes the case that irregularities in disbursing these funds are not only the result of mistakes made by the Member States, but also of those made by the Commission itself."
"One can hardly expect the Commission to point out its own mistakes."
"There is an urgent need for more stringent checks by external bodies."
"These should be carried out by the European Court of Auditors, which should cooperate with control bodies in the Member States wherever possible."
"There is also an urgent need for an appropriate system of checks and balances, which is currently lacking."
"The role of the Court of Auditors must be strengthened, and it should not merely issue positive statements, but also point out actual irregularities."
"This is essential if Community funds are to be distributed fairly and honestly."
". Madam President, the report before us by Mrs Schierhuber is important because it creates regulations for financing the common agricultural policy."
"We know that almost half the current EU budget is used for this purpose."
"Mrs Schierhuber has produced an extremely good report, and I would like to thank her sincerely for that."
"The common agricultural policy has hitherto been financed via the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund."
"It has been difficult to administer the fund."
"It is divided into two different sections, where different rules apply."
"As part of a general reform of agricultural policy the intention is now to set up two separate funds: a European Agricultural Guarantee Fund, and an Agricultural Fund for Rural Development."
"As the intention is to establish just one administration and inspection system for both funds, administration will be simplified and made more efficient."
"We know, after all, that the present bureaucratic and ineffective system of administration tends to aggravate the situation."
"To guarantee an impeccable system of budgetary control, the Commission is proposing extensions to the deadlines for embarking on the recovery of funds that were paid in error for the wrong reasons."
"The committee, however, made the deadlines shorter again."
"Personally, I would have liked longer deadlines."
"As, however, the regulation is huge in scope and contains many considerable improvements, including with regard to budgetary control, I am prepared to accept the overall proposal."
"Madam President, we know what this is about: basically it is a technical debate."
"I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on her work."
"I suppose the technicalities of this debate will go right over the heads of many farmers."
"Their concerns are rather more basic."
"I wish to address the issue of the technicalities."
"It seems sensible to simplify how we operate the funds."
"I have some concerns about an overbureaucratic system coming into place because, at the very least, there would be more documentation required of Member States."
"However, if it provides for more transparency and accountability for the wider citizens of the European Union, then it is a positive development."
"Yet I am always concerned that having more documents does not lead to transparency."
"In this case I hope it does."
"To return to the issue for farmers, their concern, in particular with the new single farm payment regime, is to receive prompt payment of what they now call the ‘cheque in the post’, to have it delivered on time and within their production year, because it comprises such a huge proportion of their farm income."
"They also have concerns, which I would share, about the very severe penalties which Member States might impose on them for breaches of the regulations that are not deliberate."
"That has to be avoided."
"I wish to address specifically the issue of rural development."
"I know the Commissioner believes very strongly in rural development and, indeed, believes that it is the future for agriculture policy, a view shared by the OECD."
"The difficulty for the European Union is that while we have grand plans for rural development, we do not have the budget to fund those plans."
"This is an area of great concern."
"It is for this reason that when we all discuss the financial perspectives for 2007 to 2013, we must remember the commitments we made to farmers in the past in relation to the single farm payment, and indeed to rural development, and we must put our money where our mouths are."
". Madam President, I wish to thank Mrs Schierhuber and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their very good cooperation, which I appreciate very much."
"I hope that it will be possible to reach a political compromise on this issue during the Luxembourg presidency."
"On rural development, I would like to say to Mrs McGuinness that we share a common vision."
"It is the future of agriculture and, as I used to say, it is also the life insurance for agriculture."
"Concerning financing, if we look at the Commission proposal for the next financial period, approximately EUR 100 billion will be available for the next financial period, including the modulated money."
"I think this will be sufficient."
"However, I would be worried if the countries that support the 1% succeeded during the ongoing discussions on the financial framework, because then we would not have enough money to realise our vision of a common rural development policy."
"Therefore, I can only encourage those who are really in favour of this policy to put pressure on Member States to finance it to the level we regard as necessary, in order to give rural development policy a proper future."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"– The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Pervenche Berès, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on possible stock exchange mergers and future architecture of financial markets in the EU (00069/2005 – B60240/2005)."
". Madam President, I will avoid making this a purely Dutch discussion, and speak in English so that others can participate directly in this interesting debate."
"The possibility of a takeover of the London Stock Exchange by Deutsche Börse or Euronext has ignited debates in the European Parliament over whether such a takeover can be assessed at national level alone."
"At present, the two cases are being dealt with by the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission in the UK."
"Legally speaking, the takeover of the LSE may be the responsibility of the relevant Member State’s competition authorities, since European competition rules do not apply as long as the national regulators deem the relevant markets to be their respective Member States and the turnover level to be below the thresholds set for European competition rules to apply."
"Nevertheless, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has tabled this oral question to the Commission to ask it to play a more proactive role."
"We would like the Commission to consider the different scenarios that might arise and assess the effects that they might bring to competition in, and the pricing of, listing services, trading services, information services and, not least, important posttrade services, clearing and settlement."
"We are aware of the detailed studies undertaken by the Competition Commission in the UK, prepared by the British Office of Fair Trading."
"The standpoint of that assessment is, however, primarily or maybe even exclusively the impact for the UK markets, and we would like to see that broadened in the Commission’s assessment."
"You may remember the shock caused in 20022003 when some traders in Dutch bluechip equities challenged Euronext Amsterdam to lower prices and to providing improvements in services, by looking for an alternative trading venue with Deutsche Börse and the LSE."
"This showed that competition really makes a difference."
"This characterises the situation we have at present of an open integrated European market with crossborder competition."
"The question is whether different scenarios increase this competitive tendency, or go in the opposite direction and tend to create monopolies situations for which, by the way, competition regulation might be a more appropriate answer."
"Another related issue is the aspect of regulation and supervision."
"From the moment the possible takeover of the LSE appeared on the pages of the financial papers, speculation started as to where the headquarters of the merged entity would be based and which regulator would get the power to supervise it."
"That was more than speculation."
"I tend to believe there was truth in the stories that the issue of the regulatory regime was a major subject in the merger talks."
"Who knows, it might even have been part of the background of the rebellion against the Deutsche Börse leadership, which you in Germany have such nice nicknames for."
"As the rapporteur of subsequent reports on prudential supervision and the FSAP, I would not dare to express my preferences for one or other national regulatory regimes."
"My far greater concern is that there will be counterproductive competition between national regimes, instead of further coordination and cooperation."
"That is one of my strongest arguments for a European level supervisor."
"In the reports I prepared in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and which were adopted in the previous plenary sitting, this is again stressed as an option for the near future."
"Such a European level supervisor should execute the application of the European regulatory framework of the FSAP developed in previous years."
"As regards the part of the financial market which is already supranational and operates crossborder and often crosssector, one of our main messages is to create real convergence in the implementation of the European directives and real convergence of supervisory practice, thereby avoiding regulatory arbitrage and possible competition on other factors for establishment such as fiscal and cost aspects."
"Therefore, the possible effects of the Commission’s ambitions as regards integration of the financial markets and the regulation and supervision of different scenarios should also be part of the assessment we are asking for."
"In that context I would ask you to focus your attention on scenarios in which merger activity is not restricted to EU countries alone."
"There may also be conceivable scenarios in which the New York stock exchange and a newly formed one joint with the LSE or, on the other hand Euronext and Deutsche Börse might get together."
"There might then be a disintegration rather than a further convergence of European regulations."
"This should also be taken into account in your assessment and expectations."
"It is regrettable that this debate is being held at such a late hour, but I thank the Commissioners for being here and wish Mr McCreevy, who was supposed to be here, all the best with his health."
"I also hope, of course, that we can continue the debate in the committee."
". Madam President, the Commission thanks the honourable Member for her question."
"I am really pleased, even if it is late, that we can talk about this very important item."
"I should have started with the apologies of my colleague, Commissioner McCreevy."
"He was very sorry that he was unable to here, but you can be assured that his thoughts are with us in this debate."
"The Commission is aware of the ongoing projects and discussions in this area and is monitoring all the developments."
"National and also, as Mrs van den Burg has already mentioned, panEuropean consolidation and restructuring in this sector is market led."
"A merger of two or three EU stock exchanges would necessarily have an important impact on the structure of the market for EU equities trading and posttrading."
"The Commission intends to maintain its leadership role in driving towards an integrated EU financial services market."
"The Commission also favours the combined intervention of market forces and public authorities to ensure fair competition between all forms of securities trading venue, including exchanges in regulated markets, as well as newer trading devices, such as multilateral trading facilities and the internationalisation of orders in investment firms."
"Mergers in this sector are subject to normal regulatory and competition authority oversight."
"Concerning the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004, the merger regulation, as well as the competition rules more generally, the Commission would like to recall that these rules apply to all industry sectors equally."
"The Commission believes that the current provisions of the merger regulation allow for efficient and appropriate assessment procedures."
"We are confident in the capacity of the national competition authorities to carry out the assessments."
"Commission services are in contact with the competition authorities concerned and have met with a number of interested parties, including the potential bidders."
"Usually, the more you can decentralise, the better it is, because those national competition authorities are very able to do their jobs."
"Therefore, I am usually in favour of the national competition authorities doing their jobs."
"There is a lot of contact and discussion within the network, so it is not a matter of them being on their own, but of doing it together."
"The honourable Member was concerned that a merger could lead to upwards pressure on trading prices."
"This is certainly being examined."
"One of the central issues in the investigations being conducted by the competition authorities is to ensure that a merged entity includes mechanisms to ensure that competition rules are respected, also for the medium and long term."
"Also noteworthy is the increased competition that is likely to come from the MiFID, from internationalisation and multilateral trading facilities in particular and the fact that capital markets are increasingly global."
"We should not forget the potential of mergers to lead to increased innovation in terms of the products and services that are offered to investors."
"The Commission cannot take a position on an individual corporate decision made by the New York Stock Exchange and its future strategies."
"Mrs van den Burg touched upon that issue."
"In case of any prospective future merger, normal provisions would apply and, to the extent that there may be any regulatory concerns, this should be for the SEC to deal with."
"In this respect, the Commission notes that of the important exchanges in Europe, including all the parties involved in the LSE merger discussions, are already listed as regulated markets in the EU."
"In Europe we have found ways of ensuring that regulatory functions are kept at a sufficient remove from the commercial interests of exchange, and there is no reason to suspect that this will not be the case in other developed markets."
"I would like to thank Mrs van den Burg for mentioning this issue."
"As the honourable Member is aware, the Office of Fair Trading has referred the cases to the Competition Commission, and this is the equivalent of what we would call a phase 2 investigation at European level."
"The national competition authorities are clearly taking this issue most seriously and the Commission is confident that they are examining all aspects which could potentially impact on competition."
"This is illustrated – to answer the point Mrs van den Burg has touched upon – by the questions raised in their issues paper."
"That would, of course, cover posttrading activities, as explicitly mentioned in the FTA’s decision in the cases referred to the Competition Commission."
"I have just one more point to make."
"You mentioned the Dutch situation concerning bluechip equities, which is something of which we are both aware."
"In my opinion it did not work; it was not successful."
"However, it was possible that it could have worked; there was potential."
"There is competition."
"It depends on what the market is doing."
"We always keep an eye on situations like that."
"Such things can sometimes be successful or sometimes fail."
"– The debate is closed."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"- A6-0150/2005 by Mr Goebbels, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission recommendation on the broad guidelines for the economic policies of the Member States and the Community in the framework of the integrated guidelines for growth and jobs;"
"- A6-0149/2005 by Mrs Mato Adrover, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States;"
"- A6-0142/2005 by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Social Agenda for the period 2006-2010."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the compiling of integrated guidelines at three-yearly intervals will tend to improve the coordination of national economic policies."
"The new integrated approach will serve to eliminate the three hundred annual reports that have hitherto been required from the Member States."
"In future, there will be only one comprehensive national report from each country."
"This espousal of the Lisbon strategy by business and labour organisations and by national parliaments will strengthen European democracy."
"The guidelines themselves, however, are too general and take no account of the marked differences between Member States."
"The Commission must therefore be encouraged to present a communication identifying the key challenges for each of the Member States."
"More differentiation by sector is also needed in the treatment of economic problems."
"The Commission’s task is not easy."
"There are no simple answers to the complex economic, social and environmental challenges of the present day."
"Enlargement has made the Union even more heterogeneous."
"The increasingly technical nature of legislation does not make the task of communicating with the European public any easier."
"As the debate on the Constitutional Treaty has shown, the institutional structure of Europe is not properly understood."
"Community jargon fails to address the everyday concerns of many of our fellow citizens."
"To an increasing extent, the European Union is being blamed for all the problems of the day."
"Be that as it may, talk of the impending demise of the EU does not stand up to scrutiny."
"Seen from outside, the Union is not only the most successful peace initiative ever; it is also the political entity in which human rights are best protected."
"Our social market economy produces high living standards while maintaining some of the world’s highest social-welfare and environmental standards."
"Of course Europe could do better!"
"That, indeed, is the aim of the Lisbon strategy."
"In three years, the Union has created 6.5 million additional jobs but has not managed to curb unemployment."
"Economic growth remains too weak, especially in France, Germany and Italy."
"Nevertheless, the EU is the world’s leading exporter and the biggest market for the rest of the world."
"The Union’s current account is in balance, whereas the United States is running both an external and an internal deficit."
"An entity which accounts for almost a quarter of all world trade is obviously competitive."
"To be competitive, an entity needs to enjoy better productivity than its rivals."
"High living standards are the result of a very competitive economy and a high rate of employment, but are not in themselves a yardstick for competitiveness."
"The difference between Americans and Europeans in terms of average income does not mean that Europe is being left behind but rather reflects excessive increases in the incomes of the richest 20% in the United States."
"In Europe, the battle to achieve greater productivity is inseparable from the battle to ensure fairer distribution of the fruits of growth, greater social cohesion and effective protection of the natural environment."
"It is no coincidence that the Nordic countries provide a high level of social and environmental protection."
"The high public spending this entails has not prevented the economies of the Nordic countries from rising steadily in the world rankings for performance and innovation."
"Europe’s performance in the global marketplace is far from disastrous."
"An analysis carried out by the services of the Commission has shown that two thirds of US productivity growth derives from the service sector, particularly wholesale and retail trade, real estate and financial intermediation."
"These are not markets in which the United States and Europe are in direct competition."
"In the primary and secondary sectors, Europe has been outperforming the United States, achieving better productivity rates in 37 out of the 56 sectors studied."
"The United States, on the other hand, has an unchallenged lead in the manufacture of semiconductors and office machinery."
"When it comes to communication services and computer and related services, however, productivity is higher in Europe."
"Basically, Europe lags behind only in certain high-tech sectors: ICT, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and GM products."
"The area where we lag furthest behind is that of research."
"In absolute figures, the United States spends about USD 110 billion per year more than Europe on research and development, an amount equivalent to the EU budget."
"European industry has the most leeway to make up here."
"Of the 1.3 million researchers in the United States, 80% work for the private sector, compared with only 48% of Europe’s one million researchers."
"The integrated guidelines will have to be fine-tuned in the course of the next three-year period."
"The euro area currently has a sound macroeconomic framework, with low inflation, a strong currency and very low interest rates."
"However, the three Member States outside the euro area have higher rates of growth, even though their monetary independence comes at the cost of higher interest rates."
"Eight of the ten new member countries enjoy substantial growth, but they do have structural problems."
"The integrated guidelines, Mr President, must take more account of the diversity of the Member States’ specific situations and problems."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since the Lisbon Council in 2000, the European Union’s economy has been negatively affected by various events which have led to much less growth than we had expected and, at the moment, we are still very far from achieving the objectives set in Lisbon."
"Last February, the Commission approved a document entitled ‘Working together for growth and jobs – a new start for the Lisbon Strategy’, which clearly pointed out that if Europe wanted to carry on aspiring to become the most dynamic and most competitive economic area in the world by 2010, the Lisbon Strategy had to be reoriented and had to focus on two clear objectives: firstly, economic growth and, secondly, employment."
"One consequence of that is the presentation of the economic and employment policy guidelines, for the first time integrated and for a period of 3 years, which will have to be incorporated into national reform programmes, which will also be innovative."
"These guidelines are based on the notion that economic growth can make a decisive contribution to job creation and that that is the best guarantee for social provision."
"I would like to thank you for the more than 90 amendments presented, which have become fourteen compromises approved almost unanimously by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and which I intend to retain today for the sake of coherence and also out of respect for the Members that have signed them."
"I will therefore reject the seven amendments by the Group of the Greens, which, in fact, have already been debated and taken up, in part, in the compromises and accepted by the different parliamentary groups."
"It would appear logical that, since we have all given ground, following arduous work, in order to reach a consensus on a good report that could be supported by a large majority, we should support that report today."
"I would like in particular to thank the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, which presented a perfect text from a gender perspective that has been taken up, practically in its entirety, in the compromises and guidelines introduced as amendments."
"Thank you very much for the work you have done."
"I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that, during the parliamentary negotiations, we have managed to improve the Commission's text by extending it and introducing new issues."
"Firstly, the reconciliation of family and work life: such important aspects as the equal distribution of family responsibilities between couples, support for flexible work patterns, in particular part-time work, paternity leave or facilities for the care of children or other dependent persons, in particular the elderly, in accordance with the objectives set at the Barcelona Summit in 2002."
"Secondly, the fight against workplace accidents."
"The report advocates prevention and we recommend the establishment of a broad agreement at European level to combat workplace accidents, which cause so many deaths throughout Europe."
"Thirdly, and very importantly, the phenomenon of immigration."
"We advocate the integration of legal immigrants and the eradication of all types of racist behaviour."
"Fourthly, training and education: improving all types of education and supporting professional training, which must cease to be the poor relation of university education, lifelong learning, new technologies and the promotion of entrepreneurial spirit, languages and exchange programmes between teachers and students."
"Fifthly, the fight against the scourge of domestic violence: employment plans for women who are victims of gender violence."
"Sixthly, our commitment to social cohesion and inclusion and to combating employment discrimination, supporting integrated action and the adoption of all measures necessary to guarantee that labour markets are open to job seekers, in particular women, young people, the elderly and people suffering any type of disability."
"The text, and also the contributions of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, include a whole range of measures to guarantee real equality between men and women, not just with regard to access to jobs, but also with regard to other issues, such as salaries, professional promotion and harassment."
"Seventhly, employment for the elderly and gradual and flexible retirement."
"We are promoting participation in the labour market by the elderly and the voluntary extension of working life by means of measures to incentivise work and make early retirement less attractive."
"And finally, the report introduces other issues, such as the environment, sustainable development and the social economy, and promotes the work of cooperatives and the voluntary sector, the role of regional and local authorities and the quest for new sources of employment, which is very important."
"In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the report we are debating today is going to enrich and improve the text originally proposed by the Commission."
"I would therefore like once again to thank very warmly all the Members who have presented amendments, not just for their interest, but also for their willingness to reach agreement, since, thanks to their work, the guidelines that we will at last approve today will allow the European Employment Strategy to contribute more effectively to achieving the objectives set at Lisbon, which, in the field of employment, are quite simply to achieve full and better-quality employment by 2010."
". Mr President, a social Europe in the world economy, jobs and new opportunities: that is how, in February, the European Commission summed up the social agenda for the next few years."
"Today, we will try to pick up where the documents left off."
"I therefore hope that the Commission, as indeed the Council, will accommodate, in a positive sense, the emphases which we will be placing today in the report on which we will be voting later on."
"Sometimes, I have the feeling that being involved in social policy is considered to be for softies."
"Social policy no longer counts for a great deal in this Europe."
"If, however, we want to achieve the objectives, regain confidence in our society and ensure that the unemployed can return to the labour market, if we want to achieve all of that, then we will need this European social model."
"When – in the context of the discussions that are currently being held in France, but also in the Netherlands – I study the new Constitutional Treaty, I notice that the social market economy is taken as a guiding principle and has implications for all the policies we implement in the European Union."
"In that knowledge, we must apply the social market economy in each piece of policy we lay down."
"Which means that when we all consider this social agenda, then what is more important to us than anything else is achieving the Lisbon objectives, in other words obtaining jobs and creating sound and high-quality employment."
"This also means that we must ensure that the small and medium-sized enterprises, which are, after all, the driving force behind more and better jobs, are given every opportunity."
"That is what Lisbon is about."
"Lisbon also means, however, that we must ensure that people who are now being sidelined, are unable to work or are disabled, as a result of which they are unable sufficiently to reconcile work with a professional life, are also given a chance on the labour market by means of the social framework which we would like to have in Europe."
"It also means that, with the remaining capacities they have, people with a work disability are given another chance on the labour market thanks to retraining or extra training."
"For years – a few decades I would imagine – we have been talking about promoting retraining and extra training, about being active at all times in order to retrain for the labour market and, barring a few exceptions, this is, in fact, done far too infrequently in this field."
"I therefore believe that the Commissioner should put training at the top of the agenda."
"Then there is the social market economy. We must have an economy that suits everybody."
"That also means that we must carefully examine the effects of demographic changes in our society on our social security system."
"If we know that, in the next few years, we will be faced with a decrease in the number of young people and an increase in the number of older people in our working population, this means that we must adapt our social security systems to those demographic factors."
"The European Commission is good at analysing, but has failed to produce absolute policy in this memorandum."
"I hope that, with the emphases we will be placing during the vote, we will manage to make the social agenda more practical."
". Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their presentations of the three reports that we are going to discuss in a combined fashion, and we in the Commission are pleased about this."
"A month and a half ago, on 12 April, Vice-President Verheugen, Commissioner Špidla and myself had the opportunity to present to this Parliament the integrated package of guidelines for the review and application of the Lisbon Strategy, combining the two instruments laid down in the Treaty into a single communication, a single discussion and a single strategy: the broad economic policy guidelines and the employment guidelines."
"The Commission considers it essential to maintain this integrated approach."
"The two instruments based on the Treaty — the broad economic policy guidelines and the employment guidelines — have the same objective, though with a different approach and at differing levels: to increase our growth, to increase levels of employment, and, on this basis, to enhance social cohesion, the social model that is laid down in the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, and socially and environmentally sustainable development — another of the principal elements of the Lisbon Strategy — and naturally all of this should be done in a way that improves our competitiveness and our capacity to continue growing."
"This integrated approach is therefore the first element I wanted to refer to, in accordance, furthermore, with the opinion of Parliament."
"In the time I have left before my colleague Mr Špidla speaks — Mr Verheugen cannot be here today, unfortunately — I am going to comment on the report by Mr Goebbels on the broad economic policy guidelines."
"In his report, Mr Goebbels draws attention to the excessive pessimism amongst operators, amongst investors and consumers with regard to the European economy."
"I entirely agree with that assessment and I share his concern about the lack of confidence."
"In the European economy, the conditions are currently in place to grow more than we are actually growing."
"In particular, in some of the biggest national economies in the euro zone, we should be growing more and, to this end, we need to increase confidence amongst investors and consumers, because the objective conditions are in place."
"As well as the confidence problem, we have a problem of disparity of situations, which, since we have decided to have a single monetary policy, presents us with a challenge on which both the Commission and the Council and, in particular, the Eurogroup, are working: how to respond, within a context of budgetary discipline — we are going to discuss the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact in this Parliament in a few days time — and on the basis of coordination of economic policies, of the broad economic policy guidelines, to that disparity of situations in such a way that, by applying recommendations adapted to the specific circumstances of each of the national economies, the whole of the euro zone and the whole of the European Union can coordinate their economic policies and we can all achieve a better result."
"We are going to debate this disparity of situations in a coming meeting of the Eurogroup working on the basis of a report that the Commission has been asked to present."
"But we also want each of the countries to define their own priorities and, in this way, to increase ‘ownership’; hence the importance of the national programmes that are going to be adopted at national level in the autumn."
"If there is one thing that the first five years of application of the Lisbon Strategy have taught us, it is that everybody claims to share the same objectives and strategies, but that not everybody has applied the recommendations that have emerged from that shared analysis of objectives and strategies."
"Hence the importance of those national plans, which will be discussed again both by the Council and by the Commission and, no doubt, by Parliament."
"Hence — and in this regard I disagree with one of the comments in Mr Goebbels’s report — in order to increase ownership at national level and in order that the debate in the States may be a political debate in which the governments and the parliaments define the political priorities and instruments for political action, during this very year, on presenting this integrated package, the Commission has not included the guidelines at national level."
"But now, between June and July, we are going to hold preparatory meetings for the drawing up of the national programmes for each of the 25 Member States and, at those meetings, the Commission’s services, on the basis of the guidelines adopted by the College of Commissioners and discussed in this Parliament and also in the Council, will naturally propose a series of suggestions to each of the Member States for national priorities to help them to draw up those programmes as effectively as possible, and I hope that those programmes will truly allow us to realise the objectives which we share with the report by Mr Goebbels and the reports by Mrs Mato and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if I may, I should like to start by thanking the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"In particular, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, for her outstanding work on the Social Agenda, and Mrs Mato Adrover, for the high quality of her work and for her proactive approach to preparing Parliament’s position on the guidelines."
"I am delighted that this House’s position on the guidelines for economic policy reflects the new focus of the Lisbon strategy for growth and employment, and that it also reflects the three priorities of employment policy, namely increased labour market participation, flexibility and investment in human capital."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I do not share the views of those who are under the impression that the European social model is a failure, and that Europe as a region is lagging ever further behind."
"There is no denying that we must still put in a great deal of work and effort in order to develop this model and to be competitive and up-to-date, but one need only compare our basic constraints with those of other regions in the world where conditions are similar to see that Europe is quite clearly not doing such a bad job."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that the amendments tabled by Parliament are not aimed at changing the structure of the guidelines."
"Instead, the intention behind them is to lend more emphasis to the discussion of certain issues."
"These include both specific problems experienced by certain groups, such as women, young and older workers or disabled people, and certain issues deemed to be key, such as partnerships, promoting job creation, preventing workplace injuries and achieving a balance between flexibility and job security."
"The Commission welcomes the general tenor of Parliament’s position, and will do its best to ensure that due consideration is given to it in the final version of the guidelines, upon which the Social Affairs Council will take a decision on 2 and 3 June."
"In concrete terms, the Commission will make every effort to ensure that the thrust of Parliament’s amendments is addressed during this debate."
"The Commission is in favour of revising the recitals in order to highlight the fact that insufficient progress has been made with reforms during the past five years, and in order to ensure that greater emphasis is placed on social cohesion and the environmental dimension as part of the Lisbon Strategy."
"As I see it, this is the very essence of the Lisbon Strategy; the awareness that we are dealing with three dimensions, rather than just one, and that we need to identify these dimensions and take them into account in every policy we adopt in the future."
"Turning to the issue of individual guidelines, I can assure you that the Commission is in favour of stepping up the EU’s involvement in matters such as partnerships, equality between men and women, the problems experienced by young people and job creation."
"At the same time, however, the Commission does not wish to draft a separate guideline on the prevention of workplace injuries, since this would go beyond the scope set out in the Council’s conclusions."
"If I may, I should now like to say a few words about the Social Agenda."
"There is no question about the fact that it plays a key role, since it is an integral part of both the Lisbon Strategy and the Sustainable Development Strategy."
"It sets out guidelines for the measures we need to take in order to make progress towards more and better jobs and towards a more balanced society in which solidarity plays a greater part."
"The European Council acknowledged this fact at its Spring Summit by coming to a favourable conclusion on the Social Agenda."
"At the same time, it emphasised that the Agenda strengthens the European social model, the basic aims of which are full employment and greater social cohesion, and that as such it would help the EU achieve the Lisbon goals."
"Although growth and employment are immediate priorities, however, greater competitiveness and faster growth are means to an end rather than goals in themselves."
"Growth alone is a guarantee of neither solidarity nor social sustainability."
"We should also take political decisions with a view to ensuring that our various goals are mutually reinforcing."
"Quite apart from anything else, these integrated guidelines are a step in this direction."
"This is the approach that has been taken in the Social Agenda, the aim of which is to help overcome the main structural problems facing Europe, which include demographic change, global competition and technological change and innovation."
"A deliberate decision was taken to present the Commission’s social and employment goals differently to the way in which they had been in the previous Social Agenda."
"As well as setting out the main problems and proposing avenues of thought about future measures, the new Agenda presupposes that any policies formulated will be open and transparent, and that they will involve all stakeholders."
"It does not provide a detailed or exhaustive list of measures, as it would be entirely illogical to decide now on measures that we would only adopt in four or five years’ time, although it is of course useful to set out guidelines and strategic goals."
"This also means that we do not need to establish from the outset which political and technical instruments will be used."
"A wide range of instruments are available to us for measures at Community level, including legislation, the open method of coordination, financial instruments, in particular the European Social Fund, and social dialogue."
"The most effective instrument or combination of instruments should not be chosen in advance on the basis of existing opinion, and no one instrument should be given preference over others."
"Although legislation will continue to be a key instrument, there are a great many reasons why we should not resort to using legislation alone."
"We are all aware that, in a great many cases, levels of implementation and compliance are far from ideal."
"In certain fields, for example the fight against discrimination, preference must therefore be given at this stage to implementing existing measures, which are both valuable and useful in legislative terms."
"I do not intend to dwell on the details of individual issues, but I am willing to take your questions, and look forward with interest to the rest of the debate."
"Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality on the guidelines for employment policy, I am saddened by the absence of our most original ideas in the final report presented by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"In the opinion, I emphasised the need to encourage the diversification of career options for girls, because enhancing women’s employability is the only way to improve their job prospects."
"We therefore recommended affirmative action to improve the employment situation for women."
"Nor did we forget the self-employed and their assisting spouses – millions of unseen workers, mostly women, who are disregarded when statistics on women’s employment rates are compiled."
"It is absurd to forget them and fail to ensure that they obtain social security cover and a share in business profits by proposing measures, such as framework statutes, which would put an end to the precarious nature of employment as an assisting spouse."
"This idea was approved by Parliament in 1997 in the wake of my report on assisting spouses in family businesses, but it still has not been embraced by the Commission."
"The report under examination was an opportunity to send a reminder, and it is regrettable that it has not done so."
"Another idea put forward in my opinion was the promotion of ‘chosen working time’ and of voluntary part-time work."
"None of these ideas found favour with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and that is a great pity."
"Perhaps the European Commission will take them into consideration."
"I certainly hope so because, if we bear in mind, Commissioner, that the proposals adopted unanimously by Parliament date back to 1997 and that, in 2005, nothing has yet been done to amend the directive of 1986 on the equal treatment of self-employed people and assisting spouses, the wait might be seen as being rather lengthy."
". Mr President, I would like to thank my colleague for the valuable contribution concerning the social policy agenda."
"That agenda is very important to fulfilling the Lisbon criteria and achieving a balance between economic growth and a social Europe."
"I want to indicate the most important areas this agenda should highlight."
"I am convinced that our common work has been successful and that we have formulated a vision and a long-term strategy for a social Europe."
"However, these were the first important steps, and we should now turn written ideas and strategies into practice."
"Let me draw your attention to some important aspects of my opinion."
"First of all, the new agenda is a response to the renewed Lisbon agenda."
"The Socialists view the social policy is one of the cornerstones of the European structure."
"Secondly, we should adopt a new inter-generational approach, incorporating into the agenda a drive to cope with the problems of socially excluded groups – not only the young generation, but also pensioners, disabled people and women."
"Social dialogue is one of the most important of our aims."
"It is a matter of concern that it will be difficult for women’s NGOs to access Community funds, and we believe that a more comprehensive forward-looking framework strategy for gender equality is needed."
"The harmonised objective of regular, comprehensive and detailed statistics is needed in order to monitor the process of the implementation of tasks."
"We are aware of Eurostat figures, but these are based on national statistical data."
"The enormous potential of small- and medium-sized enterprises should be developed and incorporated into the document, since SMEs represent over 90 per cent of enterprises in European economies and 79 per cent of employees belong to SMEs."
"Additional Community programmes are needed, as are national strategies devoted to creating favourable conditions, for example through special programmes."
"This could help greatly to create new jobs."
"I welcome the forthcoming establishment of the European Gender Institute, which will be able to monitor gender conditions in the Member States."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should like to speak about employment."
"Jobs cannot be created without businesses and businesses cannot come into being without entrepreneurs – people with the spirit of initiative and a taste for taking on risk."
"Capacity for initiative depends on a number of factors: such as macro-economic stability, good governance and, most importantly, fostering a widespread entrepreneurial culture that relies on confidence in policies and institutions."
"Confidence, however, is not something that we can lay down in legislation."
"Only those at the top table of decision-making can acquire high levels of confidence in the knowledge-based society."
"This will certainly apply to large financial groups and businesses, but small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which account for over 90% of all European businesses and which employ two thirds of all workers, are placed at a clear disadvantage and will only be able to gain in confidence if they increase in size."
"This will depend on the extent to which they are encouraged to collaborate with universities and centres of excellence in a spirit of active cooperation."
"Those regions that prove to be political driving forces will be able to play the vital role of fostering cooperation of that nature. In so doing they will spread confidence, which is the key ingredient in raising investment and in creating jobs."
"I therefore say that creating more jobs in Europe will depend largely on what happens in the regions."
"Those who turn a blind eye to the fact that Europe’s future lies with the regions and with the SMEs are the same people who call for a reduction in resources for cohesion policies, those proponents of the famous charter calling for a 1% of GDP ceiling in Member States’ contributions to the financial perspective."
"Let no one be in any doubt: if we go down that route there will be neither economic growth nor more jobs in Europe."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for the fact that, in her report, this House is clearly making a strong appeal in favour of an ambitious social agenda for the European Union."
"I think it is very important that we should have this debate in conjunction with the discussion about integrated economic and employment guidelines, because economy and employment are not at odds with a good and socially ambitious policy."
"On the contrary, I would say, protecting employees’ social rights, fighting social exclusion and investing in lifelong learning are essential if we want to give the economy and employment a shot in the arm."
"Commissioner, despite claims by the Commission in your social agenda, there was, in all honesty, no trace whatsoever of social policy during the presentation of the Lisbon strategy, and that is a missed opportunity."
"Further to the discussions in which I have been involved to date surrounding the referendum in France on the Constitution, it is obvious to me that people in Europe, not just in France, are clamouring for the European Union to have more of a social face, and I think that we would do well to step up efforts in that area."
"The Commission set the right tone in its agenda, although it could have done so in a more concrete form and could have given us a little more."
"For example, I think it is right that the Commission should emphasise implementation of, or compliance with, legislation, but, in an enlarged Union, Commissioner, we should also remain ambitious in terms of social goals."
"We still need new legislation."
"Parliament has, for example, for a very long time been asking for a revision of the directive on the European works council or a directive on the protection of employees in the case of individual dismissal."
"The European Union should, in my view, also continue to play a pioneering role with regard to the fight against discrimination, and people with a disability are very much counting on the fact that the European Union will lay down more legislation in this area."
"The Constitution is creating incredibly high expectations in connection with social rights and I urge you, Commissioner, to deliver on them now."
"I think that the European social agenda would benefit from some reinforcement, and I look forward to an excellent interinstitutional dialogue in order to strengthen even more the agenda presented by the Commission."
". – Commissioners, I am pleased that the debates on economic outlook are complex in character."
"Rarely have we discussed how today's Europe is a unique mixture of technologically advanced old members and fast-growing new members, or how this gives us a huge competitive advantage."
"This cultural diversity and intellectual diversity in the world is the most important thing."
"New technologies tend to spread very rapidly, and the leaders will be those who are able to use creative energy more swiftly and effectively."
"In order to use that creative energy and turn our cultural potential and heritage into a competitive advantage, we need to have a clearly defined set of priorities."
"One of the problems with the economic policy of the European Union is that residents and at times even the implementers of that policy become lost in all the priorities, there are so many of them – and we are so willing to do everything at once – that it is difficult to see the road Europe has taken."
"I believe that if we were to define the three main directions in the road we are following, then that would clarify matters for everybody."
"First of all, we should single out the modernisation of the economy and its structures."
"Clearly we want to see a rise in creative industries and the development of new economic branches, and the Lisbon Agenda may help us to achieve that. Clearly we wish to update our knowledge and social structure, as only qualitatively new knowledge and a qualitatively new social environment can release a person's creative energy and enable us to take advantage of our European cultural heritage."
"The third thing we must discuss, and which we are not always willing to debate, is the modernisation of the institutional organisation of the European Union."
"Successful adoption of the new Constitution would allow for such modernisation, although we should probably also discuss the way the Commission itself works, and the way Parliament and all institutions work, as the abundance of programmes and abundance of agencies gives citizens the wrong impression, they simply do not know where to turn."
"The priorities must be not only a reduction in the flow of legislation and a reduction in the administrative burdens for businesses and residents, but a clearer management structure and fund distribution structure."
"These are our priorities."
". Mr President, I would like to comment first of all on the broad economic policy guidelines that we are looking at."
"My Group does not believe that economic growth automatically produces significant employment, nor does it automatically produce sustainable development."
"We feel that this element is too weak in the current proposals."
"We recognise that there are choices to be made in how we try to develop our economies and that the pursuit of competition and more liberalisation is a mistaken path if we really want to make full use of the Lisbon Agenda."
"So we welcome the reintroduction of our amendments on eco-innovation, for example, because we think that is indicative of the choices we have to make if we want to create a sustainably developed economy."
"We also have concerns about the research element within this particular report."
"We do not favour the increase in biotech research if that is going to be looking at embryo stem cell research or GMOs."
"We equally do not accept the inclusion of nuclear energy as part of the Kyoto strategy."
"In fact I think people would probably be extremely shocked if we did."
"Part of the Lisbon Agenda is also social cohesion, a part that is often forgotten, and thus the importance of the social agenda that we are looking at."
"We very much welcome the practical report from Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and the recognition of the need to use all the available talents to really tackle discrimination, whether that be in terms of the gender pay gap, discrimination against black and minority ethnic groups, or in terms of disability or age."
"We support the additional measures advocated in the original report."
"Services of general interest are also crucial as a means of social cohesion and therefore we welcome the recommendation in this report on the need for a framework directive in this area."
"We also welcome the additional moves from the Commission on the social dimension of globalisation, to which we think insufficient attention has been paid."
"We therefore wish for the European Parliament to be fully involved in future work on that."
". – Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, under discussion are key questions in the development of the economic or social situation in all of the Member States of the EU."
"Unfortunately, the vagueness of the broad guidelines for the economic policies of the Member States and of the Community and the restrictive proposals on the Social Agenda fall short of what is required to reinvigorate economic growth, to create the 22 million-plus jobs with rights, thereby the targets set in the Lisbon Agenda, and to promote the social inclusion of the 70 million living below the poverty line."
"At a time when we need a Social Agenda that is genuinely committed to social inclusion, what the Council did at the Spring summit moved in entirely the opposite direction – it restricted the objectives in the area of social inclusion and the fight against poverty to children, sidestepping the fact that it is impossible to help children without changing the situation for adults."
"It also failed to take practical measures to promote and evaluate progress in the area of equality between men and women, for example as regards access to jobs with rights and salaries, where the situation is as bad as, if not worse than, it was."
"The political guidelines continue to move in directions that we know to be wrong."
"The answer should not have been more of the same."
"It is now clear, and in some ways the reports before us acknowledges this fact, that the results of the path we have gone down are not positive."
"The problem is that the correct conclusions are not drawn and we continue to pursue the same policies and measures, still at the mercy of the obsession with price stability and with the adaptability and flexibility of the work force."
"We persist with the liberalisation of both the internal and external markets, now with the spotlight on services and on privatising social security and, worse, pensions."
"The prevailing obsession continues to be with deficit and with the Stability and Growth Pact, when the problem we face is economic, rather than financial."
"The objective is, of course, to facilitate wage moderation and to ensure that productivity gains are passed on to the large economic groups, thereby brushing under the carpet the real scandal that already exists, namely the redistribution of profits, when profits are at their highest level for 25 years."
"The EU must therefore, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, undergo a fundamental change of policy and direction."
". Mr President, I shall make some remarks on the economic policy guidelines."
"We spend a lot of time lamenting the poor performance of the large euro economies, but are economic policy guidelines going to make them perform any better?"
"The guidelines might be better described as a wish list."
"Governments are urged to maintain sound fiscal policies, increase flexibility, hold down wage rises, improve competition, promote research and development and develop a strong industrial base, all worthy things that governments would like to achieve anyway, but do they need the European Union to tell them so?"
"Rather than giving this advice, I have a better plan."
"Get off the backs of individuals and businesses, scrap regulations instead of inventing new ones or tightening existing ones like the bureaucratic controls on financial transactions that we were discussing in this House last night."
"Most of them do not work properly and all of them add costs to business and destroy jobs."
"Unfortunately, making more rules is the only thing that these institutions are good at."
"If we could just leave business alone to generate wealth, the EU’s many programmes, such as caring for the environment and providing a high level of social security, might actually be affordable."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Mato Adrover, on the abundant efforts made in the report, which is a summary of declarations of principle."
"Even though these declarations can be agreed upon in the main, they are at times inconsistent, particularly in their attempts to harmonise increased employment with job development measures, and above all in attempting to reconcile job flexibility with job security, without specifying how this is to be achieved."
"That is why we agree with many of the amendments tabled, which supplement and improve the text."
"This is true, for instance, with regard to Amendments 12, 20 and 23 of the Mato Adrover report."
"The same holds for Amendment 13, tabled by the draftsman Astrid Lulling on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality."
"I believe that the efforts of Parliament will assist in supplementing the original text."
"I nevertheless hope that every necessary step will be taken in the course of the legislative process to reduce job insecurity and to provide social protection guarantees, and that restrictions will be placed on temporary work, whether contract or fixed-term, particularly when workers resort to it repeatedly."
"It is crucial to establish methods for workers to share in the running and in the profits of businesses, which are the best possible means both for improving the quality of work output and for boosting the self-esteem of the workers themselves."
"Mr President, when it comes to the economic guidelines, which we have discussed today in connection with Mr Goebbels’ report, I wish to say how important it is for us never to underestimate the growing competition we see from the Asian economies, as well as from the American ones."
"In ten years’ time, we shall have 800 million average income earners in these countries."
"This will change the economic relationship and make heavy demands upon our ability to exploit this."
"Sometimes, we also overestimate our own ability to cope with this transformation."
"I am sometimes struck by the fact that we forget how many people are in actual fact unemployed in Europe and in the various countries, including those in which we report high employment figures."
"In Sweden, 20–25 per cent of people either are not working or do not have a job to go to, the causes being either absence due to illness, actual unemployment or the large number of people who have taken early retirement."
"This is a social problem, but it is also an economic one in terms of our ability to bring about prosperity because, as was said in this House earlier, it is not growth that creates jobs."
"It is jobs and businesses that create growth."
"We derive hope from the simple fact that we are successful in those countries and those parts of our economies in which we have implemented reforms."
"Within the telecommunications markets, which we have deregulated, we are most successful in those countries whose economies are most deregulated."
"In those countries that have reformed their labour markets, we see better development in terms of employment; and in those countries whose taxes make matters easier for business, we see more enterprise."
"The problem for Europe is not that we have too high interest rates and insufficient stimulation of demand. On the contrary, we have historically low interest rates and, because of these and of high public expenditure, a very heavy burden in terms of providing such stimulation."
"What we need are reforms."
"In the guidelines we have agreed upon in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we emphasise the need for a more flexible labour market, better conditions for business and concentration upon productivity and competitiveness through more open markets."
"We shall therefore support this report and see to it that we win support for the proposals we are introducing into it."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the two rapporteurs and, in particular, Mrs Mato Adrover for her constructive cooperation in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs under quite difficult conditions."
"Allow me firstly to say how helpful I think it is that we have integrated guidelines, because employment policy and economic policy are, in fact, integrated."
"We must also – and this is a factor contributed in our proposals – ensure sustainable development: economic, social and environmental."
"The situation in Europe is not bright at the moment. Growth is too low and unemployment too high."
"When it comes to economic policy, I personally think that we should concentrate more on growth-promoting measures everywhere in Europe in order to get growth under way."
"Stabilisation policy is important, and this is an area in which we have succeeded beyond our expectations. We should now, however, concentrate more upon measures to promote growth."
"We are encountering increased competition in the world."
"The question is one of how we are to cope with it."
"Are we to compete against China and India in terms of poorer working conditions and lower wages?"
"The answer is no."
"We must cope with increased competition through research and development and better job opportunities and through investing in the labour force by developing its skills."
"We shall see instances of restructuring."
"We have seen them before and we shall see them again."
"How we implement them is important."
"It is also important to have companies accept their social responsibility and to involve the employees, have them participate and not place them outside the process."
"If we do not do so, we shall see more demonstrations on the streets."
"The fact of employees participating in the process also leads to better restructuring."
"We must create a labour market in which working life and parenthood can be combined. This means that we cannot have unduly long working times, or rules at European level that permit working times of any length, as that is unfair to one gender."
"We must create conditions in the labour market whereby both men and women can participate in it."
"Finally: unfairly treated groups."
"We must make greater efforts in connection with people who come as refugees to Europe and who are often placed outside the labour market, as well as in connection with disabled people and others so that they too can participate in the labour market to a significantly greater degree."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we find ourselves today discussing a number of proposals and measures linking together social growth, employment and economic growth."
"That means that we are aware of the fact that global competition and current trends are today confronting Europe with significant challenges for its future."
"As regards, more particularly, the document on the Social Agenda and on employment, we are aware that those challenges also seriously test the European social model, in which we often take pride and which we hold up to the world as a feature of a society that has succeeded in simultaneously combining economic growth with industrial and innovative development, whilst additionally maintaining a social model and a strong social dimension of that economic and institutional model."
"In line with what has already been said, I too believe that Europe has to confront those challenges with very clear objectives and extremely effective methods, but also with strong ambition, because if the challenges are great so too must be the ambition."
"I therefore agree with what was said by previous speakers, which is that our Social Agenda must also have an ambitious outlook."
"That means outlining a programme – aimed at citizens, businesses and social partners – which explains that Europe, together with its citizens, wants to create certainty and provide instruments that contribute to promoting confidence and security."
"With regard to the instruments, and in re-examining the Lisbon Strategy again today, we have all understood the importance of integration and of being able to create synergies between our work in support of the development of SMEs and entrepreneurial and industrial innovation, so as to create a more prosperous economic environment, together and in synergy with – not behind or alongside – a social dimension and a social policy."
"I believe that a society is prosperous when it is able to offer opportunities to its citizens."
"I further believe that achieving growth in human capital by assisting the disadvantaged, the chance of new training and employment opportunities for women, and wide-ranging provision of training opportunities for young people, who are today most affected by this element of uncertainty, comprise appropriate instruments for contributing both to social cohesion and to economic growth and prosperity."
"There can be no economically powerful society if there are serious inequalities and differences at its core, and if its human potential is diminishing."
"I therefore believe that the entire social inclusion policy, the policy focusing on female employment and the reference made to young people are key elements in a strongly cohesive social policy and, at the same time, in an economic growth and development policy for our Europe."
"As my fellow group member pointed out, Europe in its new shape must today take steps to reduce its differences, by appealing to every Member State to promote a policy of cohesion and internal integration from this outlook."
"–Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say, before I say anything else, that the integration of economic and employment policy guidelines is a step in the right direction."
"It is, however, mistaken to keep the guidelines for sustainable development separate from them."
"It means that we can do no other than describe integration as having been hamstrung."
"I would now like to discuss the substance of the employment policy guidelines and the report that Mrs Mato Adrover has shown such dedication in drafting."
"In essence, the Commission proposal puts the labour market at the mercy of liberalisation."
"The aim is no longer employment with a living wage and quality jobs, but rather the deregulation of working conditions and wages."
"I cannot understand why there was no outcry when it became known that, in these guidelines, the highest political authority is calling for wages to be kept down."
"I also see it as irresponsible to move towards the abolition of employers’ contributions to workers’ health insurance."
"It is also, I think, a pity that the rapporteur has rejected our proposal for the reintroduction of the fourth pillar of employment policy, that being action to help women gain access to employment."
"Gender mainstreaming is only an important addition to this, rather than a substitute for it."
"In the absence of the fourth pillar, the Member States have abandoned active measures to help women into employment, and that we cannot accept."
"Priority must continue to be given to promoting the employment of women, and I reiterate my urgent appeal to the Members of this House for the reintroduction of the fourth pillar, for it alone ensures that we can monitor how seriously the Member States are taking the advancement of women."
"I ask them to support our Amendment 30."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we all know that the policies and, more importantly, the resources available for promoting the social agenda and active support for employment are inadequate."
"Unfortunately, the midterm review of the Lisbon Strategy and the proposal for the new financial perspectives undermine the importance of the social agenda and give less money to this priority, whereas we need to invest more in knowledge, research, innovation, training and in support for the weakest members of society: persons with disabilities, immigrants and vulnerable groups such as young people, the elderly, women, unskilled workers and the unemployed."
"I should like to thank Mrs Mato Adrover for her excellent work on the question of the guidelines for employment policies."
"The amendments by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs improve the Commission's initial text."
"The amendments proposed by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance call for clearer targets and improve the text still further, which is why we shall support them."
"Mr President, in May of every year, we debate in this Chamber the EU’s economic policy guidelines."
"Today, it looks like it would be more appropriate to talk about ethics rather than the economy."
"There are many things in the Goebbels report with which I can identify."
"I endorse the integration of social policy and concern being expressed about insufficient progress in the area of investments in order to comply with Kyoto."
"This is where Mr Goebbels should have stopped, though."
"I agree with Mrs Lambert that this report goes much too far in one particular area."
"In Modification 12, the rapporteur argues in favour of more objective information about the controversial research into genetically modified organisms and about embryonic stem cell research."
"I think we have better things to do than to promote controversial research."
"To me, it is of the essence that, in stem cell research, the value of human life is central, and this is inconsistent with research on embryos that are destroyed in the process."
"In previously adopted documents, this House has clearly spoken out about the place of stem cell research."
"Consequently, the text of this resolution is not in line with those documents."
"For example, on 10 March, this House adopted a resolution about the trade in human egg cells, and paragraph 15 of this resolution emphatically specifies that embryonic stem cell research can be left to the Member States, where that is permitted."
"The Member State ‘can’ do this research, but does not need to."
"That is a clear distinction that is lacking in this resolution."
"I will withhold my support for this resolution if Mrs Van den Burg’s Modification 12 and Amendment 24 are adopted as they are."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has made a great many appropriate, intelligent and rational proposals."
"Unfortunately, it has failed to make any reference in its proposal to the issue that is of most importance to the citizens of the new Member States, namely genuinely equal rights in employment."
"Those citizens of the new Member States who take a serious and earnest approach to European integration cannot and indeed will not tolerate a situation in which 12 of the old EU Member States, with the exception of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden, continue to treat people from the new Member States, such as Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, like second-class citizens."
"They are given jobs, but only in the black economy."
"They manage to earn money, but a great deal less than the residents of the pre-enlargement EU as it was before May 2004."
"The Council should not bury its head in the sand and hope that this problem will go away."
"This matter does not fall under the jurisdiction of the Commission, but of the Council."
"A full and immediate liberalisation of labour markets really would revolutionise the EU economy, and prove to the citizens of the new EU Member States that there is no such thing as a first-class Europe and a second-class Europe."
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate Mr Goebbels on his report."
"It makes essential remarks on where European decision-makers need to concentrate their efforts in the coming years."
"I wish to pick up on a few points mentioned in the report."
"First, it is the big eurozone countries that are in serious need of reform."
"Last week’s elections in Germany and the forthcoming referendum in France are sending strong signals that voters are unhappy with their governments’ handling of the economy."
"Another important signal: Finland now has the lowest real interest rates in Europe, historically beating even the traditional yardstick, Germany, in the price of capital."
"Reform is the key to European competitiveness and employment growth."
"Collective wage negotiations should be reformed to take greater account of productivity growth."
"The entry of women into the job market also needs to be enhanced."
"I would also like to express my strong support for the amendments tabled to the report by my colleague, Mr Hökmark, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group."
"We must continue to emphasise the importance of reducing unemployment by strengthening growth and increasing investment and competition, the level of service and the range of choices available to citizens."
"Entrepreneurship should be encouraged, for example through a fiscal framework favourable to SMEs, and equal opportunities should be offered to both women and men."
"The idea of a flexible and secure labour market open to all citizens is an excellent one."
"We must not allow our stagnating rules and practices to hinder those who are willing to work from entering or staying in the labour market."
"Europe needs people willing to work today, and increasingly so in the years to come."
"We should encourage our citizens to work by reforming our tax systems, for example by reducing the burden on low-wage earners."
"I hope the Commission will take the points made by Parliament seriously."
"Mr President, as various colleagues in my group have already said, we are all for the integrated approach to these guidelines."
"I should add, though, that this should not lead to a superficial discussion, but that it is very important to do more than scratch the surface and, particularly, to give the specialist committee a role in its specific field."
"In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we in our group emphasise the need for stronger economic coordination, and I should also like to ask Commissioner Almunia to examine how we can inject more coherence into the discussion of these packages of guidelines and annual budgetary reports about convergence in the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"A third point I should like to make is that it is important to give the European Parliament a fully-fledged role in these processes and, in terms of procedures, also to ensure that we are given sufficient time and space for our contribution in the next few years."
"Although this is more a technical question of procedures and schedules, I hope that we can make sound agreements next year, because these matters turned out to be somewhat problematical this year."
"I think this is important from a content point of view, because I think that you, as the Commission, have Parliament much more on your side in the search for a real European perspective."
"Finally, I worry about the way in which the Council still uses this European perspective as a guiding principle only on a few occasions, and I would like to ask the Commission to look into this."
"In this case, I would particularly like to address Mr Spidla, because I was extremely vexed by the way in which a position we adopted last time in the plenary about the Working Hours Directive was handled; this was immediately followed by a reaction that was very negative towards Parliament’s position and that very much pandered to a veto by one Member State that had added a few other Member States to the Working Hours Directive dossier."
"I think that this is not the way the Commission should deal with Parliament."
"Mr President, I think it was wrong to assert that the integrated guidelines, which we are debating in this House today, would, once and for all, give a boost to business and employment within the European Union."
"Yet again, the guidelines give priority to the governance of the markets, which has one thing above all others in mind, that being to ensure that workers, in whatever sector, meet market requirements."
"In no way can this do anything to resolve the structural problems of society and the economy."
"It is evident from political crises, such as that which Germany is undergoing, that these instruments do not work and have failed."
"I do not see in the least why the combination of previously useless instruments should, suddenly and on its own, help to achieve a real breakthrough as regards job creation and economic growth within the European Union."
"I therefore ask, as a matter of urgency, that thought be again given to the principles involved."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unemployment in the EU’s Member States has virtually quadrupled since the beginning of the 1970s, and temporary employment agencies are becoming the principal employers in many countries."
"The onward march of globalisation is robbing us of jobs on a massive scale, and, after a downturn, the number of unemployed never falls back to the level it was at before recession struck."
"Productive sectors such as agriculture, mining and heavy industry are being marginalised to an increasing degree."
"What we are left with is the services sector, which is not likely to be enough in the long term, and in which almost 67% of the entire workforce now work."
"If, though, purchasing power continues to fall, there will be a continuing downward spiral, and there is no doubt that the problems we already have with social protection will become even more acute."
"This leads me to wonder to what extent the ongoing privatisation of public services, for example the railways and the postal service, which has not produced all the results that had been hoped for, will turn out to have been a grave mistake."
"Infrastructure ranks, in any case, alongside qualified workers as a factor that makes Europe attractive as a business location."
"The idea that low taxes and wage dumping will bring us closer to the virtually full employment we have set ourselves as a goal strikes me as highly questionable."
"Mr President, I do not intend to take up too much time talking about the measures in the two reports that we are discussing."
"I agree one hundred percent with the comments made by Mr Hökmark."
"I would like, Mr President, to focus for a moment on the analysis."
"Europe is not working well."
"Mr Goebbels has not wished to rub salt in the wounds, he has given a rosy view of the situation and so has Mr Almunia."
"He says that the conditions are in place for Europe to work properly, but the population knows that it is not going well."
"The enormous pessimism amongst all our populations has been very visible in the debates that are currently taking place in relation to the referenda in France and in the Netherlands."
"We are growing less than the United States, we are creating less employment, we are less productive and we are very far from achieving the Lisbon objectives."
"This enormous pessimism has led our populations to express perfectly understandable fears."
"How are we going to deal with the challenges of globalisation?"
"How are we going to deal with the competition from the emerging countries?"
"We are currently discussing the problem of the textile sector and competition from Eastern countries will soon bring further problems."
"How are we going to prevent the relocation of companies?"
"How are we going to deal with the challenge of immigration?"
"How are we going to safeguard a welfare state threatened by the ageing of the population?"
"These fears are increasing because the response of the institutions has been weak."
"We have discussed the Stability and Growth Pact – and we are continuing to do so – and we should make it very clear that we have reached a situation of mass non-compliance, a kind of amnesty, and we have ignored the strictest rules for ensuring budgetary stability."
"We are incapable of establishing the financial perspectives and all the signs are that we want to spend less money on the Union. With less money, we will not create more Europe, but rather less Europe."
"As my colleagues have pointed out, we are a very long way from implementing the reforms we need to make."
"This Parliament has sent a good message by bringing together the two reports we are debating today and trying to eliminate discrepancies so that the message is clear."
"It now falls to the Commission and the Council to oblige the Member States to comply with what is decided here."
"It is true that we are going to discuss the national programmes when they are drawn up, but I hope that the Commission is not content simply to be a letter box nor that it restrict itself to politely praising the national programmes, but that it will demand that the States demonstrate courage, determination and audacity, which is what is needed in order to put an end to the enormous pessimism that I have intended to describe here."
"Mr President, Commissioners, let me remark on three points."
"The first concerns methodology."
"The European Parliament is fully aware of the importance of national ownership with regard to the matters under discussion."
"This is why, on 25 April, we organised a meeting with our colleagues from the national parliaments."
"I believe this was a first which ought to be repeated if this is to be a real policy debate on the broad guidelines defined at the European level in association with the Member States and applied by the Member States themselves."
"Still on the subject of method, you will be aware that there is uneasiness on the part of Parliament, which fears that it will not always be able to contribute to the formulation and adoption of these broad guidelines because of the session calendar."
"I hope that we shall arrive at a satisfactory agreement on this point for the future."
"My second remark concerns the general climate."
"Confidence cannot be created to order, and it is absent at the present time."
"We can therefore talk as much as we like about structural reforms, but they will be unwelcome; the public will not accept them in the present climate."
"The first priority is to rekindle growth, and with growth restored we shall be able to tackle the necessary structural reforms."
"I should like to say to my honourable colleague Mrs Kauppi, and I am sure she knows this, that the reform issue is not the same for large and small countries."
"This fact of life must also underlie all our plans for our collective entity."
"When the OECD sends signals to the European Central Bank and the ECB responds as it just has done, it is time to express concern about the nature of the macroeconomic debate at the European level."
"My third remark is that, in the prevailing climate, this instrument of ours, the broad economic policy guidelines, should be the basic assessmenttool."
"All too often, however, the guidelines appear to be empty words that are not followed by action."
"We must make these guidelines a rigorous instrument for the coordination of economic policies if the Lisbon strategy is to prove successful and if we are to avoid the sort of bland appraisal we used to receive before the revision of the strategy."
"The broad guidelines are a support instrument for the overall strategy, but they will serve no useful purpose if they are not bolstered by a reform of the Stability and Growth Pact which grasps the nettle as well as by a Financial Perspective that serves to finance solidarity for the benefit of everyone."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the need for us to do something about our economic, social and environmental policies is not a matter of doubt; it is because some things need to be changed if the good is to be maintained that we need to adapt all three of these policy areas to the new demands made upon them, thereby enabling risks to be minimised and opportunities seized."
"A new independence is what is needed."
"While we have to ensure that the shackles are taken off and bureaucracy cut down, the necessary protection mechanisms must remain in place; it must be made easier to set companies up, there must be more research, and the internal market needs to become a reality."
"What does rather sadden me is the feeling I get that, over the last weeks and months, the Member States and the various political families in this House have not – unlike the Commission – been using economic and employment policy guidelines to bring business and labour together, but have instead, in debate, been resorting to the old-style models of class warfare, with employers on one side, workers on the other; social protection mechanisms on the one hand and liberalisation on the other."
"This will not enable us to resolve the issues and give people greater confidence in the political decision-making process."
"We see the market not as an end in itself, but as a means to an end."
"We must nevertheless make it more competitive; we aim to increase competitiveness, create jobs and take our environmental responsibilities seriously."
"Far from inevitably hampering competition, good social and environmental policies can help make us more competitive, promote growth and create new jobs."
"This leads me to say that it is because it secures fundamental social rights that we need the Constitution."
"We need to get rid of unanimity on matters of fiscal policy."
"We need to complete the internal market."
"The European Union needs fundamental social rights and basic standards if there is to be more liberality and a more market-oriented economy, for, rather than throwing the baby out with the bathwater, we want to breathe new life into the model of the environmentally-responsible social market economy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, there is a lack of growth in Europe, and I now see that even the OECD’s economic managers are saying the same thing clearly and unambiguously."
"Anyone who concerns themselves seriously with Europe from an economic point of view can see this."
"In reality, Europe is not so badly placed when it comes to our export markets."
"We are the region of the world that, in terms of exports, has acquitted itself better than the United States and Japan in recent years."
"I am not saying that this is good enough."
"What I am, however, saying is that this is not the most important problem, and I am saying that the most important problem right now is that there is insufficient growth in Europe’s internal economy or internal market. Moreover, such growth does not come about of its own accord."
"It does not come about through reforms that do not go all the way and that do not have the confidence and support of our populations."
"Such growth only comes about through a combination of modern reforms that, instead of causing countries to compete in reducing social benefits, is couched in human terms and takes the form of a more modern and socially active labour market policy, combined with coordinated investments."
"You have presented a sound economic programme, Commissioner Almunia."
"I am able to assent to everything contained in it."
"All I should like to say is that I should very much like to see an additional dimension."
"What I should dearly like to hear come out of the economic guidelines is a constructive message to all the Member States, saying ‘let us now, together and in each individual country, invest in the Lisbon Objectives over the next three or four years, and let us do so at one and the same time’, for doing so simultaneously would be Europe’s secret weapon."
"In that way, we could make use of our economic independence from one another and combine social protection with economic competitiveness and sound growth."
"That is something that we in the Nordic countries have demonstrated and that we can extend throughout Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in several respects the EU economy is further away from its goal of becoming the world’s most competitive economy than was the case in 2000."
"The continued under-performance of the EU economy is a result of the fact that its labour input remains comparatively low, particularly in the case of young people and older workers."
"A further problem is the low level of productivity growth, which is due to a slowdown in the rate of technological progress and innovation and a slow take-up of information and communications technologies."
"In this context, the European Union and its Member States should put the emphasis on investment in knowledge."
"The realisation of a knowledge society, based upon human capital, education, research and innovation policies, is necessary to boost our growth potential and to prepare for the future."
"Europe needs to invest more in human capital and life-long learning for the benefit of individuals, businesses and society as a whole."
"We must not forget that knowledge-based economies require different skills from traditional industries, and that these skills constantly need updating in the face of technological change and innovation."
"If they are to remain in work and climb the career ladder, employees need to renew their knowledge and skills regularly."
"Education and training systems must therefore meet the needs of the economy."
"Knowledge accumulated through investment in research and development, innovation and education is a key driver of long-run growth."
"Yet the draft budget for 2007-2013 presented by the Luxembourg presidency involves drastic cuts to spending on science, research, education and transport."
"These cuts would amount to a drop in funding of over 40% in relation to the original proposal, or in other words of EUR 50 billion."
"In my opinion, we should not set ourselves ambitious goals if we subsequently fail to secure the necessary funding for them."
". Mr President, at this final point in the debate I would like once again to thank the rapporteurs, in particular the rapporteur for the broad economic policy guidelines, Mr Goebbels, for the excellent work they have done."
"I believe that many more positive contributions have been made during the debate on these reports."
"I would like to comment on a specific element of the procedure."
"It is the case that this year the time scales for the debate, in order for the Commission and Council to take account of Parliament’s opinion expressed in these reports, have been particularly short, but this is due to the beginning of the cycle and the very tight timetable available to all the institutions in order to begin this new cycle of coordination of economic policies, within the context of a review of the Lisbon Strategy."
"I am confident that next year the time scales will be longer and we will all be able to work much more effectively and the opinions of Parliament will undoubtedly be taken into account."
"Secondly, I believe that the speeches have demonstrated that there is a very broad basic consensus on three requirements necessary for the whole of the European Union to increase its economic growth, its growth potential and, therefore, its ability to create more employment and to make progress towards all the Lisbon Strategy objectives."
"We must improve the quality of public finances, we must improve the quality of public spending — and in this regard I agree with some of the contributions and comments made — we must introduce the dimension of sustainability into public actions, into structural reforms and into public accounts — as several Members have mentioned — but we must also maintain the principle that we need budgetary discipline and healthy public finances, because without them none of the other objectives can be achieved."
"This approach includes the review of the Lisbon Strategy, the reform of the Stability Pact, which we are going to discuss in this Parliament in a few days time, and also, I hope, as from the European Council in June, the new financial perspectives for 2007-2013."
"Allow me to make a final comment: as has been said, it is the case that structural reforms are difficult to launch and implement in an environment of low growth, but it is also the case that the countries that are growing most are the countries that have carried out reforms, as has been said in the debate."
"Let us not therefore turn this debate into an attempt the square the circle: we must achieve more growth and the reforms are an essential element, we will have to decide what must be reformed and how it must be reformed, but there is no question that we need reforms, that we need to improve the functioning of the market in goods and the labour market, to improve the quality of public accounts and to incorporate more research, development, innovation and knowledge into public actions."
"The way to combine the necessary forms and the necessary acceptance of those reforms cannot be written in a communication, but rather it is a political element of political leadership."
". Ladies and gentlemen, the message that Mr Almunia and I will take away from this debate is that there is a broad consensus of mainstream opinion on the Commission’s proposals."
"I believe that it would be useful to highlight a number of key approaches that emerged clearly from the debate, and I would add that these are in fact present in the Commission’s proposals, albeit in different form."
"The first of these is that if Europe is to be able to compete successfully on the global market, it must be competitive in terms of quality."
"Our competitiveness must not be based on low wages or factors of scale, but on the growth of innovation, science and development, as well as on skills development, or, to use the jargon, the development of what is termed ‘human capital’."
"The second point that emerges quite clearly, and that has been acknowledged during the debate, is that we need an overall or coordinated approach."
"Such an approach would make allowance for the fact that the issues with which we are dealing form a complex whole, and that the individual parts of this whole must not be taken out of context in the hope of achieving some sort of success."
"Furthermore, it goes without saying that whilst the Commission is convinced that the key issue at stake is quality-based competitiveness with a view to growth, it emerges quite clearly from the strategy for growth and employment that the Commission does not take it as read that growth on its own is the answer to everything, or that there is no need for it to be accompanied by other proactive policies."
"In my opinion, the debate as a whole has demonstrated that extremely complex questions can be asked about the extent to which the proposals that have been presented speak for everyone."
"As I see it, it is quite obvious that this is an issue that is always open to debate."
"Furthermore, I am sure that the debate in this House will result in improvements to the final versions of these EU strategic documents, as the latter pursue two goals."
"The first, of course, is to formulate a coherent policy that reflects our values, one of which is the promotion of a socially cohesive and economically productive society whose members have a high quality of life."
"In my opinion, there can be no one who would dispute this goal."
"At the same time as searching for ways in which we can draft effective strategic documents, however, our second goal is to shape a common European will, and indeed this is something that has frequently been mentioned in this Chamber."
"This would enable us to work together and in harmony towards goals that derive from our values and to overcome the problems with which life confronts us."
"Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission I can assure you that we will do everything in our power to ensure that due consideration will be given to the outcome of the debate in this House in the final documents, which will be debated by the Council in early June."
"Mr President, several speakers have asked Mr Špidla about the Working Time Directive and the way he dealt with Parliament’s position in the last plenary."
"I did not hear a response on that."
"Mrs van den Burg, we cannot turn the debate into a fresh debate."
"I can only allow you to take the floor again if it concerns a point of order."
". There is no disputing the fact that the Working Time Directive is an extremely important document, and I believe that I acted with the utmost responsibility in setting out my views during the previous debate on this Directive."
"One of the distinguishing features of the European model of integration is the search for a complex compromise between the European institutions, the Member States, Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"I am prepared to play my part to ensure that future debates on this Directive result in a compromise that will succeed in gaining the broadest possible support, and this will in fact be my greatest challenge."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"I speak on behalf of the New Italian Socialist Party."
"As reformists, we wish to highlight some of which, in our opinion, must be the guidelines for action."
"First of all, policies must be promoted in order to enable simpler and fairer mechanisms for access to, and permanence and participation in the labour market, particularly for those groups – young people, women, disabled people, immigrants and minorities in general – that have greater difficulty today in integrating in the production system."
"Safety at work policies must be implemented and harmonised, reducing health risksall too often newspaper articles describe unthinkable events for our European society."
"Equal treatment must be promoted with practical measures."
"Education and training schemes must be constantly adapted and updated in line with market needs, which evolve and change in a continual and dynamic way."
"Finally, the promotion of good industrial relations must be guaranteed by means of improved information and worker consultation, in addition to making provision for greater and more effective interaction and cooperation with trade union partners, enabling genuine social and territorial cohesion."
"As much as has already been done, very much more remains still to do in order to lay the foundations for constructing a fairer and more objective ‘European system’."
"Ladies and gentlemen, please sit down and take down those placards."
"This is neither the time nor the place to express your support in that way."
"I would ask you to respect the Rules of Procedure, to sit down and to take down those placards."
"If you do not take them down, I shall order this Parliament’s security services to do so."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Mr President, in my capacity as rapporteur, I should simply like to remind the House what is at stake in this second reading of a draft regulation on statistics, the aim of which is to establish a European framework for the compiling and transmission of quarterly non-financial accounts by institutional sector."
"This will be an important instrument for the conduct of monetary policy in the euro area – and I hope you are all committed to the single currency – and for the monitoring of Member States’ economic policies."
"At the first reading last year, on 30 March 2004, the European Parliament proposed only one amendment, which was designed to clarify the fifth recital."
"I should like to emphasise that these accounts of the European institutions will be integrated into the accounts for the relevant area, be it the eurozone or the whole European Union."
"The Council, which has taken ages over this – more than a year – has also introduced an amendment, relating only to Article 2."
"A common position was finally adopted on 8 March 2005, thanks to the Luxembourg presidency, which instilled a long-overdue sense of urgency."
"It is nevertheless appalling that the Council has taken a year to present us with its common position on a draft regulation to which Parliament and the Council each made only one amendment."
"Since the single currency has been in place for a number of years, the European Union should arm itself with instruments that enable it to collect, at less than yearly intervals, statistics covering all transactions in each of the major sectors."
"The Council has adopted our amendment, and I urge the House to adopt the common position, as the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has unanimously recommended, so that this regulation can enter into force."
"The scheduled date is the first of June 2005."
"Given the complete lack of respect you have shown during Mrs Lulling’s speech, I must call all the honourable Members to order."
"Please be quiet."
"Sit down and remained composed since we are going to vote and we must not have Members moving around in the aisles."
"Otherwise, we will not know who is voting and who is not voting."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the new agreement on relations between Parliament and the Commission lies before you."
"If you vote in favour of it, you will be helping to build up the cooperation between the two institutions, and also giving the right response to yesterday’s destructive debate, which was aimed at wrecking it."
"I wish to thank all those who, over the past six months, have hammered out this agreement, for this stage itself reinforces Parliament’s rights, both as a legislative and a budgetary authority."
"This stage – which has not been put on merely for show, but has been a transparent procedure – has also clarified the political responsibilities of the President and Members of the Commission."
"I regard this agreement as a real leap forward, in that it ushers in a new culture of cooperation, one that works towards transparent work processes, embodies mutual respect for the functions of our institutions and wants the European Union’s policymaking to be characterised by constructive dialogue."
"I ask you to vote in favour of its adoption."
"Ladies and gentlemen, before the signature of this Interinstitutional Agreement that Parliament has just approved and that President Barroso and myself are going to sign, I would like to congratulate the Commission and Parliament on having reached this framework agreement — which is the fourth — that establishes the foundations for our cooperation."
"I believe that, as a result of this Agreement, the transparency of the work of both institutions will be increased."
"It also enhances the role of our Parliament as a control body and a democratic expression of the European Union and, therefore, also enhances the democratic legitimacy of our common project and better defines the political responsibility of the Commission."
"It is now clear that, notwithstanding the principle of collegiality, each member of the Commission is responsible for the fields that fall within their competence."
"It is stipulated that, in the event that there is a new member of the Commission, they must attend a hearing before the European Parliament before commencing their duties."
"And it is also laid down that, every three months, the President of the Commission or the Vice-President responsible for relations with this Parliament will meet with the presidents of the political groups in order to ensure that there is permanent dialogue between our institutions."
"Beyond the letter of the Agreement, however, our intention through this agreement is to maintain constant cooperation in Parliament’s legislative actions, which must take the form of a clear strategy and better results."
"We will immediately be able to ascertain the extent to which the spirit of this Agreement will also govern the actions of our institutions."
"They operate in a complex manner and sometimes their decisions oblige us to take one route or another in a way that to a certain extent predetermines the result."
"We will soon see this, for example, in the case of the events involving the working time Directive that this Parliament recently approved by an absolute majority."
"The decisions taken by the Commission in this regard will determine the procedure to be followed and, to a certain extent, will also predetermine the result."
"The Agreement we are signing today, notwithstanding its letter, is intended to strengthen democracy in the European Union’s operation, something that the European citizens are unquestionably calling for."
"Thank you very much to everybody and congratulations on this Agreement."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted with the result of the parliamentary vote."
"By virtue of our common resolve, Parliament and the Commission now have a renewed instrument which opens up new vistas of cooperation and joint activity."
"This agreement covers all the points dear to our institutions, points which are at the heart of European democracy, namely the political accountability of the Commission to Parliament and transparency and cooperation in the legislative and budgetary fields as well as in international relations."
"We have strengthened the role of both institutions."
"We have shown that the European institutions are capable of concerted action in a spirit of fair and fruitful cooperation in full accordance with the existing treaties."
"The Commission has made good the intention I have had since the start of our terms of office, namely to establish constructive collusion and sustainable strategic partnership with the European Parliament."
"I am happy to be able to sign this agreement with you, Mr President, in the presence of my Vice-President, Mrs Wallström, who is responsible for relations with Parliament."
"On behalf of the Commission, I express my firm belief that this agreement represents another step forward in the collaboration between our institutions on the construction of Europe."
"Mr President, as I have to make an objection to the order of the vote regarding Article 3a and Article 4, I ask whether I should do so now or wait for the vote on Amendment 29."
"The order of the vote has been fixed for some time, but we shall take your point when we get to the relevant part of the vote."
". Mr President, although I have not requested to speak, I should like to point out to Members the possible reintroduction of Article 4, which reinstates the nutrient profiles that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in contrast decided to scrap."
"I strongly recommend the approval of this amendment insofar as it serves to restore meaning to the regulation as a whole."
"Mr President, I will not comment on the merits of this amendment, but I would just like to point out that to vote first on this new Article 3, dealing with Amendments 99 and 32, is perhaps acceptable from a formal point of view, but not from a substantive point of view, insofar as the new Article 3 is nothing but a new version, a ruse to reintroduce the contents of Article 4."
"That is a fact, and so much so that if, for instance, you had the courage – or the misfortune – to read Amendment 99 and compare it with Amendment 88, you would see that they are identical, save for a small detail regarding the dates."
"I therefore think it more appropriate to vote on the amendments to Article 4 as such, and only afterwards, and if required, to address those relating to the new Article 3, which seeks to replace Article 4 through the back door."
"The amendments have been tabled in due form and I shall leave it to the wisdom of the House."
"Mr President, thank you for allowing me to intervene at this point;"
"I realise there are a lot of votes to get through."
"It is important to note the uniqueness of this particular resolution."
"It relates to an agreement between both sides of the rail industry, employers and unions, and is the first such agreement representing 95 per cent of the workers and the employers in that industry."
"Strictly speaking, Parliament has no direct role in the matter; it is a matter for the Council to approve."
"But I am hopeful that if we can get overwhelming support for it here today the Council will, as a matter of urgency, adopt it without further delay."
"It is an important initiative and we should encourage not only the rail industry but also other sectors of industry to adopt this kind of social partner agreement on working conditions for employees."
"I should like to propose an oral amendment to Amendment 42."
"I would ask that the following phrase, which I shall read out in English:"
"‘… to look at the Russian attitude to any Member State, and the new EU Member States in particular, as a test of the Russian goodwill in relation to the European Union.’"
"be replaced by the following phrase, which I shall again read out in English:"
"‘… show solidarity and unity within the EU between the old and the new Member States alike in the event of Russia aiming to differentiate its approach towards them.’"
"This highlights the importance of the principle of solidarity in EU foreign policy."
"I would therefore urge Members to support this amendment to Amendment 42."
". Mr President, in order to make it conform to recent events, I wish to propose an oral amendment to the first part of Amendment 7, which reads as follows: ‘reiterates its call for Russia to ratify the recently concluded border agreement with Estonia, and to sign and ratify the border agreement with Latvia without further delay’."
"The rest is unchanged."
"Mr President, I wish to insert a new paragraph after paragraph 31 concerning Russia’s very outdated current social security legislation."
"This legislation provides for Russian military action in the Baltic States that are in the European Union and guarantees for the Russian military to be used for this."
"This Russian legislation was passed in 1993."
"It has since been amended several times."
"The last time was in 2003, but the Baltic States are still mentioned in the legislation as a site for possible Russian military action."
"I regret that the reply I received from the Commission was very weak."
"If Parliament is to be more consistent in its position on such absurdity, your support is required."
"The text of the oral amendment is as follows: ‘Suggests that Russia delete from its existing social security legislation the reference to the Baltic States as an area where the Russian military may even now be deployed and harmed in armed conflict;’"
"I ask for your support."
"Mr President, my oral amendment is as follows: ‘Calls for the conclusion of an agreement between the LUKOIL company, controlled by the Russian Government, and the Lithuanian Government on guarantees of compensation in the event of an environmental catastrophe at the D-6 oil drilling facility near the Curonian Peninsula, a UNESCO World Culture Heritage Site;’"
"Mr President, I wish to propose that we insert the word ‘German’ before the word ‘Nazi’, so that it would read ‘German Nazi’."
"Mr President, the oral amendment concerns a change in paragraph 14 concerning one word."
"Instead of ‘should’, it should read ‘can’."
"I will read the text out for you: ‘Points out that the Member States and the Union institutions enjoy a special right to bring actions before the Court in the interests of the law and takes the view that Parliament , using that means, defend the rights of citizens in cases where fundamental rights might be affected by a Union act;’."
"The PSE Group wants to take Amendment 6 as an addition to paragraph 5."
"Are there any objections?"
"Mr President, we do not want Amendment 6 to be an addition to paragraph 5, we want it to replace paragraph 5."
"We would like to vote for that."
"My Group will be voting for Amendment 6 to replace the text of paragraph 5."
"I hope I have clarified the situation."
"This will be for the prosperity of Europe."
"Mr President, if Mr Hökmark and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats do not want this to be an addition, may I ask the House to vote against Mr Hökmark’s amendment."
"Mr President, I wish to notify the House that there is a mistake on the voting list as to where Amendment 24 splits."
"We wanted to split the text so as to delete the word ‘biotechnology’."
"So we end after ‘preventive healthcare’."
"Mr President, this is not really a point of order."
"I just want to draw the House’s attention to Amendment 8, which calls for services of general interest to be excluded from the requirement of notification under state aid policy."
"We actually adopted a report on this matter in February – as a matter of fact it was my own report – and this amendment would be exactly the opposite of the conclusions of that report, which was adopted with a solid majority."
"Thank you very much for your comments, Mrs in 't Veld, we take note of them."
". Strong economic performance requires the most accurate information currently available on the various economic indicators, whilst of course respecting the right to privacy."
"As this report meets some of these needs, I voted in favour."
"The June List believes that a one-year extension to the five-year programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship is undesirable. The programme does not have the cross-border character required if one is to believe that the principle of subsidiarity has been respected."
"It should be the Member States’ responsibility to, if they so wish, facilitate small and medium-sized enterprises’ access to funding and venture capital, as well as to assist them with information about EU legislation, European standards and cooperation partners."
"It is very important that small businesses around Europe be able to feel their way to different solutions in accordance with the principle of institutional competition."
"In order not to incur the costs of an extended programme, we are voting against the report."
". The multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), was initially planned to run from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2005."
"This programme is the key element in the Community’s policy to promote entrepreneurship and to support innovation in European SMEs. I therefore voted in favour of this report, which advocates extending the programme until 31 December 2006 and highlights the need to increase the annual appropriation to EUR 91 million."
"These measures will improve coordination between the multiannual programme, its successor – the ‘Framework Programme for Competitiveness and Innovation’ (CIP) – and the Seventh Research Framework Programme."
"It is important to maintain and extend support to entrepreneurs and SMEs in Europe because they are the backbone of Europe's economy; if we are to achieve the Lisbon objectives they must continue to grow."
"The financial instruments in the existing programme must also be kept in place, as they largely cover the needs of the new Member States, and restricting funds will hamper those countries from integrating into the European economy."
"In light of the results of the programme before us, and of the broad agreement on the proposal to increase the appropriation, I voted in favour. Furthermore, I sincerely believe that this programme will have a positive effect in terms of increasing competitiveness and entrepreneurial innovation."
". Within the framework of the financial perspective for 2007-2013, the EU has set up a 'Framework Programme for Competitiveness and Innovation' (CIP) for enterprise and entrepreneurship and to support innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)."
"In order to bridge the gap between the existing programmes, which finish in 2005, and this new framework programme, Parliament has increased its support to EUR 91 million for 2006."
"I welcome this initiative because the SMEs are the backbone of the European economy and a key element in achieving the Lisbon objectives."
"If the EU is to be more competitive, achieve economic growth and create jobs, the entrepreneurial skills of the SMEs must be harnessed."
"In order to fully achieve its potential the EU must adopt initiatives to make entrepreneurship more attractive."
"This range of measures must involve, , fostering a culture of entrepreneurship, allaying the fears attached to risk-taking and setting up a simple and efficient administrative framework."
"Despite the fact that evaluations of the programmes supporting the SMEs found that the intended objectives were met, it is important to step up coordination between the future CIP and the Structural Funds, against a backdrop of regional development, established by means of partnerships between local and regional players."
"The report takes offence at the fact that the European Parliament was neither consulted nor informed about the measures concerning Europol’s work and organisation and demands that the Council take measures to increase democratic control by involving Parliament."
"The June List believes that increased democratic, legal and budget-related control of Europol is desirable, but, because the Europol Convention is a form of intergovernmental cooperation, it is the national parliaments that should exercise this control and not the European Parliament."
"We have therefore voted against the report."
". In light of the Court of Justice judgment that Community institutions have exclusive competence in this area, and given the need for regulation and agreement, I am in favour of the report before us."
". As I am in favour of the crux of this report, which is of significant importance to an effective fisheries policy, I must express my agreement with the proposed change to the timeframe, in order that the programme can meet its objectives."
"I therefore voted in favour."
". We believe that the European Union’s fishing agreement policy must be reviewed."
"Over-exploitation of fishing waters pushes people in developing countries into ever greater poverty and robs the marine environment of a vital link in the food chain."
"We believe that, if the EU concludes a fishing agreement with a third country, the total amount of the financial compensation for this country must be provided by those EU Member States whose fishing vessels utilise the opportunities supplied by the agreement in question."
"Those Member States must then each themselves decide whether they, in their turn, are to fund this expenditure by deducting taxes on their respective fishing vessels."
"That is a position adopted on grounds of principle by the June List when it comes to the EU’s fishing agreements with third countries."
"There are individual amendments by Parliament that are commendable, for example wordings concerning the sustainable management of fishery resources."
"These proposals are, however, extremely limited."
". We voted in favour of this report, in order to ensure fishing opportunities for Community fleets, including the five longliners, in these waters until 30 June 2007."
"The last protocol expired on 30 June 2003 and was extended for a further year."
"This agreement provides for financial compensation of around EUR 1 million, fishing rights of 9 000 tonnes per year, 1 300 GT per month for demersal species and work for 48 French, Spanish and Portuguese vessels."
"The Commission drew up a cost/benefit assessment of this agreement, which concluded that the protocol was a sizeable subsidy to the EU tuna fleets in these waters; it led to a value-added of EUR 1.7 million."
"The value-added for the Côte d'Ivoire economy was estimated to be EUR 2.5 million."
"Nevertheless, despite the commendable concern for the sustainability of fisheries in Côte d’Ivoire and for protecting local traditional fishing, this protocol has – apart from the tuna seiners – been under-used, which is also indicative of the current state of the Community’s distant fleets, especially in Portugal."
"It is imperative that an assessment be carried out of this situation, and of the distribution of fishing opportunities."
"As I have said on numerous occasions, the issue of fisheries is of special importance to Portugal. Defending national interests is therefore at the forefront of my ideas on this report."
"Given that fishing opportunities for five surface longliners has been maintained, I feel that this interest has been duly protected, and therefore voted in favour."
". I agree with the rapporteur’s position as regards the objective of simplifying the financing structure in order to make funding more efficient and transparent."
"I share her doubts as to whether financial management will in fact be simplified in future."
"Two financial management systems with differences in terms of mode of payment and commitment of funds will have to be set up, and the Member States will also have to provide additional documentation. Administrative operations will consequently need to be adapted, and this may be counterproductive for farmers and for all those involved in the process of rural development."
"The crux of the issue with regard to common agricultural policy funding comes under the heading of ‘modulation/degressivity’, in terms of the criteria and the amounts to be transferred to the two funds – the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development."
"The ongoing debate in Parliament and the Council on the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 does not envisage any change in these aspects; quite the opposite in fact."
"The amounts so far put forward are indicative of pressure from the bigger countries as regards their financial contribution, and effectively put paid to a cohesion policy and a common agricultural policy that protects food sovereignty, small and medium-sized farmers and the rural world."
"Portugal and small and medium-sized farmers stand to lose out most from this policy."
". The question of financing the common agricultural policy is one that needs to be discussed, at the appropriate time, and with clear objectives."
"The entire issue of agriculture and the rural world, along with the environment and the essential preservation of the balance between making use of resources and the economic viability and sustainability of so doing require proper consideration and detailed discussion."
"The actual political thrust of this report deserves my support."
"It is a policy of simplification that could potentially make the implementation of the programmes and funds in question more effective and easier to monitor."
"In this context, regardless of the future direction of the common agricultural policy, I support the proposal before us."
". We support in principle the Framework Agreement for ensuring that the practical work of the European Parliament can be carried out and for obtaining an analysis of the Commission’s activities involving, for example, its expert groups."
"We have chosen to support the report in spite of the wording of recital A which is misleading and which maintains that establishing a Constitution for Europe would deepen democracy in the EU."
". I and my British Conservative colleagues are in favour of improving the relations between the European Commission and European Parliament and we welcome especially, the demands for greater transparency."
"However, some of the processes involved are still flawed with regard to the selection of Commissioners and there is a greater need for accountability at this level."
"As a result, my colleagues and I have abstained on the final vote for this report."
". I have on many occasions had the opportunity to speak in considerable detail on the institutional model for Europe that I consider most appropriate."
"I therefore do not wish to do so again, although I felt it important to mention this."
"Nevertheless, irrespective of prevailing opinions, there is one aspect on which there must be agreement: Community institutions must work together in a spirit of cooperation, as this is in the interests of the smooth running of the EU, which is something that I wholeheartedly advocate."
"I therefore feel that, within the parameters that I have described above, this report is worthy of my support and my vote in favour."
". In my capacity as a Member of the Transport Committee, I 100% support the Koch report which seeks to make it compulsory for all vehicles – minibuses, buses, coaches, light commercial vehicles and lorries – to be equipped with seat anchorages and head restraints."
"The implementation of such safety systems in all vehicles will come into effect from 2006 onwards."
"I think this directive is well over due."
"It is deeply regrettable that for many transport users in Ireland, as I am sure in other Member States, this is a measure that has simply come too late."
"Unfortunately, too often the stimulus for improving road and transport safety comes from devastating lessons that are hard learned from the past."
"In view of the recent tragic events in Meath in Ireland in which five young people lost their lives in a school bus crash, there is an urgent need, amongst other measures, for quick progress on the fitting of safety belts and child restraints on all coaches, including school buses. This Directive should be approved and implemented as quickly as possible."
"Any requests for temporary derogations must be kept to an absolute minimum and should be scrutinised thoroughly by the Commission. Implementation of this Directive should also be linked with full compliance with Directive 2003/23/EC which provides for the compulsory wearing of seatbelts on coaches, where fitted, from May 2006."
"There must be no repeats of last Monday's accident."
"Mr President, I would have preferred to vote against Amendment 61, which concerned politically exposed persons."
"I would have preferred the Commission’s original version, which says that only complex and substantial transactions in the market should fall under the politically exposed persons category."
"The Commission’s original version on that point would have been much better than the compromise that was accepted."
"I fear that the European Parliament has blundered by yielding to the dictates of so-called political correctness."
"The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering has made recommendations concerning ‘politically exposed persons’."
"It is natural to combat the misappropriation of funds, which is sometimes practised even at the highest levels of government in certain countries."
"The European Union is duty-bound to implement these recommendations, but it must not go beyond that, lest it create other difficulties."
"As a matter of fact, I find the adopted definition of ‘politically exposed persons’ surprisingly loose."
"Defining them as natural persons with prominent public functions and their family members and even their close associates goes so far that it gives one cause to wonder who would not fit this description."
"Failing to distinguish between citizens of the European Union and non-citizens flies in the face of all the principles that underlie our Community law."
"A Member State of the Union cannot put other Member States on a par with non-EU countries."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has made the most appropriate proposal on this matter."
"I greatly regret that it has gone unheeded, because the war on money-laundering cannot be waged with a vague instrument that will only result in inefficiency and dissipation of effort."
"For the reasons explained above, I voted against the Nassauer report."
". I welcome this attempt to build on the original 1991 Directive against Money Laundering."
"It is vital we take steps to combat these crimes which have the power to undermine confidence in the EU's financial systems, as well as notoriously close links with terrorist finance."
"I welcome the risk-based approach the Commission takes regarding the obligations for those covered by the Directive."
"This means the directive does not demand customer due diligence if the relevant financial transactions offer only a minimal risk of money laundering."
"In addition, the minimal risk of money laundering or terrorist financing also justifies the decision to exclude companies only occasionally offering limited financial services from the directive."
"Although money laundering is defined as a criminal offence with criminal law sanctions as a requirement, the directive should confine itself to just a ban on money laundering and terrorist financing leaving the Member States free to decide what punishments they wish to impose."
". Whereas money laundering is not exclusively linked to financing terrorism, the truth is that this ‘crime for real criminals’ plays a key role in financing terrorist activities."
"Europe must never forget that terrorism is a real and permanent threat, one that we must tackle."
"This is true of both ‘new terrorism’, which has taken on a new scale and relevance since 11 September, and for forms of terrorism that have been around for much longer and that are still active in Europe, as in the case of ETA."
"Combating terrorism therefore requires unwavering vigilance and resolve. Legislation needs to be adapted, but this must be done without affecting freedoms, be they individual or collective; this applies to both freedom of expression and economic freedom."
"We must also, however, be conscious of which requirements placed on economic operators are fair, reasonable and effective and which are unworkable, ineffective or simply unreasonable."
"We must ensure that a balance is struck between freedom and security, and that we do not have one at the expense of the other."
"This report deals with the Community’s strategy for promoting the very important objective of achieving equality between men and women."
"We have voted against the report because we are confident that the Member States’ respective national parliaments take suitable charge of this issue."
"We object in principle to the general trend whereby the EU institutions endeavour to achieve influence and competence within ever more areas."
". I should like to congratulate Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou on her important report on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Decision 2001/51/EC establishing a Programme relating to the Community framework strategy on gender equality and Decision No 848/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community action programme to promote organisations active at European level in the field of equality between men and women."
"I welcome this report, and in particular the reference to the need to extend these two programmes until 2006."
"Although these programmes are expected to be amended in the future, it is vital at this time that the work done by Europe in this area is backed up by continued and extended action until the financial perspective for 2007-2013 has been adopted, especially now that the EU comprises 25 countries."
". I warmly welcome this move to promote equality at a European Level between men and women."
"If a better balance is to be achieved in gender equality then we must surely be working towards the same aim at each and every level."
"It is important that after their end-date of 31 December 2005 the work of these two programmes be supported so that worthwhile priority themes such as equal pay, reconciling working and family life and gender roles and stereotypes can continue to receive support."
"Therefore I agree with the rapporteur's call for adequate budgetary provision in the new financial perspective for the period 2007-2013 for the purpose of financing the Programme relating to the Community framework strategy on gender equality and the Community action programme to promote organisations active at European level in the field of equality between men and women."
". In view of the direction of action programmes and given the need to address the issue of adapting the timeframe for financing them to the adoption of the financial perspective for 2007-2013, I feel that my vote should reflect what is in the report, and I therefore support it."
". I have a special interest in issues of road safety, both as a member and Vice-President of the Committee on Transport, as well as on a more general level."
"Accordingly, and in light of the fact that the report makes reasonable and workable proposals, I voted in favour."
". We are very disappointed that in the vote in this report, an important article concerning restrictions on the use of nutrition and health claims was removed."
"In the article in question, the Commission was called on to establish specific nutrient profiles, which food must respect in order to bear nutrition or health claims. These nutrient profiles were to be established by reference to amounts of fat, saturated fatty acids, sugars and salt/sodium present in the food."
"We also regret that the provisions on situations in which health claims are permitted have been watered down."
"In the original proposal, the health claims would have to be authorised, or proven, whereas in the amendment that had just been adopted only the relevant authorities will be informed about the use of health claims and only where doubt exists will it be subject to assessment."
"This process is justified on the grounds that it is less cumbersome, but the truth is that it is the consumers who lose out."
"It is essential that consumers be informed and protected. This is a right that must not be placed at the mercy of the economic and financial interests of those who prioritise reducing costs, regardless of the damage this may do to consumers."
". The internal market presupposes cooperation, together with harmonisation of the Member States’ legislation."
"It is, however, important to take account of proportionality in legislation and of the role and significance of the national parliaments."
"We are of the view that the Member States should in the first place decide on rules concerning nutrition and health claims made on foods."
"We are critical of quite a few of the Commission’s articles, for example Article 4 stating that the Commission should be entitled to establish nutrient profilesthat must be respected when it comes to health claims made in advertisements, or Article 11 concerning rules governing which implied health claims should not be permitted."
"The European Parliament has, however, contributed a number of positive amendments, which is why we have chosen to support the report as a whole."
"I voted in favour of this regulation."
"There are too many claims being advanced today for our food products, which only perplexes consumers when they come to make their choices."
"Moreover, some excessively general assertions such as ‘healthy’ or ‘good for you’ have absolutely no scientific foundation and may even deceive the buyer."
"It therefore seems perfectly fair that those who market foodstuffs in packaging on which nutritional claims are made should be able to justify them."
"This is the spirit in which the regulation was devised."
"At the same time, this system must not penalise local producers and small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Accordingly, I am in favour of measures for the provision of special assistance to these businesses to enable them to prepare supporting documentation and meet the extra cost this entails."
". I oppose the inclusion of wine in the proposal for a regulation on nutrition and health claims made on foods, Article 4 of which provides for the prohibition of any nutrition and health claims on beverages containing more than 1.2% of alcohol by volume."
"The labelling of wine is already subject to a very stringent set of rules."
"Moreover, scientists have recognised the benefits of moderate consumption of wine."
"Wine is a food, a tonic; it soothes the nerves, aids digestion, is anti-allergenic and can act as an effective preventive against vascular diseases, cancer and dementia."
"You will agree that it would be a pity to be unable to emphasise these benefits to consumers and convey to them the fact that wine – like any food or beverage – can be part of a healthy diet and benefit a person’s general health if consumed in moderation."
"Lastly, the consumption of wine is part of a European tradition that goes back thousands of years, each country having adopted the habit in accordance with its own dietary customs."
"The prohibition of nutrition and health claims for all European countries would be tantamount to ignoring the relationship that each country in the EU has with this traditional product and could harm an important European industry that is currently experiencing an unprecedented crisis."
". I thought I ought to vote in favour of Amendment 29 which abolishes the nutrient profiles proposed by the Commission."
"I can understand Mr Maaten’s dissenting position since, in his capacity of shadow rapporteur of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, he is supposed to promote the group position that has been agreed upon."
"When making nutrition and health claims on foods, the guiding principle should be that there is no such thing as good or bad foods, only good or bad diets."
"Claims on foods must be scientifically underpinned and need not fit into a profile imposed by the government."
"Moreover, uniform food profiles are at odds with the variety of living and eating habits in the EU Member States."
"Consequently, the introduction of nutrient profiles as a condition for foodstuffs being able to display nutrition and health claims infringes the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality."
"Another objection to the concept of nutrient profiles is the disproportionate administrative burden that this entails for the small and medium-sized enterprises which are, indeed, strongly represented in the foodstuffs industry."
". The economic model that we advocate provides, on the one hand, for freedom and initiative, and, on the other hand, for state control to ensure compliance with fundamental rules creating objective conditions whereby consumers can make their choices knowing what they are choosing."
"Given that the proposal before us is consistent with this aim, I voted in favour."
"The resolution provides guidelines for the Member States’ employment policies."
"Even though quite a few of the proposals are sound, we do not believe that the EU should interfere in this area."
"Employment policy is best decided in the respective Member States and in accordance with the specific conditions in each of the countries concerned."
". In the year 2000, when the European Council met in Lisbon, we were promised that the European economy would become the most competitive in the world by 2010."
"Mato Adrover’s report, for its part, observes that the growth and employment objectives have not been achieved."
"This does not surprise us at all."
"The miracle envisaged for 2010 is not going to happen."
"This proposal for new guidelines, moreover, is merely the umpteenth proclamation of lofty sentiments which insults the millions of people who live from hand to mouth in social insecurity and poverty."
"These demagogic flights of fancy create a smokescreen to hide an intolerable future for workers threatened by job-dumping, a future in which individuals have to sell themselves at the best available rate while China’s factories and Brazil’s farms destroy our economy, deliberately sacrificed on the altar of free trade and unbridled globalisation."
"The reality in Europe is the loss of jobs and the eastward gold rush of large companies as a prelude to their final exit from Europe."
"The reality is that jobs are moving out while immigrants continue to move in for no purpose."
"Instead of fine words, it is time for action so that preference and national and Community protection prevail at long last within a more controlled economy and employment market."
"We do not share the visions of the European Parliament’s Committee on Constitutional Affairs when it comes to setting up a European External Action Service.Establishing such a service would be a step on the road towards a common foreign and security policy for the EU in which the Member States had completely handed over this policy area to the EU."
"We believe that each EU Member State should continue to conduct the foreign policy of its choice, drawn up following the election either of representatives to the national parliament or, alternatively, of a president or following national referenda."
". I voted against the resolution on working conditions of mobile workers assigned to interoperable cross-border services."
"This resolution welcomes a Council Directive that turns an agreement between social partners into legislation."
"This agreement between the Community of European Railways (industry) and the European Transport Workers’ Federation (trade unions) is surplus to requirements as we already have a Working Time Directive (2003/88) that does a fine job of incorporating mobile workers in its remit."
"Moreover, the CER only represents the railway companies that have national monopolies in the Member States."
"The European Rail Freight Association, which represents smaller companies, was not recognised by the Commission as social partner, while the new Directive places impossible demands on these small railway companies."
"For example, there is the requirement that a mobile worker must, after one night away from home, spend the next night at home at all costs."
"That is over-regulation in itself, but also a barrier to new operators in the market that actually offer cross-border freight transport."
"In short, the EU cannot use this directive if it wants to make a modal shift from transport by road to transport by rail and if it wants to make the EU more competitive in the framework of the Lisbon strategy."
"That is why I have voted against."
". I welcome this report's focus on the importance of our relationship with our close neighbour Russia who is becoming ever closer with enlargement of the EU."
"I agree with the Rapporteur that it is in both our interests that Russia is integrated better within the European structures and there is a more common approach to the Countries covered by our neighbourhood strategy."
"However, if Russia is to be a Member of the WTO it must respect WTO regulations, in particular counterfeiting and piracy of goods must be stamped out."
"I share the disappointment expressed by the rapporteur at the seeming reversal in Russia's democratisation and its disregard for some of the principles of the OSCE and Council of Europe documents."
". The clear conclusion of the debate that took place in committee on this report was that, owing to the recent enlargement, the EU now has a different notion and a different memory that informs its relations with Russia."
"In addition to the EU’s traditional concerns as regards democratisation, respecting freedoms, complying with international standards, advocating an economic model in which free initiative is not to be confused with the absolute freedom of the few or with the freedom that varies according to who is in power, the EU is now discovering the concerns of most of its most recent new Members."
"These concerns must, unreservedly, form an integral part of our relations with Russia."
"Recent news can scarcely, moreover, be described as encouraging."
"After some initial concern, followed by an appropriate response, the international community now has firm reasons to be concerned at the situation in Russia and with its plans on the international stage."
"That said, it must not go unmentioned that good relations with our enormous neighbour are of the highest importance."
". If the area of freedom, security and justice is to be established, it is crucial that fundamental rights be defended and promoted."
"It is necessary to avoid having a large number of agencies overlapping functions and creating more work."
"This new agency will only be worthwhile if it can make up the shortfall in data collection mechanisms and if it can keep track of trends and processes that have not worked in the Member States. Otherwise, it is difficult to gauge the true extent of the challenge and to assess the effectiveness of Community legislation in these areas."
"Existing agencies must be absorbed (such as the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, whose functioning has left much to be desired)."
"It will be the job of this agency to issue opinions and recommendations and not to interfere in the work of the institutions responsible for decision-making."
"Unwanted conflict with similar organs, such as the European Council High Commission for Human Rights, should also be avoided."
"I also welcome the fact that President Barroso has set up a group of Commissioners on Fundamental Rights, Anti-Discrimination and Equal Treatment, to establish a comprehensive and coherent strategy for protecting human rights."
"The report is about extending the mandate of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia to make it a Human Rights Agency."
"Failing to respect the results of the referenda in the Member States, Parliament is proposing guidelines for the Agency’s role and tasks, as if the Constitution had already entered into force."
"Setting up a further EU body to issue opinions and recommendations and to do work on raising awareness in the human rights area – an area in which the European Council, the OSCE and various UN bodies are already doing excellent work – would be pointless, moreover, and involve an unnecessary duplication of effort."
"The June List has therefore voted against the report."
". We voted against the report in light of its obsession with deficit and the Stability and Growth Pact, whereas the problem that we face is economic rather than financial."
"It overlooks the fact that our problem is one of demand, which requires increased buying power and in turn higher salaries."
"It overlooks the fact that we have a genuine economic problem, and that what we therefore need is greater support for manufacturing. We must also, as a matter of urgency, make use of safeguard clauses for the textile sector, thereby saving thousands of businesses from closure and preventing unemployment from spiralling out of control."
"We must also, at the earliest opportunity, carry out a thorough-going impact assessment on economic and monetary union and the rise in the value of the euro in terms of the European economy’s loss of competitiveness, and in terms of economic and social cohesion."
"What is needed is the courage to scrap the Stability and Growth Pact and replace it with a Growth and Employment Pact, with the accent placed on investment in manufacturing and social progress."
"The EU must undergo a radical change of policy and direction."
"Mr Goebbels’ own-initiative report is another flagrant example of the way in which the European Parliament tries to turn national policy into a common EU policy."
"In our view, the report presents many quite sound views on how growth should be stimulated, the importance of relevant investments, how environmental initiatives can contribute to economic growth and how unemployment creates social injustice."
"The June List believes, however, that each Member State must decide for itself what type of tax system it wants or how it might become a ‘competitive’ country."
"Institutional competition between the Member States will show which system is most successful."
"Other Member States will then comply with such established best practice in their own fully understood interests."
"We support the report on the Social Policy Agenda for the period 2006-2010."
"We interpret the wording concerning a legislative proposal ‘to guarantee a minimum income’ as referring to what we in Sweden call supplementary benefits and not to the introduction of a minimum wage system."
". As we stated in the speech in plenary, the restrictive proposals in the scope of the Social Agenda fall well short of what is required, if we are to create more than 22 million new jobs with rights, thereby meeting the targets set in the Lisbon Strategy, and to promote the social inclusion of the 70 million people living below the poverty line."
"At a time when we need a Social Agenda that is genuinely committed to social inclusion, what the Council did at the Spring summit moved in entirely the opposite direction – it restricted the objectives in the area of social inclusion and the fight against poverty to children, sidestepping the fact that it is impossible to help children without changing the situation for adults."
"It also failed to take practical measures to promote and evaluate progress in the area of equality between men and women, for example as regards access to jobs with rights and salaries, where the situation is as bad as, if not worse than, it was."
"The distribution of income remains serious or has worsened, and the rights of workers, pensioners, users and consumers have been scaled back, whereby they are now threatened with the proposals for directives before us concerning the organisation of working time and the creation of an internal market for services."
". The delegation of the Dutch People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy considered it should vote against the Oomen-Ruijten report on the Social Policy Agenda for the period 2006-2010."
"The report mentions a number of matters which should not be regulated at European level, such as the proposal for a legislative initiative for a European minimum wage."
"In addition, the VVD cannot see the point of promoting a model for European education and training."
"These are typical examples of unwanted interference from Brussels which undermines national sovereignty, something that is unacceptable to the VVD."
"Similarly, the request to the Commission to set up a voluntary framework for transnational collective bargaining is superfluous."
"Social partners already operate at European level and can settle these matters among themselves much more effectively."
"The crowning touch is the abundance of new directives proposed in the report, many of which put a suffocating blanket over entrepreneurs, as a result of which they can no longer get round to running their businesses."
"This could have a boomerang effect on employment, which should never be the intention of social policy, in my view."
"For the VVD, the best social policy at European level is the creation of jobs."
". The revision of the Lisbon Strategy is based on the three strands of competitiveness, growth and employment."
"In order to relaunch the social component, the Council has tabled a new Social Agenda (2006-2010), which to my mind falls short of what might justifiably be expected."
"I have no objection to the underlying philosophy of creating a European ‘labour market’, nor to the various measures proposed, such as concluding collective transnational conventions on work, promoting jobs for women and combating poverty."
"My criticism lies elsewhere. I feel that this vague and not exactly binding instrument is not the most appropriate or proportionate answer to the pressing need for modernisation, with a view to achieving growth and competitiveness."
"For example, the Social Agenda attaches little importance to local economies and to small and medium-sized enterprises, which are key elements in economic development and jobs, and are responsible for over 90% of business activity in Europe."
"The overriding impression is that this is a catalogue of good political intentions."
"In other words, although I agree with the diagnosis, I fear that the recommended treatment is not the most suitable."
"I voted in favour of this report because I agree with the points the Commission makes therein on the initiative."
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 26 May 2005."
"15 years ago, the European Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize to the Burmese opposition leader, Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi."
"In a few days time, she will reach her 60th birthday, that is to say, 15 years will have passed four times, but she is still under arrest."
"She is the only Sakharov Prize winner who has not been able to receive her prize after more than 3 500 days in captivity."
"I felt I should point this out, because it may have been forgotten."
"It may also have been forgotten that, in 1990, her party, the National League for Democracy, received 80% of the votes in the parliamentary elections, 80%, but it could not take power because of the Burmese military regime."
"And, despite the frequent and constant appeals from this Parliament, despite the European Union’s sanctions, despite the condemnation of several bodies of the United Nations, the Burmese regime is continuing its campaign of ethnic cleansing and systematic abuse of human rights."
"Human Rights Watch recently accused that regime of the systematic violation of human rights, torture and executions."
"I therefore believe it appropriate, on behalf of this Parliament, for us all to renew our call for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and her fellow political prisoners and express our complete condemnation of the abuses of the Burmese regime."
"The final version of the draft agenda for the June part-session as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Wednesday 2 June pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"The following amendments have been proposed:"
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has requested that Questions to the Council be removed."
"Does anybody wish to explain the request of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament?"
"Mr President, the agenda for Wednesday includes two important debates – one on the reform of the UN and the other on trans-Atlantic relations. We also want to discuss the Council and Commission statements on Uzbekistan and then deal with a question on Philip Morris."
"Very little time has been made available for this."
"By way of deviation from our written motion – and in order to accommodate those Members who want at least some Question Time and then the written replies – I would like to ask that the debate be allowed to encroach upon half an hour of Question Time, leaving half an hour for questions to the Council, so that we – by which I mean both the larger and smaller groups – can have a rather more in-depth debate."
"That is to say, Questions to the Council is not being cancelled, but rather it is being shortened by half an hour."
"Mr President, I just wish to point out that Question Time is supposed to last an hour and a half."
"Therefore, the kind generosity of my friend in the Socialist Group in reducing it to half an hour is cutting it not to half but to one third of what it should be."
"I should like to propose that it is kept at one hour or, as a compromise, three-quarters of an hour."
"Question Time is a very valuable institution."
"Please do not suppress it or let it disappear."
"Mr President, speaking on behalf of our group, I would like to ask for something that does not involve changing the agenda, but simply adding to the title."
"On Wednesday morning, between 9 a.m. and noon, the Council and the Commission are due to make statements on the preparations for the European Council."
"Having had the referenda, I think it would be appropriate for them to be mentioned, and so we ask that they should feature in the title, thus: ‘The future of the European Union following the referenda on the Constitution’."
"This would make it clear that this is not ‘business as usual’, but that we are focussing our attention on this major issue."
"It would be appropriate if we were to do this."
"Mr President, we would like to congratulate Mr Poettering, whom the weekend has brought to his senses."
"Last Thursday, we ..."
"Yes, and you were against it!"
"We proposed that last Thursday."
"Thank you, Mr Poettering, for sleeping on the issue and coming to the right conclusion."
"Thank you very much, Mr Cohn-Bendit; we do not know who Mr Poettering has consulted, but it is wise to rectify."
"What is clear is that the proposal is from Mr Poettering and that he is calling for the text of the item on the agenda to be amended."
"In any event, the text of the title is not what matters, but rather the content of the debate."
"Mr President, I wanted to speak earlier when we were discussing Question Time, but I did not catch your eye."
"I just wanted to ask for clarification of the agenda."
"The right to put questions is possessed by Members as individuals, and it is for that reason that it enjoys special protection."
"I doubt whether it can be set aside by majority vote."
"I would ask that we stick with the 90-minute Question Time in future, which the Rules of Procedure guarantee as an individual MEP’s right."
"As you know, the item has not been removed from the agenda but rather its duration has been reduced."
"You do not like this and I understand that, but the majority of the House has voted for it and we are not contravening the Rules of Procedure, but rather applying them."
"The next item is the one-minute speeches."
"Please allow me to point out that this is the first time that we have had this item on the agenda since you received the letter from the Presidency in which I indicated how I intended to organise it."
"Not a single Member has expressed any objection to it, but I imagine that you will know precisely what I said in that letter, and next I will apply the procedure that I indicated to you, that is to say, I will give priority to Members who have already asked to speak in writing, indicating the subject on which they wished to speak."
"Thirty-one Members have done so, and I am going to give them priority in these speeches."
"Mr President, I am taking the floor on my own behalf and on behalf of Mr Pittella, Mr Yáñez and Mrs Madeira, to protest at the discrimination against Asturias, Murcia, Melilla, Ceuta, Basilicata and the Algarve in Mr Juncker’s documents."
"The President-in-Office of the Council spoke in a very discerning way following the French referendum."
"He said that politicians should make decisions understandable to the public and react."
"That is precisely what we are requesting for these six European regions: to prevent injustice and marginalisation compared to others who are in the same circumstances."
"Mr Juncker, in your coming document you must remove the precedent of marginalising three million citizens."
"It is a question of dignity, of making European policy comprehensible, of making it fair and democratic, true to its roots and to its ambitions."
"Mr Juncker, we place our trust in you."
"Mr President, on Wednesday, the global campaign, Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative was launched."
"Aids, malaria and TB are generally known problems."
"Less well known are Chagas disease, sleeping sickness and leishmaniasis."
"Together with AIDS, TB and malaria, these diseases kill 14 million people each year, mainly in poor countries."
"They claim more victims globally than traffic accidents, famine and terrorism combined."
"Three billion dollars would be enough to fund the research needed to produce better treatments for these diseases."
"The solutions are within reach if solidarity and human sympathy are mobilised."
"For many, ‘tsunami’ was an unknown word six months ago but, when the devastating power behind that word became generally known, we were rapidly able to mobilise aid for those affected."
"Now, attention is being paid to other less well-known diseases such as Chagas disease and leishmaniasis, which affect millions of people."
"This time too, let us show how we can teach ourselves new concepts and take new initiatives to combat these afflictions."
"After the rejection of the European Constitution in the French and Dutch referenda, the idea of a united Europe, the principles of solidarity and access by the citizens of the new Member States to the EU 15 labour markets, which are closed to new members in the hope that restriction will protect them against competition, have become the most topical themes today."
"My country Slovakia together with the other new Member States desire to be fully-fledged members of the Community."
"Since last–year’s enlargement of the European Union, labour migration from the new Member States has been only 150 000 people, and has not reached the level the critics of enlargement have warned about."
"The fall of the Berlin Wall signified a great hope for our endeavours towards integration and let us not therefore attempt to rebuild a new European wall out of fear of so-called social dumping."
"Mr President, since cheating his way to victory in the October 2004 elections, Belarus’ President Lukashenko has been even more zealous in repressing his opponents."
"A few days ago, on 1 June, the chairman of the Belarus Social Democratic Party and founder of Belarus’ European Movement was sentenced to three years in jail for doing nothing more than joining with others in demonstrating against the rigged presidential elections."
"Mr President, in this instance too, I would ask you to address vigorous protests to the Belarus authorities concerning these acts of repression."
". – Mr President, I would like to use this platform to say that a month ago, Mr Hegyi, the Hungarian MEP, told you and all of us an untruth about the alleged impossibility for Hungarians to obtain citizenship in Latvia."
"After what we had heard, several members from Latvia met with the Hungarian Association in Latvia."
"Hungarians, just like other permanent residents of Latvia, have every right to obtain Latvian citizenship."
"Many Hungarians have already done so, but the issue, as it turned out, was not about citizenship."
"The biggest problem for those people who are by no means well-off is the impossibility of travelling to visit relatives in Hungary without visas, which cost quite a large sum of money."
"For this very reason, Hungarians in Latvia had approached the Hungarian Government, asking it to issue them with special certificates for entering Hungary, such as those living in other countries already have."
"Since their request was refused, Latvian citizenship becomes the only way in which to travel to Hungary without a considerable outlay on visas."
"Mr Hegyi, I call upon you as a member of the Hungarian Socialist Party not to mislead Parliament, but to appeal to your party colleagues in the government and to propose that they stop requiring that their own Hungarian people have visas in order to enter Hungary."
"Mr President, on 28 April last year the President of France, Mr Jacques Chirac, said ‘If a country votes against the proposed Constitution, it must leave the European Union’."
"I would like to ask, Mr President, whether you have yet received the French resignation."
"No, Mr Mote, I have not received it."
"Mr President, the anti-European camp wants the constitutional ratification process to be discontinued."
"I disagree fundamentally with that approach."
"Countries representing half the population of Europe have said yes."
"It would be undemocratic to deny those who have not yet ratified the opportunity to do so."
"Ironically, the values-driven Union provided for by the Constitution is needed to address the concerns of many of the ‘no’ voters in France and the Netherlands."
"If some Member States need more time, then let us have a new deadline; but in the interests of our peoples and of Europe’s future in the world, the Constitution must not be shelved."
"I would suggest that France and the Netherlands might consider establishing national conventions of Europe, to consider exactly what kind of Europe they want."
"When the European Council meets next week, it – and the Commission – will need to bear in mind that driving forward with market reforms without strengthening the democratic, social and environmental dimension of Europe, will feed the current crisis, and indeed, that strengthening nationalism will destroy Europe."
"Mr President, the ‘Lost at Sea Scheme’ was introduced in Ireland by the Irish Ministry for the Marine in 2001."
"It was an EU-approved scheme under Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002."
"The purpose of the scheme was to compensate people who had lost fishing vessels over a number of years previously."
"Unfortunately, because it was not advertised widely – it was only advertised in marine magazines – many of the people who could and should have qualified were not allowed into the scheme."
"I made representations on behalf of several of those people, but to no avail."
"The Irish Ombudsman has described the scheme, as introduced by the Irish Government, as seriously deficient and grossly flawed."
"It is quite obvious that the scheme will have to be revisited and that is the reason why I am asking – in the event of the Irish Government making an application for the scheme to be reopened because it is so flawed – that the European Union support the reopening of such a scheme to allow people who missed it to enter."
"Mr President, my reason for speaking today is to draw attention to the fact that on 19 June, in the time between this part-session and the next one, Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of Burma’s democracy movement, will celebrate her 60th birthday."
"On that day she will have spent 9 years 238 days in detention."
"The junta in Burma is now more hardline and more firmly in control than ever."
"Aung San Suu Kyi’s house arrest is now more restrictive than it has ever been."
"She has no visitors; her phone line has been cut; she lives behind a wall of sandbags and barbed wire, patrolled continuously by armed guards and soldiers."
"We see no sign of change."
"The last resolution of this Parliament on Burma was very clear."
"We would ask the Commission to seriously reconsider softening its approach to this regime, which continues to show utter contempt for human rights and democracy."
"Aung San Suu Kyi is a Nobel Peace Prize winner and a recipient of the Sakharov Prize of this Parliament."
"She shows breathtaking courage."
"Thank you, Mr President, for your commitment to Aung San Suu Kyi and to the people of Burma."
"Mr President, I would like to draw the attention of the House to a golden opportunity for us to demonstrate relevance to the people of Europe: the G8 summit at Gleneagles in my country, Scotland."
"The contribution of this House could be signing the written declaration in my name on the aims of Making Poverty History."
"At this time of cynicism about the direction of the EU, it is an opportunity for us to march in step with the people of Europe."
"Too often, EU trade policies have been the cause of problems within the developing world, not the solution."
"We can change this mindset and give a lead which I believe would be appreciated by the peoples of Europe."
"This summer the world will be coming to Scotland."
"I hope a million people come to Scotland and behave themselves."
"If anybody from this Chamber wants to accompany us on our march to Make Poverty History, I would be more than happy to arrange it."
"Immediately following the failure of the referendum in the Netherlands, one of the more prominent European leaders came out in favour of a meeting of representatives of the European Union’s founding members."
"They would supposedly discuss the special responsibility of these founding members."
"From the formal aspect, of course, everyone has the right to meet with anyone else."
"Yet from the political aspect, it seems to me that this kind of initiative in this sensitive period of impasse in the European Union might also be rather delicate."
"It might send out a disturbing message or trigger the question of whether, a year after the enlargement of the European Union, certain states are more European than others."
"Do these states have a greater calling and greater responsibility than, for instance, the new Member States of the European Union?"
"I count myself a proponent of the EU."
"I put this question because, in this sensitive period for the EU, I would like to promote the cause of all 25 Member States, regardless of when they joined the EU, in joining together to thrash out some sort of future for the EU."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rejection of the European Constitution has overshadowed another event that is also significant, albeit somewhat less so."
"I have in mind Parliament’s adoption, on 10 March, of a resolution that referred to terrorist activities on the part of Hezbollah."
"This is an issue that has been the subject of debate in this House for many months."
"The way in which the many Islamic communities in Europe are informed about terrorism is of crucial importance, and the media plays a huge role in this respect."
"A good example of this is the television channel , which is popular amongst European Muslims."
"There are, however, serious grounds for doubting the objectivity of this channel’s reports on Islamic terrorism."
"This same holds true for the Spanish and the French , which in practice violate European legislation in this field, as do the channels and , which are broadcast to Europe from Saudi Arabia and Egypt respectively."
"The question that could well be asked at this point is how long the Spanish and French governments will tolerate such channels broadcasting from their countries."
"The gravity of this situation should not be underestimated."
"As a member of the European Parliament’s fact-finding mission to Vojvodina, I would like to draw attention to the fact that the situation has not improved since the visit we made nearly six months ago – and especially not the situation of minorities there."
"In the last few weeks alone, indigenous Hungarians were badly beaten up by Serbs recently settled in Vojvodina, for the sole reason that they were speaking in their mother tongue – which, incidentally, is an official language of the European Union."
"This calls for urgent action by the European Parliament to monitor Serbia, not only in the Delegation to Yugoslavia, but also – and this has not happened since February – in the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"Moreover, the unexplained denunciations of Hungarian leaders in Vojvodina in recent weeks, bear all the hallmarks of a concerted political attack."
"This impression is reinforced by the sentence that was imposed exclusively on Hungarian youths in Temerin and which has become infamous due to its excessive severity and one-sidedness."
"So far even war criminals have been treated less harshly by the Serbian judiciary."
"The reason behind all these incidents – as the investigating delegation from this Parliament also pointed out – is the fact that minorities are not proportionally represented in the Serbian judicial system or the police, or indeed in the public administration."
"Moreover, the Belgrade leadership is also dragging its heels as regards keeping its promises on education for minorities."
"All of this raises the question of the responsibility of the European Parliament and Union institutions, because, for example, the Interreg CBC plans fail to give Vojvodina autonomous status – despite the fact that the province was autonomous until 1989 – and yet it complies with all the requirements laid down for NUTS2 regions."
"Mr President, on September 16 the European Parliament adopted a resolution condemning the offences committed against minorities in the Serbian province of Vojvodina and, as a consequence of this, in late 2004, a delegation led by Mrs Doris Pack visited the province on a fact-finding mission."
"Following objective and credible investigations, the delegation found that offences are indeed committed, but not in an organised manner."
"Recently, however, I am sad to say, we have once again witnessed disturbing events in Vojvodina."
"The greatest cause for concern is the fact that the recently appointed Serbian public prosecutor in Subotica has issued an indictment against József Kasza – president of the most important organisation of Vojvodina Hungarians, the VMSZ [Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians] – to investigate abuses of power allegedly committed by him nine years ago during his time as mayor. Denunciations of this sort have been made against József Kasza several times in the past, but have never been proven."
"The timing in the present case is no coincidence."
"Kasza was the person who was most vociferous in condemning the violent acts committed against Vojvodina Hungarians and he cooperated closely with the European Parliament’s fact-finding delegation."
"Mr President, I ask you and Mrs Doris Pack to take care that VMSZ president József Kasza does not become a political victim in a show trial."
"Mr President, entrepreneurs in the Polish metal industry have issued warnings that imports of metal goods, and in particular of what are known as small metal goods, have risen sharply since 1 January 2005."
"It was on this date that administrative restrictions on imports of such goods into the European customs union were lifted."
"The entrepreneurs have highlighted the fact that Chinese producers do not include employer contributions to insurance and social security schemes or money spent meeting environmental standards in their production costs, and that this makes it possible for them to charge significantly less for the goods they export."
"On top of this, they benefit from various forms of state support, which show every sign of being illegal state aid."
"The result of all this is an increase in the number of cases of unfair competition, and ever-worsening problems for European metal industry entrepreneurs, including those in Poland."
"I would ask the President to alert the European Commission to this problem, and to suggest that it should come up with solutions that would protect the EU market from being swamped by imported metal goods from China."
"Many thanks."
"Mr President, for several months we have been hearing very worrying news from Sudan, specifically from Darfur."
"We are facing a crisis with no foreseeable outcome, that some people have described as genocide, and which has led to thousands of deaths and hundreds and thousands of displaced persons, within a context of horrendous violations of human rights and an enormous humanitarian disaster."
"One of the most recent pieces of news we have received relates to the arrest of two officials of Médecins sans Frontières, a Briton, Mr Foreman, and a Dutchman, Mr Hoedt, accused of espionage and spreading false information."
"In particular, the supposedly false report notes more than 500 cases of rapes of women in Darfur."
"I believe that the report is important; the credibility and solvency of Médecins sans Frontières organisation are proven and for all of these reasons Parliament has the duty to take action to defend these two officials of that organisation."
"On behalf of several colleagues from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I would call for action, perhaps a letter from the President to the Sudanese authorities expressing Parliament’s concern about the events being condemned and calling for the release of Mr Foreman and Mr Hoedt without charge."
"Mr President, in view of the huge influx of honey into the EU from third countries, and given the alarming reports from consumers about the poor quality of this honey, I believe that protective measures need to be taken."
"Unless this happens, the problems currently experienced by the beekeeping industry will be exacerbated."
"It should be noted that there has been a drop of almost 40% in Europe’s bee population over recent years."
"In Germany, for example, numbers have dropped by 33% over the past 15 years, and in Poland by 40% over the past 20 years."
"Bees are not only important in terms of honey and other bee products."
"They help maintain a balance in nature and increase the efficiency of food production, as well as playing an essential role in environmental preservation."
"In view of the above, it is my opinion that the European Commission should, as a matter of urgency, present the House with proposals for measures to be taken in this respect."
"The aim of these measures should be to protect not only the market in honey and bee products, but also bees and the future of beekeeping."
"– Mr President, I should like publicly to thank Mr Poettering, the chairman of our parliamentary group, for his proposal that we discuss the situation in the European Union in detail today, together with progress with the ratification of the European Constitution."
"I wish to thank him because this satisfied an initiative on my part to have this debate."
"I should also like to take this opportunity to thank my honourable friends who signed – and thus gave real support to – this initiative."
"The European Parliament cannot merely react. It must also act."
"Certainly the situation in the European Union today is a matter for the democratically elected governments; however, it is also a matter for the democratically elected institution , the European Parliament."
"It is a minimal indication of democratic responsibility towards the civil society of Europe."
"Mr President, for the last two years the British Government has funded ‘Operation Scrap-it’ with GBP 7 million – EUR 11 million – a year given to London boroughs to cope with the End of Life Vehicles Directive."
"This programme provides a fast, London-wide removal service for abandoned cars, removing around 75 000 a year from London streets."
"The scheme has saved many neighbourhoods from the blight of scrapped and burnt-out vehicles littering and polluting the environment, making a real difference to the quality of citizens’ lives."
"However, to coincide with World Environment Day yesterday, the UK Government made known that this funding would end in September."
"This would not be so bad if our government made manufacturers liable from that date, as it has the possibility to do under the directive, before manufacturers’ liability becomes mandatory in January 2007."
"The government has not done that, putting corporate profits before a sustainable environment."
"Through you, therefore, Mr President, I appeal to the British Government to prolong the funding of ‘Operation Scrap-it’ to stop an environmental crisis in London."
"– Mr President, according to confirmed reports, a meeting of neo-Nazi and fascist organisations from Greece, Italy, Spain and other countries of Central Europe and the USA is scheduled to take place from 16 to 18 September 2005, in the Meligala region in the prefecture of Messinia in the Peloponnese."
"This meeting will pose a challenge to the democratic authorities and sensibilities of the Greek people and of all the peoples of Europe."
"Especially today, when these forces are using the European Constitution as a pretext for undermining the values and principles on which we have built common, peaceful and democratic cohabitation and brotherhood in Europe."
"The Greek Government should immediately ban this anti-democratic meeting. This call should also be supported by the European Parliament."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to seize this opportunity to draw your attention again to a problem that I regret to say is still present, that being subsidies for the export of live animals."
"Ever since export subsidies for the transportation of live animals were introduced in 1989, this House has on many occasions voted in favour of their removal from the EU budget."
"Although the animals’ torments, particularly on journeys over long distances, and the resulting disadvantages for consumers, are a matter of general knowledge, their transportation continues to be subsidised to the tune of EUR 41 million in 2001, EUR 57 million in 2002, EUR 67 million in 2003, and now the figure has reached EUR 77 million per annum."
"Giving subsidies in this manner amounts to promoting extreme suffering for animals, and we should therefore surely reject it."
"I wish therefore to call upon the Members of this House to endorse this statement, and would advise the ladies and gentlemen currently engaged in negotiating the EU’s budget that the abolition of these subsidies would remove several hundred million euros from the budget, and to do so would be surely to give it some justified relief."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 25 Heads of State or Government signed the European Constitutional Treaty, as did 25 foreign ministers, and 10 Member States have ratified it."
"This House adopted it by the two-thirds constitutional majority."
"Most of Europe’s citizens have already said yes to this Constitution."
"I would ask you, Mr President, to issue a press release making it clear that we will not allow ourselves to be taken hostage by opponents of the EU, disinformation merchants, those who play the blame game or rabble-rousers, and that this Constitution reinforces the public’s fundamental rights, strengthening Parliament, and, through Parliament, the citizens, democracy and transparency."
"I would ask you, Mr President, to inform all the Heads of State or Government that it is because we do not want to interrupt the constitution-making process that the European Parliament is opposed to self-willed decisions appealing to popular national sentiment and premature statements by Heads of Government – such as the one made today by Tony Blair."
"Mr President, the European Constitution is dead."
"The French killed it, the Dutch put it in the coffin and now the lid is on."
"But, like Count Dracula, EU treaties have a nasty habit of coming back to life."
"The Constitution needs a stake through its heart."
"That stake could be administered by means of a British referendum, which would deliver a resounding ‘no’."
"It now seems, however, that the British Government will deny the British people that opportunity."
"Instead of a stake there might be an even more deadly termination, in the form of a silver bullet."
"That silver bullet will take the form of the disintegration of the European single currency."
"The eurozone is already starting to show signs of fraying at the edges."
"The break-up of the European single currency, which is only a matter of time, will kill political and economic integration stone dead once and for all."
"Mr President, it is nice to see our loony friends are in the Chamber with us today."
"Despite recent major jolts to the EU project, we still have some fairly substantial work in progress, not least the Lisbon Strategy."
"I would like, therefore, to continue my mission to name and shame Member States that have not implemented some of the Lisbon directives."
"The European Parliament has passed 83 Lisbon directives."
"Sixty-three should have been implemented; only ten have been fully implemented by all Member States."
"The European company statute directive should have been implemented by 18 October 2004, but the following countries have yet to notify the Commission of their legislation implementing this directive: Belgium, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Slovenia."
"Mr President, would you write to those Member States and ask them when they intend to implement the directive?"
"– Mr President, between the two part-sessions, we had a thunderous from both France and the Netherlands."
"However, the 'no' to the European Constitution was not also a 'no' to Europe."
"We must listen to the European people."
"In the European Parliament, 62% of the French members voted ."
"However, 55% of the French people voted ."
"Here, 82% of the Dutch members voted . However, 62% of the Dutch people voted ."
"What is happening?"
"Why are governments saying yes and the people are saying no?"
"The people know a few facts."
"They know about unemployment, inflation and the invasion of Chinese products."
"They know about everything that we arrange behind their backs."
"We let Turkey in without asking them and illegal immigration is out of control."
"We need to pay closer attention to the people."
"If we ask the people, if we sing from the same hymn sheet as the people, then Europe too will progress."
"Europe without the people cannot progress and the bureaucrats in Brussels need to understand that."
"Greater attention to the people and more respect for the people."
"The 700 000 or so lorries that drive through Slovenia into Italy every year, must, on crossing the border, use the special lanes through the Italian customs posts at the cities of Trieste and Gorizia."
"Although lorries in transit travel unladen and require no customs services, they have to use the same special lanes as they did prior to Slovenia’s accession to the European Union, and have to pay a road toll."
"If they do not pay the toll, they are stopped and prevented from continuing their journey."
"I suspect that the underlying reason for the use of this system in Italy is that following Slovenia’s accession to the EU, the volume of customs services in connection with transit goods haulage has been halved."
"The unjustified charging of a road toll is the financial compensation."
"Yet this medieval-type tax seriously violates the principle of free flow of goods and persons within the EU and constitutes an inadmissible precedent."
"Mr President, today I should like to alert the House to a matter that has outraged public opinion in my country for many weeks."
"I refer to the Lukashenko regime’s persecution of the newly-elected leaders of the Union of Poles in Belarus."
"Violations of fundamental human rights in Belarus are something to which we have been accustomed for many years."
"I need only mention the fact that two leaders of the democratic opposition, Nikolai Statkevich and Pavel Severinets, were sentenced a few days ago to three years in a forced labour camp for organising anti-government demonstrations."
"Nevertheless, the recent attacks on the Polish minority organisation deserve to be singled out for particular criticism by the EU authorities."
"I would remind the House that although new leaders were elected at the March congress of the Union of Poles in Belarus, the Belarussian Ministry of Justice not only refused to recognise these elections, but also threatened to outlaw the organisation entirely."
"What is more, the publication of , the country’s only Polish-language newspaper, has been suspended, and a Polish diplomat has been expelled from the country."
"These facts give a full insight into the persecution suffered by Poles in Belarus."
"The drastic measures to which the Belarussian authorities have recently resorted are a clear indication of the fact that they fear their country will experience a repeat of the democratic revolution seen in Ukraine."
"I hope that their worst fears come true, but the European Union must pursue a more proactive policy to ensure that this happens."
"Mr President, this is a question for you."
"You will be aware that over the last few part-sessions in Strasbourg there have been any number of serious problems with flights to and from Strasbourg airport."
"You are not listening but never mind, I shall carry on."
"Strikes, diversions, cancellations and all sorts of other reasons have meant that MEPs have been seriously delayed or diverted."
"As the City of Strasbourg and the French aviation authorities seem incapable of providing a consistent or reliable service to this great city, and in view of the clear wish of both Members of the European Parliament and the peoples of Europe that we do not waste any more of their money, is it not time seriously to consider once and for all the future of the monthly plenary sessions held in Strasbourg?"
"This afternoon I am asking you personally what your proposals for action in this field are, both in the short term and in the long term, or is it perhaps a question you prefer to avoid?"
"I believe that the Treaty should be respected in every respect."
"The rules in force establish where and how this Parliament should meet and our obligation is to comply with the rules in force, which say what they say about where the European Parliament should meet."
"Mr President, I would like to correct what Mr Leichtfried has said."
"I, too, am opposed to the transport of live animals for slaughter, but this statement makes no distinction between animals for slaughter and animals for breeding and production, the latter of which must be exported alive and really are economically significant to Europe’s farmers."
"If we subscribe to the statement as it stands, something like half of Europe’s breeding cattle would be affected, and that would represent another major blow to Europe’s farmers, on top of the general economic stress."
"Mr President, I do not want to give the impression that I am anything other than an advocate of a peaceful and united Europe, but I do believe that, after the votes in France and the Netherlands, we cannot simply go on with business as usual."
"Nor can it be said that over half Europe’s citizens have already cast their votes in favour."
"To do so is simply wrong; in Germany, it was fewer than 600 members of parliament who voted in favour, while over 80 million citizens were not asked their opinion."
"Last week, a major German daily newspaper polled its readership."
"Of the almost 380 000 readers who took part, 96% were opposed to the Constitution."
"I do not believe that the blame lies with the French and Dutch voters who voted against the Constitution, but rather with the Members of this House who voted to start accession negotiations with Turkey and in favour of the early accession of Romania and Bulgaria."
"That is what we need to be talking about."
"Mr President, in the light of the Constitutional referenda, I would hope that at last, in this House, there might be some recognition that the EU project is seriously flawed and heading in the wrong direction."
"However, that is not the point I want to draw attention to."
"Another Member has already mentioned the G-8 summit, which is going to take place in Edinburgh, and also the Live-8 campaign, which is seeking debt relief, trade justice and increased aid for Africa."
"However, financial measures alone cannot solve Africa’s problems."
"If we are going to bring about real change for the better in Africa, this must be accompanied by action to ensure that good governance is practised, the rule of law upheld and human rights respected."
"I look at the case of Zimbabwe, where in March Mugabe had another sham election and where, at this moment, he is involved in clearance of urban areas inhabited mainly by opposition supporters, whom he is ruthlessly suppressing."
"The international community is doing nothing about this."
"The Council said that it would review sanctions in the light of the elections that took place in Zimbabwe."
"Nothing has happened."
"I call upon the Council and the Commission to take robust action against Mugabe and similar dictators who are abusing the oppressed people of Africa."
"That concludes this item."
"The next item is the debate on the report by Anne Laperrouze, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down guidelines for trans-European energy networks and repealing Decisions No 96/391/EC and No 1229/2003/EC (COM(2003)0742 – C5-0064/2004 – 2003/0297(COD)) (A6-0134/2005)."
". Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Laperrouze, for having taken over this proposal on the guidelines for trans-European energy networks and for having carried out a focused analysis in her report which was adopted by a large majority in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"I would like in particular to express my gratitude for her commitment, together with that of the shadow rapporteurs, in aiming for an agreement at first reading which, I very much regret, has not been achieved."
"Let me recall on this occasion the objectives of the proposal."
"The challenge of the proposal is to build a legal instrument that will be efficient in delivering the necessary energy transmission infrastructure, while developing the appropriate cooperation with the private sector and the Member States."
"The security of energy supply and the functioning of the internal energy market are key policy issues."
"These objectives are taken up in the trans-European Energy – TEN-E – guidelines aiming at the installation of an electricity and gas network of truly European character by better linking the fragmented national networks."
"Concerning natural gas, there is a strong growth perspective."
"The trans-European energy networks policy aims at securing and diversifying additional gas import capacity from sources in Russia, Norway, the Caspian basin region, Northern Africa and the Middle East, and providing the necessary interconnection capacity between Member States."
"Concerning the electricity networks, the main function is to create and foster a real European electricity market."
"For this objective, sufficient interconnection capacity between Member States is essential."
"Since the adoption of the existing guidelines for trans-European energy networks in June 2003, the need has arisen fully to integrate the new Member States and candidate countries in these guidelines and further to adapt those guidelines to the new European Neighbourhood policy."
"The revision of the TEN-E guidelines proposed by the Commission in December 2003 should be seen as a complement to and an improvement on the existing guidelines. It aims at explicitly incorporating the ten new Member States into the priority projects, as well as the incorporation of essential energy connections with third countries."
"As to the choice of the projects, we have proposed to introduce a top-down approach, identifying the projects of highest priority on the priority axes from the larger family of projects of common interest."
"The projects of European interest are those of highest priority."
"They have the objective of supporting the rapid implementation of the most important cross-border interconnection capacity."
"To achieve this aim, the projects of European interest need to comply with special criteria."
"They must be situated on a priority axis. They are of a cross-border nature or have significant impact on cross-border transmission capacity."
"They must be mature: that means that a firm commitment must exist to start before the end of 2006 and that the projects need to be completed by 2010 at the latest."
"Another essential element of our proposal is the European Coordinator."
"The European Coordinator will encourage cooperation with users and operators, and promote the projects amongst private investors and financial institutions."
"A coordinator may be designated by the Commission and will act in the name of, and on behalf of, the Commission."
"I now look forward with great interest to your debate on the proposal."
". Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his kind remarks."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let me also express my deepest gratitude to my fellow rapporteurs for their opinions, which have been in my mind throughout my considerations and which have made a considerable contribution to the report that I am presenting today."
"I would also like to thank the representatives of the European Commission and the representatives of the Council for their attention and for their answers to the many questions we have raised."
"Finally, my thanks go to the secretariat of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and to my assistant for the help that they have given me."
"Commissioner, you recalled the objectives of this proposal for a decision."
"They are to adapt the guidelines to the shape of the European Union of 25 Member States, to authorise the financing of common-interest projects, to make it possible to create an internal market for gas and electricity and, principally, to ensure that there is security of supply via interconnections between the Member States and with neighbouring countries: south-east Europe, the Mediterranean countries, Ukraine, Belarus."
"This approach to the trans-European energy networks corresponds, in fact, to the approach taken for the trans-European land transport networks."
"A majority of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy supports the new ideas introduced by the European Commission to define the action priorities, particularly the description of projects of European interest located on high-priority routes and the appointment of a European coordinator, provided, however, that this is limited to complex projects that present particularly difficult implementation conditions and that it occurs in consultation with the Member States."
"Parliament must also be consulted on the appointment of the coordinator, which is the aim of the amendment proposed by my group."
"The report voted for by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy encourages the Member States to cooperate amongst themselves when this is made necessary by the implementation of transnational enquiry procedures taking into account decisive criteria, such as security of supply, the project’s impact on the environment, the opinion of the inhabitants of the territory concerned, and so on."
"On the basis of information provided by the Council, the Committee on Industry felt that the Council’s recommended approach was consistent and made it possible to simplify the Commission’s original proposal."
"Thus, the report voted for by the Committee on Industry establishes a hierarchy of projects: common-interest projects that form the basis of the trans-European projects are listed in Annex III and priority projects described as projects of European interest are listed in Annex I."
"The Committee on Industry did not want to call into question the projects established by the Member States, because it felt that it did not have sufficient competence or information to assess the choice of projects."
"Nevertheless, following comments made by some of my fellow Members, I would like to ask the European Commission to verify the validity of the projects when this decision is applied."
"By way of example, our fellow Members from the Baltic States think that it would be more appropriate to have a gas transport network crossing the Baltic States to supply them, rather than an offshore network in the Baltic."
"As another example, the EHT line between France and Spain is giving rise to very forceful protests from the inhabitants of the region."
"That is why the financial package allocated to these projects should be increased to EUR 60 million, which would make it possible, for example, to respond better to environmental constraints, which may require more thorough feasibility studies."
"It is a matter of validating the projects, of coordinating the procedures for consultation between the Member States, of finding the most appropriate technical solutions."
"Before I finish, I would also like to stress the fact that the Committee on Industry views the inclusion of the transport of olefins in this text as justified not only in view of the importance of such networks in Europe for the European chemical industry, but also in view of the gains in terms of safety and the environment that would result from a reduction in road transport."
"Besides access to the European Investment Bank, the reference to olefin-related projects guarantees a symbolic European label."
"It does not, however, enable these projects to benefit from European subsidies under the budget for trans-European networks."
"I think it is also necessary to consider the integration of the trans-European energy networks into the European corridors that have been proposed for the land transport sector."
". Madam President, I would like to thank the Commission and the committee responsible for the work they have accomplished, and it should be emphasised that the directive which we are to discuss today is particularly important in taking the European Union’s physical integration a stage further."
"I would, however, like to draw your attention to a few aspects which might stand in the way of achieving the tasks advanced in the directive."
"Thus, creating interconnections in structured supply systems is not always in the interests of those suppliers who dominate in any particular region."
"In such cases, investment in interconnections must be assessed from the perspective of medium-term and long-term returns."
"This requires market principles to be replaced by long-term planning methods to guarantee security of supply for consumers and environmental protection."
"The thinking is similar when an interconnection has to be created in the interests of security of supply, to overcome an inadequacy of production capacity."
"In such cases it is not always possible to adhere to market principles, as the time required for recovering the investments may not correspond to the objectives of a participant in the competitive market."
"In cases where creating new interconnections is not in the interests of participants in the electricity market, creating network elements may be a public service obligation for system operators."
"Therefore, the choice of the priority interconnection elements of trans-European networks which will be created with the financial support of the European Union should not only be a matter for commercial competition between regions and Member States, as appears from the approach offered by the directive."
"When making its choice of priority network elements, the European Commission must be guided by the interests of medium-term and long-term security of supply and the creation of the European Union internal market."
"The European Parliament ought to retain a supervisory role over this process through the budget procedure."
"In this connection, I should like to draw attention to the fact that the three Baltic States are totally isolated from the European Union’s electricity and gas market."
"Since Soviet times they have been in a joint electricity supply network with Russia."
"This ought to be a priority task, a priority area where interconnections should be created."
". Madam President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Laperrouze and thanking her for her spirit of cooperation during the production of this report."
"The importance of this proposal stems from the fact that the development of interconnections is a necessary condition for the creation of a genuine internal market in energy."
"Furthermore, the interconnections will provide us with better guarantees for dealing with occasional situations of scarcity of electricity supply."
"As has been pointed out, following the informal three-way dialogue with the Council and the Commission, it was not possible to reach an agreement with Parliament at first reading."
"We do not agree with the Council’s desire to eliminate projects of European interest and we support maintaining the categories of project advocated by the rapporteur."
"We also support the rapporteur’s amendment that modifies the text relating to the post of European coordinator, maintaining the amendment approved in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, to the effect that the coordinator should be appointed for those projects that raise difficulties and that Parliament should be consulted in relation to the appointment of the coordinator, something that was approved in the case of the trans-European transport networks."
"I would like to highlight a very important amendment, presented and approved in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"I am talking about a new recital 2(a) which takes up the objective established by the Barcelona European Council that electrical interconnections between the Member States should account for 10% of installed generation capacity."
"It only remains for me to applaud the Commission’s proposal for a Regulation, which is being debated, on the funding of the trans-European transport and energy networks."
"That proposal, for the first time, provides for the co-funding of projects in the field of energy and not just preliminary studies."
"I trust that this will be taken into account when establishing the financial perspectives for 2007-2013 because, if the budgetary allocation is reduced, this and all of the European Union’s programmes, such as Rural Development, Life, Trans-European Networks and the Seventh Framework Research Project, will be negatively affected."
". Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with warm thanks to Mrs Laperrouze for the splendid work she has done and above all for the collegial spirit in which all groups were enabled to have input into the report."
"The report is, I think, a good one, in that it clarifies our need for more trans-European energy networks if we are to achieve the Lisbon goals, which have to do with making our continent more competitive."
"Two things are clear: firstly, that networks are needed within Europe, and secondly, that there is no guarantee that they will be problem-free."
"Far from it: it follows that integrated networks can result in a problem transferring itself to other networks, although security of supply is generally enhanced."
"What is also needed is an increased supply in the shape of the diversified supply of energies, especially of course of crude oil and natural gas."
"I will take this as an opportunity to observe that you, Commissioner, someone whose dedication I otherwise greatly respect, were not present at the commissioning of the important pipeline from Baku to Ceyhan by way of Tbilisi."
"The presidents of the countries involved were there, as was the Energy Secretary of the United States of America, but there was, alas, no sign of Europe’s Energy Commissioner or, indeed, any other Commissioner."
"When such an important pipeline is built in a region covered by the European Union’s neighbourhood policy, connecting a potential Member State of the European Union, or at any rate a country with candidate status, I would have liked the photograph to include you – not just because I like seeing you in pictures, but because it would have had symbolic significance for the European public, indicating that this European Union of ours cares just as much about energy as does the administration of the United States."
"I am well aware that the American administration was behind the building of this pipeline, but we ought also to have made our presence visible."
"It may be that you were not invited or that you could not be there, but perhaps you could give a brief explanation of your absence either today or on some other occasion."
"There are two other things I would like to mention."
"You are quite right to say, Commissioner, that we have to bear in mind that there are certain projects of European interest, and that these must be supported accordingly."
"I agree that the European Coordinator can be important, and so I would like to endorse what has been said by certain Members, including Mrs Laperrouze, to the effect that this House needs to be consulted prior to his appointment, although the appointment itself is of course a matter for the Commission."
"To recapitulate, I believe that energy supply is vital to our continent’s competitiveness, that we need a diversity of sources of energy, including those from outside the EU, and I hope that Commissioner Piebalgs will be able to be present the next time an important pipeline is opened, thereby demonstrating the importance of energy supply to Europe."
". A possible solution for the assurance of security of the gas supply at the cross-country level has been on our minds for quite a time, as well as the solutions for the security and diversification of the supply to the Baltic region of the European Union."
"The speaker has also noted this matter in her speech today."
"Two projects have been included in the priority list of the guidelines under consideration, that is, the Northern Trans-European gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany and the Yamal-Europe transit gas pipeline route to Germany via Belarus and Poland."
"The list of projects of general importance includes the Amber Project, a gas pipeline from Russia to Germany via the territories of Latvia, Lithuania and Poland."
"Naturally, the specific routes of pipelines result from particular agreements between the gas companies and the countries concerned; however, I would like to point out that the Northern Trans-European transit gas pipeline project partially disregards the interests and needs of all European Union states along the pipeline route that are concerned with the supply of gas."
"The 2nd project of the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline fails to meet the provisions for gas supply safety as it crosses the territory of Belarus, and we should remember the blocking of the gas supply via Belarus in February 2004."
"We need an additional merger of the gas system of Eastern and Western Europe so as to ensure the safe provision of natural gas to consumers, to create a common and functioning gas market and satisfy the growing need of the European Union for natural gas in the mid- and long-term outlook; therefore, I propose to enter the Amber Pipeline from Russia to the European Union into the first appendix of the list of general significance projects, that is, the list of priority projects, as a possible alternative for Yamal II, while passing a new decision concerning the Council and European Parliament project."
"Such a merger complies with the priorities set out in the Community guidelines in 2003 and indicated in the project under deliberation."
"Such a gas pipeline route would also make a sound contribution to the settlement of security problems of the European Union and the Baltic region in particular."
". Madam President, let me make one thing clear: we are not, in this instance, talking in terms of publicly-owned infrastructure; on the contrary, the networks under discussion, which are to be further developed, are to a large degree owned by the private sector in the shape of big energy suppliers."
"This is what makes this debate so very different from that on the transport networks."
"We repudiate Mrs Laperrouze’s report, certain aspects of which we have not, despite our efforts, succeeded in improving."
"It is our belief that this wish list of 300 projects of European interest will do no more than make the hearts of the energy supply companies – which, in Europe, amount to oligopolies – beat faster, and will be more likely to give additional power and influence to European energy suppliers, who are already too powerful in acting against the market, and we do not believe that benefiting such businesses’ interests alone will bring us any closer to security of supply."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me, too, start by extending warm thanks to the rapporteur and to all the shadow rapporteurs for the excellent work they have done and also for their willingness to engage in dialogue on this issue."
"Today, we are debating the establishment of guidelines for trans-European energy networks."
"The decision we reach concerning these guidelines will determine the future development of a modern infrastructure for trans-European energy networks."
"I would like to use this short speech to highlight something that matters particularly to me, namely the decision to incorporate, for the first time, what are known as olefin gas pipelines into the trans-European energy networks."
"While I agree with the rapporteur that this is of great importance in terms of Europe’s success as an industrial and business location, the Commission proposal does have what I regard as the unfortunate disadvantage of not specifying individual stretches, and, on behalf of my group, I have tabled Amendment 39 in order to remedy this defect."
"There are already some individual olefin gas networks in the European Union; they are to be found in the west of our continent and in the new Member States, but there is no link between the two."
"Amendment 39, which I will again take this opportunity of urging you to support, lists a number of selected stretches that could be used to bridge these gaps without delay and in a sustainable manner, thereby securing the supply of olefin gases and keeping our businesses viable."
"It is clear – in view of the paucity of funds available – that not every project can be supported, and my amendment is not, indeed, concerned with financial support for the stretches named in it."
"My concern is that there should be a clear statement of policy and an indication that these stretches are of particular significance to the European Union and its Member States."
"It is for that reason that I again urge you to lend your support to Amendment 39 when we vote tomorrow."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the trans-European networks are important for achieving the Lisbon objectives."
"Energy brings synergy. The TEN-E networks in the energy sector will play an important role in the liberalisation of the internal market and in improving operational reliability, as they will enable the EU to connect to suppliers outside the Union."
"The energy networks should not, however, be treated in the same way as trans-European transport networks."
"Transport networks are part of the general infrastructure, whereas the TEN-E networks are in private ownership."
"Accordingly, public funds for the energy networks should be spent mainly on planning and research."
"In any case, this sum of money is so small for the Union’s energy networks that it will not be a critical factor when investment decisions are being made."
"A Coordinator would hardly be of any great value either: it would simply create a new organisational level once again."
"In matters of expertise just a little money should bear fruit."
"As far as certain details in the report are concerned, I am suspicious about mentioning the priority projects as proposed by the Commission."
"Their preparation has not been systematic: in practice it has been quite random."
"Do not let us emphasise the status of certain projects, then, but above all, the importance of Union-wide investigations into what we should invest in."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we all the while need to ensure that the operational reliability of energy does not lead to wastefulness, but savings."
"According to new estimates, all energy sources apart from renewables may run out within a few generations, depending on levels of consumption."
". Madam President, I wish to thank Members for a fruitful debate."
"However, we should be very honest in looking at the trans-European networks in the energy field."
"It is clearly a necessity because the security of our energy supplies depends on our energy networks, and on interconnection as the most important part of it."
"When we speak about a competitive market, again interconnection is an absolute necessity."
"From this point of view, I cannot accept that there should be no policies at the European level."
"So the guidelines are clearly there to justify our approach."
"We spend EUR 20 million a year on trans-European energy networks."
"The money is for feasibility studies and perhaps in the future we can provide support for the projects."
"There have been advocates from the Baltic States for particular projects."
"At this stage it is clear, as one Member said, that the Baltic States are like an isolated island: there is no interconnection of electricity."
"There will be interconnection from Estonia to Finland."
"However, the PowerBridge Project between Lithuania and Poland will never be a reality unless there is Community support for trans-European networks in energy."
"I strongly advocate the approach we have delivered."
"Concerning broader support for energy, we definitely need to diversify our supplies."
"For this reason we are working with all the countries and also with Azerbaijan, which I visited."
"No European company was involved, but we need to be involved from the beginning."
"Four countries have signed the Treaty."
"The Commission could not do so, but we are interested in this project because it concerns oil that that will be used by customers."
"We are interested in gas supplies but, at the same time, as we are not financing the project we cannot expect to take all the credit."
"Therefore, we are thinking about diversifying our security supplies."
"At the same time, as I mentioned, the main sources of investment are from private investors."
"Therefore the private investors should invest in the project and the Commission, through these guidelines, should provide the necessary political input."
"So I am very grateful for today’s debate."
"We will continue our work."
"I wish to thank in particular the rapporteur, Mrs Laperrouze."
"As concerns olefin and Amendment 39, I am sorry to say that at this stage the Commission simply notes the importance of olefin networks, without going into detail about the priority sections of this network, which will have to be assessed by the European Investment Bank for every specific proposal for financing."
"Therefore, the Commission does not propose a financing intervention by means of European Community money."
"For this reason, we cannot support Amendment 39."
"However, as I mentioned, the Commission’s and Parliament’s proposal are very close."
"I wish to thank Parliament again for its very close cooperation."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A6-0130/2005) by Mrs Rothe, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on energy end-use efficiency and energy services (COM(2003)0739 – C5-0642/2003 – 2003/0300(COD))."
". First of all I would like to thank Mrs Rothe for her excellent work in producing this report."
"I would also like to thank the other members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy who have drafted amendments and worked to improve the Commission proposal."
"Many of these amendments will strengthen and add coherence to the proposal."
"As you know, I consider energy efficiency in the Union to be a priority area for Community energy policy."
"I am gratified that the European Parliament strongly shares this view."
"The proposal for a directive on energy end-use efficiency and energy services can prove to be one of the most effective tools at our disposal, not only as a means of combating climate change and improving competitiveness, but for improving our security of supply, increasing employment within the EU and establishing a viable market for energy efficiency."
"As you know the Commission is also in the process of preparing a Green Paper on energy efficiency."
"This paper is designed to stimulate public debate on the usefulness of improving energy efficiency in the European Union and the best way to do this."
"The debate on the Green Paper will also focus attention on the energy services proposal and on its role."
"The proposal for a directive on energy end-use efficiency and energy services has several important objectives and means to achieve these objectives: it sets uniform energy savings targets to be achieved in each Member State through improved energy efficiency and energy services; it is also designed to stimulate market development for energy services and for energy efficiency in general; it applies to distribution and retail sales to most final customers of most types of end-use energy, such as electricity, gas, district heating, heating oil, and most of the transport fuel sector."
"It is ‘fuel neutral’ in that it seeks to improve energy efficiency regardless of the primary energy involved."
"We have also proposed that Member States place an obligation on their energy distributors or retailers above a certain size, requiring them to offer their end-use customers energy efficiency measures or, alternatively, fulfil other energy efficiency obligations, while allowing the necessary flexibility."
"The proposal also sets forth requirements for Member States to promote financial instruments for saving energy, such as performance contracting and third-party financing contracts; to improve metering and consumer information; and to promote the certification of energy service providers and improve the quality and use of energy audits."
"The proposal also provides for Member State regulators to improve their distribution tariff structures when possible, in order to promote energy efficiency."
"Two issues that were discussed extensively in the European Parliament and in the Council were the compulsory character of the targets and the measurement systems for energy efficiency achievements."
"Throughout the debates in Parliament and in the Council, the Commission has maintained its position on the importance of mandatory targets, for both the overall target and for the public sector target."
"As regards measuring efficiency, Mrs Rothe’s report points out that a system with bottom-up measurement provides the necessary accuracy and robustness and can be further developed with comitology."
"We also believe that comitology is the way forward because these issues would be too technical and detailed for coping with in the codecision process."
"We do, however, see a need to maintain some top-down measurements."
"I will have the opportunity later to comment in more detail on the amendments put forward to this House but I would like already to say that the Parliamentary debates in committee have been extremely constructive, and that we have appreciated in particular the efforts of the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs in developing a coherent and consistent report, with many constructive amendment proposals."
"I look forward to the debate you will have on the proposal."
". Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that the Commission should present this proposal for a directive on energy efficiency and energy services was a matter of urgent necessity."
"This House had already, and repeatedly, called on the Commission to respond to the creation of the single internal market in electricity and gas by proposing concrete measures to deal with demand, the minimal use we at present make of what is almost our largest energy resource being indefensible."
"All reputable studies indicate that total energy end-use consumption in the European Union could be reduced by between 20% and 30% without harming the economy or reducing comfort; the technology available makes savings of over 40% possible."
"Knowing as we do that we are increasingly dependent on imports, some of them from regions in crisis, and that our current use of energy is a significant factor in climate problems, we are obliged to get started with a real policy for energy efficiency and energy saving."
"As Commissioner Piebalgs said, that also means a policy that deals with climate change, a policy for improving security of supply, and a policy for something that is part of the Lisbon strategy, namely the creation of many new jobs."
"Hundreds and thousands of new jobs are to be created in this sector."
"So I really am grateful to the Commission for producing this directive, and to Commissioner Piebalgs; I really do appreciate, Commissioner, your desire – which you have expressed on many occasions – to attach such special importance to energy efficiency, and to present a Green Paper on the subject before long."
"In this proposal for a directive, the Commission has – as the Commissioner has just said – put forward binding targets, and I am glad that the Committee has done as I suggested and kept these targets binding; indeed, it has gone further in making appropriate increases to the targets proposed by the Commission, whilst allowing the Member States the greater flexibility of reporting on three periods of three years each rather than on an annual basis."
"If, as the Commissioner has just said, the Commission wants to give rather greater emphasis to the top-down model, the targets will have to be the subject of renewed discussion, for the more the top-down approach is adopted, the higher the targets will have to be."
"The initial line taken by the Committee is that we want to keep doing things from the bottom up."
"None of the Member States will find it difficult to make energy savings of between 3% and 4.5% by means of concrete measures over a period of three years."
"Let me state again, for the sake of clarity, that it is not the total energy consumption that is to be reduced; rather, the intention is that the concrete measures ensure that savings can be made, so that if, for example, total energy consumption increases in line with economic development, the increase would have been greater had these measures not been in place."
"Matters will also be made easier for some Member States by the calculation taking into account the continuing effects of saving measures taken earlier."
"We also – and this too is important – agree with the Commission that the public services should lead by example – a role laid down for them already in other directives."
"I am confident that this House’s vote tomorrow will send a clear message to the Council, and will call on it not to take refuge in the ‘take it or leave it’ approach."
"I am also confident that we can do this with a broad majority."
"I would like to take this opportunity to say a really very big thank you to the shadow rapporteurs – Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca, Mrs Hall, and Mr Turmes – for their cooperation, which was really excellent and also resulted in the drafting of a compromise, which we are putting before you."
"The Committee had, in its voting, to decide between two approaches: one was the one I have already described, which involves the Member States taking action to meet clear and binding targets, and the other was that of applying benchmarks."
"We have already put before you a compromise providing, in the first instance, for binding targets to be applicable, to be followed by the setting of benchmarks in all areas, which – time-consuming and far from simple though this will be – will enable the targets to be met."
". Madam President, first of all I should like to thank Mrs Rothe for the dedication she has shown in producing this report."
"In stating its position, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has mainly emphasised the cost-effective approach towards energy efficiency."
"In addition, we have proposed a number of amendments, on a few key points of which there is, fortunately agreement, but the Committee believes that ultimate proposal does not go far enough, particularly with regard to the flexibility that we have to offer to the Member States where the objectives of energy efficiency are concerned."
"Consideration should be given to the different degrees of energy efficiency that exist in the Member States."
"I am pleased, though, with compromise amendment 107, because it provides, or at least provide, more flexibility for national objectives."
"That is in itself a good thing, but we should not at the same time stand by the compulsory objectives for each Member State and consequently keep the door open to uniform compulsory objectives being prescribed for each country."
"I do not think, therefore, that we should abide by the obligation in this respect."
"Secondly, it is important for SMEs – which make a considerable contribution in reducing energy consumption – to be guaranteed a major role in the market."
"The requirement that energy suppliers provide free energy audits would harm SMEs and it is therefore a good thing that this has been abolished."
"Thirdly, this leads the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to believe that we must promote a cost-effective approach."
"It is of major importance for energy efficiency to go hand in hand with sound cost-benefit analysis."
"The proposal to introduce benchmarks will certainly encourage the spread of best practice, but it is important to set up a possible benchmark system in such a way as to ensure that it does not produce paperwork that cancels out the value added by the benchmarks."
". Madam President, we are dealing with a subject that is central to climate policy."
"The energy services directive is intended to supplement the directive on emissions trading by directing savings measures to areas beyond its scope and to continue the energy savings process among end-users."
"As the person delivering the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I myself had hoped that this would have provided an opportunity to correct the problems and distortions of competition which the directive on emissions trading contains."
"Now there is much that is good about the directive, for which I wish to thank Mrs Rothe, but I shall address its biggest problem."
"I opposed common savings targets for all Member States to the very last, because I believed they would punish countries in which energy saving measures had already been undertaken for a long time."
"It is perhaps paradoxical, but when we treat Member States uniformly we accord them unequal status."
"For that reason, I would have liked to refer the Article relating to savings obligations back to the Commission so that a system that takes account of each country’s different potential for saving energy might be created."
"The Committee on the Environment approved the Commission’s equal savings targets."
"I am not objecting to the ambitious nature of the savings, but their unfairness."
"Once again they are being wrongly allocated."
"Some countries have been set a very tough target; others, on the other hand, a ridiculously easy one."
"My own country, Finland, which has invested in the efficient use of energy for years now, is facing quite a different challenge from that which Poland, for example, is."
"In a common market, it is a matter of the distortion of competition when measures that have already been implemented are insufficiently taken into consideration and Member States are not given enough latitude."
"The proposal mentions taking early actions into account when reducing the fixed common target, but as long as it is not abundantly clear what the savings verification method is, nobody can know what measures will be approved."
"If my idea had been adopted, a study would have been conducted of the savings potential across Europe, and savings targets would have been allocated on a country-by-country basis, according to each country’s savings potential."
"This way we would have been acting even more ambitiously than now, and, even better, in a sustainable way."
"I regret that what we now have is a weak compromise."
"The issue may well have been considered urgent, but too much haste can be costly, to the extent that it could lead to conciliation with the Council."
". Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Rothe and all the shadow rapporteurs who have participated in the production of the report for their willingness to seek points of agreement."
"It has been a pleasure, as always, to work with such constructive and reasonable colleagues."
"As Mrs Rothe has already explained, after a long negotiation we have reached a satisfactory agreement on the proposal for a Directive."
"I believe that this compromise demonstrates the enormous importance that all of us who have participated in the discussion attach to the issue of energy efficiency, as well as considerable agreement on the objectives of this piece of legislation."
"Security of supply and fulfilment of the objectives we have established in relation to climate change, not to mention those laid down in the Lisbon Agenda, oblige us to take a multi-dimensional approach to energy policy."
"I believe that it is important to stress the necessary balance between the establishment of ambitious and realistic general European objectives and their flexible adaptation to the specific situation of each Member State."
"It is fair to acknowledge that some countries have made considerable efforts in the past, which have led to undeniable improvements in energy efficiency, and these achievements must be recognised when it comes to deciding on the objectives to be fulfilled."
"It is also important to make it clear that the ultimate purpose of this directive is not exclusively to reduce consumption, since in countries in which there are significant sources free of emissions it is perfectly acceptable to take a more flexible approach which is more in line with their economic growth needs."
"Madam President, I am pleased to reiterate my group’s satisfaction with this new step towards the goal, which we all want to achieve, of combining security of supply, protection of the environment and the competitiveness of the Union’s economy in the global market."
". Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my group supports all possible energy saving schemes."
"They are vital for us to be able to achieve the Kyoto objectives and reduce our dependence on imported energy."
"Mrs Rothe has undertaken a mammoth task, and I thank her for it."
"She has had very broad support for her proposal."
"The compromises have not come about easily, but now they have the support of the major political groups."
"The proposal entering the debate is an ambitious one."
"The proposals for energy saving targets, in particular, are even tougher than those in the Commission’s proposal."
"Trans-European objectives are a good thing."
"We have seen that, without them, Member States wriggle out of their responsibilities over and over again."
"The fact is, however, that the position of the Member States in this respect varies considerably from one to another."
"This proposal will cost my country a lot of money, as we drew up a list of considerable savings measures a long time ago."
"In fact, we were got started too early, and now we have to pay the price for that a second time."
"An annual 1% savings target is therefore unfair, because for Finland that would mean increasing the present costs of financing energy saving by 450 million to a billion euros."
"It is my sincere hope that we will see a change, and that one day, ladies and gentlemen, we will all be prepared to support directives which seem inevitable but which cost our own country very much when the circumstances are so unfavourable."
"I would like to point out that we have implemented all the directives that are connected with the Lisbon process."
". Madam President, we need this European directive first and foremost because of what the United Kingdom scientific adviser has called the ‘elephant in the living room’; that is, the enormous threat posed by climate change which we largely pretend not to notice, even though it is sitting massively in front of us."
"We also need this directive because of a large and growly bear in our living room."
"That bear is the threat to our energy supply."
"By 2020, Europe will be 90% dependent on Russia for oil."
"Already we get a quarter of our oil and half our gas from Russia. The easiest way to lessen our energy dependency is by using less energy."
"This directive will give a clear framework in which companies dealing in energy efficiency can operate and compete."
"I welcome, in particular, the provisions for accurate metering and billing."
"In the United Kingdom, the single biggest cause of consumer debt is the arrival of a sudden, enormous utility bill on the doorstep."
"The requirement for regular bills, based on actual consumption, will put an end to that problem."
"The targets in this directive are not ambitious; they are way below what is technologically possible."
"The advantage of sticking with these modest targets is that they are absolutely realistic and attainable."
"There are whispers coming from the Council that higher targets might be acceptable if they were merely indicative, not mandatory."
"But high targets are meaningless if they are just a wish list."
"The incoming United Kingdom presidency has declared that tackling climate change will be a top priority."
"It would be tragic and hypocritical if a knee-jerk reaction against making anything mandatory at a European level were to be allowed to be jeopardise that commitment on climate change."
"I hope that we in the European Parliament will send the strongest possible message that mandatory targets on energy saving are necessary."
"Madam President, on behalf of my colleague Mr Turmes, who is stuck in a traffic jam on the motorway and is therefore unable to thank the rapporteur himself, I would like to convey the thanks of my Group for the very cooperative and productive work in producing this report."
"We believe this report succeeds in putting the demand side – rather than always the supply side – at the centre of energy strategy once and for all."
"That is something that has been neglected in many decades of debate on energy policy and we hope that with the Rothe Report we are now going on the offensive."
"Forty per cent potential savings is a great deal."
"Even for 20% to be economically feasible today without having to internalise the external costs is a tremendous challenge."
"I would like to say at this point that we have agreed to compromise and that we back the report."
"We do think, however, that these figures suggest that the Commission and the Council, too, really could be even more ambitious in this area."
"Let me say for Mr Paasilinna’s benefit that we do not believe that mandatory targets are damaging, and, if I understand things correctly, Finland, too, could still make enormous savings in heating alone."
"When I look at what the Berlin Energy Agency has achieved in energy efficiency, for example, then I wish people would follow Berlin’s example."
"We rather feel that energy services are the key to the future for energy efficiency."
"We believe we must create a market for energy services if our ambitious targets are to become reality."
"I believe economics and ecology can actually go in tandem again here, because if we tackle this single-mindedly then as well as enormous benefits for the environment we will also be able to create jobs, jobs in small and medium-sized firms."
"Mrs Rothe, the rapporteur, mentioned public buildings."
"We really must set an example here."
"We have been discussing it in Germany for a long time."
"We have already begun in Berlin, for example, but we have probably still not yet opened up all the potential there is in Germany."
"Finally, I would like to express my conviction that we will only really succeed in achieving the ambitious targets we are pursuing in the energy debate, that is independence and security of supply, and in overcoming the major risks, namely climate change and the nuclear risk, if we at last take energy saving and energy efficiency seriously and translate our fine, ambitious words into action."
"I am sure that Mr Piebalgs will be the first Commissioner in Europe to act rather than only talk."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the province of Upper Austria, from which I come, must surely be the world’s market leader in energy efficiency, and we have always concentrated on making that energy efficiency as economic as possible, in other words making it meet the Lisbon criteria."
"We all know that the cost of saving is now lower than the cost of new production."
"It follows that taking action to save energy also promotes growth and employment."
"In principle, however, we are against mandatory or binding targets."
"We should concentrate more on incentives and we should in particular see to it that account is also taken of Member States’ inputs, in my province, for example, that now has far fewer opportunities at the margins than others."
"We should also establish precisely who could achieve what savings with a benchmark system."
"Most important of all, we need a system of tried and tested practice."
"We need to learn, not only in Europe but across the world."
"Worldwide learning is crucial here."
"That is why I would like to recommend to Commissioner Piebalgs the establishment of a prize for energy efficiency for which the whole world can compete, so that we can become acquainted with the best models from all over the world and put them into use as quickly and efficiently as possible; that way, we in Europe, too, will be able to create new jobs and growth in this new sector."
"Perhaps we could also have an impact analysis of this sector so we can learn which measures have the most efficient and quickest effect."
"We should also look back over the past 10 years and compare the different Member States, also making comparisons on a world scale; that will give us a basis for the next 10 years for negotiating the targets we want to set and above all for deciding whether there is a place for incentives such as the ‘Intelligent Energy’ Programme, for example."
"Madam President, if I may come straight to the point, we are, today, saying a heartfelt ‘yes’ to a European approach for more efficient energy use, but I should like to start by congratulating Mrs Rothe and the Commission on the proposal and the report on energy efficiency."
"The more efficient use of energy is in all our interests; we all stand to benefit from it."
"Greater efficiency means a reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases, which, in turn, helps us meet our Kyoto obligations."
"Consumers and governments save on their energy bills, and energy-efficient companies become more competitive."
"Innovation is the key word here and I unreservedly endorse the top runner principle in Amendment 96."
"Critics who view this proposal as needless interference from Brussels in their domestic affairs forget the unfortunate fact that, without external pressure, too little is done in order to make our energy consumption more efficient, but I think that Mr Piebalgs’ top down approach should be complemented by its opposite."
"Amendment 45 challenges enterprises to come up with all kinds of proposals on more efficient energy consumption."
"I wholeheartedly support the Commission in its endeavour to get Member State governments to lead by example."
"Governments are ideally placed to make investments in energy efficiency that are unprofitable in the short term but that are recovered in the longer term."
"Whether by purchasing clean and economical official cars, refuse lorries, electronic equipment or investing in energy-efficient buildings, governments are ideally placed to address this problem."
"In this context, I also think that we as European institutions have an additional responsibility."
"Not only should we impose obligations on the Member States, we must also accept the challenge to enhance our own energy efficiency."
"I suggest that the European Commission, Parliament and the Council all compete against each other to find out which is the most energy-efficient institution."
"The outcome could be presented to the public and press during next year’s Green Week, and, while I am on this subject, I should like to say that I think there is room for an improvement of over 30% in the new Parliament building."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, as things stand in the market, and in light of the supply model in most EU countries, we will only be able to achieve a sustainable European energy policy if there is a considerable increase in energy end-use efficiency."
"Consequently, the proposal by the Commission on which this report is based, albeit only one element of a much broader body of legislation, represents a key step on the road towards achieving this objective."
"This issue is all the more crucial given the fact that energy efficiency levels are known to vary a great deal between the Member States. This creates discrepancies and, worse, waste, which is utterly unjustifiable in the context of a future internal market."
"The model proposed by the Commission is based on rules that are clearly laid down, yet it is also sufficiently flexible and workable, and will encourage the 25 Member States to save energy."
"Mrs Rothe approaches the issue from both a global and a specific perspective, which is welcome and helpful."
"Proposing more ambitious targets for energy saving – and structuring those targets on three different levels – enshrines active intervention on Parliament’s part. This sends out a clear message to the Council that the Union’s energy policy aims are being complied with."
"Also relevant and worthy of note are the objectives set for the public sector – which are even more ambitious – and the creation of an energy efficiency fund accessible to every supplier of energy services, which will benefit households and small and medium-sized businesses, although it must be acknowledged that implementing them will be no easy task."
"Given the current state of economic development and the practical realities of the internal energy market, further incentives must be put in place to encourage energy efficiency."
"Global energy policy is about far more than efficiency, however. It is increasingly based on ever-broader new energy sources, and on the safe integration of the Trans-European networks, a philosophy that corresponds to the way in which the transport networks currently operate, as has been mentioned in this House."
"It is also essential to move towards tariff and contract harmonisation, thereby giving real dimension to European energy policy."
"Madam President, I welcome this directive, as it will primarily help energy users to reduce and monitor their electricity consumption."
"This measure will require companies to give energy consumers accurate information to allow them to regulate consumption, compare their consumption with a normal user in a similar building and in an ecologically efficient building, and assess the environmental impact of, for example, the CO2 emission levels of the energy they consume."
"Consumers deserve to have full and fair information on their energy use."
"The UK gas and energy watchdog, Energywatch, does an excellent job in giving information to consumers."
"For example, if you type in your postcode on their website you can find out who is your cheapest supplier."
"We all know that efficiency is absolutely essential."
"I hope implementation of this directive will be fast-tracked in Britain to make it easier for consumers to play their part in reducing energy consumption and tackling climate change."
"The directive will require the introduction of smart metering services that allow consumers to check at a glance how much energy they are using and how much it will cost."
"The new meters are obviously part of a package of measures that will also force energy companies for the first time to give individual consumers accurate and detailed bills, along with information about the environmental impact of their energy use."
"Climate change is one of the fundamental challenges facing us today and it is vital that we reduce carbon emissions across Europe to help meet this challenge."
"Progress in this area will require radical changes and investment decisions and behaviour by governments and individual households."
"This directive will enable people and businesses to assess accurately the environmental and financial impacts of their energy consumption and make informed choices on how to reduce such impacts."
"I fully support this directive and I welcome the work of the rapporteur."
". Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Rothe again for her very important work in Parliament."
"I would also like to thank Mrs Wortmann-Kool and Mrs Korhola for their contribution to this well-prepared report."
"I will start where I see more support in the European Parliament."
"In some cases doubts have been expressed about the need for energy efficiency, at least in the form proposed."
"It is an important, timely and necessary proposal, although perhaps a bit late in the day."
"First of all, concerning the security of energy supplies, there are limited possibilities for the supply side."
"We should address the demand side: this is where we should focus our attention."
"The second issue which is extremely popular with Member States, at least theoretically, is the climate change issue."
"But the achievement of climate change goals is impossible without firmly addressing energy efficiency issues."
"We can indicate that if the target of 1% per year of energy efficiency were achieved, we could save around 50% of the European Union’s Kyoto goals."
"This is an extremely important issue."
"Without addressing energy efficiency firmly we cannot achieve these goals."
"Sometimes it is perceived that energy efficiency is against the Lisbon goals or against our competitiveness."
"Quite the opposite."
"It is the only way to go forward because climate change is a global issue and if we get competitive development in this field, we will definitely be competitive leaders in the world."
"So it provides more opportunities than the cost involved."
"Regarding mandatory targets, I very much welcome Parliament’s approach."
"I think a mandatory target is a must."
"First of all, we do not have very good experience with indicative targets; but secondly, in the energy efficiency area as it relates to all areas, mandatory targets are providing a sustainable policy."
"I salute the proposal of the Parliament to be more flexible about the scope and level of the target."
"I would say the Parliament is more demanding than the Commission."
"I congratulate Parliament on that, but we think that our figures are perhaps more modest, but at the same time generally well defendable in the Council."
"So, there is no difficulty with a three times three years proposal."
"I think it gives some necessary flexibility, but at the same time 3, 4 or 5% with a bottom-up approach means a lot."
"It is a really demanding target and we shall have to see whether it is achievable."
"Concerning the issue of one target or individual targets, I am in favour of the general approach of one target."
"Some of the speakers mentioned that we have a different situation, one country has done more, another less."
"If we compare, for example, new and old Member countries, the energy consumption per capita in the new Member countries is lower."
"There are huge possibilities, but it also shows that there is an opportunity for older Member States, so all Member States have the potential to achieve these targets."
"I think this is a less bureaucratic approach and is a policy throughout the Union, and the Member States that have invested in energy efficiency are gaining more and have more possibilities to achieve something in the energy efficiency field."
"There has been less debate on energy services, but I think that this part of the directive is also very important."
"If you personally look and see what has happened with energy services during your lifetime, you will see that not much has happened."
"So this directive is giving a necessary boost for the construction of energy services, because the market by itself has not provided this development."
"There have been some very good proposals from the Parliament, some of which could be acceptable."
"There are some very important issues relating to best practices."
"Each Member State can find something it has done in the energy efficiency area that could be used in other Member States."
"So it is very important at a European level, but also at Member State, regional and local levels because energy efficiency is an aspect of each of the operations or uses of energy using the equipment that we have."
"It means that we should involve the whole society in this process."
"At this stage it must be done in a very intelligent way, but not necessarily always through restrictions."
"I would like to thank the Parliament once again for its strong support for this very important directive and I hope that we will convince the Council about the mandatory targets."
"That is now the big challenge."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report by Mr Bösch, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on protecting the Community’s financial interests and fight against fraud (2004/2198(INI)) (A6-0151/2005)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although this report relates specifically to the budget year 2003, it is not intended as a snapshot; rather, it seeks to analyse failings and their causes over a longer period of time, to understand trends and learn from them for the future."
"We in the Committee on Budgetary Control are not contemporary historians; what we want to do here in this House is to prepare documents and adopt reports that will ultimately help to improve the fight against fraud and to improve the situation for European taxpayers."
"I believe this is of quite particular interest in the run up to a new financial period, a new Financial Perspective."
"I would also like to say to those taxpayers here today that we must clearly understand, to take only one example, that so long as we have policies like the payment of export refunds in agriculture, there will be fraud."
"It is an open invitation to fraud and we therefore need to put an end to these policies."
"We ought to think about this in connection with the forthcoming Financial Perspective."
"The year 2003 saw a slight decline in reported irregularities and fraud compared with the previous year: EUR 922 million compared to 1.15 billion."
"The long-term average is around 1 billion, far too much, of course, to be ultimately acceptable."
"Looking back over the years, we find a decline in reported irregularities in agriculture, with an almost equal rise in irregularities in the structural funds."
"One reason for this may be that the increased controls in agriculture are having a visible effect – often at the expense of small European farmers, and that, too, needs to be addressed here."
"On the other hand, it may be because the amount of structural fund payments has increased appreciably in the last few years."
"A second subject is recoveries – a truly timeless one, to judge by the European Court of Auditors’ latest report."
"I wonder what is the point of trying harder to prevent fraud if we have to wait decades for money that was wrongly paid out to be recovered."
"The Court of Auditors’ special report highlights the shocking scale of recoveries in agriculture."
"Between 1971 and 2004, EUR 3.1 billion of irregularities were reported in agriculture, only around one fifth of which were recovered."
"Some 70% of monies wrongly paid out have never found their way back to the EU budget."
"I believe there is reason enough for action here."
"The blame rests clearly with the Member States, and the European Parliament must make that clear."
"European money obviously ranks differently with the Member States than their own money."
"One final point that is emphasised in this Parliamentary report on fraud is the question of combating cigarette smuggling."
"We learn that cigarette smuggling is causing us tremendous losses, that the Member States are not cooperating with the European Union as much as they ought and that the Member States, and their finance ministers in particular, are still clinging to an incorrect and dangerous tax policy, always increasing tobacco duties when they need to plug a gap in national tax revenues."
"That is an invitation to organised crime and we are all – Member States and the European budget – the losers."
"It will be up to us as the European Union to develop appropriate strategies to prevent it."
". On behalf of the Commission, I welcome the report by Mr Bösch on the protection of the union’s financial interests and the battle against fraud."
"The report concentrates on the previous year."
"For me this has been a period of familiarisation with OLAF and the development of the European anti-fraud policy for the coming years."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bösch, for his constructive work."
"As I have repeatedly stated, I believe that OLAF also requires a stable and secure environment for its development."
"Next I will address some of the issues that I would like to examine in greater detail."
"First, in connection with the returning of payments, I welcome the responsibility of the Member States in this matter, as emphasised in the conclusions."
"The Commission is grateful for comments concerning the work of the joint working group formed between OLAF and the Directorate General for Agriculture in connection with cases of the returning of funds connected with the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, where Member States have made an application before 1999 concerning possible fraud or irregularities."
"The report notes the cooperations agreements concluded between Philip Morris International and the Swiss Confederation as successful examples."
"Both have been visible and tangible results in the struggle against fraud."
"I am grateful for complimentary comments and the support of the rapporteur in dealing with these cases."
"In connection with the agreements concluded between Philip Morris and the Swiss Confederation, I would like to emphasise the innovative nature of these agreements."
"The Commission finds that all of the other Member States could accede to the agreement."
"We hope that they will join Austria, Ireland, Malta and Poland, which have recently acceded."
"I also hope that the agreement concluded with Phillip Morris will serve as an example for the conclusion of similar agreements."
"In light of the upcoming hearing of OLAF in Parliament, the Commission and Parliament await the Court of Auditors’ report concerning the results of the management audit performed at OLAF."
"The hearing will offer the possibility for serious discussions of several matters raised in the report."
"This primarily concerns comments about the institutional organisation of OLAF and its complicated role in communicating with Member States’ corresponding organs and European Union institutions."
"At the hearing, which will take place in Parliament at the beginning of July, we will have the opportunity to examine the structure and organisation of OLAF in detail."
"I am grateful to you for organising the hearing, and I hope that the upcoming hearing will help us to find the best solutions for the development of OLAF."
"The Commission will attempt to do all in its power to ensure that the implementation of the conclusions of both this and previous reports correspond to the wishes of Parliament."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, the protection of the financial interests of the Communities, which is directly linked to the fight against fraud, constitutes a duty which is divided up between all of us, on the one hand, and the reasonable protection and expectation of citizens and society, on the other."
"Combating fraud must be considered a national and Community priority, not only of an economic but also of a cultural nature."
"It is a question of a general culture, over and above the question of unfair competition."
"In this direction, policy-making and the rules for applying policy are of paramount importance."
"One of the financial sectors which is in the limelight is the agricultural sector."
"It is a complex, multidimensional sector with dispersed social characteristics."
"The mid-term review of the CAP and the simplification promised are a positive starting point for the application of effective control and transparent management systems."
"Within the same framework, the recent agreement on a new financing regime for the CAP which, as you mentioned earlier, has already been decided by the Council of Ministers for Agriculture, appears to serve the same objectives of the simplification of procedures and the efficacy of the support provided."
"The application of new systems for managing the common market organisations depends on an additional effort by the Member States, who must always keep a more beneficial ratio between costs and anticipated benefits in mind."
"The simplification of the payment and control mechanisms must be promoted, so that there is a clear division between irregularity and fraud, especially in a complex sector such as agriculture."
"Nonetheless, the main responsibility lies with the Community institutions."
"Within the framework of their competences, they should act and cooperate for the benefit of the Union."
"The citizens' expectations are that we should have correct management of the resources of the European Union."
"To close, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his integrated proposal on the question of combating fraud and protecting the interests of the European Union."
". – As is clearly stated in the report in front of us, there is still much to do in the fight against fraud, especially when it comes to cigarette smuggling and use of European Union funds."
"I think, however, that it would not be right if we did not acknowledge the useful work being done in the fight against fraud, even, for example, in the new Member States where substantial progress on this matter has been noted by the national authorities."
"I would also like to welcome the useful work being done by OLAF, which is instrumental in this fight, and it is good to note that, at last, we are reaping the harvest of the investment we made by establishing OLAF."
"I am very much afraid, however, that there are still many who are trying to hinder the work of this office."
"OLAF was set up under the auspices of the three institutions."
"There is no reason, however, why it should not evolve into a completely independent office."
"Indeed, if we want OLAF to be more effective, we need to allow it to work independently."
"To be effective, OLAF needs less interference and less political pressure when it comes both to the appointments made to it and to the investigations it conducts."
"I wish to remind the House that, in speaking about fighting fraud, we are referring not only to protecting the financial interests of the European Union or national public finances."
"More than anything else, we are also talking about people’s interests as tax payers who want to see the tax burden shouldered fairly and not increased on account of those who evade taxes through smuggling or by abusing European Union funds."
"At a time when Europe is going through a difficult period where public opinion is concerned, we must make great efforts to be more effective in the fight against fraud."
". Mr President, in expressing my appreciation of Mr Herbert Bösch’s extraordinarily thorough, thought-provoking and forward-thinking report – on which I also heartily congratulate him – I am speaking not so much in my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, or as spokesperson of the Socialist Group."
"Instead, on behalf of Hungary, as a new Member State, and all the new Member States, I would like to emphasise the concrete significance for us, both in theoretical and practical terms, of protecting the European Union’s financial interests and fighting fraud."
"We, too, participate in the expenditure of EU budgetary resources by Member States; the body responsible for ensuring the lawful and efficient use of EU funds is currently being developed and consolidated."
"We, too, are participating in this process in a concrete way and we support its efforts to protect the EU’s financial interests and to fight fraud and corruption."
"Moreover, as a general matter of principle, the kind of example the new Member States and institutions have before them is not merely a minor issue for us."
"In the course of the accession negotiations, when we were preparing for membership of the European Union, particular attention was given to modernising the public administration and combating corruption."
"Upon accession, our situation was deemed acceptable, although it was stressed that work still needed to be done to whiten our economy and rid our public administration of corruption."
"Now, one year on from our accession to full membership of the EU, it is very important that, on the basis of this concrete report, the public administration and public opinion should get a sense of the level of attention given by the EU to protecting its financial interests and fighting fraud and corruption, so that this will serve as a reminder to us and a pointer for the future."
". Mr President, I too should like to add my thanks to Mr Bösch for his consistently interesting report on this subject."
"As a Dutchman, I do, of course, still have the outcome of the referendum on my mind."
"What general conclusion can be drawn from it?"
"Here in Brussels or in Strasbourg, a Moloch of rules is coming into being – rules that are completely unintelligible, utterly incomprehensible, and with which we do not want to be associated in any way."
"When we talk about the fight against fraud, all we can do is to tighten the rules."
"That is the problem with this subject."
"How can we avoid lapsing into excessive regulation while fighting fraud effectively?"
"That is, I think, the challenge for this Commission."
"One of this report’s conclusions is that the number of isolated cases of fraud and irregularities in structural funds is going up."
"I come across more and more organisations that prefer not to use those structural funds because they are far too complex to use."
"You need all kinds of agencies to complete the forms."
"This is again an example of an inconsistency."
"How can the Commission solve this?"
"Although cigarette smuggling has been an issue for a very long time, we are making progress on all kinds of fronts."
"When I read the report, I was reminded of the first, temporary, committee on the prevention of fraud in transit, on which I sat, and which made a whole host of recommendations, including equipping all customs offices with computers to enable information to be passed on swiftly."
"That report has never, as far as I am aware, been followed up."
"Has the Commission done anything with it?"
"Does the Commission intend to revisit it, to inform Parliament what subsequent action has been taken, because it contained many interesting recommendations?"
"Finally, there will not be a European public prosecutor for the time being."
"This is an old idea."
"I belong to the group of people who regret this."
"Another recommendation in the report of the temporary enquiry committee was to organise as much as possible the exchange of customs officers from the different Member States with a view to them learning from each other."
"What is the Commission’s current position on this?"
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to thank Mr Bösch for the excellent report and also for the excellent cooperation."
"There are two points of particular interest to which I should like to draw your attention this evening."
"The first one is the responsibility of the Member States, which, let us not forget, manage 80% of all European aid, which gives us every right to ask more commitment of them, meaning, above all, extra efforts in reporting possible irregularities and cases of fraud."
"It also means reinforcing systems for monitoring and managing the structural funds."
"We have a long way to go in this respect."
"It also means that extra efforts have to be made in the area of reimbursement of funds paid either in excess or in error, which amount to the tidy sum of EUR 3 billion."
"In his speech, Mr Bösch made a point of explaining how this is possible, and Member States have to be galvanised into action, for they have not taken any responsibility to date."
"It is in this respect disappointing that the Member States where the most significant irregularities are reported are also the very Member States with the lowest reimbursement rates."
"Secondly, with regard to cigarette fraud, as Mr Mulder pointed out, Parliament is a driving force in addressing this issue, which, indeed, formed an important part of the enquiry committee on transit fraud."
"Every container that disappears represents a value of EUR 1.5 million of income of the Member States and the EU, in other words the taxpayer."
"Next Wednesday, we will be questioning the Council and the Commission about the agreement that was concluded with tobacco giant Philip Morris who, for the next 12 years, will be paying USD 1.25 billion into an EU account."
"I congratulate the Commission and OLAF, the anti-fraud office, on the exemplary way they have worked together to bring this about."
"We need more agreements of this kind with other tobacco giants."
"As Mr Mulder pointed out, the past referenda taught us that people have doubts about the European Union."
"Issues like these, including the Philip Morris issue, demonstrate at any rate that if Parliament, the Council and the Commission join forces, organised crime and mafia networks, which are, in fact, also used for other products like drugs, can certainly be tackled adequately."
"Finally, if you, Mr Bösch, say that we should abolish export subsidies and for the reason that it is a scheme that is very susceptible to fraud, then you will know that you can rely on me as an ally."
"We should indeed put the issue of export subsidies on the political agenda and keep it there."
"Mr President, last week’s referenda in France and the Netherlands were a dramatic reminder of how little legitimacy the European Union now has in the eyes of the peoples of Europe."
"The EU is rightly viewed as a project ever more driven by an elite."
"A political elite with no genuine mandate from the people rides roughshod over the public and their national institutions in ever more areas of political life."
"In Sweden, a scientific investigation is carried out each year into the population’s confidence in about twenty different institutions."
"The Commission and this House – the European Parliament – are at the bottom of the list."
"There are many politically committed people such as ourselves who wish to rescue the European integration project from the attempts to create a European superstate."
