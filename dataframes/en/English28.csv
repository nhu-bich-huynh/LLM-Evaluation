"Therefore, for the future, it is important that we have a clear explanation of what these buildings are going to be used for and that these buildings are environmentally friendly, user-friendly and cater for people with disabilities."
"I must express surprise that we are already negotiating on new buildings in the absence of major decisions in a variety of areas including the language regime."
"Mr President, I too should like to congratulate both rapporteurs on the result achieved and also on the speeches they gave here this afternoon."
"However, I have to admit that I still feel slightly resentful about the Council' s result."
"I am pleased with the final, positive result, but on the other hand, why did the Council present such an unacceptable initial proposal?"
"It truly seemed as if the members of the Council were, once again, behaving like little boys running riot with cap pistols, as I expressed it a number of years ago."
"Fortunately, everything got straightened out, for we would have had major problems with the whole of the budget on account of heading 3."
"I really fail to understand how the Council dares present proposals of this kind."
"In my opinion, we have made a rather considerable concession with regard to payments. I believe that we should monitor this more closely in future."
"The Council seems to have taken an interest in this, and it may be wise to be a little less generous next time than we were this year."
"But that is a matter for next year."
"I should like to highlight that, in future, we will be extremely short of cash in Headings 3, 4 and 5."
"We subscribe to what the Commissioner referred to, namely how relatively little the Union is currently spending."
"We must, of course, also bear in mind that as soon as new Member States join, the outlook will change immediately."
"We are therefore putting some savings away for the future."
"Another point which causes great concern, in my view, is the Council' s attitude towards projects which could improve employment."
"The issue surrounding Galileo springs to mind, which has caused great difficulty."
"All other points which cost money from the EU budget and which can contribute to better economic performances in the coming year - and there are quite a few of those - have been systematically discouraged, and if we do not sufficiently appreciate this, we will really end up in a recession."
"If we see what the Americans are currently doing, how much money they are prepared to pour into their recession, we do not have to copy all of this, but we can move slightly in that direction and manage our funds wisely."
"Mr President, I again would like to congratulate the rapporteur, the Commission and even, to some extent, the Council for the work they have done this year."
"This has been a budget procedure which has so far run with remarkable smoothness."
"We recognise the pressures on the budget - whether it is the Balkans, Palestine, enlargement, Afghanistan or the demand for action in new fields of activity."
"Balancing these pressures has been quite a performance, particularly on behalf of the Commission, and for that we say thank you."
"In those sectors that are the concern of the Environment Committee I particularly welcome the establishment of frameworks and long-term funding regimes which have certainly stabilised our work in the area of consumers."
"I welcome the developing framework in the area of health where it is certainly going to encourage the development of steady progress in that field."
"It is equally important to say that those kind of stable funding regimes assist our work enormously."
"I am pleased that they have been, in the most part, respected."
"I also welcome the decision that was going to be taken, but has not, not to withdraw money from the Life Programme for the environmental projects that are so important."
"We can only develop our work in guaranteeing the future rights of the consumer, the health of the public and the safe, clean environment if we put our money where our mouth is and spend the cash that is needed."
"Mr President, my warm thanks to Mr Costa Neves, Mr Wynn and all the members of Parliament's team in the conciliation negotiations."
"There was nothing else to be done."
"The Commission's amending letter being as modest as it was, one could hardly build up anything great on it."
"As we know how little room there is for change when it comes to compulsory expenditure in the agricultural sector, I think we have to give you credit for having fought and won a few points."
"I would like to single out one point, one, which makes very clear the dilemma as regards the agricultural budget."
"We all know that our hands are more or less tied when it comes to compulsory expenditure, that they are tied, too, when it comes to outlining compulsory expenditure and thus outlining the common agricultural policy."
"Where we could make headway - the second pillar, which is a no more substantial beanstalk than it was before, where we have more obligations than we can meet - we are unable to transfer funds from the compulsory expenditure."
"Our self-imposed captivity must at some point come to an end."
"Not for the first time, I claim for Parliament not only the unhindered right to set a Budget, but also I claim for it the full right of co-decision in the area of the common agricultural policy."
"If these rights are not granted to us, then this dilemma will remain unresolved."
"Mr President the reform of the common fisheries policy on 1 January 2003 will change this important economic sector for the better."
"Of that I am convinced."
"It was for that reason that the committee did not want to bring in any new Budget lines at the present time, with the exception of the flexibility reserve because of the Morocco disaster, which has been a heavy blow for the fisheries sector and raised many issues."
"We did, though, seek a few small changes."
"A: on food safety, especially with regard to genetic engineering, where there is an urgent need for scientific underpinning."
"B: on the monitoring of fishing activity."
"We need rigid controls and, perhaps, financial sanctions to deal with the black sheep."
"C: genuinely to include the sector in discussions and in the legislative measures in accordance with the bottom-up principle."
"Dialogue must be put on a formal basis."
"To sum up: We thank the Commissioners and in particular Mr Costa Neves for their constructive and wise collaboration."
"The Committee on Fisheries felt itself to be in good hands."
"We wish to maintain fisheries for our benefit and for the benefit of the generations that will come after us."
"I seem to have another minute to go, so I would like to touch on another subject."
"I refer to Mr Turchi and Mr Prodi's statements about Galileo this morning."
"I appeal to all of you not to block the road to further development."
"Mr Dover, the amendments proposed to Mr Turchi's report on TEN 1999, above all by our British colleagues, should be rejected."
"The justification for them is false, as the enterprises had, in a 'Memorandum of understanding' , taken a positive line on their financial participation as early as the beginning of 2001, without the political will having been present at that time."
"Mr Dover, please think of the many jobs involved, as Mr Prodi has done."
"Mr President, I am now focussing just on sport, or more accurately, its absence from the draft budget that has been adopted by the Council."
"A statement has been made in many consecutive summits, most recently at Nice, on the social importance of sport."
"Despite that, sport is hardly taken into consideration in the work of the Union."
"The situation has become more critical as, unfortunately, the EU had to withdraw from WADA funding."
"The Committee on Budgets has repeated the proposal by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which was agreed in Parliament' s first reading, for an appropriation of five million euros for preparatory actions for a Community policy in the field of sport."
"The appropriation would be used, for example, to help the work of sports associations to prevent exclusion amongst youth."
"I hope that the motion will receive Parliament' s support in the vote on Thursday."
"It would also be very much in harmony with preparations for the physical education theme year."
"Mr President, my speaking time is limited, but I nonetheless want to address a couple of important issues."
"There has definitely been a breakthrough this year in the area of aid, on which I have been working."
"We have reached an agreement with the Commission both on how the reporting is to take place and on the direction our assistance is to take in the future."
"I would thank the Commission for the constructive spirit in which our discussions have been conducted."
"Parliament' s scrutiny and control of aid money will substantially increase."
"The conditions are now much better than they previously were for bringing order and method into an activity which is unfortunately often characterised by anything but those qualities."
"The fact that the Commission has accepted as a benchmark that a third of the aid must be used as social assistance also definitely represents progress."
"The agreement guarantees greater focus upon programmes and activities of special importance in combating poverty."
"I also wish, of course, to thank Mr Costa Neves for the way in which he has taken care of the work."
"His approach to a very difficult job has been characterised by openness, friendliness and efficiency."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the report presented by the Committee on Women' s Rights was approved by Parliament at first reading, practically in its entirety."
"A new line, A-3037 N, was added to the amendments in this report, for women' s organisations which do not belong to the European lobby, but which do effective work for the equality and promotion of women."
"Both this and certain other proposals by the Committee on Women' s Rights have been removed by the Council, and therefore Parliament, making use of the rights afforded it by the Treaties, since they are not obligatory expenses, is presenting them once again for approval."
"We are thereby acting coherently, presenting the amendments which Parliament approved on first reading."
"Amongst these amendments I must also highlight line B5-331, Information Society, which is so important for the future, especially for women and their full incorporation into the labour market."
"I would lastly like to warmly thank Mr Costa Neves for the very important work he has done and his sensitivity in responding to the needs we had raised."
"I hope that the House will approve it by a large majority, because, as you all know, since the Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force, all Community programmes must include the objective of promoting women and achieving greater equality, not only in the European Union, but also in the countries with which we have cooperation agreements, particularly in the Euro-Mediterranean area."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the draft budget for 2002, both in its Commission section and in the sections relating to the other institutions, deals directly with the financial challenges of enlargement."
"The two rapporteurs have budgeted for the structural, administrative and logistical needs which the immense challenge of enlargement will very soon present us with."
"For 2002 we are basically faced with two new structural needs originating from the Nice Summit and not foreseen in Berlin."
"The first one is caused by the failure of a Community policy, the non-renewal of the fisheries agreement with Morocco, which obliges us to convert part of Portugal and Spain' s fishing fleets, with the great social impact of that conversion on many regions of those countries."
"The other structural need derives from the very fact that enlargement is imminent."
"We must respond to the needs of the border regions of the Union, whose competitiveness is being weakened by the imminent application of the freedom of circulation of persons, goods and services."
"I would like to highlight the fact that the great majority of this Parliament understood both structural needs and supported a joint solution from the outset."
"However, it has not been simple to respond to both demands."
"Until the conciliation meeting of 21 November it was not possible to agree on a satisfactory solution, and that means living with an excessive degree of risk."
"It is therefore very important that we improve the degree of implementation of the appropriations agreed."
"Issues such as the entry into force of automatic failed commitments and the achievement of a level of payments which allows for the absorption of the leftovers are priorities which this Parliament is happy to have obtained."
"We do not know which new structural needs we will have to deal with between now and 2006 and a degree of flexibility is therefore necessary within the spending categories, while always respecting the principle of maintaining the current financial perspectives which are now entering the third year of their difficult and eventful life."
"This acceptance of the financial framework must not, however, lead us to forget how tight it is."
"This year Afghanistan and the Middle East are the issues which have once again created tension within heading 4."
"The problem is not the ends, but rather the means used by the Council to achieve them."
"Nobody disputes the needs of Afghanistan and the Middle East, as well as other international crises which may arise."
"But this Parliament does not agree with the Council' s way of doing things."
"The Council is once again making financial commitments in external policy without taking account of Parliament' s political priorities, and furthermore it is doing so with non-obligatory expenses, which complicates even further the task of those Members who want to maintain the current financial framework."
"We would ask the Council whether it is really so difficult to establish a prior consultation system for external priorities in heading 5?"
"We take very good note of the words of the Commissioner on the possibility of improving the suitability of the legislative and budgetary procedures during next year and we truly welcome what he has said."
"I would like to congratulate Carlos Costa Neves and also Kathalijne Maria Buitenweg, as well as Francesco Turchi on his report on the Trans-European networks."
"We would also like to congratulate Terence Wynn on his work as chairman."
"We believe that Commissioner Schreyer has found a good ally in this Parliament and that we have received good help from the Commissioner."
"We believe that it has been a good marriage of interests."
"I would finally like to thank the Council for making the most difficult thing look easy, and that is being here when necessary."
"Mr President, I also want to begin by thanking the rapporteurs, Mr Costa Neves, Mrs Buitenweg etc."
"They have not only sought broad solutions within Parliament but have also persistently maintained our positions in relation to the Council, something which has been especially important."
"I also want to thank the Council and the Commission."
"We have sometimes been critical about the forms, especially in connection with the first conciliation, but we nonetheless came up with a constructive approach in the end."
"It has been possible to solve a number of difficult issues."
"It is, of course, incredibly important that we have been able to produce substantial additional aid for Afghanistan, given the enormous needs that exist."
"Personally, I am delighted that we have been able to direct a portion of this aid to women' s involvement in constructing the future Afghanistan."
"In the same way, there is satisfaction to be found in the fact that we came up with solutions both for the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets and for aid to the border regions."
"In spite of the fact that work on the budget has, then, proceeded well, we see a number of problems for the future."
"One of the biggest problems is that the EU budget is not flexible enough."
"Each year, we are witness to events in the world around us which require the EU to contribute resources without delay."
"In 2000, this was the case with Kosovo and in 2001 with Serbia, and now this year it is the case with Afghanistan."
"We have released funds for these unexpected situations, for example through the flexibility mechanism, but the process has been extremely difficult."
"Now, moreover, we are seeing its shortcomings for, this year, we had to use the flexibility mechanism for other, heading-2, aid."
"When, at the same time, a crisis like that in Afghanistan occurs, the problem becomes clear."
"Obviously, we ought, therefore, seriously to discuss the approach laid down in the interinstitutional agreement, namely that of revising the ceiling in the budget."
"The Council is steadfastly saying no to this, in spite of our having a budget, large amounts of which are never used."
"The problem, then, is that all that Parliament can do is account for every single krona in the budget, right up to the ceiling, and not allow for any margins for unforeseen events, or else cut back on other of its high priorities and thus let recipients of aid in other parts of the world in practice pay for our new needs in the Balkans or Afghanistan."
"We can naturally solve such a dilemma once, perhaps even twice, but when such initiatives tend to become permanent and when the situations in Kosovo, Serbia or Afghanistan give rise to multiannual programmes that pile up without the other needs disappearing, then the situation becomes untenable in the end."
"I believe that one of the major issues for next year will be that of finding new ways to increased flexibility."
"I therefore welcome the Commission' s ideas as a starting point for this discussion and hope that the Council will show a corresponding open-mindedness."
"Another fundamental error is, of course, the poor implementation of the EU' s budget. We have now launched a number of new methods, which are not only about increasing payments."
"Instead, we are trying to identify those areas we think of as lagging abnormally behind. We are trying to specify what is required of the implementation profile."
"We have conducted extensive discussions as to which services are required if we are to be able to implement initiatives in different policy areas. Finally, we have also, as Mr Wijkman pointed out, launched a new benchmarking method in the area of aid."
"These are important areas of progress, but I believe that they need to be developed further in future if we are to be able to win back people' s confidence in how we handle taxpayers' money."
"As next year's rapporteur, I naturally see a number of important areas that have to be worked through."
"Enlargement is drawing ever nearer."
"During the preparations, we must, quite simply, consider not only the short-term perspective but also the long-term perspective when enlargement seriously makes itself felt in the budget too."
"Finally, we must also take a genuine look at reforming the Commission."
"If we do not succeed in this - and it is not only a question of reviewing the regulations but, above all, of looking at evaluation, follow-up and how we use taxpayers' money - then I do not believe we shall succeed in changing people' s view of the EU."
"We must have effective administration and make sure that people regain their confidence in the European Union."
"That is one of the most important tasks for future work on the budget."
"Mr President, first I would like to heartily congratulate and thank the budget' s main rapporteur, Mr Costa Neves, with regard to his excellent draft budget and his constructive cooperation."
"Likewise, I wish to thank the second budget rapporteur, Kathalijne Buitenweg, and also, in particular, the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Terrence Wynn, for his skilful and constructive leadership of the Committee."
"The budget for 2002 now being debated is a moderate and disciplined one."
"Appropriations have grown by just 2%, which is clearly below the figure for the financial perspectives."
"The European Parliament has shown an enormous sense of responsibility, which our group values highly."
"This budget is a considerable improvement on the Council' s first proposal."
"The agricultural budget is realistic."
"There are more funds available to cover outstanding commitments under categories 2 to 4, and there is a common call to use them to clear arrears."
"The reform of the Commission proceeds, and any expenditure that should not in fact arise, has been cut."
"We particularly appreciate the fact that no negative reserve, that is to say, no uncovered appropriation, has been adopted."
"In the first reading of the budget some cuts were made to external actions, such as the western Balkans CARDS programme."
"Now we have been able to prevent most of these cuts."
"A total of 206.4 million euros is being proposed for the Balkans."
"Furthermore, the CARDS programme had already been given 63 million euros out of this year' s budget transfers, so all in all the programme is returning to what was proposed in the Council' s draft budget."
"This was immensely important for my group."
"For the Commission' s reform 317 posts are being reserved, which guarantees that the reform will proceed."
"Of these, 105 are in reserve, and our group hopes that at least the majority of them may still be released."
"A flexible instrument had to be adopted once again this year."
"A compromise decision was reached on its use, according to which Spain and Portugal will see the structure of their fisheries fleets revitalised with the aid of 170 million euros, plus another 27 million in 2003."
"Thirty million euros are to be spent on solving border problems associated with new Member States, with a further 15 million being spent on this next year."
"Our group supports all these decisions."
"Mr President, in the conciliation meeting between the Council and Parliament most of the time was spent discussing the use of a flexible instrument."
"The Commission would have promised 197 million euros for the reconversion of the Spanish and Portuguese fisheries fleets, which is a lot of money."
"In the same connection, the Nordic countries are demanding 50 million euros to resolve problems on their eastern borders."
"It was decided to finance these new needs with a flexible instrument under section 2, but over a period of two years."
"This new interpretation of the use of a flexible instrument shows that if there is the political will to finance something, the rules can definitely be bent."
"The EU does not have a money shortage."
"That is evident from the financial statements for 2000."
"Furthermore, there will be a surplus of billions for this current year."
"There is 40 billion in outstanding commitments - the so-called 'RAL' s - in the accounts, and it is to be supposed that most of it will never be spent."
"The Commission has saved money but it is questionable as to whether it has made any political decisions regarding savings."
"As there are such huge budget surpluses, the Commission has not implemented those budget decisions Parliament has made."
"To be perfectly frank, the Commission high-handedly invalidated the decisions of Parliament."
"If the next EU year is evaluated from the point of view of the budget we might say that things are on an even keel, no rises and no falls."
"There are no special areas of focus, only running costs are funded from the budget."
"When the Council lacks the ambition to tackle the problem of unemployment, it also shows in the Commission' s draft budget; for that reason, our group takes a critical view of it."
"Just a small detail, the Council has not wanted to end the transport of live animals over excessive distances."
"The ill-treatment of transported animals continues, and the Council of Agricultural Ministers is to blame."
"Mr President, there is an old Dutch saying which reads: 'wie wat bewaart die heeft wat' [waste not, want not]."
"This has proved invaluable time and again for those who have lived by it."
"When we adopt the budget, it is crucial to set aside adequate reserves for unforeseen expenses."
"This was illustrated yet again this year."
"In this respect, the recent crisis in agriculture springs to mind in the first instance."
"Unfortunately, the Commission has abandoned its plans for a reserve in the sum of EUR 1 billion in the compulsory agriculture expenditure."
"In our view, the Commission' s argument for this U-turn borders on naivety and bears witness to a short-term view."
"Even if expenditure in terms of arable crops, dairy products, sugar, olive oil and mutton turns out higher than expected, expenses are far higher where vinicultural products and cotton are concerned."
"Our greatest frustration is the fact that BSE and foot and mouth no longer seem to feature in the Commission' s dictionary."
"Mr Görlach from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is right to remark on the underlying uncertainty as to the final end of the foot and mouth crisis in the United Kingdom and other Member States, as well as animal transports and the inconsistent vaccination policy."
"Additionally, I share his fear that the BSE crisis is likely to be around for the foreseeable future."
"The recent confirmation of a case in Austria speaks for itself."
"How does the Commission intend to pay for unforeseen expenditure?"
"Will we once again have to fiddle with the ceilings agreed in Berlin?"
"The second point concerns the flexibility instrument."
"It is striking that these resources, an annual amount of no less than EUR 200 million, have been fully used up ever since this instrument was created three years ago."
"I do not call into question the validity of the spending objectives to obtain funding."
"What bothers me is the financing method."
"Why do budget headings not receive a thorough overhaul for unspent amounts and unprofitable budget lines?"
"This Parliament wants to be close to the citizen. It should therefore act as any sensible citizen - if it wants to pay for something new, there will have to be economies elsewhere."
"Mr President, negotiations with the Council were, yet again, not straightforward, but it is important that we were able eventually to come to an agreement on the question of the modernisation of the fishing fleet and on additional funds for the Member States' frontier regions."
"The roles played by the Commission, and indeed also by some Members, were in our view not always transparent."
"The acceding countries must not have large amounts of promotional funds made available to them whilst the frontier regions of our Member States get no additional funds at all."
"These regions' economic situation is often not much better than that in the acceding countries."
"The poor economic situation in the frontier regions of the Member States may well get even worse after the new countries join the EU, because differing levels of funding - almost all get Objective 1 funding - will greatly favour the frontier regions of the acceding countries, some of which already possess better transport infrastructure than is to be found in the frontier regions of the Member States."
"As an example of this, I would mention the airport at Laibach in Slovenia, which is more modern and much better developed than the airport at Klagenfurt in Southern Austria."
"The accession of the new states will, for the reasons I have mentioned, make it difficult, or almost impossible, to support small and medium-sized enterprises in the frontier regions of the Member States."
"We must, though, be clear in our own minds that the citizens in these regions can hardly be in favour of the accession of new countries under these circumstances."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today is a good day, because we as Parliament have together, and as citizens' advocates, gained something for the frontier regions that the Commission at first denied them, and I wish to thank from the bottom of my heart those Members who helped to make political reality of this important concern that the Heads of State and of Government had articulated in Nice."
"My thanks are especially addressed to the Belgian Presidency of the Council, who took the concern of the regions' peoples on board and here provided the financial means it demands."
"Commissioner, I now of course expect the Commission to table proposals with all speed."
"You have demonstrated that you are in a position to do this where fisheries policy is concerned, and I hope that you will present programmes for the frontier regions within a comparable timescale, so that the money can be tied up as quickly as possible and be spent on the ground on worthwhile projects."
"Secondly, I would like to point out that we must, of course, ensure that political priorities and the Budget process are synchronised in the future."
"It was this morning that we first had the opportunity to acquaint ourselves with the Commission's political priorities for 2002."
"I find that quite unacceptable."
"The former Commission, which also had to step down because of problems with the Budget, was significantly quicker and more efficient than the present one when it came to setting priorities and discussing them with Parliament."
"As the Commission always needs some supplementary tuition, we will happily provide it."
"The best way of doing this is to keep in reserve those positions that the Commission urgently needs."
"I hope that will help to make the setting of political priorities and the Budget process go more in step with one another."
"I find it unacceptable that we should be told the political plans for the coming year only on the day we are debating the Budget at second reading."
"I will also take the opportunity to thank Mr Turchi for his report on the Trans-European Networks."
"Here, too, I would like to ask the Commission to see to it that, where funds for stages or parts of networks are made available from the EU's Budget, care is also taken that the whole network is also constructed."
"Let me give just one example from my own country, the important transport link from Berlin to Verona via the Brenner Tunnel."
"The German federal government readily undertook to finance the construction of the stretch from Berlin to Erfurt, but struck the Erfurt-Nuremberg portion from its list of priorities."
"Now, either the money must be repaid, as a stage is no use on its own, or pressure must be brought to bear to get the next stage built."
"Let me end by saying something about Parliament and its budget."
"I think it is a bit close to Christmas to be drawing up Christmas lists of possible new buildings that we will need if we are to have the space to cope with enlargement."
"I think there must be serious examination of whether there is real need for additional space for offices and meeting rooms."
"Christmas lists are nice, but the Christ child does not grant us all wishes, and nor should we."
"Let me thank everyone, the rapporteurs and especially the Belgian Presidency of the Council, for their cooperation."
"Many thanks."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Schreyer, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to add my thanks to Carlos, Kathalijne, Francesco, Esko, Joane and Terry."
"It is they, of course, who have provided us with these documents for today' s debate, and I believe they have done an outstanding job."
"The result we shall obtain from all of this will be a very good one."
"Allow me at this point, I spoke out of turn last time, to address Mr Vande Lanotte, the representative of the Council."
"After Mrs Parly last year, you are the second President of the Council whom I shall remember with profound gratitude."
"If this trend continues in the coming years, if this level is consistently maintained, we shall yet manage to establish really close cooperation and mutual trust one of these days between the Council and Parliament."
"Keep an eye on us, Commissioner - you must treat us better, otherwise you will suddenly find that we are far more in tune with them than with you."
"The point I wish to put to the President-in-Office, however, concerns Laeken."
"As I have already remarked, one of the things you will be discussing in Laeken, naturally enough, is the future structure of the European Union, and this discussion will not be confined to the question of a constitution in the sense of defining the structure and purpose of each component of the Union."
"No, we must also talk about the way in which we can achieve a budget that is transparent in every respect. It is impossible to explain to any of our citizens the fact that, having underspent various allocations by 4.6 billion euros, as the Commissioner said, we should be fighting for weeks and months here to obtain an extra 200 million or, when acute emergencies occur, that we actually have to push the entire budget back and forth to deal with them at the expense of our long-term strategies and basic political aims."
"We have had to make a large amount available for Afghanistan this year, and indeed it is very important that the people there do not merely see Europe as an authority that comes to punish but that they also experience Europe as a helper coming to assist them in their development."
"We have allocated aid to the fishing regions and aid to the border regions."
"This, too, was very important, because it signalled to the world that we are taking the current changes seriously and that we are restructuring in response to them."
"Allow me a brief remark in parenthesis."
"Time and again, as we all know, the cry from Bavaria has been that we need money for the border regions."
"These are the selfsame Bavarians who, on other occasions, denounce the system of revenue redistribution among the Länder and who, in CDU and CSU papers on structural issues, advocate the scrapping of all structural aid."
"On such occasions they turn round and demand a great deal more money."
"I have been a very fervent supporter of assistance for border regions and shall continue to support it, but those who beat the drum with high-powered press releases must ask themselves whether this is a consistent way to act."
"We also have fundamental matters to deal with."
"We must forge ahead with the reform of the Commission, because we want a modern administrative system."
"We must forge ahead on e-learning, one of the areas with the highest growth potential in a developing economic area like the European Union, not only because we want to grasp our economic opportunities but also because we want to avoid a split within our populations between those who can afford to acquire computers at a very early stage and those who are excluded from the information society."
"We must cooperate more effectively in Europol and Eurojust to combat terrorism."
"We cannot have a situation in which the criminals are driving Ferraris and the police are trying to chase them in Fiat Unos!"
"I mention these two makes of car deliberately, because they come from a certain country, a country that would do well to consider what it is doing to Europe at the present time."
"In the domain of foreign policy too, we must agree to tackle important issues."
"The Balkans must continue to receive attention."
"So must the Mediterranean region."
"But we must also heed the silent agony of the voiceless in the world."
"This is why we have been active this year in the struggle against AIDS."
"Silent agony, however, is easily neglected."
"We must keep closer watch."
"We must not wait to be rocked by violent explosions in the world. On the contrary, the European Union must become more sensitive, in cooperation with the regions of the world where our help is needed, especially to the need for food aid to ward off starvation but also to the need to help the countries in those regions to improve their administrative systems and infrastructure, thereby guaranteeing that those countries can develop by their own efforts in a manner which reflects credit on the quality and diligence of European cooperation with the rest of the world."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, I wish to concentrate on a single point, namely the issue of the Commission' s reforms, which are of course an important priority, in this year' s budget too."
"There have been quite a few speakers here today who have stated that there are things in the budget process that could be done better and that the institutions should in future work better together, even though this budget has proceeded very peacefully under the expert direction of Parliament' s Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg."
"However, I also think that, in certain areas, we should give some thought to how we act in Parliament."
"In next year' s budget, money has thus been set aside for early retirement and new appointments in order to ensure that the Commission obtains the right manpower for carrying out its tasks."
"In Parliament, we have demanded information as a condition of the appropriations, and the Commission has, on several occasions, reported in detail on the staffing situation."
"There is a majority in the Committee on Budgets that has wanted to place a large amount of money in reserve until further information has been provided."
"I think we must be careful, in making our demands, that we are not too pedantic and do not require too much detail. Otherwise, we shall end up obstructing the reforms rather than promoting them."
"We must, of course, ensure that taxpayers' money is managed efficiently and transparently, but I believe it is important for us to concentrate our attention more on results than on detailed management of the Commission' s administration, for that would not promote responsibility."
"I think that we in Parliament should honour the obligingness and openness shown by the Commission and either release those items that are in the reserve or at least be content to keep a smaller amount in the reserve so that the Commission obtains reasonable conditions."
"Mr President, from Brussels' point of view, the budget for 2002 is coherent and comprehensive, despite the criticisms made by the European Court of Auditors, which I have been examining with great interest."
"The Berlin decisions still offer some scope, particularly since there is apparently no need to maintain the levy on the Member States at its present level."
"In the implementation of the budget for 2002, I expect the structural support funds for the development of rural areas to be spent in full and all surplus revenue to be reduced to zero before or during the year 2006 if possible, by ensuring that eligible projects are realised within the shortest possible time frame. In response to another complaint that I hear time and again, I also expect guarantees that enough flexibility will be shown for projects to be replaced if necessary."
"At the same time, I expect the Commission to reconsider carefully whether the intended lowering of the support rates for major investments in the least affluent areas is necessary and warranted."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first let me pay tribute to the presidency of the Council and to its cooperative approach to this year' s budget."
"Naturally I also pay tribute to our rapporteurs and to the Commission for a budget that, in my view, is going in the right direction."
"Nonetheless, I have three comments to make."
"The first concerns the reform."
"In this context I must say that I am most disappointed, we as a Parliament are most disappointed with the various episodes of these past days."
"As the President, Mrs Schreyer, will know, I am not addressing her at this moment but the Commission in general, including its Vice-President Mr Kinnock."
"I think the kind of communication and exchanges of view we have seen over the past few days between the Commission and Parliament is not likely to help us take the decision we need to take this evening to unfreeze the budget items on reform, which is a pity."
"I want to draw the attention of Members and in particular of the rapporteur to two points."
"It seems to me that yesterday the General Affairs Council buried the 'European political parties' heading."
"That means EUR 7 million are likely to be unusable for lack of a legal basis."
"I would ask the rapporteur whether we could vote differently on Thursday."
"Furthermore, in regard to the budget heading for north-south cooperation in combating drugs, the Commission has not really followed up that question."
"A report that should have been drawn up is not there."
"Here again we have entered money under this heading, which has no raison d' être."
"So I would ask you whether we could change the vote on Thursday and delete this heading."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe it is right firstly to express my gratitude, as previous speakers have done, for the work of Mrs Buitenweg, of the chairman of our committee and, especially, Mr Costa Neves."
"The Union is at a decisive stage of its history, which must be accompanied by budgets which are suited to the challenges we are facing."
"We must begin by acknowledging the fact that, if we want to promote the work of the Union and make it truly efficient, we should enter soon into a debate on the Union' s resources and the Community' s budgetary weight."
"First of all, I should point out that throughout the difficult negotiation, which has ended with a positive agreement, progress has been made in resolving problems which go beyond a particular budgetary year."
"The commitments made in the statements during the conciliation process represent a code of conduct which works in favour of transparency and greater efficiency in spending."
"It is therefore important during the next six-month period, under the Spanish Presidency, which has declared its intentions with regard to the financial Regulation, to reach a definitive agreement on this fundamental piece of legislation."
"We have responded to the problem created by the lack of a fisheries agreement with Morocco by compensating the Community fleets in Spain and Portugal and guaranteeing the funding of the necessary conversion and modernisation programmes both in the 2002 budget and in the current period, as the Commissioner has pointed out, and I thank her warmly for her commitment."
"But it is also necessary for this Parliament to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Commission on such important projects as the establishment of the European satellite navigation system, known as Galileo."
"At a time when there are doubts on the part of some Member States, we must make it clear that the programme must not be called into question and that this phase needs to be basically sustained by means of public funding, as the Turchi report demonstrates."
"It is true that, as we move towards the mid point of the period of the financial framework in force, the difficulties increase because the new demands, the new commitments, call on the budget without any financial coverage."
"Despite the difficulties and contradictions, I sincerely believe that, with the signing of this budget, the way ahead has been partly cleared."
"It is a political success because it is rigorous and is accompanied by guarantees of more efficient implementation, and these conditions are essential if we are to ensure healthy and sustainable economic growth."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, here we are at last at second reading and as far as the administrative reform is concerned I agree with Mrs Wynn and colleagues who raised the matter."
"It is true that at first reading we were quite severe with the Commission about the reform."
"However, as you know, after the Commission' s replies we are quite prepared to give up these reservations, although there are still some points, two in particular, that bother us."
"Let me remind you of them."
"First there is the question of early retirement; up to now, and for several months now, we have had no reaction and seen no document that meets our expectations."
"The second point to which I would draw the attention of Parliament as a whole is the establishment of base management activity, with as its corollary the lack of any reliable response from the Commission on the application of coherent legislative and budgetary procedures with a view to drawing up our next budgets."
"I must say that we would not be so concerned if the administrative reform had been accompanied by an even more revolutionary reform, that is, a much more satisfactory system of interinstitutional relations with a view to drawing up the budgets."
"I must tell you that if the Council could reply in time, coherently and on a reasoned basis to the questions we or the Commission put to it, we could make progress on every front."
"Above all, if the Commission implemented in a reliable manner the budgets we as the budgetary authority adopt, believe me, Parliament would not hesitate today and would find it easier to give a vote of confidence and to abandon many of its reservations, especially those relating to the reform."
"You may be sure that Parliament continues to spearhead the reform with a view to modernising the administration; but then the Commission must also give us proof of its serious resolve to reform the working procedures between our two institutions."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"I, too, should like to congratulate all those involved in this budgetary procedure, which, as far as I can see, was an excellent procedure."
"We greatly appreciate the fact that amendments tabled by Parliament to compulsory agricultural expenditure have been adopted under the Belgian Presidency for the first time."
"It is somewhat regrettable that the Commission has failed to seize the opportunity to include Parliament' s proposal in the letter of amendment at this stage."
"In the light of the foot and mouth crisis, it is crucial for the European Union to do something about the development of marker vaccines and of insurance systems against animal diseases."
"I only hope now that the Commission will implement the amendments to this budget, for in the past I have had certain doubts in this respect."
"Other amendments which have not been included unfortunately, but which are of major importance, in my view, are the amendments which relate to the quality policy for agricultural products."
"This then refers to a quality heading other than the purely organic production."
"I hope that the amendment will be adopted and that the Commission will implement it accordingly this time."
"Of great concern is still the fact that a large number of amendments are left over, of which the Commission had said before that it was unable or not prepared to implement them."
"There is every chance that these amendments will be adopted on Thursday nevertheless."
"What will the Commission do in that case?"
"Will it persist in its attitude or will it bow to the wishes of the budgetary authority?"
"Mr President, I want to speak briefly about an amendment I have tabled to the Turchi report on trans-European networks."
"I have no problem about telematics being included in such a programme and I generally support the Galileo project."
"But the fact is that nearly EUR 1 billion is committed over the next five years, all from the public sector - from either the European Space Agency or from the Commission itself."
"By contrast, only EUR 200 million is allocated to the project by the private sector."
"My amendment therefore says that it is doubtful whether the private sector will come up with the goods early enough."
"I ask for a reserve of half the money allocated by the Commission for the first year of the funding to be set aside and released only if the private sector signs up to its commitments to take part in this project."
"I do not want to smash the project."
"I know there are heated discussions in the Council, and many nations have withdrawn their support for now, or are a bit uncertain."
"That is not my agenda."
"I just want to make sure the private sector comes to the party early enough to make sure there is more confidence in the scheme as a whole."
"Mr President, I too thank the rapporteur, the President of the Commission and all those who have contributed to the achievement of an agreement that I see as being positive and satisfactory on two key subjects that have concerned us: the restructuring of the Spanish and Portuguese fleets and the impact of enlargement on cross-border regions."
"These two problems do not just affect two nations but have Europe-wide repercussions."
"I therefore ask the Commission once again to provide a better definition of the concept of cross-border area and region."
"For us socialists, a cross-border region, which should be included in the pilot project and other measures, is one which forms a border by land or by sea."
"I do, however, regret certain cuts, in the case of the Balkans for example, but I am also pleased with the success achieved in MEDA recovery."
"In this regard, I hope the Commission will give priority to the regional dimension of the partnership provided for within this programme."
"I must also express my satisfaction with e-learning, Socrates, Leonardo, Europol, Eurojust and the Global Help Fund."
"Thanks also to Mr Turchi for his report."
"The projects approved at Essen must be speeded up; the individual States must be involved more, but the space for the great networks linking North and South must also be increased."
"Only if North and South can be brought closer together will we have a more cohesive European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me just deal very briefly with some of the comments we have heard."
"Mr Colom i Naval suggested that the agreed amounts which are laid down in the multiannual programme should be index-linked."
"The Commission cannot endorse this view, because these appropriations must be adopted as absolute amounts."
"If we then have a different inflation rate, that naturally creates more leeway in Category III, which such a situation will quite obviously require, and of which Parliament will rightly avail itself."
"Many comments related to the implementation of the budget."
"May I simply remind the House that a new instrument has been in place this year through which Parliament has been able to take part in the monitoring process, namely the weekly implementation figures issued by the Commission."
"This is the only Parliament that is kept so well abreast of the day-to-day expenditure situation."
"The Parliaments of the Member States do not have such an instrument."
"This is a genuine innovation, and we should certainly maintain it."
"For you, of course, it is a very important source of information, enabling you to observe how implementation is proceeding."
"I believe that what we have set down in the resolution is another important step towards close cooperation as part of a sound implementation process."
"The third point that was raised in many of your contributions concerns the flexibility of the budget as a whole."
"How rigid is this system that the Financial Perspective gives us?"
"It is undoubtedly noteworthy that this year, for the first time, the Council consented almost immediately to the use of flexibility instruments, of the flexibility reserve, in the budget."
"This really shows how important it is to have a balancing instrument, a fine-tuning instrument."
"But of course we must also ask the question whether that in itself is sufficient."
"We are in the third year of the Financial Perspective."
"Much of what we have to do here together, it must be said, raises budgeting almost to the level of an art form."
"This is the third year that we have launched the budget together."
"I do believe we can be content once again with the result, which certainly stands up to scrutiny."
"On behalf of the Commission, I should like to repeat my sincere thanks to everyone who has been involved in this process."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at 10 a.m. on Thursday."
"Determination of Member States' payments to VAT-based own resource"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0431/2001) by Mrs Haug, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the Common Position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 as concerns the use of ESA 95 in the determination of Member States' payments to the VAT-based own resource (8793/1/2001 - C5-0385/2001 - 2000/0241(COD))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in June 1996 a Council Regulation introduced a new revised European system of national and regional accounts, ESA 1995."
"This revised system superseded the old ESA 1979."
"Its use was made compulsory for all Member States."
"It applies to all acts of the Community - all except one."
"For budgetary purposes and for the determination of the Communities' own resources, the old system is to stay in place for as long as the Council Decision of 1994 on the system of the Communities' own resources remains in force."
"Back in 1994 it was assumed that there would be a new decision on the Communities' own resources in 1999."
"As we know, it actually took until the end of September 2000 before the Council plucked up the necessary courage."
"At the same time, however, the Council tried to railroad us here in Parliament into a quick decision."
"A grim picture was painted of the scenario that would ensue if Parliament did not adopt the Council Decision without amendment and, later, if we insisted on a second reading."
"A delay, we were told, would be intolerable, the Communities' own resources from VAT could not be collected properly, the Member States would incur high costs, because statistics would have to be collected for both accounting systems, and so on and so forth."
"Sheer balderdash! Since the year 2000 all the statistical offices have in any case been compiling their respective accounts on the basis of the 1995 system."
"The ESA 1979 data are not even available any more - a fact, incidentally, which the Council has now formally acknowledged in item 2 of its common position."
"So if we approve the common position at the present time, we shall merely be legalising a fait accompli."
"In other words, we had all the time in the world, and we wanted to take this opportunity to issue another urgent reminder of the importance of the revenue side in the compilation of the budget, to re-emphasise that revenue is the key to our prospects of funding our European policies."
"In its common position, the Council has only adopted the first of our amendments, the one in which we stated that the change from ESA 79 to the ESA 95 system for the determination of the Communities' own VAT-based resources would have no impact on the level of these resources, neither in terms of the balance between Member States nor of the overall volume of the Communities' own resources."
"The Council has rejected our Amendments Nos 2 and 3, in which we sought to guarantee better annual information for the budgetary authority on the state of play with regard to the Communities' own resources in the form of a Commission working paper and to establish a trialogue with the Council and the Commission in this domain."
"Yes, the Commission has subsequently written to us, indicating its willingness to provide us with such a working paper every year, for which we are grateful."
"No, the Council does not wish to engage in talks with us."
"There is no provision for such a trialogue in the interinstitutional agreement, it says."
"Huh! So much for the constant preaching about transparency!"
"Then there are those who say that the discussions about our own resources have no place in legislation on statistics."
"Admittedly, we cannot invoke Treaty articles, the Financial Regulation or interinstitutional agreements."
"Admittedly, statistical legislation is not the most attractive vehicle, it is not the ideal means of getting our demands through."
"We do not have a formal legal base, but we have a right, the right of equality for both branches of the budgetary authority in all matters relating to the common budget."
"If the participants in the Laeken Summit, the post-Laeken convention and the subsequent intergovernmental conference speak of democracy, they must also speak of the democratic right of Parliament to exercise full powers of co-decision on the European budget, and they must not only speak but also take action."
"If, by the end of these meetings, Parliament has obtained its rightful budgetary powers - co-decision on all expenditure and revenue - that will be a satisfactory outcome."
"Anything less, and the word 'democracy' in the mouths of Council members will not be worth the cost of the electricity that feeds their microphones!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in order to achieve the objectives set in the Treaty on European Union and, more specifically, on Economic and Monetary Union, the Community requires high-quality statistical instruments, which provide all the institutions, governments and economic and social operators with a collection of harmonised and reliable statistics on which to base their decisions."
"In this respect, it is necessary to modify the Regulation in order to make it possible to use ESA 95."
"We believe that the new ESA 95 significantly improves on the previous version, which dates from 1979."
"Progress has been made on the harmonisation of methodology and the accuracy and precision of the concepts, definitions, classifications and accounting rules which must be applied in order to achieve a quantitative description of the economies of the Member States."
"It is clear that, by implementing the change to the new system, the Member States have made additional improvements to the quality of the national accounts as a result of a complete review of their sources and methods used in producing accounts."
"Of all the various uses of the national accounting data of the ESA in the budgeting procedure, such as setting budgetary limits, calculating gross national product, setting the fourth resource etc., the only thing that is affected by the modification is the determination of Member States' payments to VAT-based own resource."
"In this regard, we agree with the draftsperson of the opinion that to use this new system would make no difference in terms of the level of Member States' payments, since they have already begun to adopt the ESA 95 in producing their national accounts."
"To attempt to calculate them again would be expensive and risky and furthermore would not be useful, since all the experts agree that, for rebalancing the levels of taxation, the use of ESA 79 or ESA 95 would not have an effect on the result."
"Finally, we congratulate the rapporteur on having obtained a commitment from the Commission to present an annual report to the European Parliament on the state of the collection of own resources, the forecasts in this field for the next budgetary year and certain frequent problems relating to the system."
"This will contribute to greater transparency and will allow the European Parliament to be duly informed on the implementation of the modifications necessary for the harmonisation of the new system."
"In relation to everything else, we fully agree with the rapporteur' s views."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission firstly wishes to thank Parliament, and in particular Mrs Haug, for your understanding and the common approval of the Council."
"As Mr Garriga has stressed, the Regulation is going to allow the Member States to use the best and most recent data from national accounts for the calculation of VAT-based own resources."
"As Mr Garriga also pointed out, the Regulation in no way affects budgetary revenue or the balance between Member States in the field of own resources."
"The debate at first reading allowed us to better understand and restate the need to improve information to Parliament relating to budgetary revenue."
"As a result of this debate, I would like to confirm on behalf of the Commission that, at the beginning of every year, we will present Parliament with a working document on the state of the collection of own resources, the forecasts for those resources for the following budgetary year and any other specific problem relating to the own resource system."
"I therefore confirm what has been said by the rapporteur, Mrs Haug, and also Mr Garriga, in this respect."
"I believe that in this way we are going to establish fruitful cooperation between the Commission and Parliament, and I would like to congratulate Mrs Haug on this initiative and on the work she has done with a view to the adoption of this Regulation, which is highly technical, but no less important for that."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Green paper on the criminal protection of the Community's financial interests: A European prosecutor"
"The next item is the Commission communication on the Green Paper on the criminal protection of the Community's financial interests: A European prosecutor."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission attaches high priority to the fight against fraudulent misuse of the financial resources of the European Union."
"The Commission is well aware of the fact that the European Parliament is our staunchest ally in this cause."
"Today the college of Commissioners has unanimously approved the Green Book I presented on the use of criminal law to protect the financial interests of the Community and on the creation of a European Public Prosecutor."
"By adopting this Green Paper just before the European Council meeting in Laeken, the Commission has sent out a strong political signal."
"We have already made some headway in the fight against fraud."
"This applies especially to our cooperation with the Member States."
"The Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) is doing sterling work in this domain."
"The Commission has also been doing a great deal in the field of prevention; for example, OLAF will examine all future legislative proposals to ascertain whether they are fully fraud-resistant."
"On the other hand, there are still many serious shortcomings to be rectified in the body of criminal law with which the European Union seeks to combat fraud."
"We need a consistent approach to criminal prosecution throughout Europe."
"The prosecution of cross-border frauds involving funds from the Community budget all too frequently grinds to a halt at the borders between different legal systems, of which there are not only 15 but 17 in the European Union, a number that will increase still further with enlargement."
"What is lacking is an effective instrument with which administrative scrutiny by OLAF and national investigations can be made to culminate in criminal prosecution rather than running into the brick walls that divide our legal systems."
"For this reason, back in September 2000, the Commission tabled a proposal for the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice that a European Public Prosecutor be established to protect the financial interests of the Communities through the system of criminal law."
"The introduction of a European fiscal prosecutor would be unprecedented in qualitative terms, and a truly innovative step in the judicial fight against fraud."
"The Heads of State and Government, sadly, did not pursue this proposal at the time."
"The issue, however, is far too important to be left on the shelf to gather dust."
"For this reason, I immediately decided to draw up a Green Paper which would spell out the details of the proposal for a European Public Prosecutor as well as indicating how this Public Prosecutor could operate in practice."
"The best possible use should therefore be made of the time between now and the next reform of the Treaties to respond to the questions and scepticism from the Member States, which have been asking us repeatedly about the precise form that such a system would take."
"The EC Treaty would merely deal with the appointment, the dismissal and the responsibilities of the European Public Prosecutor and the main elements of his or her job specification."
"All other details, such as the status and working methods of the Public Prosecutor, would be laid down in secondary legislation."
"These are precisely the questions that are now addressed in the Green Paper."
"How and on whose initiative does the Public Prosecutor act?"
"What are his or her powers?"
"Who supervises the actions of the Public Prosecutor?"
"How does he or she cooperate with the national prosecuting agencies?"
"What is the Prosecutor' s legal status, and how is the Office of the European Public Prosecutor to be organised?"
"On these questions, the Green Paper advances various options for discussion."
"The Commission, however, also clearly expresses its preferences, which, taken together, form a coherent system."
"What is the general approach that the Commission is proposing?"
"Which principles underlie the Green Paper?"
"The general approach proposed by the Commission is that the European Union should legislate only where such legislation is absolutely necessary and should rely as far as possible on the national laws and legal systems to regulate other matters."
"Our proposals are therefore fully consistent with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality."
"The European Public Prosecutor would considerably enhance the effectiveness of criminal law as an instrument in the fight against fraud without turning the national judicial systems upside down."
"What does that mean in detail?"
"The originality of the proposal lies in the fact that the European Public Prosecutor would be a central authority responsible for conducting and co-ordinating criminal investigations and prosecutions at the European level, whereas the Office of the European Public Prosecutor itself would not be centralised, and the principle of mutual recognition would be paramount when it came to taking specific measures."
"A common investigation and prosecution area would thus be created in Europe for the protection of the Communities' financial interests."
"Once investigations were completed, the European Public Prosecutor would prefer charges before the proper national court in the relevant Member State."
"The proceedings themselves, including the delivery of a judgment, would then be governed by national law."
"The Commission proposes a decentralised structure for the Office of the European Public Prosecutor."
"In the Member States, the European Public Prosecutor would be assisted by 'delegated national prosecutors' whose responsibilities would have a European dimension."
"As for proceedings, the European Public Prosecutor should be able to draw on the broad range of national investigation instruments."
"European prosecutors should therefore be able to enlist the help of the national and regional prosecuting authorities, such as the criminal investigation departments of the national police forces."
"The application of the principle of mutual recognition should also ensure that these investigative measures are automatically admissible throughout the territory of the Community."
"The same applies to the recognition of evidence and to judicial scrutiny of the actions of the European Public Prosecutor."
"For example, if an application made in a Member State for a search or telephone-surveillance warrant is granted by a national court under the applicable national law, the warrant would be valid throughout the territory of the Community."
"This approach respects the national legal system."
"At the same time, the principle of mutual recognition would ensure that the common investigation area became a reality."
"As far as judicial scrutiny of the European Public Prosecutor' s actions is concerned, the Commission also takes the view that national legal channels are adequate for this purpose and sees no compelling need for a European criminal court."
"Moreover, the Commission does not believe that the definition of the crimes for which the European Public Prosecutor could prefer charges implies the need to create an autonomous European penal code."
"What we do propose is the minimum essential degree of harmonisation, which should certainly go beyond the level that is set in the proposed directive for the protection of the Community' s financial interests and should therefore cover a wider catalogue of crimes than is covered by the 1995 Convention."
"We want to incorporate all offences that damage the financial interests of the Community, such as fraudulent practices in connection with tendering procedures or breaches of official secrecy to the detriment of Community interests."
"We also consider uniform rules necessary for sentencing and prescription limits."
"The Green Paper, then, is structured in strict accordance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality while guaranteeing that a European Public Prosecutor will be able to operate efficiently and effectively."
"It is my view that we have struck a good balance which might even win over some sceptics."
"The concept of a European Public Prosecutor fits neatly into the vision of a common European legal area."
"I compiled the Green Paper in close cooperation with Commissioner Vitorino."
"The various departments of OLAF were also in constant touch with their counterparts in the Directorate-General headed by Mr Vitorino during the drafting process."
"The new and long-awaited breakthroughs that have been made in judicial cooperation between Member States in criminal matters represent a sound basis for the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor."
"One of these is the European arrest warrant, which we hope the European Council will approve in Laeken."
"Another is Eurojust."
"The Eurojust initiative is not in competition with the European Public Prosecutor either. The two, in fact, would complement each other very well."
"I expect the Green Paper to herald the start of a broad and objective discussion about the creation of a European Public Prosecutor with all interested parties, including, of course, practitioners, judges and prosecutors in the Member States."
"I would ask the European Parliament, as the driving force behind this idea, to play an active part in this discussion and to foster the debate in the Member States."
"We need the widest possible feedback on our proposal."
"Once we have analysed the results of the consultation process, our aim is to be able to contribute something at the end of 2002 or the beginning of 2003 to the convention responsible for preparing the next intergovernmental conference."
"The ultimate goal is to ensure that the European Public Prosecutor is enshrined in the Treaties when they are next revised."
"We must be prepared for a long haul."
"I am, however, optimistic, because this goal can be achieved together, with the support of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, what I have to say is addressed particularly to Mrs Schreyer, the Commissioner."
"A fortnight ago, you described me as a champion of the European State Financial Prosecutor."
"I take that as a title of honour and might perhaps apply the term to you yourself, as we have now of course achieved what we wanted at the beginning of the nineties - a Green Paper and consequent Treaty amendment."
"I believe, though, that the timetable has to be tightened up a bit, as what you have said indicates that such a State Prosecutor will be in place only in 2006 or 2007."
"So, we are on your side, but, as we want to speed the process up, I would like to ask you to find the time to enable us to achieve the objective, and, with all the subsidiarity, please see to it that the process is not ponderous, slow or inefficient."
"That is important; it will enable us to really move ahead with setting up the State Prosecutor."
"The citizens out there demand it, and we are doing something for Europe if we make it clear that it is Europe's money that we are protecting."
"Mr President, I would like to pick out a few points."
"Firstly, it is a fact that you, Mrs Theato, were the originator of this idea and have been pursuing it for a long time."
"I believe that we are now at a stage when, as the Nice Summit showed, it really is important to be precise."
"The question at issue was what exactly this meant, which is often taken as an excuse to say that the whole idea will have to wait."
"The timetable looks more or less like this: the consultation will run until June 2002."
"While a new treaty amendment is launched for the next Intergovernmental Conference, proposals for secondary legislation - that is, on functioning and on such issues as the admissibility of evidence - will be drafted at the same time. The time available will be used for both purposes, so that we can as soon as possible not only give form to the idea, but also make the institution a practical reality."
"Firstly I would like to say that the previous speaker, my illustrious committee chairman, was being slightly disingenuous because there is no real demand for a European public prosecutor."
"Only two weeks ago in Parliament we saw huge tranches of her own report being deleted because they contained references to such a body."
"There will be some dissension among the various political parties in this House but many people are concerned about what this is actually leading to."
"I do not think you were being completely fair with us, Commissioner, when you said it will only go so far and no further."
"Will it lead to corpus juris?"
"If you say no to this question, how can you reconcile that with the answer that Mrs Delmas-Marty gave our committee a month ago?"
"Mrs Delmas-Marty is the former head of the supervisory body of OLAF and she has written many books on this particular subject."
"She said yes - a European public prosecutor will almost certainly lead to corpus juris, a common body of law throughout the Community."
"What would be the core competences of the European public prosecutor?"
"What powers would he or she have?"
"What are the Community's financial interests?"
"Surely you are not ignoring political signals sent by both the Council - many countries are against this - and Parliament, which, as I said at the beginning, two weeks ago rejected many things to do with the European public prosecutor?"
"Mr Heaton-Harris, the debate a fortnight ago was about the directive on the protection of Community financial interests, a directive in which the offences of fraud, corruption and money-laundering were defined, and, moreover, in terms already agreed on in 1995 by all Member States, the United Kingdom included."
"That agreement, though, is not yet in force, and the Commission therefore proposed to include it in a directive."
"Like the Commission, Parliament was of the opinion that the directive was not the right place for a definition of a Public Prosecutor, both of them being convinced that the creation of a European Public Prosecutor could not be accomplished by a directive, but would need an amendment to the Treaties."
"It was for that reason that Parliament struck out a Member's proposal that it should be dealt with in the directive, but doing so was not a vote against the European Public Prosecutor."
"This, I think, is something we must stick to."
"You are right to ask now what the duties of the European Public Prosecutor might be."
"One is that he will take over the direction and coordination of law enforcement and also direct investigations, which would themselves be conducted according to national law."
"The European Public Prosecutor would then be entitled, having assembled incriminatory and exculpatory evidence, to bring charges on the basis of that evidence, and this would also be done in accordance with national law and in a national court, so there is no question of creating some huge new apparatus or a new European penal code - we all know how much scepticism there still is about that."
"Many of these cases are listed in our Green Paper."
"There was, for example, the regulation that, where evidence was gathered in one Member State and then, crime knowing no frontiers, was used in a cross-frontier case before another court, it could be objected to on the grounds that it had been gathered in accordance with administrative law. That is something we do not recognise."
"It often happens that there is a mass of evidence of fraud being committed against the European budget, but the evidence is, as it were - legally rather than bureaucratically - defined out of existence, because of the sort of differences that there are."
"I do not believe that is in the public interest, and it is certainly not in the interests of Parliament."
"I would ask you, Mr Heaton-Harris, to examine this proposal with an unprejudiced mind. We have said that we are committed to applying the subsidiarity principle, but we do of course want there to be real protection in criminal law for Community interests."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to dissociate myself from the remarks made by Mr Chris Heaton-Harris and I believe that the Commissioner has very effectively outlined the framework within which the amendments to the Theato report were rejected in this Parliament."
"This is indeed a correct account."
"I should like to echo the words of Mrs Theato and call for speed."
"Commissioner, you have now announced a timeframe for setting up the post of European Public Prosecutor that is indeed a very slow process."
"You will be submitting a proposal after the Green Paper consultation in the course of 2002 or at the end of 2002 or beginning of 2003, this will be followed by a Treaty amendment in 2004, and entry into force is likely in 2006-2007."
"You will have to admit that this is all a long way off. I should like to note that at the time, the Committee of Independent Experts made a few suggestions in reaction to the dismissal of the Santer Commission in order to work faster and to move away from multi-stage plans."
"I should like to ask you whether you have adopted elements of these proposals by the experts in the Green Paper and whether you are willing to consider them, thus enabling us to make a start on the establishment of the function of European Public Prosecutor at this stage."
"Mr President, the Commission had indeed submitted a proposal to amend the Treaty to the Nice Intergovernmental Conference, and if that proposal had been successful, it could be said that the legal basis would have been created as soon as the Treaty of Nice was ratified."
"The Council decided otherwise, and this proposal was not even put on the table for the negotiations."
"Now we must in fact wait for the next IGC to carry out an amendment of the Treaty that will make the creation of the European Public Prosecutor possible, but, as I was saying, we will be making good use of this time and not just waiting; we will be using the time for consultation to find out the best possible model, and will then be discussing functioning, organisation, status, evidence gained from questioning, periods of limitation, in short, all the things that of course have to be cleared up."
"I work on the assumption that we will be having very intensive and practical debates in the Committee on Budgetary Control on the issues that have been raised."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to address the timetable issue, and do so from the same angle as did the previous speaker."
"I do not think, Commissioner, that you can in fact afford to wait until 2006. You cannot do so in view of the revelation of two billion euros' worth of fraud and irregularities, and in view of the challenges, some of them financial, with which eastward enlargement is going to face both you and us."
"I do think that speed really is of the essence here, and, indeed, you must not wait."
"You know that as well as we do, you know our report and you know about the proposals that have been made, which have stated that you are well able to tackle an initial, introductory stage without amending the Treaty establishing the European Community."
"Both the Council of Experts, which made proposals in 1999 towards reform of the Commission, and also the latest annual report of the committee overseeing OLAF have mapped out these two stages for you."
"In view of this pressure, which really is needed, I ask you: why do you still hesitate?"
"Why are you again putting it off, until 2006?"
"Why are you so hesitant, why do you not take the plunge, as we urged, most recently in the Bösch report?"
"Mr President, Mrs Stauner, it is not within the Commission's competence to appoint a Public Prosecutor, who can then carry out law enforcement in the Member States and bring charges in them."
"That is not the case; rather, the European Union is founded on the Member States' agreement to cede competences to the European level."
"The Member States have not as yet ceded the competence to establish a European Public Prosecutor."
"The foundation for such a law enforcement competence must first be laid at the European level, in other words, a Treaty amendment is needed to do it, and an effective instrument needs to be created, one that can actually deal with cross-frontier crime in all the Member States efficiently, not only carrying out investigations, but also bringing charges that result in prosecution and, finally, punishment."
"It is that procedure that we must apply."
"You may well now say that you wish the European Union were different, but I must tell you that the Commission is the guardian of the treaties, and what we propose must therefore take due account of the competences."
"This proposal really does, in my view, promise much for the future, and I hope that we can use it to convince even the sceptics."
"Mr President, I just wanted to ask a few questions."
"I am sorry I was not here at the beginning."
"First of all, do you not think that Mr Heaton-Harris is giving a green light to fraudsters?"
"In the past five years only two people have been prosecuted for fraud against the EU."
"If he does not come up with any alternatives, it is effectively giving the green light."
"I wonder if you could comment on that."
"Secondly, how do you convince those Member States which are resistant to the concept of European Public Prosecutor, for example my own country which, in my opinion, is misguided on this point?"
"Thirdly, how will the European Public Prosecutor be appointed?"
"And, fourthly, do you not agree that it is important not to proceed too quickly and do you accept also that this proposal is not enough?"
"In other words, Eurojust will simply not work."
"Mrs Schreyer, I am going to ask you also to be very brief."
"Thank you very much."
"Mr President, we are dealing here with a relationship of complementarity similar to that with Eurojust, which I have described."
"The European Public Prosecutor proposed here has to do with the protection of Community interests in the financial sphere, whereas Eurojust deals with other types of serious crime."
"Of course there has to be a link here, for data exchange among other things, but always from the data protection angle. We must look at it in a complementary way."
"Secondly, the Public Prosecutor's appointment would involve various procedures."
"On the one hand, a procedure must be devised for the appointment of the European Public Prosecutor, who would, as it were, represent all public prosecutors."
"The national European Public Prosecutors or the Delegates want a decentralised structure and would then be appointed under the relevant law of the Member State."
"I do not believe that Mr Heaton-Harris wants to protect fraudsters; rather, this is about what steps have to be taken for protection to be efficient."
"I will say again that we have a Community Budget, we have Community finances and we have a common internal market, and to that degree we no longer have borders in the legal sphere, but we do still have seventeen different legal systems, as the United Kingdom has three different legal systems."
"These, then, are real obstacles, which leads to the possibility of real defects in law enforcement, defects that we should overcome."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"What the Commissioner is saying all sounds encouraging."
"I should like to pose a very brief question: how does she view cooperation between the proposed Prosecutor and OLAF?"
"Mr Mulder, there are of course various possibilities for that as well."
"One is that OLAF would continue in its present function of carrying out investigations under administrative law, in which case provision would of course have to be made for OLAF to present its results to the same Public Prosecutor, who would make use of the intelligence thus gathered."
"Another possibility would be for OLAF to itself take over enquiries rather than being limited to an examining role."
"We consciously refrained from giving that a prominent position in the current debate, but then it would have been said afterwards that we wanted to give OLAF a specific role."
"This is, as it were, an issue that has to be worked out once we have the 'big picture' ."
"I can only reiterate that we are not now dealing with competing conceptions, but with a White Paper in the drafting of which OLAF played a part."
"OLAF is always facing the difficulty of its having gathered evidence or intelligence and then having to wait to see whether a national state prosecutor's office will accept this material and work with it."
"If we had a European Financial Public Prosecutor, it would be a really positive step forward for OLAF's work."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"You must not enter into a dialogue."
"You must be aware of the Rules of Procedure and apply them."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Questions to the Commission (B5-0536/2001)."
"Part I"
"Question No 39 by (H-0878/01):"
"Subject: Securing the external borders of an Enlarged Union Slovenia has some 370 border crossings with its neighbour Croatia."
"However its government currently only has enough money to man around 90 of them."
"Thus, some 270 border crossings are currently wide open."
"In view of terrorism, organised crime and illegal migration, what plans has the Commission got to ensure a secure border for the Union in the Enlarged Union?"
"Mr President, one of the future external borders of the European Union is expected to run along the border between Slovenia and Croatia."
"There are 36 crossing points along this border where it is legally possible to cross."
"The figures quoted by the honourable Member refer to places where crossing the border between Croatia and Slovenia is physically possible but legally prohibited - for instance, footpaths, roads and bridges."
"I agree with the honourable Member that it is the reality on the ground - literally speaking - that deserves attention."
"The Commission recalls that Slovenia must achieve a high level of external border control upon accession."
"The Commission is paying close attention to Slovenia's progress in the framework of the negotiations under the Justice and Home Affairs chapter, as well as in the pre-accession process."
"Slovenia is required to demonstrate its capability systematically to check all persons crossing external borders and to ensure effective border surveillance between authorised border crossing points."
"In this regard, Slovenia has prepared a detailed action plan for the implementation of the Schengen acquis, as requested by the European Union."
"In its action plan, Slovenia has shown that it is taking the necessary steps to ensure that the appropriate infrastructure and equipment are allocated to the border with Croatia."
"In addition, Slovenia is taking measures to ensure greater coordination between its authorities involved in border controls."
"The Commission wishes also to underline that Slovenia is already engaged in intensive bilateral cooperation for control of the common border with Croatia."
"This should be further expanded by the conclusion of the agreement on simplified border checks on road and rail traffic and an agreement on cross-border police cooperation."
"The latter agreement will also encompass joint border patrols for the surveillance of the green border, that is between the authorised border crossing points."
"In addition to the very substantial financial assistance granted to Slovenia for upgrading its border controls - this is financial assistance within the framework of the pre-accession process - the Commission is encouraging and directly supporting the bilateral cooperation between Slovenia and Croatia."
"This is funded under our assistance programme to Croatia for integrated border management, which will also cover border crossings with Slovenia."
"Slovenia and Croatia have recently reached agreement on the demarcation of the common border."
"While, in the past, the lack of demarcation did not affect in practice the quality of the border controls and of the surveillance of the green and blue border, this agreement, once ratified, is additional proof of the good cooperation between the two countries."
"Thank you Commissioner for a very full answer."
"Everybody is aware that this is very difficult."
"My point is one that was raised with me by a minister in Ljubljana."
"All the crossings, whether they are legal or illegal, will be used by terrorists, smugglers, immigrants, criminals and so on."
"Therefore it is a very serious problem."
"The minister also said to me: we cannot pay; we do not have the money to man all these crossings!"
"So Slovenia has got a real problem."
"There are nine other applicant countries - if I leave aside Cyprus and Malta where it is presumably easier to control the borders - so we have ten applicant countries, all with problems like this, without enough money to meet the cost."
"Is there any possibility that the Commission might propose that the Union takes on a responsibility for guarding our eastern borders?"
"I would not necessarily agree that the ocean is easier to control."
"I mean it is as easy getting to Malta and Cyprus in the dark from the sea as crossing a hill in the mountains."
"We know that there is a real problem."
"We have organised and funded capacity-building support to provide very strong assistance in this effort and this is what we have to do right now."
"It is quite important, as part of the whole negotiation process and accepting the acquis and responsibilities, that we clarify that this is a responsibility for the applicant country."
"There are numerous problems."
"The issue of controlling the periphery of the European Union will remain with us as a real challenge for quite some time."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the EU-Slovakia Joint Parliamentary Committee recently toured our border with Slovakia."
"Near Kosicec there is a forty-kilometre long border strip consisting of green fields. We were told that this is very difficult to monitor and that, at present, a very substantial influx of Afghan refugees can be observed there, perhaps not all of whom are entering Europe motivated by peaceful intentions."
"I would therefore like to ask if it is possible for the Commission to introduce satellite surveillance here, for example, or automated systems, making it possible on the one hand to gather statistical material and, on the other, to pick up more of these refugees and so be better protected in future?"
"What programmes are in fact available to these states?"
"Mr President, it is difficult to add anything substantially new to what I already expressed."
"But the mention of satellite monitoring prompts me to say that it is quite well understood in Parliament that the Commission is serious about Galileo and considers it to be an important programme."
"This is just one other application."
"Not having it would be a problem for the future of Europe and for our ambitions."
"I could not agree more with your remarks, but please talk to your national governments about that issue."
"Question No 40 by , which has been taken over by Carlos Carnero González (H-0881/01):"
"Subject: Revitalisation of the Euro-Mediterranean policy On 24 October 2001 President Prodi, addressing the EP plenary in Strasbourg in the debate on the Ghent European Council of 19 October 2001, said: 'The time has come to make new moves in the Mediterranean area. (...)"
"The Euro-Mediterranean region must aim at genuine economic integration and at setting up institutional mechanisms for taking common decisions'."
"Which of the existing mechanisms does the Commission intend to reinforce in order to improve the effectiveness of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership?"
"What new instruments or mechanisms will the Commission propose to generate real prospects of economic and social integration with the Mediterranean countries in the short and medium term?"
"What institutional mechanisms need to be put in place for the purposes of 'taking common decisions'?"
"In re-invigorating the Barcelona process we are strengthening the existing institutions of the Euro-Med partnership and moving ahead in a number of key areas."
"Concerning the association agreements, 2001 started with the good news of Egypt' s decision to initial the association agreement and negotiations are ongoing with Algeria, Lebanon and Syria."
"My second point concerns the association agreement signatories developing free trade between each other."
"We are encouraging each association agreement signatory to agree on free trade arrangements with the others so as to facilitate economic cooperation and inward investment."
"The Commission is working with the countries which have already started this process to see where technical advice can best be provided to help partners reach agreement."
"In parallel we are working on the rules of origin to see how the partners can be brought into the pan-European system."
"In order to lay the basis for a Euro-Med internal market so as to fully exploit the future free trade area, we are assisting our partners to bring their regulatory frameworks closer to ours."
"During 2001 the Commission has further developed a concept of the Euro-Med internal market, provided information about its implications and opportunities, and we have paid particular attention to internal market issues in MEDA programming."
"Cooperation is being strengthened across a range of sectors."
"The regional economic dialogue is being reinforced with future discussions focusing on growth and employment."
"MEDA is being used to examine certain infrastructure needs from a regional or subregional perspective and, where appropriate, to draw up strategies for interconnection and for linkage with the trans-European networks to ensure that priority projects are funded and implemented."
"Together with our partners we are developing a new regional MEDA programme on justice and home affairs and are engaged in discussions on these issues bilaterally in relation to the provisions of the association agreements and in MEDA programming."
"Concerning new instruments and mechanisms, in recognition that cooperation between Europe and Mediterranean countries cannot be solely political or economic, the Commission is looking at ways to initiate a new broad-based cultural dialogue in the Mediterranean region."
"In this regard, in addition to the programmes which are currently being implemented to support cooperation in cultural heritage, audiovisual activities and youth exchanges, the Commission is examining the feasibility of extending the TEMPUS programme for higher education to the Mediterranean region."
"With regard to new structures for dialogue, the Commission will bring forward proposals to adapt the working methods of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, in particular to provide for more frequent political dialogue on regional and international issues."
"The Commission will launch a policy dialogue with the Mediterranean partners on employment policy, sharing EU experience on ways of combating unemployment and of creating new jobs."
"It will work to improve the available information and statistics as part of ongoing efforts to channel legal migration and to combat illegal migration."
"Finally, the Commission will consider ways to stimulate investment and joint development projects in the Mediterranean, for example by studying the need for, and feasibility of, a new bank or other financing mechanism, building on the European Investment Bank."
"Let me add some information concerning the performance this year of the activities in the MEDA programme."
"For this year, there are commitments under MEDA of about EUR 740 million in the budget which are expected to be fully implemented."
"The same is true of other budget lines benefiting the Mediterranean partners."
"As far as payments are concerned, they are expected to represent over 56% of commitments this year to reach nearly half a billion euro, in fact the best ever result achieved in the region."
"This year is also the first year of the implementation of the revised MEDA regulation which puts in place mechanisms for more coherent programming of the aid, better coordination both with partners and with the other major donors, and more streamlined approval procedures inside the EU."
"Consultations have already taken place with the partners and with the other donors on the country and regional strategy papers covering 2002 to 2006 and on the more detailed national and regional indicative programmes for 2002 to 2004."
"All these documents should be approved by the end of the year."
"I am reporting these details because I do not want to miss this opportunity to inform Parliament about the MEDA Programme which has been quite problematic in the past."
"We are now seeing some light at the end of the tunnel."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the Commissioner for his friendly and extensive reply and also apologise on behalf of Mr Obiols who, contrary to what he would have liked, has not been able to get to the House on time today."
"I believe that the Commissioner has given us a variety of reasons to think that the European Commission is taking the same approach as Parliament."
"We must prevent one of the greatest successes of European Union external policy, the implementation of the Euro-Mediterranean process, from entering a period of stagnation."
"This process must not be limited to Euro-Mediterranean summits or ministerial meetings, such as the one which is going to take place next April under the Spanish Presidency in Valencia."
"It is therefore necessary to implement mechanisms which lower the level in a vertical sense and also broaden it in a horizontal sense."
"I suggest that, with regard to what the Commissioner has already said, we add, the possibility of relations between civil society, trade unions, women' s organisations, young people, as he has also already mentioned, and, of course, the cultural field."
"I would like to hear the Commission' s views in this regard."
"I do not have anything further to say on the matter."
"Question No 41 by (H-0917/01):"
"Subject: African children sold into slavery in Europe The BBC recently raised the issue of the increasing trade in child trafficking from Africa to Europe."
"There are thought to be around 10 000 West African children living with strangers in the UK alone, and the trade appears to extend across the European Union."
"Parents are persuaded that a new and better life awaits their offspring in Europe and send them off to live with distant family and friends in order to receive an education."
"In reality, children are put to work as domestic slaves, some are beaten and abused - they rarely set foot in a classroom."
"The BBC highlighted the apparent ease of bribing West African officials to buy genuine papers to enable children to be taken to Europe."
"Can the Commission indicate whether it is aware of the level of this trade and whether it has statistics from the Member States to quantify the problem?"
"Has it considered whether coordinating action can be taken at Community level to bring an end to this appalling practice and confirm that the OECD Convention on Bribery and Corruption, aimed at discouraging the bribing of public officials in third world countries, has been ratified by the Commission and by all the Member States."
"The Commission confirms that it is aware of the phenomenon of child trafficking."
"As regards the situation in the European Union, a study has been finalised with support from the Stop programme."
"The title of the report is 'Trafficking in unaccompanied minors for sexual exploitation in the European Union'."
"It was carried out by the International Organisation for Migration and is available on the IOM's website."
"The report includes figures from Belgium, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands."
"The Commission is also shortly expecting a report from Defence for Children International in the Netherlands."
"They have carried out a study on the extent to which children are trafficked for sexual purposes into the European Union, how they get here, what happens to them next and what can be done to help them."
"Furthermore, for 2002 the Stop II programme will support a follow-up and extension of the IOM report through a seminar on trafficking in unaccompanied minors in EU Member States."
"Additional research on the situation in France, Greece and Spain will form part of the preparations of this seminar."
"As regards action against trafficking in human beings, the Commission has been developing a comprehensive policy to fight and prevent such trafficking in human beings over the past few years."
"The most recent example is the agreement reached on 28 September 2001 on the Commission's proposal for a framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings."
"The framework decision essentially concerns approximation of criminal laws and penalties to improve and facilitate law enforcement and judicial cooperation."
"The Commission confirms that the political dialogue under the Cotonou Agreement and EU support for good governance in ACP countries have given real opportunities to address the human and social aspects of this practice, as well as the corruption elements that may be linked to it."
"Moreover, as poverty and lack of local opportunities are amongst the main reasons for children being trafficked, the poverty-reduction approach of our development cooperation is a meaningful basis for attacking the problem."
"It gives a priority to equitable growth and better access to education."
"The Commission is also implementing actions and coordination with UNICEF and a large number of NGOs in several African countries where this problem is most acute."
"In June 2000, in Cotonou, in Benin I had the strange experience of visiting two projects we were funding from the Commission."
"One project was helping abandoned children, the other helping abducted children."
"In the same city we had two groups of beneficiaries: one project was for street children or orphans or simply abandoned children, and the other was for children who had been freed by the project from being enslaved."
"It was very strange to experience."
"We went from one project to another and were told about two different ways in which children find themselves in very serious situations."
"We are pleased with our cooperation with NGOs in many countries in trying to do something meaningful here."
"Finally, it is not envisaged that the Community as such will ratify the OECD Convention on Bribery and Corruption which is mentioned in the question, as its Member States are ratifying this convention."
"At present all Member States, except Ireland, have ratified the convention and it is expected that Ireland will ratify it very shortly."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner very much indeed for that extremely comprehensive answer and also for mentioning his own personal experience of the problem."
"I am pleased at the range of measures that he has outlined."
"If I could perhaps ask a couple of supplementary points: in his list of countries involved in the various studies on the Stop Programme, he did not actually mention the United Kingdom."
"Perhaps he could confirm whether my own Member State is involved or whether it will be brought in in the future."
"If not, maybe this is something that I, along with others, can do something about."
"Secondly, in terms of the work outlined and personal experience, particularly in relation to the issue of providing information to the parents of children - to some extent setting aside the issues I raised in my question, as it is clear from the BBC report that parents of children are being completely misled by people wishing to exploit their offspring - are there perhaps grounds for involving the EU in some sort of campaign to overcome this problem of misinforming parents, to try and tackle the issue at source."
"Mr President, I do not have any information on the involvement of the UK in these investigations and studies."
"It is clear that the real value of these studies is their ability to throw light on the whole issue and to raise awareness."
"Knowledge, as such, is a strong weapon."
"As regards the specific issue of child soldiers, where we have set in place a personal initiative on my behalf, there is a scheme under way with Unicef to try to establish a real information system that could produce reports, using a comprehensive standard base in order to establish meaningful and credible statistics."
"At present, we only have the figures that have been flying around for the past five or six years."
"So this scheme aims also to exert pressure and keep everybody better informed."
"However, the core of this problem is not only poverty, it is also greed."
"It is a moral issue."
"Highlighting the problem of greed could be part of stronger work in this field."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"I must inform you that Mr Lamy has not yet arrived, so Mrs Diamantopoulou will answer questions first."
"Second part Questions to Commissioner Diamantopoulou"
"Question No 44 by , which has been taken over by Mihail Papayannakis(H-0866/01):"
"Subject: Fatal accident at Perama - implementation of health and safety directives On 20 October 2001, five people died as a result of a fire which broke out while they were working on board a tanker."
"Similar fatal industrial accidents occur frequently in ship-repair yards in Greece while tankers are undergoing maintenance."
"The Greek judicial authorities responded to the last accident by initiating criminal proceedings, inter alia for infringement of Presidential Decree 70/90 concerning the health and safety of workers engaged in shipbuilding and ship repair work."
"Ten years have passed since the Presidential Decree passed into law and, in the meantime, a number of Community directives on the protection of workers in such conditions have also been issued."
"Will the Commission say whether there are any directives and accompanying measures concerning the health and safety of workers applicable to working conditions on board tankers, whether they have been incorporated into Greek national law, and whether Presidential Decree 70/90 now covers the obligations deriving from Community legislation?"
"Mr President, Mr Alavanos's question refers to the fatal accident in Perama, which was a most tragic incident and I should like to express the Commission's condolences to the families of the workers who were killed."
"The reply to Mr Alavanos's question as to whether there are any directives and accompanying measures concerning the safety of workers on board tankers, which should have been incorporated into Greek law, is that there are no new measures and no new legislative framework which should have been transposed and that framework directive 89/391, which covers both shipbuilding and the ship repair industry, was transposed into Greek law so as to cover working conditions in such cases."
"This specific accident is being investigated by the Greek authorities and the European Union is waiting for the final results of the investigation into the causes so that measures can be taken, in collaboration with the Greek government, in order to prevent this sort of accident from happening again."
"Finally, the health and safety strategy is on the European Commission's list of priorities."
"There is a huge number of deaths every year at European level."
"The new health and safety strategy is due to be announced in 2002, and the report on the application of European health and safety legislation at national level is being drafted as we speak, by which I mean that we are drafting a European report to evaluate the extent to which each country applied the health and safety specifications applicable to each sector last year."
"Commissioner, following on from your last sentence, may I ask if the report which you mentioned will contain details of how Directive 89/391 has been applied?"
"I ask because this is not the first time accidents have happened."
"In Perama in particular they have become par for the course."
"I should also like to ask the following supplementary question: having studied the texts, not that I have any highly specialised legal knowledge in these matters, I found other directives which, to judge from their titles, appear to relate to the matter under discussion here."
"Directives 89/656 and 99/92 concern explosive atmospheres and work in such atmospheres, which is what caused the accident in Perama."
"Surely these directives have a bearing on the matter?"
"And, in any case, and I only ask because you said that you are waiting for news from Greece, and rightly so, does the Commission not periodically examine the prevailing situation on its own initiative, at least in highly sensitive areas which already have a history, such as Perama?"
"As the European Parliament knows, the Commission has received specific charges relating to the application of the national provisions transposing the directives which you referred to into Greek law."
"I have to say that it is extremely difficult for the Commission to intervene on its own and control and monitor the application of directives in all the Member States."
"However, where specific charges and reports are filed, it is obviously obliged both to investigate them and to act accordingly, from nagging at governments through to bringing charges before the courts against the Member State in question if it finds that legislation is not being applied."
"There have been charges relating to the application of national legislation, there has been an exchange of correspondence which started in the summer, in August to be precise, between the Greek government and the European Commission, staff from my directorate have visited Greece and examined the institutional framework and its application and we have requested additional information further to a letter sent by the Greek government on 9 November. We believe that the information sent is being processed at the moment and other information has also been requested, so that we can make a full evaluation of the level of application of legislation in the case of the specific directives to which you referred."
"Mr President, I actually have a further question."
"It is very important that regulations governing health and safety at work are applied in the field of shipping, especially where oil tankers are concerned."
"It is also of crucial importance to comply with environmental legislation."
"Since the Erika disaster, we have had several projects in Europe that have aimed to improve environmental legislation with regard to oil tankers."
"Yesterday an oil spillage was discovered close to a nature conservation area in the archipelago off Turku, in Finland, probably due to some breach of environmental legislation - or at least the reason for it has not yet become apparent."
"I would therefore like the Commissioner to comment on what measures can also be taken with regard to environmental legislation so that culprits may be identified, and on whether it is possible that the Commission might also take action regarding the kinds of oil-related accidents that occurred last year in Gotland, on the French coast (with regard to the Erika disaster), and now in Turku in Finland."
"Thank you for your question, which of course refers to other policies."
"Environmental policy, especially after EUREKA, has been a driving force at the European Commission which, as you know, has submitted a framework of measures and proposals to the Council as regards both the actual ships and their various structural specifications and the measures which coastal countries need to take."
"However, as far as the specific issue of the health and safety of workers on tankers is concerned, I have to say, first, that European legislation which applies to building sites also applies here and, secondly, that there is a specific directive on fishing vessels, which are a separate class of ship, and a directive on the provision of medical care on board ships."
"That is all the legislation which relates specifically to the health and safety of workers on ships."
"Question No 45 by (H-0873/01):"
"Subject: Collection of statistical data on Greece According to the Commission's answer to my question H-0704/01 on the gathering of statistics on unemployment in Greece, the bulk of the reforms of the employment agencies are expected to be complete by the end of 2003, while the implementation of supplementary measures will continue through to the end of 2005."
"Since the Commissioner responsible stated in her answer to my question H-0675/00 in September 2000 that the responsible Greek authorities had given a commitment to speed up the restructuring of public services, the employment agencies and the statistical services, and given that the restructuring is due to be completed by the end of 2001, can the Commission say what the reasons are for the delay and who is responsible for it?"
"Mr President, the Greek authorities have undertaken to reform the national employment agencies, the so-called OAED, and to set up a modern, integrated statistics system which can cope with the problem of people entering and leaving employment."
"This undertaking is contained in the agreement on the community support framework for 2000-2006 or, more precisely, in the operational programme on employment and vocational training, and has been reiterated by the Commission in its recommendations for the last three years."
"The Greek Ministry of Labour has tabled a business plan for reforming the employment agencies."
"It is basically a plan which meets the need for preventive, individualised employment policies."
"It has also tabled a reforming law, which was published on 19 October 2001."
"The Greek authorities have informed us that the bulk of the reforms will be complete by the end of 2003, while the implementation of supplementary measures will continue until the end of 2005."
"One very important aspect of the reform of these agencies is the improvements which will be made to how statistics are collected and to the modus operandi of the employment agencies, which are the counterpart of the statistical office."
"Commissioner, we appear to be condemned, you and I, to discussing the same question every three or six months."
"It is like chestnut trees in Paris, to borrow an expression from journalism."
"My question is this: you originally told me - I have all the information here and I do not suppose that you will question it - that it would be all done and dusted in 2001."
"That is what you told me in September 2000, a year ago."
"Obviously, you do not lie. Obviously, you were given that information and this assurance."
"Now you tell me that you have been informed, but not assured I hope, that it will be all done and dusted in 2003, with a few extras 'tacked on' in 2005."
"What I should like to ask is who is to blame, Commissioner?"
"Are you in a position to point a finger at who is to blame for this situation?"
"Because this is no way to conduct a policy to combat employment and the periodic employment statistics published by Eurostat are making a laughing stock of my country because the column headed Greece is always blank."
"This is no longer acceptable."
"Sir, I do not think it is up to me to say who is to blame but I shall repeat the Commission's recommendations to the Greek authorities that the policies on employment, which are subject to the agreed framework of the employment strategy, that is, prevention and an individualised approach, be applied as quickly as possible."
"The reform of the national employment agencies in Greece is a difficult and complex matter."
"There were procedures which the Greek government had to follow in terms both of social dialogue and parliamentary deadlines."
"I only hope that a start will be made on putting these reforms into practice as quickly as possible."
"As always, Commissioner Diamantopoulou is highly alert; indeed, she is one of the most alert, able and sharp-minded of the Commission' s representatives."
"Employment statistics are certainly extremely important in combating unemployment."
"Does the Commissioner know, for example, that in Italy, in order to get a pension, many women are forced to sign on at the job centre as if they were looking for a job, thus altering the unemployment figures?"
"The jobless in Italy therefore always seem far more numerous precisely because there is a law that forces women to join the list of those seeking work even if this work is not what they want or desire."
"Since this is an inflated and unfair statistic, does the Commissioner not think that there should be an attempt to seek clear and transparent statistics?"
"Without doubt, statistical offices need to function objectively and correctly, correct statistical methods need to be used and the results of these statistical surveys need to be reliable if the strategy on employment is to be implemented properly."
"The European Commission has repeatedly made recommendations to numerous countries, wherever statistical offices have failed to harmonise with common European standards and there are problems with the statistics which they supply, and a new method is due to be introduced in 2003, in collaboration with the EU Statistical Office so as to ensure maximum harmonisation between statistical methodologies relating specifically to the question of employment and unemployment."
"I hope that preparations by the Member States, which have already started so that we can commission this new system in 2003, will be of help both to the European Union as a whole and to each individual country."
"Question No 46 by (H-0912/01):"
"Subject: Health and safety at the workplace As part of the Social Policy Agenda, the Commission has undertaken to publish a statement on a Community strategy for health and safety at the workplace in the course of 2002."
"Since comparable statistics are needed in order to carry out such an undertaking, how does the Commission intend to address the lack of data and problems of comparability between national data?"
"According to EUROSTAT research, the average percentage of accidents which are reported in the EU is 89%, while the corresponding figures for Ireland and Greece are 38% and 39%, respectively, which is very alarming."
"What measures does the Commission intend to propose to ensure that accidents at the workplace are reported?"
"May I say that I fully share Mrs Kratsa's concerns about the availability of comparable statistics at European level on both accidents at work and occupational diseases."
"As I said earlier, the European Commission has put the strategy on health and safety on its list of priorities and harmonised statistics from the EU Statistical Office will be the basis for the proper development of this strategy."
"The Commission has published two harmonised statistical methodologies since 1990."
"The first is the ESAW, the European Statistics on Accidents at Work, with 1993 as the reference year."
"The second is the EODS, the European Statistics on Occupational Diseases, with 2001 as the reference year."
"Provision was made for a special unit for work-related health problems in the 1999 survey on employees."
"As far as accidents at work since 1993 are concerned, the Commission has annual statistics available for nine economic sectors."
"These statistics come from various national sources and include statistics from Greece and, once they have been received from the Member States, they are adjusted by the Statistical Office in order to estimate the total number of accidents and ensure that they are comparable at European level."
"As regards your comment on statistics supplied by Greece in comparison with other countries, the statistics provided by Greece are supplied by IKA, the Social Security Fund, and only refer to a proportion of accidents because only accidents which result in more than three days off work are reported."
"According to IKA estimates, 39% of accidents are reported, which compares with Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom, although we must bear in mind that 45% of Greeks who are self-employed are insured with IKA."
"However, we know that, in 1999 in Greece, 43.4% were employers, self-employed or employees of family businesses, while the corresponding European average, according to Eurostat, was 16.2%."
"As part of the new Community strategy on safety, the Commission intends to recommend measures to improve the reporting of accidents at work and occupational diseases which, we believe, will help promote this strategy in all the Member States."
"However, I must stress that the efficient implementation of national provisions transposing Community directives, especially those relating to the employer's duty to report accidents sustained by employees at work is a matter for national governments."
"It is very hard for the European Commission to monitor the situation at national and regional level, let alone at enterprise level."
"So it is important for each country to set up national mechanisms to monitor health and safety issues."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for all the information which you have given me."
"I understand perfectly that, in order to achieve the objectives which you set in the Social Agenda, you need the national governments and the social partners as your allies."
"But how do you intend to change the climate?"
"Will the Community strategy which you propose force the Member States to supply detailed records, will you monitor progress, will you use tools other than the standard tools?"
"There are countries, such as Greece which you mentioned, which need to adapt to a number of new circumstances and a new policy, new obligations, in order to highlight and inform the social partners of the quality and economic benefits of monitoring and applying Community policy in the field of health and safety in the workplace."
"Mr President, the new strategy on health and safety will be announced at the beginning of 2002 and there will also be a consultation procedure with Parliament and with the Economic and Social Committee and the social partners."
"The Commission is already preparing a report under framework directive 89/391, evaluating the application of heath and safety in the Member States. This report is based on the reports submitted by national governments but also takes account of the independent expert's report."
"We are in the initial stages of drafting this report as I speak."
"However, I must tell you that there are new ideas as regards the application of the new strategy on health and safety and, to reply to your concern as to whether further steps will be taken, thought is being given to applying the open cooperation method to the field of health and safety, which means common objectives, common national action plans, recommendations and cooperation between Member States."
"This is one of the proposals which the Commission intends to submit for the new approach."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"Questions to Commissioner Lamy"
"Question No 42 by (H-0895/01):"
"Subject: Commission contact with the TABD The Transatlantic Business Dialogue (TABD) was set up in 1995 on the joint initiative of the Commission (led by Commissioners Brittan and Bangemann) and the US Department of Commerce."
"Is it true that the Commission and the TABD maintain permanent contact and exchange information and proposals with each other?"
"Has the Commission contributed to the financing of any of the TABD's annual conferences?"
"This question concerns the Transatlantic Business Dialogue that forms part of a series of dialogues established in 1995 at the Madrid Summit."
"The objectives of this dialogue, as of others too, and I will come back to this, are in a sense to build bridges across the Atlantic by bringing together a number of private, non-governmental players on the one hand and political decision-makers in the Union and the US Administration on the other."
"This system of dialogues that was established at the time certainly includes the Transatlantic Business Dialogue, but also includes a Transatlantic Consumer Dialogue, a Transatlantic Labour Dialogue and a Transatlantic Environment Dialogue; the business aspect being one of the pillars of this dialogue, which includes three others."
"The purpose of this range of dialogues is to draw up public recommendations addressed to the Commission and to the US government, which, on a rotational basis, present their recommendations to the political leaders at the EU-US summits."
"The Commission for its part attaches the same importance to all these dialogues, and we emphasise this because it has produced valuable results in terms of a number of developments, and certainly in terms of creating more balanced and solid transatlantic relations."
"Participation in these various dialogues is open."
"It is open to the parties concerned, in the various areas, and the results are obviously largely a question of how much the various participants invest in them."
"The Commission is involved at different levels in the events that are organised in the context of the Transatlantic Business Dialogue, including an annual conference between the CEOs of the various companies, which could be said to form the annual highpoint of this dialogue."
"The recommendations are published and available to the public, both on the website of the Transatlantic Business Dialogue and on the Commission sites, since our reactions to these recommendations are also in the public domain."
"In fact, some Members of this Parliament closely monitor the bilateral US-EU bilateral business relations and are invited to take part in the annual conference of the Transatlantic Business Dialogue on a regular basis."
"When the first dialogue was arranged in Seville, the two sides shared the costs of this event."
"In 1998, at another EU-US summit, both sides undertook to support all the dialogues and in fact that same year the European Parliament created a specific budget heading to support them."
"In response to your specific question about financing, since 1998 the Commission has contributed to the financing of the business dialogue, as, incidentally, it has contributed to financing the other dialogues in the form of annual contributions."
"In the case of the business dialogue, part of the Commission' s contribution was designed to cover the costs of organising the annual conferences, although most of the costs of these events are now covered by the business sponsorship system."
"That in fact explains why the Commission gives markedly less financial support to the business dialogue than it does to supporting the consumer dialogue, the labour dialogue and the environment dialogue."
"I want to thank the Commissioner for a very comprehensive answer."
"I have two follow-up questions."
"My first is as follows. The major companies in TABD are making a number of practical demands, or expressing their wishes, in connection with legislation they want to see within the EU."
"I wonder whether the Commission is reporting back on this to TABD, that is to say upon how these demands are being met and, if so, whether such reporting back is in the public domain."
"Secondly, I wonder if TABD representatives participated when political summits were held between the EU and the United States, that is to say, meetings at the highest political level."
"Have these major companies and their representatives access to such summits?"
"As far as the first point is concerned, I would like to say that, like the dialogues on consumers, the environment or employment, the transatlantic dialogue on trade is intended to produce desires, recommendations and points of view that can help to provide a basis for our own work."
"This contribution is, therefore, far from being exclusive."
"Since we are engaging with a number of people from the business world, with trade unions, with non-governmental organisations, we have a whole range of bodies that are contributing to trade policy, part of which is the dialogue on trade."
"This dialogue is important because the European and American business world is putting a considerable effort into this, which is commensurate with the importance of our trade relations with America."
"This framework provides the opportunity for desires and wishes to be expressed, and recommendations and comments to be presented."
"We discuss these, as we do with a number of representatives in the area of trade."
"With regard to participation at the summit, as I said earlier, those taking part in these dialogues on business, consumers, the environment and employment are, in turn, urged to come and present their recommendations to the leaders of the two sides, in other words to the American president on the one hand, and to the Presidency of the Council and to the Commission on the other."
"This is being done in conjunction with the summit' s official meetings, which, as expected, bring us together with the responsible political authorities."
"This is being done in conjunction with these events."
"Question No 43 by (H-0935/01):"
"Subject: WTO conference in Doha NGOs had very little opportunity to put their case at this year's WTO Ministerial in Doha."
"Does the Commission consider that the opportunities NGOs were offered to represent their interests at Doha were nevertheless adequate?"
"If not, how can it be ensured that NGOs and civil society are able to put their case in an appropriate manner at WTO conferences in the future?"
"Does the Commission conclude from this that no more WTO conferences should be held in cities such as Doha?"
"Mr Martin' s question broadly relates to the problems that non-governmental organisations experienced in gaining access to the Doha Conference in Qatar."
"First of all, I shall give you some background information."
"Any member country of the World Trade Organisation can stand as candidate to organise the ministerial conference."
"It turned out that Qatar offered to host the Fourth Ministerial Conference, and that it was the only candidate."
"If we cast our minds back, so that we have a clear understanding, this decision was due to be taken several months after the Seattle conference, which may explain why there were not as many candidates as some might have wished."
"Doha was, therefore, the only candidate city and it is relatively small in size."
"Nevertheless, I think that the authorities made a considerable effort - this was something that all those taking part in the ministerial conference mentioned - to be in a position to offer the delegates appropriate accommodation and provide the necessary logistical support."
"It is true that several delegations had to restrict the number of their participants due to the limited number of hotel rooms."
"That is true."
"However, I do not think that it is a catastrophe to slightly restrict the number of participants at such conferences."
"In any case, I am sure that this saved the taxpayer some money and as for the delegation from the European Union, we were pleased with the way the conference was organised."
"Furthermore, 20 Members of the European Parliament were in the EU delegation and I believe that they said they were satisfied with the way everything was organised."
"It is also true that logistical matters were not helped by the events of 11 September and that many security measures were added to the checks that are normally applied at such conferences."
"That is true, and it did not make anyone' s life any easier."
"I would like to reiterate that, as I also said to Parliament some time ago, we asked the Qatar authorities for access for the non-governmental organisations and were granted it."
"This is what happened, even if the security restrictions caused some difficulties for everyone."
"The last point that I would like to stress is that, again for security reasons, a large number of potential participants, whether governmental delegations, parliamentary delegations or non-governmental organisations, decided on their own initiative not to come to Doha."
"In my view, NGOs were offered genuine opportunities to put their case at Doha."
"The organisations that were present were able to contact their national delegations, were able to influence the outcome of the conference and we at Commission level widely encouraged transparency towards the non-governmental organisations."
"For instance, documents were discussed quickly, meetings were held openly, and everything that favours transparency has been, in my view, significantly improved over the last two years by the WTO secretariats, has been supported, encouraged, and even initiated by the European Union."
"Furthermore, the Director-General of the WTO arranged a number of meetings, in accordance with the commitment that he had made at the conference held in Geneva in July."
"I willingly take on board the idea of a code of conduct, which could regulate relations between the WTO and the non-governmental organisations."
"To come back to our own delegation, I said that it was made up of a number of MEPs, a number of colleagues of Franz Fischler and myself, more than fifteen representatives of civil society, who valiantly made the journey to Doha and who all achieved the goals they had set themselves."
"We worked together with them at Doha."
"If any one of them wishes to give their opinion, I have no objection to them doing so."
"I myself had many intensive discussions with these representatives during the conference, and also with the representatives of other organisations from European civil society, who were not, strictly speaking, part of our delegation."
"To sum up, if I compare Doha to Seattle, I think that we had better participation, greater transparency, a more lively reflection, and that the organisations present had a genuine opportunity to put their case."
"This certainly had an effect on the outcome of the Doha Conference. I spoke to you this morning on that subject."
"Overall I think that progress has been made in the way that civil society is managing to make its voice heard as regards multilateral trade policy."
"This happened between the Seattle and Doha Conferences, this happened at Doha and I am certain that this will happen more often after Doha."
"Mr President, I do not want to rephrase my question, but to put a supplementary one."
"Commissioner, if everything was the way you describe it and Doha really was better than Seattle, how, then, do you explain the numerous complaints by NGOs that they were disadvantaged in the run-up to the event, that they could not get visas issued to them and that they were deterred from active involvement by bureaucratic obstacles being put in their way or by being told that there were too few hotel beds?"
"Secondly, you have just described the narrow field of vision experienced by the European delegation, and how our delegation was composed. That was not, however, what my question was about;"
"I was asking, rather, about the extent to which civil society could consider itself represented there, my point being that the situation was quite different from that in a country in which there is the freedom to demonstrate and the corresponding possibility of self-expression."
"If though, you do not see things that way, I would very much like you to confirm that a second time."
"Mr Martin, as far as the accommodation facilities are concerned, these were inevitably determined by the number of hotel rooms available in Qatar."
"If my memory serves me well, there were approximately 4 500 rooms and, again if I remember correctly, about 700 of these had been reserved for the non-governmental organisations, meaning of course those NGOs that were present in that capacity, apart from those NGOs who were part of the delegations."
"However, in the context of the European Union, and I suppose that it is essentially the EU that is of interest to you - it is, in any case, of primary interest to me - we are very lucky to participate in such conferences with 15 Member States, which themselves bring a number of NGOs along with their own delegations."
"Therefore, from the European standpoint, many NGOs were present and I heard no complaints about this issue, either before or during any of the many meetings that I had with these organisations."
"As far as what happens next, I will be taking part in a status meeting next week which will enable me to come to an opinion."
"Once again, if you wish to hear first-hand information, those who were there will be able to give you the details."
"I think that the NGOs were able to take the initiative in Doha."
"Either I myself or my colleagues on my behalf spent time each day explaining to them (as I did for Parliament' s delegations and, of course, for the Council of Ministers) where we were coming from, what stage we had reached and where we were heading, so that they could follow the work and influence it."
"As you know, when you meet a delegation of this type which is able explain a few crucial points, this is what counts in such circumstances."
"I therefore feel that, from this perspective, things were much better at Doha than at Seattle."
"I would reiterate what I said earlier, with Doha being the only candidate city, competition and the law of the market concerning the appeal of the conference location did not really play a part."
"This is an issue that we can only take note of; since Doha was the only candidate city, I cannot see what other choice we had."
"I reiterate that we ourselves specified the condition that access be offered on an equal basis for all the delegations."
"Commissioner, would I be mistaken in suggesting that perhaps the admirable arrangements at Doha had something to do with the relative success of that meeting compared with previous WTO meetings?"
"Perhaps we are finding a way of having a more civilised relationship with the NGOs than was evident in Seattle and Genoa?"
"Are you happy that we now have a more rational and civilised arrangement to deal with the representations of NGOs for the future?"
"Mr Purvis, I can see what you are driving at and I am not sure that I can go as far as you want to take me in this direction."
"One of the reasons why Doha was better than Seattle - and, in my view, this is the main reason - was because everyone (the governments, the WTO, the NGOs) gave much thought as to why Seattle failed."
"Everyone learnt a great deal from this failure after the event, if I may say so, and took lessons from it in preparation for Doha."
"The reason why Doha was a success was, in the main, related to preparation. The reason why Seattle was a failure was, in the main, related to preparation."
"The preparations for Seattle were poor, the preparations for Doha were good, and that is what counts for around 80% of the success."
"That basically leaves 20%."
"In Doha, things were well managed and the number of parties, in other words, the number of people who felt involved in the negotiations, who felt able to influence them, was considerable."
"I always thought that what happened in the streets of Seattle only had a very small bearing on what was obviously a failure."
"Similarly, I believe that what did not take place in the streets of Doha only had a very small bearing on the success of Doha."
"Mr President, Commissioner, let me first congratulate you on your success in the Doha negotiations."
"I believe that the European delegation, to which I belonged, did very well to bring the negotiations to their conclusion."
"We stand a good chance of completing this round successfully."
"Our hosts in Doha also looked after us extremely well, something which I think was a fundamental requirement."
"What Mr Hans-Peter Martin is referring to, though, is the dialogue with the NGOs, a point I would like to probe further with reference to the Parliamentary Assembly."
"I do not believe it is feasible for this discussion to be carried on every couple of years and at the same location."
"Do you not think too that it would make more sense for parliamentarians from the various countries to be able to get together over a period of time and jointly to work through this subject, which is so crucial for the future, in a professional and detailed way?"
"Mr Rübig, I am very much in favour of the suggestion to organise, structure and make more permanent the consultation between the governments and the WTO, to set up an organisation and parliamentary structure which could be derived from the Inter-Parliamentary Union."
"You know, as I do, that we have worked on this area, and this House was a primary contributor."
"We have not managed to set up anything with any shape or form for the time being, for reasons that mainly relate, on the one hand, to the great reluctance of a number of developing countries, and on the other hand, to the fact that the members of the American Congress have not, as yet, shown any particular enthusiasm for the idea."
"These two barriers are still standing in our way, but I believe that we must not give up, and, in any case, if Parliament continues to move in the direction it has chosen, namely to attempt to set up this inter-parliamentary structure, you will have the support of the Commission in striving to overcome the obstacles that I have just mentioned, which are still standing in the way but which, in my view, must not deter us."
"Thank you very much, Mr Lamy."
"Questions to Commissioner Byrne"
"Question No 47 by (H-0880/01):"
"Subject: Animal transport The European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has recently adopted a report (A5-0347/2001) by Albert Jan Maat MEP, which calls on the Commission to present proposals incorporating a maximum limit of eight hours or 500 km on the transport of animals to slaughter or for further fattening and an end to the payment of export refunds in respect of the export of live EU cattle to third countries for slaughter."
"Does the Commission intend to present proposals incorporating the above two resolutions of the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development?"
"Mr President, as rightly pointed out by Parliament's report, one of the key issues concerning animal transport relates to travelling time limits, and I thank Parliament for its contribution."
"Travelling times, as with other parameters such as temperatures or densities, are essential elements to achieve a good level of protection for the animals during transport."
"As a matter of policy, the Commission considers it to be of the utmost importance to draft legislative proposals on the basis of sound scientific advice."
"The Commission has therefore requested an opinion from the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare on different welfare aspects of animal transport and, in particular, travelling time limits."
"This opinion is expected early in 2002."
"The Commission will present further proposals on animal transport in the light of this opinion."
"As regards the granting of export refunds for slaughtered cattle, the Commission shares the views of the Council, as expressed in its resolution of 19 June 2001 on welfare."
"The first objective is to correct the deficiencies observed with the implementation of existing legislation."
"There should be more controls and severe sanctions if the existing legislation on welfare during transport is not correctly implemented, be it on transport inside the Community or on exports to countries outside the EU."
"Commissioner Fischler is also committed to strengthening the existing rules in this respect."
"Community legislation in the field of export refunds unambiguously links the payment of aid to the respect of all the conditions related to animal welfare."
"The Community must achieve a well-balanced solution to the different aspects of this question."
"For example, it is wrong to assume that if we abolish the refund for live cattle, third countries will import carcases rather than live animals."
"I conclude by assuring you that animal welfare is very high on the agenda of the Commission."
"Animal transport in particular deserves much attention and action in the near future."
"In 1993, the Commission admitted that the laws on animal transport were being systematically flouted."
"In 1999, we had further evidence of particular problems in Spain, Italy and Greece."
"There is no reason to believe that implementation enforcement has improved at all since 1993 or 1999."
"Animals frequently still find themselves crammed into overcrowded trucks, given neither food nor water, often for journeys flouting the current limits and travelling for up to 30 or 40 hours."
"The combination of high temperatures, poor ventilation, overcrowding and lack of water can be lethal."
"Many animals suffer extreme discomfort during transport and arrive dead or dying at their destination."
"The European Parliament has repeatedly voted in favour of an eight-hour limit on transport."
"It had the overwhelming support of a majority in plenary."
"It had the support of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"I am pleased to hear that a proposal will follow the opinion of the Scientific Committee, but what is the Commission going to do to ensure the proposal is enforced properly and to ensure the current laws are enforced properly?"
"What specific actions is Commissioner Byrne going to take to improve enforcement both of current laws and the laws that we hope to see implementing an eight-hour limit and an end to export subsidies?"
"Mr President, as I have already indicated, this report is due to be presented to the Commission early in the new year and when that report is available it will be closely examined by my services and myself to determine an appropriate response with regard to time limits and distances."
"In the meantime, the control of this issue lies in the hands of Member States and it should remain there with the supervision of the Food and Veterinary Office."
"That is one of the jobs that is undertaken by the FVO in its inspection reports."
"The Commission also takes this issue seriously, not only in continuing its discussions with the Member States in circumstances where there is a recognised failure to comply with the legislation so as to ensure upgrading of standards, but also, where there has been a persistent failure to comply with the legislation, in instituting proceedings against individual Member States."
"There are a number of such proceedings being considered at the moment."
"You will also be aware of Regulation (EC), No 615/98 which requires and empowers the Commission to withdraw export refunds in circumstances where the animal welfare legislation has not been complied with."
"I refer you to the detailed answer given on 19 February 2001 to the question asked by Mrs Maes on the issue of the withdrawal of export refunds and, in particular, to the annex attached to that answer which clearly sets out the number of withdrawals of export refunds in respect of the Member States involved and the values involved."
"I assure you that this issue is taken seriously by the Commission and all the measures I have identified have been taken."
"We are keeping a close eye on this issue to ensure that animal welfare standards are kept up."
"I wonder when the treatment and transport of animals will be seen as part of the public health and food safety chain."
"We have already seen how animal nutrition has significance for people' s health, but the ways in which we treat animals and the methods and systems we use to feed and transport them in fact affect public health as directly as does poor animal feed."
"If these matters are not handled in the right way, there is a significant increase in the risk of diseases. These are mainly cured with antibiotics, but large quantities of tranquillisers are also used."
"One consequence of antibiotics being misused as a result of poor animal husbandry is that what, during the last 60 years, have been simple infections are now - and, above all, will be in the future - significantly more serious when antibiotics are no longer available to us."
"The connection between animal health and the treatment of animals and human health is well documented."
"There is a close association between the two and definitely a connection in the sense that you make reference to - antibiotics."
"The Commission has brought forward legislation in that regard and I refer you to the conference that took place only a couple of weeks ago under the auspices of the Belgian presidency on this particular issue."
"I refer you to what I said on that occasion and also to what Minister Magda Aelvoet said in relation to that particularly important issue."
"I also make reference to the zoonosis directive which has gone through the Commission and is now before Parliament."
"Mrs Paulsen is your rapporteur for that particular piece of legislation and I identify that legislation as also being important in addressing the question of animal health as an influencing factor on human health."
"Just one final point on this question, in relation to the transport of animals over long distances."
"One of the issues that has to be weighed in the balance and borne in mind is the location and quality of abattoirs and meat plants: they need to be up to the high standards necessary to comply with the legislation passed here in this House and by the Council of Ministers."
"The investment needed to achieve these standards means that there are now fewer abattoirs than there used to be and this is necessary in order to comply with the legislation for the protection of human health."
"But ultimately it also affects the question of animal transport and the transport of live animals over a longer distance."
"That, however, is another issue that has to be borne in mind in determining the protection of human health in respect of animals, animal health and animal welfare."
"I am going to ask all Members to be very concise in their questions, and the Commissioner in his answers, naturally, because we are running late and we want to finish the programme of questions."
"Mrs McKenna has the floor for a supplementary question."
"I am worried that maybe this scientific report is a way of trying to avoid reducing the time and the distance to what Parliament wanted."
"There was consensus between the Environment Committee and the Agriculture Committee on the reduction of the overall journey time and distance."
"It is very important that the Commission takes this on board. I am sorry to say I do not find your answer quite sufficient in relation to the export refunds."
"You talk about respecting all conditions of animal welfare and say you need a well-balanced solution."
"European taxpayers do not want their money going to fund something that causes distress and harm to animals."
"We need to stop the export refunds granted in relation to third countries for slaughter, irrespective of whether conditions are being complied with or not."
"It is wrong that our money is being used in this way."
"This is the message that came out clearly from Parliament."
"I would like a commitment from the Commission that it is going to abolish export refunds to third countries for slaughter."
"The scientific report you refer to will be made available for your consideration and will be considered by the Commission before bringing forward any further policies."
"On the question of stopping export refunds, I have already indicated that is not Commission policy."
"It is also not the policy of the Council of Ministers and it does not reflect their views."
"Therefore I cannot give the commitment you seek."
"We are going to change the order because Mr Lund needs to leave the Chamber urgently."
"Question No 49 by (H-0908/01):"
"Subject: Unacceptable limit values for heavy metals in fish The Danish newspaper Politiken reported on 15 November 2001 that the EU was to raise limit values to allow more heavy metal in fish despite a recommendation from an EU committee of experts that stricter standards should be introduced."
"Mercury, lead and cadmium, which are found in shellfish for which there is high demand, can, for example, weaken the nervous system and cause other very serious diseases in humans."
"There are absolutely no grounds for raising these limit values."
"Will the Commission therefore say why these limit values are to be raised, on which studies any increase may be based, and which studies are opposed to any increase?"
"I would also point out in this connection that the population of Denmark has long been encouraged to eat more fish as it promotes the general level of public health."
"Unfortunately, these endeavours will now be to no avail if, at the same time, the EU intends to raise the limit values for noxious heavy metals in fish."
"The Scientific Committee on Food made assessments on lead and cadmium in the diet and advised upon safe intake levels."
"It concluded that dietary intake levels were well below the safety thresholds."
"When EU legislation on contaminants is established, if the intake levels are below safety thresholds, the principle known as ALARA must be followed."
"This involves setting maximum levels as low as reasonably achievable."
"This is an internationally applied approach."
"In this specific case, the Commission adopted limits for lead and cadmium to come into force in April 2002."
"Concerns were expressed at the time by the Member States in the Standing Committee for Foodstuffs that the new provisions were not achievable for certain fishery products."
"It was agreed, therefore, urgently to review the relevant provisions."
"From recent data, it became clear that these limits would impose requirements beyond the scope of what is reasonably achievable, without benefit to public health."
"Therefore, the maximum levels in certain fishery products were reviewed and slight increases for certain limited species are now being proposed to take account of this reality."
"To set unachievable limits is not defensible."
"Given the overall intake levels, the revised maximum levels do not increase the risk to public health."
"Thank you very much for your answer."
"We are concerned here with ordinary, edible fish and shellfish, of which we normally recommend people in Europe to eat plenty."
"I therefore find it worrying that there is now a desire to increase the limit values."
"I must ask a couple of supplementary questions."
"Is it correct that the Committee of Independent Experts has in actual fact recommended a reduction in the limit values?"
"Is it correct that the United States has stricter limit values in these areas than we have in Europe?"
"Finally, I want to ask who has asked for these limit values to be increased."
"Is it the fishing industry and, if so, in which countries does the fishing industry want permission for higher limit values for the heavy metals at issue here: lead, cadmium and mercury?"
"In respect of mercury the general maximum level is 0.5 mg/kg for fishery products."
"That remains unchanged as previously set under veterinary legislation, in particular Commission Decision 93/351."
"The only proposed change is that two additional species have been added to the list of fish species for the maximum level of 1 mg/kg."
"These are the grenadier fish and the emperor fish which are minor contributors to diet, but data showed the lower level was unachievable."
"You then asked me about shellfish."
"The proposals will not increase the safety level of eating shellfish for either children or adults."
"The only proposed change for limits in shellfish as bivalve molluscs is for lead."
"A slight increase from 1 mg/kg to 1.5 mg/kg is proposed, because data shows that the lower level for lead is not reasonably achievable."
"Exposure to lead in the diet is well within safe limits."
"Otherwise, there is no change for provisions on cadmium or mercury."
"Question No 48 by (H-0889/01):"
"Subject: 'Smiling face' food quality label On 1 October 2001 the Danish food inspectorate began to have its reports put up in the 40 000 or so establishments in that country producing or selling food and drink to the public."
"The idea is that within a year all of them will be prominently displaying at least one report, clearly expressing the outcome of the official inspection in a label taking the form of one of four different facial expressions."
"A broad smile for example will mean that no adverse comments were made after the most recent inspection, while a really cross face will show that the establishment was fined, reported to the police or had its permit withdrawn."
"It would be hard to find a better way of conveying clear consumer information."
"Is the Commission aware of this new Danish system?"
"If so, is it prepared to recommend other Member States to follow suit?"
"If not, does it not feel that the system deserves closer study as a possible basis for future rules on the matter?"
"I agree with the honourable Member that it is important to raise consumer awareness."
"The Commission is favourable to any initiative protecting the consumer."
"However, the Commission considers that the task of developing food quality and information to consumers on the results of official controls, surveillance and other monitoring activities in the food sector should be left to Member States."
"Member States are responsible for carrying out the official control of foodstuffs at all stages of production and distribution."
"It is for them to decide how best to inform the consumer about these activities."
"This is in line with the principle of subsidiarity."
"While the Commission is not aware of this particular initiative by the Danish authorities, it can encourage such steps or the voluntary implementation of such initiatives by other Member States, but it is unlikely to make a similar proposal at Community level."
"I stress that these points are made in relation to the outlets that you particularly refer to in your question."
"Question No 50 by (H-0942/01):"
"Subject: State of slaughterhouses in Greece According to the data available, the Greek slaughterhouse infrastructure is extremely inadequate."
"Specifically, of the 350 operational slaughterhouses, 50 to 60 fulfil the requirements of Directive 91/497/EEC to a certain extent, and have formal approval, while the rest belong to municipal authorities and communes and are of ancient construction, with inadequate and obsolete equipment and no facilities for the hygienic disposal of liquid or solid waste or highly toxic substances."
"Additionally, cleaning and disinfection programmes are not implemented in these slaughterhouses and the slaughterhouse workers do not observe the rules on personal hygiene."
"Is the Commission satisfied with the current situation in Greek slaughterhouses, and what steps does it intend to take to ensure that Greece complies fully with Community law?"
"Slaughterhouses in Greece are approved by the competent authorities under Council Directive 64/433 on health conditions for the production and marketing of fresh meat as amended by Directive 95/23."
"47 slaughterhouses are recorded as being approved for placing meat on the Community market."
"The meat from the remaining operational slaughterhouses that is judged fit for human consumption can be marketed on the national territory."
"The last inspection mission on fresh meat carried out in Greece by the Commission's Food and Veterinary Office was in September 2000 in relation to porcine meat."
"This mission identified serious wide-ranging deficiencies in the operation of official controls and production standards in this sector."
"As the honourable Member is aware from the reply to his earlier question at the November session, there have been follow-up contacts with the Greek authorities during 2001 in an attempt to resolve the problems found."
"To date the action taken has not been satisfactory and the Commission remains very concerned about the situation."
"Further high level meetings with the Greek authorities are planned for early 2002 in an attempt to resolve the remaining shortcomings in food safety and veterinary control standards."
"With regard to waste water treatment, Council Directive 91/271 concerning urban waste water treatment foresees rules for slaughterhouses."
"Waste water above a particular volume must meet conditions established in prior regulations and or specific authorisations by the competent authority since 31 December 2000."
"Where slaughterhouses discharge directly into the public sewer, the general rules of the directive are valid."
"Detailed information on the situation of industrial discharges in Greece is under assessment."
"Commissioner, you said that 47 slaughterhouses meet certain Community requirements, while others can operate freely in Greece."
"The point is that we have 350 slaughterhouses, leaving a large number of slaughterhouses which obviously do not meet Community requirements."
"Is that correct?"
"I should just like to clarify this."
"The second question I wish to ask you is if you have any news on spongiform encephalopathy."
"The Commission has conducted an investigation in Greece."
"What is going on?"
"By which I mean as regards BSE."
"Then there is the serious question of the central meat market in Athens, where the Commission has ordered an investigation."
"Given that you are in contact with the Greek authorities, I should be obliged if you could tell me if you have any news on this matter."
"As I indicated in my earlier reply, the Commission remains very concerned about the situation in relation to slaughterhouses."
"With regard to BSE and other controls, I refer you to the FVO reports on this issue."
"On 22 May, I confirmed that I met the Greek minister in the margins of the Agriculture Council where there was a discussion in relation to the weaknesses identified in successive reports of the FVO."
"Once again, on 8 June, I wrote to the Greek minister asking for a follow-up to his initial reply of 27 April."
"This has led to further interaction between the minister, the relevant authorities in Greece and my own services."
"The message to the Greek authorities is consistent: much greater effort and resources must be invested in correcting the deficiencies consistently found in the missions of the FVO."
"The conclusions of the FVO reports are available for perusal on the website."
"As the time allotted to questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 51 to 83 will be replied to in writing."
"That concludes Questions to the Commission."
"(The sitting was adjourned at 7.25 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"WTO meeting in Qatar (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the meeting of the World Trade Organisation in Qatar."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to say how grateful and obliged we are to the Commission and the Council for the excellent preparation of the WTO Ministerial Conference in Qatar."
"Commissioner Lamy, you and your colleagues achieved something extraordinary in starting from an extremely difficult situation just before Doha and nonetheless, by the end of the meeting, getting all the subjects wanted by the European Union into the programme for the round beginning in 2002, this despite the usual, and largely unjustified, attacks by India and the Cairns Group countries on the European Union."
"Essential elements of our pre-conference resolution were included."
"Two weeks later, in Accra, I saw for myself the pride of Ghana's government representatives in pointing out that Africa had played an independent role this time, and this could, among other things, be attributed to good preparatory work by the European Union and in particular by Commissioner Lamy."
"The developing countries, particularly Africa, are now and for the future fully involved in negotiations, and this was also one of our main demands."
"The political declaration on TRIPS represents a respectable result for the African mediators, something that you have already mentioned this morning, Commissioner Lamy."
"The demands of the developing countries and of the Africans - ranging from the need for comprehensive technical aid to the Cotonou Agreement's exceptions up to 2008 - have very largely been met."
"The core European demands will, though, also be included in the new round of negotiations."
"I do not need to go into the details again."
"What is important is that we in the European Union can input our conceptions of a socially and environmentally responsible market economy into the system of free and fair world trade and that they can also, slowly, prevail."
"I also believe, though, that there is still more that we can do to make the WTO more democratic."
"Mr Lamy, you too have referred to the need for us to achieve the creation of a parliamentary assembly."
"We in this Parliament should retain our leadership role and also ask the Commission to continue its financial support for us, so that we can especially involve the representatives of the African parliaments."
"Let me return to a point made in this morning's debate."
"One of our colleagues, Mrs Lucas, pointed out that the outcome was poor, indeed unacceptable."
"I thought, here comes a European justification of European interests, but she only referred to India and certain NGOs, which..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, I want to speak on an issue which Parliament identified before Qatar as vital, indeed we called it 'make or break' as did the Commissioner - that is the link between environment and trade."
"In Qatar, we saw a breakthrough."
"For the first time, and against fierce and widespread opposition, we will have negotiations on some key environmental issues."
"Of course, much more remains to be done, but a process has been started and a taboo broken."
"The key to further progress must be to demonstrate, above all, to developing countries that their fears of green protectionism on our side are groundless."
"Qatar, frankly, did not produce the progress that we in the PSE Group wanted, and asked for beforehand on labour rights, on democracy and transparency in WTO decision-making."
"But it did leave the way open to progress on both."
"We know there was intense pressure from many countries, including developing countries, for a declaration that labour rights were a matter for the ILO alone."
"That pressure was resisted quite rightly and the principle of WTO cooperation with the ILO restated."
"The EU must now push hard to translate this principle into practice, seizing the opportunity given by the ILO's launch of a commission on the social aspects of globalisation in which the WTO and other international organisations will be participating."
"The ministerial meeting also agreed to negotiations on reform of the dispute settlement procedure with an open agenda covering whatever proposals WTO members choose to table."
"The EU must take this opportunity for openness and transparency."
"Commissioner, we would really like to know what your ideas are for reform and we shall not be slow in letting you know what our ideas are either."
"We would like to put on record today our recognition of the key role played by you, Commissioner Lamy, in the success of the meeting."
"You had a very difficult role and you displayed skill and tenacity."
"I emphasise, in particular, your insistence that you need the political support of this House in order to pursue the round in the way it was launched."
"We shall be marking our support in a resolution to be voted tomorrow."
"Many people went to Qatar hoping for a fiasco, hoping for a re-run of Seattle, hoping for something to denounce, in a mood of populism."
"They are disappointed in that hope and they need to be honest with themselves and to respect the views of developing countries not to indulge in paternalism as some of our colleagues have unfortunately done."
"The Qatar Declaration contains almost everything that developing countries wanted on the agenda."
"The agenda is not the outcome and we will need to be vigilant for a good result, but when developing...."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the World Trade Organisation has a future."
"It is true that in the coming years the 144 Member States will resume negotiations on the further liberalisation of world trade, but more than ever before, the rich man' s club has learnt that survival of the fittest no longer applies."
"Indeed, the developing countries have made huge progress and have made their mark during the negotiations. However, the European Union also has reason to be satisfied."
"Thanks to the commitment and perseverance of the European negotiators, both our Commissioners who are present today, an agreement has ultimately been reached on a broad-based negotiation round."
"For example, in the new round, there will be scope for negotiations about public spending, competition, investments, and the link between international environmental agreements and the WHO rules."
"These trade discussions are held at a significant time, because after the acts of terrorism in the United States, they send out the message that the Member States are prepared to join forces at international level and that terrorists cannot undermine international trade."
"Furthermore, it is important to continue the liberal trade policy because it can give the failing world economy a shot in the arm."
"Finally, I should like to point out that the WTO' s challenge is to continue to develop the multi-lateral trade system in such a way as to ensure that globalisation yields the best possible benefits for as many people and countries as possible."
"We must continue to strive as we have for over fifty years."
"Madam President, in a report to the 133 Committee on the WTO meeting in Qatar, the Commission asserts that 'active participation by European civil society strengthened the hand of the EU negotiator' ."
"This creates the impression that popular movements should be just as deliriously happy as Mr Lamy about the result from Qatar."
"That is an unusually impudent lie."
"The truth is that the environmental and solidarity organisations are criticising the EU' s action in Doha and characterising the final agreement as a defeat for the poor peoples of the world."
"The International Forum on Globalisation observes, for example, that the results from Qatar signify 'the ultimate triumph for the world trade body whose very mission is to exclude civil society from shaping economic systems' ."
"Prior to the Laeken Summit, ATTAC Belgium wrote that, partly because of its support for the WTO, the EU est essentiellement déterminée par les intérêts des institutions financières et des grandes entreprises."
"The truth is that both the European popular movements and representatives of the developing countries are very embittered about the EU negotiators' way of using the language of force to twist the arms of the poor countries' representatives."
"It is bad enough that the Commission should represent a Eurocentric, self-regarding and neo-liberal trade policy, but is it not rather crude, Mr Lamy, untruthfully to try to make Europe' s popular movements jointly responsible for the shameful abuse of power of which the EU was guilty in Doha?"
"Madam President, we view with concern the decisions of the meeting of the World Trade Organisation."
"Its repercussions in the short and medium term may prove disastrous for the peoples of many countries, particularly the less developed countries, but also some in the European Union, namely Portugal."
"For my country, the opening up in the agricultural and textile areas, including the bilateral agreements being negotiated by the European Union, such as that with Pakistan, without taking Portuguese requirements into account, is particularly worrying."
"For the economic and multinational groups, the most important factor was achieved: the opening of negotiations for greater liberalisation of world trade, postponed in Seattle and openly called into question this year by world organisations, namely those which were present at the World Social Forum of Porto Alegre and at Genoa."
"The triumphant declarations of UNICE (European employers' organisation) show this clearly when they state that the principal issue was settled, even if not all its demands were fully satisfied."
"The final resolution of the WTO itself, referring to liberalisation in particularly sensitive areas such as textiles, important aspects of agriculture, services and others, including the area of intellectual property, leaves little doubt, although its consolidation in practice could yet be influenced by any disputes that may develop."
"Even a few small positive advances in the field of intellectual property, after the pressure which countries like Brazil and South Africa brought to bear in order to obtain generic drugs to combat AIDS and malaria, show that it is important to step up the fight against capitalist globalisation in its various aspects, whether political, economic, social or environmental."
"The European Union trade associations have already condemned the opening of negotiations within the WTO framework without at least having secured real progress in upholding compliance with the ILO agreements and minimum standards of defence of workers' rights, given that there can be no sustained development without social and environmental development."
"The liberalisation of international trade favours the rich countries and multinationals, deepens the gulf between developed and less developed countries, as is clearly shown by studies conducted under the aegis of the UN, intensifies the exploitation of communities and workers by multinationals which dominate international trade and which are only interested in making maximum profit, even if it is at the expense of child labour, food safety, the environment, family farming and multifunctional farming."
"Hence the importance of mobilising support for the fight for an alternative of sustained development which places priority on reducing poverty and social expansion, which promotes a review of the CAP, which is more coherent, which provides more mutual support and which is less isolated from the countries of the South."
"Thank you, Madam President."
"The Qatar trade round was to become a round for the benefit of the developing countries."
"This objective has been partly achieved. Partly, because Europe, like other rich countries, refuses to cut down on market-distorting aid."
"Europe' s euphoria about Qatar can therefore be put down more to the expected trade liberalisation for its own benefit."
"It has to be said that Qatar has given the umpteenth green light for the reform of our agricultural policy."
"The challenge is to guarantee farmers a reasonable income without distorting the world market price."
"Direct income support, and a widening of the agricultural packages of tasks and rewards are positive steps towards that goal. Even after Qatar, the impression remains that not all Member States are adopting that line."
"Another matter of major importance for developing countries was the clarification of the agreement on intellectual property."
"There may be the political explanation that patent law should not obstruct the production of life-saving medicines in emergency situations, this explanation is not entirely satisfactory."
"Indeed, it must be possible for countries which do not boast an industry which produces these cheaper medicines to import them freely."
"The legal problems which emerge in this connection deserve a resolute approach."
"To avoid misuse, inspection to establish whether there is indeed an emergency situation is crucial."
"Finally, I would underline that in the fight for the environment and social standards, not distortion of competition, but market access for poor countries and their well-being should be the EU' s most important driving forces."
"Madam President, Commissioner, at Doha, the fourth WTO ministerial conference had to set an agenda and a programme."
"It did this, so from that point of view it was a success."
"Yet for whom was it a success?"
"It was, no doubt, Commissioner, a success for you, since you proved that you enjoy excellent health and the ability to work through the night."
"Talking of health issues, Doha was a real success as far as medicines are concerned, but it is chiefly due to Osama bin Laden that the poor people of the world owe their entitlement to access to medicines."
"In other words, if the USA had not been afraid of anthrax and had not, therefore, had to challenge Bayer' s intellectual property rights, they would not have given in."
"Apart from that, what did we get out of Doha?"
"The answer is, two things, a few clichés and a reprieve."
"The clichés are piling up."
"First of all there are those clichés about world trade leading to growth, stability, and of course peace."
"We had already signed a trade agreement in Marrakesh, and everyone knows that that agreement brought about peace in Gaza and in Palestine, and even peace in Afghanistan."
"The second great cliché is that Europe would have held out, but was abandoned by Japan."
"The least developed countries, despite having been given everything except arms, also abandoned it."
"Korea has maybe stayed with it."
"The European Union is showing cracks."
"The French farmers are on their own again, apart from some support from Ireland."
"However, Europe did obtain a victory on the environment and social affairs."
"On the environment, the United States, which is not a party to the Kyoto agreement, did not associate itself with us, and on social affairs, all the European trade unions have expressed their highly negative opinions about Doha."
"In addition, Europe obtained a reprieve."
"First of all there was the agricultural reprieve."
"Until the end of the negotiating round, and therefore until 2005, our farmers will have internal aid and restitutions."
"After that, we agreed that these will be abolished."
"However, the French representatives Jacques Chirac and Lionel Jospin called for a stay of execution so that they can get through the presidential elections without any trouble."
"They obtained that stay of execution for the CAP, which was facing the death penalty, so well, in fact, that when Poland accedes to Europe, Polish farmers will be deceived because they will be joining the Europe of the CAP when in fact, from 2005 onwards, there will no longer be one."
"We also obtained a reprieve for foreign investments."
"The IMA was thrown out of the OECD window only to return through the WTO door."
"We also obtained a reprieve on pensions."
"The insurance companies will not immediately be able to appropriate this large market for themselves."
"After Doha, therefore, we are left with the following situation: the European agricultural model has been broken up, the European cultural exception has been forgotten, and the long-term European social model is at risk."
"What will remain of Europe?"
"It will be merely a vast free-trade area, and everyone knows that, according to Adam Smith, free trade equals national poverty."
"Madam President, the self-appointed opponents of globalisation were in the headlines only for a short time."
"They thought they had exiled the WTO to the desert."
"Doha's very remoteness brought about a compromise anyway, one that was signed by all 142 members."
"What a contrast with Seattle in 1999, when debates on content were overshadowed by clashes on the street."
"I was there when militant demonstrators paralysed our conference and, in professional fashion, immediately supplied photos of the performance they put on."
"Doha again saw highly polarised debates between the seven hundred accredited NGOs and the national delegations, but it achieved important results."
"Three years are to be spent working on a new world trade round in order to facilitate further liberalisation of the global economy."
"The EU had its way in agricultural issues."
"One aspiration is that subsidies should come to an end, but this is not a precondition of the forthcoming negotiations."
"It is unfortunate that investments and environmental issues could not yet be put on the negotiations' agenda; they will be on it in two years' time at the earliest."
"We all have to give way somewhere - the USA on hormonally treated meat, the labelling of genetically modified produce and the opening up of the textiles market."
"The EU, too, must dismantle barriers, above all, Commissioner, as regards protection of farming."
"We must strike a balance between the opening of markets and their regulation."
"On the one hand, import restrictions are to be dismantled; on the other, the import of low-quality cheap produce is to be prevented, for, firstly, they are a danger to the consumer, and, secondly, pirated copies and infringed patent rights cost businesses billions."
"We are opposed to total liberalisation."
"Social security and public services need to be tested, but state monopolies should not be dismantled while private ones are built up."
"Changes to the agenda are just as important."
"Let us then call for sustainable protection of the environment, social standards and the punishment of human rights violations."
"Madam President, congratulations on being seated there today."
"Thank you to the two Commissioners who are present and thank you also to the whole of the Commission's team."
"I would also like to thank the Council."
"I believe it was only by working together that we managed to achieve real success here."
"I include in this, by the way, our colleague Mr Westendorp, who headed our delegation and, unfortunately, is not here this evening, but I believe he deserves as much gratitude as everyone else."
"There are just a few points that I want to address."
"First, I believe that many Members have yet again forgotten a number of things, above all those whom I always describe as permanently engaging in mantra politics by repeating the same thing over and over again."
"I believe that they are forgetting that Doha opened a way ahead for negotiations and laid down a strategy for them."
"We should give more consideration to how we can work together with the Commission and the Council in future, for it is only now that the actual negotiations are happening."
"The subjects for discussion must be defined, and it is by no means certain that apparent successes we have achieved on many points will prove to be lasting successes over the years, and so I would like to ask the Commissioners in particular how they actually envisage cooperation with Parliament."
"I would like this cooperation to be substantially more precise and detailed, giving a much more accurate view of the state of negotiations you will be engaged in on the various subject areas, and also signalling where there are difficulties or problems, not only giving definite information on many points, but actually facilitating political monitoring as well."
"Let me make another point."
"I believe it will be much more important than in the past to join up policies on trade and foreign affairs."
"I would particularly like to mention in this context two regions - the European Union and the United States."
"I believe that the European Union and the United States bear to an incredible degree responsibility for the future definition of trade policy, which is much more than can be summed up in the traditional trade themes we were familiar with in the past, incorporating as it does so many new ones."
"Development of traditional trade policy and its connection with new subject matter will be the difficult task to be faced in the future."
"You - above all Commissioners Lamy and Fischer - managed to bring that off elegantly in Doha, but, as I said at the outset, the real work is only getting under way now."
"I believe we must attach much more emphasis to putting foreign policy regarding countries such as, for example, India, Singapore or China, but also regarding many of the Latin American countries, on a much firmer footing, using a stronger foreign policy to achieve greater understanding for what we actually want to achieve in the sphere of trade policy."
"There is still the prevalent feeling in certain countries and states that we are actually using our trade policy to engage in indirect protectionism."
"We should take care that this sentiment does not arise in the first place, and that, if it does, it can be rooted out."
"The Singaporean Ambassador has again drawn my attention to his country's long-standing desire to conclude a free trade agreement with the EU."
"I believe that bilateral free trade agreements bring with them the possibility of opening doors of that sort, and also have the potential to achieve greater multilateral rapprochement by means of bilateral negotiations."
"Commissioners, perhaps you would be so kind as to tell us what you think about that."
"Thank you, Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. The Doha Conference has spawned a sense of enthusiasm that I can only ascribe to the fact that expectations were so low, for I have to say that we remain very critical."
"Inequality of power is simply too pronounced in the world, which leaves its mark on conferences of this kind."
"While the developing countries wanted to see the earlier agreements through to a conclusion, Europe wanted to continue to build at multilateral level. There was therefore a certain level of ambiguity which has facilitated some progress."
"We are, of course, delighted with the fact that in connection with medicines, unmistakable progress has been made, because there is now at least an agreement about the intellectual property rights."
"However, we are hugely vexed by the fact that Europe continues to insist on high import levies on agricultural and textile products, while an agreement on a gradual cutback had, in fact, been reached."
"The first results should be evident as soon as 2005, and upon further research, it now emerges that too little has happened in this field."
"At the moment, agricultural support as a whole is hardly any lower than at the end of the eighties."
"As at previous WTO conferences, the liberalisation of the economy was also mentioned at Doha."
"Although the issue of intellectual property rights may have been a positive illustration of this, surely this was only a tiny ray of hope."
"Ideally, we would like see that we side with the weak, for whoever observes this world at war is bound to see that this is all about inequality of power."
"Madam President, all this triumphant talk masks the latest instalment in a policy to ensure that global trade serves the interests of the multinationals."
"Further liberalisation is still the main objective, that is, opening up the markets in poor countries to the industrialised products of the developed countries which, at the same time, will import agricultural produce to compete with our own, together with raw materials at derisory prices."
"In the agricultural sector, the main aim is to wipe out subsidies, which would strike a tremendous blow to production in countries such as Greece where, I should point out, farmers have taken to the roads yet again in order to demand a fair price for their labour."
"When it comes to foreign investment, competition, public procurement and commercial arrangements, the 'because I say so' approach has been used to impose imperialist choices, despite the almost universal opposition of non-governmental organisations and the less developed countries."
"The meeting in Qatar confirmed the WTO as the main tool of capitalist globalisation."
"Any interest evinced in the problems of less developed countries and the environment is lip service and, as such, mere hypocrisy."
"It does, of course, show that the mass demonstrations have had an impact and that the WTO is trying to hijack the anti-globalisation movement by appearing to be sensitive to its concerns."
"But it took good care to shield the meeting from troublesome protestors and we would not be surprised if the next meeting were held in Antarctica."
"The only way open to the grass-roots movement is to resist and counterattack both the WTO and the European Union and the governments advocating and applying anti-grass roots policies."
"Madam President, I also consider the results of the ministerial conference in Doha to be positive and I would therefore like to join other Members in congratulating Commissioner Lamy, Commissioner Fischler and the Council on their unquestionable contribution to this success."
"It is true that the final declaration does not say everything it should say and, I would say, that sometimes it says more than it should say, but any negotiation means reaching compromises and compromise requires concessions."
"The thing we must really value about Doha is the bringing together of the diverging, and sometimes contradictory, interests of the Member countries of the WTO and an agreement has been reached to launch a new round, set an agenda, a timetable and a working programme, and, secondly, that the development dimension has been fully integrated into all negotiations and that the least-developed countries and the developing countries have spoken out strongly and their voice has been heard and their concerns taken into account."
"The WTO train, as you said quite rightly, Commissioner Lamy, is back on the rails and has already left the station."
"I would add that furthermore the means have been provided so that its destination may be a sustainable growth which also benefits the poorest countries."
"However, in order for that train to reach its destination, the necessary means must be adopted, the texts must be interpreted correctly, since they are full of structural ambiguities, and guarantee reciprocity in the opening up of the markets and full respect for the rules which govern multilateral trade."
"In order to help to overcome the barrier of poverty once and for all, we must adopt the necessary measures to facilitate access, above all by the least-developed countries, because these countries may suffer as a result of the multilateral commercial system, due to the advantages we offer to the developing countries."
"Mr President, before Doha, many of us were clearly aware that the issue of access to medicine was going to be the benchmark that developing countries would use to test our seriousness about whether we wanted to launch a development round."
"What we have seen is a declaration on access to medicines and public health."
"Even the title is important because it is not just about access to medicines, it is about support for public health."
"It is groundbreaking and, as someone said this morning, it has within it a commitment to the whole question of flexibility of the agreement on TRIPS."
"As the Commissioner is well aware, the United States and Switzerland, in particular, argued that the reference to public health was too broad."
"They wanted it to be limited to certain infectious diseases."
"But I have to say, Commissioner - and you will agree - that what happened represented a real victory for developing countries because they were skilled in negotiation, and that position by the US and Switzerland, in particular, was finally rejected."
"It is important that we pay tribute to developing countries and to the negotiating skills that they displayed."
"The belief traditionally fostered by the pharmaceutical companies has been that patents are sacrosanct."
"After Doha that has changed."
"If drug companies price medicines beyond the reach of people who need them, governments can override patents without the fear of retribution."
"Despite the progress at Doha, as far as patent rules are concerned, the story is far from over."
"I have two specific questions, Commissioner."
"Does the Commission agree that the immediate challenge is to ensure that the WTO lifts the restrictions on the export of cheap equivalents of patented drugs to countries which have decided to override a patent but do not have the necessary manufacturing capacity?"
"That issue was not resolved at Doha and has been referred to the TRIPS Council."
"Secondly, how does the Commission intend to ensure that countries without production capacity or insufficient production capacity can make full use of the compulsory licensing provisions?"
"This must, in my view, be accompanied by a reduction in the length of drug patents in poor countries."
"TRIPS currently dictates a patent term of 20 years world-wide."
"At the review of the rules scheduled for 2002, the WTO should at least agree to extend the deadline for TRIPS compliance for all developing countries and base it on development progress rather than on arbitrary dates."
"I wonder if the Commissioner agrees with me on this?"
"Finally, on the question of developing countries, I would like to pay tribute, in particular, to ACP countries, in which we have a particular interest and partnership in the European Union."
"The 77 ACP countries succeeded in obtaining a waiver."
"They put out a brilliant declaration before Doha."
"I have had several meetings with them since then."
"They are well pleased with the results."
"Doha should have been the development cycle."
"Yet what have the developing countries gained from Doha?"
"I do not share other Members' optimism on this point."
"For instance, the agreement on access to medicines, which appeared to be a victory, is really a decoy to lure the media and the developing countries."
"Presented as a vital stake at this conference and as a major concession to the developing countries, the clarification of the TRIPS agreement and the interpretation of it - which has always been our interpretation - are admittedly a political victory, but that victory changes nothing from the legal point of view."
"It is of no value before the body that settles disputes within the WTO, and, as Mrs Kinnock has pointed out, the question remains unresolved for those countries which have no production capacity."
"For the time being, nothing allows them to use compulsory licensing in order to arrange for the medicines they need to be manufactured by third parties, and this point was emphasised at the recent conference in Ouagadougou."
"In the same way, the derogation and the WTO' s reciprocity rule, which were granted at the last minute to signatory states of the Cotonou agreement for a period of eight years, appeared to be a positive achievement."
"In reality, however, that authorisation, which the ACP states had been waiting for for months, seems more like blackmail as far as they are concerned."
"They were obliged to sign the final Doha declaration or risk having their request refused."
"The gains were therefore minimal, and were used by the countries of the West, which are united in their desire to launch a new round, as a means of buying what they wanted."
"In reality, what happened at Doha was more like a cynical play at the theatre."
"We are becoming increasingly committed to unbridled liberalisation and, as we shall continue to insist, a fundamental reform of the WTO really is essential."
"Madam President, Mr Lamy, Mr Fischler, I should like to say, first of all, that I am delighted by the success of the Doha ministerial conference, not only from the point of view of its results, but also from a material point of view."
"It took place in excellent conditions, despite all the fears that we may have had."
"Holding this event in Qatar was in itself a response to the war against terrorism that we entered into following the tragic events of 11 September."
"Like other Members who took part in that conference, I appreciated the constant transparency that prevailed between the Council, the Commission and Parliament during the negotiations."
"That transparency was also the order of the day among the NGOs present at Doha, who are to be congratulated on the efforts that they have made in this direction since the previous conference in Seattle."
"We all hoped that this conference would lead to a substantial agreement that would pave the way for growth to be stimulated, thereby contributing towards economic development at a time when the international community is going through a very difficult situation."
"This ministerial conference certainly enabled considerable progress to be made on various fronts, including the inclusion of China and Taiwan."
"Another positive result, as has already been mentioned, was in connection with medicines."
"As for the rest, the Commission took a tough stance in the negotiations, and the efforts that it made during the final night and on the morning of 14 November enabled the European Union to convince its partners that its positions were well-founded."
"However, the work programme is still lagging behind the ambitions that we had set ourselves on certain major issues, such as the environment, the Singapore agenda and social standards."
"For my part, I should like to make three comments."
"During the conference, the developing countries often adopted a highly critical attitude towards the European Union."
"When we were preparing for this ministerial conference, did we listen carefully enough to their concerns?"
"Let us show humility, let us take up our pilgrim' s staff again, let us listen to them and try to understand them, so that we can take their real concerns into consideration, and above all let us stop taking their place in defining the development policy that they need."
"Secondly, the Doha ministerial declaration constitutes an undertaking to start negotiations on the priority issues of European enlargement and integration."
"Finally, now that the real negotiations are about to start, I hope that the transparency that has prevailed so far will continue to do so, and that it will be strengthened still further between us."
"I have just one question to ask the Commissioner. What will be the general structure of the negotiations which will be defined?"
"Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the European Parliament delegation attending the Doha Conference, I too would like to congratulate our Commissioners on the excellent work that they accomplished and the results that they obtained, which were undeniably very positive and which bear witness to the highly effective way in which our Commissioners handled these negotiations."
"I should also, above all, like to say how pleased I was with the excellent cohesion and solidarity between our three institutions which were represented in Qatar."
"Basically, and restricting my comments solely to the agricultural issues, I was interested to discover that the European Union has given itself the room to manoeuvre that is needed to reform its common agricultural policy in response to the new expectations of our society, because non-trade considerations were explicitly mentioned in the final ministerial declaration."
"It seems to me that this aspect is the vital element in the outcome of Doha."
"The priority for European farming today should no longer be to remain competitive in exports at any cost."
"It should be to satisfy social demand as regards food security and the sustainable rural development."
"The Union can also take advantage of a success that it has achieved with regard to the United States, because all forms of aid to exports will be subject to negotiation in the new round."
"Finally, it seems to me that the Union can congratulate itself on the fact that special and differential treatment for developing countries has been strengthened."
"That should enable them to respond to their needs, including those needs relating to food security and rural development."
"This prospect, in its turn, is more likely to encourage the development of farming for food production, and is therefore very important from the point of view of the world demand for food, which is expected to double in the next twenty-five years owing to the increase in the populations of the developing countries and the improvement in living conditions in the emerging countries."
"In all, I believe this agreement represents a good balance between trade liberalisation and regulation, and also between trade and the development of all types of farming."
"I just hope that the negotiations in the new round will fulfil the hopes that have now been raised."
"Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, it is too early to say who won or lost at Doha in terms of the agricultural COM, since the only issue there was agreement on an agenda and a timetable of negotiations."
"The winners for now were the developing countries, whose principal demands, including the demands of the ACP countries, were accepted in the text."
"The countries of the Cairns group and the United States saw enshrined in the text the principle of ongoing agricultural reform, improved market access and the gradual elimination of export subsidies."
"The European Union succeeded in ensuring that this reduction in export subsidies would not be automatic and had some of its main demands in terms of reinforcing the non-commercial elements of the agreement included in the text."
"Despite the relative optimism of the Community negotiators, the agreement did not include some of our fundamental demands."
"Multi-functional agriculture was not expressly referred to in the text and the strengthening of measures for the protection of geographic indicators was only defined clearly for wines."
"Furthermore, one thing was made crystal clear: the elimination, even the gradual elimination, of export incentives, will create strong pressure to reduce agricultural prices internally."
"It will therefore not be difficult to conclude that the next reform of the CAP, before 2006, will have to be more thorough than may have been hoped."
"Not just because of the cut in the guaranteed prices it will involve, but also and especially because of the qualitative change in the instruments of support for farmers so that, even without market support, they continue to have an income safety net."
"Doha was merely a starting point and much has still been left open."
"But let there be no illusions."
"Today, our commercial adversaries are fighting for an end to the supposedly more distorting support of international competition, but tomorrow they will want to impose an end to all types of agricultural subsidies, that is, the old story of the rings, the fingers and then the rest."
"It would not be fair to end without paying special tribute to our Commissioners for the courage and firmness they showed in these negotiations."
"Madam President, Commissioners, I will avoid polite flowery phrases, for you cannot talk up the outcome of Doha in such a way as to paper over the absence of any social component in world trade - at least from the point of view of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"It is not only that that is regrettable; we must not overlook the minimal acceptance of environmental and food safety, and the failure to accept the demand for clarification of the precautionary principle."
"Now, though, to my main criticism."
"The EU often happily talks about the social dimension as a part of our European philosophy, but all it has achieved as regards the issue of core labour standards as human rights in the workplace has been to return them to the position discussions had reached at the 1996 Singapore Conference, that is, they have been put on ice."
"What has become of our social responsibility?"
"Perhaps this next observation will not be lacking in interest."
"I basically welcome the fact that China has joined and that, hopefully, other countries will do so as well, but I doubt that it will become any easier to achieve basic human rights standards at work."
"So the beginnings of an opportunity have certainly just passed us by."
"I warn against taking conflict prevention too lightly."
"If sensible steps are not taken to monitor it, globalisation will spark further demonstrations and more social conflict."
"As Mr Mann has already pointed out, Seattle is not a thing of the past."
"It can be resurrected, and we, in the safe haven of the European Parliament, should not banish that thought from our minds."
"Commissioner Lamy, what are you thinking of doing in future to ensure that core labour standards are not only insisted on by the toothless ILO? How can you help us, after what has happened at the WTO, to make a new start and move things forward?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking the team of Fischler, Lamy and Neyts most warmly for getting a new round of talks together."
"It is, though - in my opinion, Mr Ettl - significant that people are talking to each other rather than looking for points of conflict."
"I believe that this spurt of growth in Europe, especially in employment in Europe, is of enormous significance - but not only for Europe, for, particularly in the developing countries, millions of people will be able to cross the poverty line, something that represents a breakthrough for the poor in the developing countries as well."
"I believe this is of especial significance for Europe, which is the world's greatest exporter of goods and services and the world's biggest investor."
"Discussions covered many areas affecting the developing countries, the environment, social affairs and animal protection too, and I believe that efforts are being made to find consensus here as well."
"We should not forget, though, that the WTO should also be concerning itself with the creation of fair general conditions for investment, competition and market access."
"We must remove the administrative obstacles to trade and take reciprocity into account when opening up markets; we need maxima for customs duties and reliefs for SMEs and for products sent in small quantities."
"Where trade works, so does democracy, and prosperity is the result."
"I also take the view that the real, economic actors should be more deeply involved in the negotiations, and I believe it is right and proper that we should bring in EuroCommerce, Eurochambres, UEAPME and the SME-Union, so that they can join in discussions on this subject."
"To tell the truth, conglomerates no longer see the WTO as the core issue - there is already a McDonald's in every city in the world."
"I would like to end by asking another group to explain to us how they are going to handle the confidentiality of discussions between the Commission and Parliament in future."
"I believe we need a solution to this in order to guarantee good, honest cooperation in the future."
"Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the President of the Commission expressed optimism this morning as to the future of Europe."
"""A greater Europe is taking form"" , said Mr Prodi."
"We may ask: is a Europe taking form that is greater in spirit and in intent?"
"A Europe with new aims, a Europe capable of performing its international role better?"
"I hesitate."
"It is permissible to doubt."
"The Conference of the World Trade Organisation in Qatar in itself justifies tempered optimism."
"The European Union' s action through its representatives, namely Commissioners Lamy and Fischler, was difficult but frankly positive."
"In fact, European diplomacy contributed decisively to the positive results of the Conference and hence to putting an end to the paralysis of the World Trade Organisation, to restoring its credibility after the resounding failure of the Seattle Conference."
"The commitments undertaken by the European Union are far from fulfilling our main priorities, particularly in the environmental and social spheres."
"The European representatives were, in fact, faced with a dilemma, where they saw protection of nature and social rights, the representatives of the developing countries saw only disguised protectionism of European interests."
"Therefore, there are grounds for hope, but also grounds for disappointment."
"It is worth emphasising the positive aspect of the negotiations with regard to agriculture, which are, at last, prompting and stimulating an in-depth reform of the CAP which the European Union proved incapable of carrying out internally."
"Equally praiseworthy are the results obtained with regard to medicine prices and the undeniable victory achieved over the egoism of the pharmaceutical multinationals."
"The Doha Conference represents just a small step along the steep path that aims to harmonise liberalism and regulation, a small step for globalisation to contribute to world progress and especially to the reduction of poverty, hunger, disease and violence."
"Lastly, if the failure..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Thank you, Mr Lage, your speaking time is up."
"Before I give the floor to Commissioner Fischler, in my capacity as President - and of course, I am not allowed to take part in the debate - I should like to warmly congratulate both Commissioners and also thank them for the pleasant working relationship which was very constructive, particularly in Doha."
"I now give Commissioner Fischler the floor."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, before Pascal Lamy sums up the discussion as a whole, please permit me a few remarks on the subject of agriculture."
"I see the most important success at Doha as having been the formulation now contained in the Doha Declaration, which gives us the chance to decide for ourselves the direction we will take in agricultural policy."
"That is both an opportunity and a responsibility."
"It is an opportunity because, unlike in the Uruguay Round, we are not so much standing with our backs to the wall in a situation in which, while we continually just said 'no', the other parties to the WTO Treaty determined the direction of future policy."
"It is, though, also a responsibility in so far as this outcome does not mean that we do not have to make further appropriate developments to our agricultural policy."
"It is this task that now faces us, and it is one that we must take very seriously."
"The criticism from some quarters has been that we, the rich part of the world, continue to exploit the developing countries with the help of our refunds on exports."
"I take a somewhat different view of this."
"I believe we should not ourselves make the mistake of hanging on to old images of a former agricultural policy."
"Four per cent of the Community budget is hardly going to put the whole world's agricultural trade out of true, and we use no more than 4% of the total Budget for the promotion of exports."
"I also, by the way, take the view that we really have nothing to be ashamed of when it comes to imports."
"The European Union alone imports more agricultural produce from the developing countries than do the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan put together."
"Various speakers have rightly pointed out that the work is only just beginning, something for which we will have to make proper preparations."
"It goes without saying that we will make our further preparations in consultation with Parliament."
"What still matters above all, though, is working at convincing others."
"We cannot assume that our ideas about the future of agriculture will be accepted elsewhere in the world without needing to be explained."
"I cordially invite you to join with us in carrying on this work of persuasion together."
"Let me conclude with heartfelt thanks for the many compliments we have received today."
"I see them, though, more as an appeal to us to carry out our responsibilities in the future."
"Madam President, I must say that the fact that our work this evening is being chaired by an eminent specialist in trade matters is symbolic, and I should like to thank you, as well as all those present here this evening who believe that the Doha ministerial achieved positive results."
"I should also like to thank, as Mr Fischler has done, those of you who have attributed part of that success to those negotiators who are this evening sitting on the Commission benches."
"Having heard everyone who has spoken, I believe that the broad majority among you approve of what was achieved."
"The fact that your approval is not completely unanimous is a matter of regret, at least for Mr Fischler and myself."
"We shall try to do better next time."
"The fact that the results obtained are of good quality is really due to the fact that this is the product of policy work in which Parliament and the Council played an important part."
"I believe that Doha has reminded us of a basic rule of Community algebra, which is that the weight of the negotiators is an exponential function of the solidarity of the Union."
"Once again that rule has proved to be true."
"Yet that solidarity was neither the result of a sudden act of faith nor the expression of blind confidence in the two negotiators, whatever the qualities that you have emphasised."
"In reality, the solidarity derived its substance from the Union' s negotiating position and from the balance, which is in some ways intrinsic to our mandate, between liberalisation and regulation, between our general concerns here among the countries of the North and our openness towards the concerns of the countries of the South, between the specific values that we, as Europeans, wish to defend and our openness towards a number of the concerns felt by partners who do not necessarily share those values."
"Of course, we did not achieve our objectives one hundred percent."
"That is true but, as in any negotiations, we reached a compromise, a compromise in which everyone can be a winner, since we are not playing a game in which the stake is zero."
"However, it is true that on the social side - and I think that neither Mr Fischler nor I have sought to conceal the fact - we have not made as much progress as we would have liked."
"Many of you have, quite rightly, said as much, and we shall have to keep working on it in other forums."
"I should just like to say a word to those people whom I have heard criticising the development aspect."
"To be honest, I find it hard to understand their criticism, since the developing countries have been able to express themselves and make their voices count at this ministerial conference in conditions that they have never been able to obtain before, and I can say to this House that the Union played a part here, and if the developing countries were able to obtain a place at the conference table - both during the conference itself and during the preparations for it - which is much better than it has been before, it was to some extent the result of the efforts that the Union had been making in various places."
"As a result, we shall be tested during the next round of negotiations, on our capacity to remain faithful to this viewpoint, particularly when it comes to adapting our programmes of technical assistance for development to fit the ambitious negotiation programme which has been decided on."
"We shall have plenty of opportunity to verify it with our African friends during the phasing-in period after Cotonou and the WTO negotiations."
"In reply to the question about the order in which things will happen, I can say that the real negotiations, particularly at technical level, will start at the beginning of next year."
"I would suggest that we stick to our usual successful working methods, in other words, as things develop, continuing in what I believe to be more or less complete transparency, we should keep one another informed about developments in our mutual positions, and in particular about the Union' s negotiating position."
"The structure of the negotiations themselves is still being finalised."
"On this point, we shall have to be scrupulous and careful to ensure that a certain number of the political balances that we obtained in the negotiating programme are not destroyed by some underhand means as a result of timetables with variable speeds, which would have the result of dealing with some subjects before others."
"On the specific subject of intellectual property and medicines, as someone has already pointed out, the question of the use of compulsory licences by a developing country which does not have its own production capacity still has to be sorted out, and we shall be actively considering this issue and other issues too."
"We shall be proposing solutions that will be in the same spirit as what we have already done in order to achieve this compromise, a spirit which those of you who are familiar with the Commission' s position in February last year will easily have recognised."
"It should be noted, in passing, that most of the countries in question are exempt from the disciplines of the agreement on intellectual property until 2006."
"Finally, to those of you who would like to see a reform of the WTO and who have pointed out, quite rightly, that this is not included in the working programme, I would reply that I share your view."
"Some progress has, admittedly, been made since Seattle, at least in practice, without making any formal changes to the rules of procedure."
"This is true in the case of transparency, and it is true as regards having a much larger number of the actors who sit around the WTO table being involved in the decision-making process, but I think that at Doha we probably went as far as we could in terms of what informal action can add to formal action, and I think that we shall have to think about this matter very soon."
"As most of you have said, the serious negotiations are only just starting, and will continue during the years to come, in all probability with the maximum negotiating intensity somewhere between 2003 and 2004."
"We therefore have a little time to prepare for the peak in the negotiations which will no doubt occur at around that time."
"I believe, therefore, that our method of working together has produced some good results, and I hope that during the negotiations we shall retain this spirit, which is at one and the same time positive, resolute and open, and which is the spirit in which we have been working for the last two years."
"In any case, you can count on Franz Fischler and myself to ensure that that is the case as far as the Commission' s contribution is concerned."
"I have received four motions for resolutions, submitted in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"Public health (2001 - 2006)"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council' s common position with a view to the adoption of a programme of Community action in the field of public health (2001-2006) (A5-0420/2001)"
"I now give the floor to Mr Trakatellis, the rapporteur."
"rapporteur. (EL) Madam President, the adoption of the Community action programme in the public health sector is the European Union's first integrated attempt to protect public health."
"Protecting public health is currently one of the primary concerns of the Union's citizens."
"Health must be a priority, over and above political or economic compromises, and cannot be treated as a commodity."
"The programme designed to replace sectoral and fragmented Community action on health is a more integrated programme, based mainly on disease prevention, which will help us to introduce quality standards in the public health sector."
"The Council has included a large number of the amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading in its common position, mainly as the result of excellent cross-institutional collaboration."
"However, important aspects of our proposals have been rejected in the common position; worse, part of the programme's proposal has been deleted by the Council, forcing us to amend the common position in the Committee on the Environment, the members of which voted in favour of the present recommendation for second reading by a large majority."
"I should like now to make a few comments on the programme itself."
"The main objective of the programme is to strengthen collaboration between the Member States - and hence achieve added value from the synergy of Community action - by developing three lines of approach, which constitute the general aims of the programme."
"The first line of approach is to improve the information and knowledge needed in order to develop public health."
"The second line of approach is to strengthen the potential for a rapid and coordinated response to health threats."
"I should point out here, given that it is three months to the day since the terrorist attack on 11 September, that we need to include a category to deal with health threats from natural, biological and chemical agents caused by unforeseen circumstances, such as accidents or defective infrastructure or machinery, human error or even acts of terrorism."
"The third line of approach is to take account of health-determining factors in all policies and activities through health promotion and disease prevention schemes."
"The programme, which complements national policies, aims to achieve a high level of physical and mental health and greater equality in health issues throughout the Community."
"Given that the programme has limited resources, we need to prioritise health protection measures, so we can support action to prevent the most serious diseases, together with practical action and the need to develop an integrated, cross-sectoral health strategy within which all Community policy and action will help to protect and improve health."
"I should like to highlight two points in our amendments to the common position."
"Although we are in almost total agreement with the Council on the objectives of the programme and on individual issues, there is still a great deal of discussion as regards coordination and the budget for the programme."
"The European Parliament feels that this sort of complex programme, which includes networks, data, various institutions and non-governmental organisations, needs efficient coordination and control."
"Obviously, there is a need for a coordinating organisation, which is why, at first reading, Parliament recommended a mechanism called the Health Coordination and Monitoring Centre which would, of course, operate under the Commission and the programme."
"We have now confirmed this approach in the Committee on the Environment, which voted for a second reading."
"Of course, the Council, in its common position, and the Commission, in its amended proposal, espoused and adopted the main elements of Parliament's position on developing what they refer to as an efficient system and mechanism for coordinating and monitoring the programme."
"However, the configuration which they have opted for, in the form of structural arrangements including strengthened central resources, is not ideal and will, at the very least, give rise to confusion and ambiguity, which is why we shall clearly insist on a coordinating centre in a bid to achieve efficient, overall and continuous coordination of the programme."
"Finally, the budget."
"The programme must be adequately funded."
"Parliament is asking for EUR three hundred and eighty million, given that the programme contains extremely ambitious projects and schemes."
"Consequently, the budget needs to be increased if we are to fully satisfy the needs and objectives of the programme and meet the demands involved in applying the Council's proposals for preparing, adopting and operating suitable structural arrangements including strengthened central resources, as set out by the Council in the second paragraph of Article 7.1."
"It is also vital for us to have the flexibility to redistribute resources."
"Finally, strengthening the foundations of our European Structure depends on convergence, not just at the level of economic strategy and policies, such as the single market and EMU, but in individual sectors, such as the health sector."
"These are new forms of integration, which I call new convergences, which broaden and deepen the unifying processes."
"My view, therefore, is that the new programme marks the start of just such a convergence process in the vitally important health sector."
"Madam President, Commissioner, this is the second reading of the public health programme and it is important that the European Parliament re-address a number of issues which it considers to be of fundamental importance."
"To start with, we feel that the European Commission really must make suitable structural arrangements, within a year of the date on which the programme starts, for a mechanism which guarantees permanent monitoring and coordination, boosts efficiency and supplies the Member States with information on best practices and an overall evaluation of the programme."
"This will provide an opportunity to readjust national policies along the right lines."
"Following recent events and their impact on health, we need to extend action in order to deal with unforeseen threats and new circumstances."
"As far as the budget is concerned, I shall not mince my words because, if we really want to respond to the needs and objectives of the programme in question, we need to provide the resources required in order to implement it."
"Given that current programmes have been extended as a result of the delay in approving this programme, at the expense of the present budget, the sum of EUR 280 million proposed by the Council is already too little and is incompatible with the successful application of the programme."
"I know the budget has limited room for manoeuvre, but I think that, on such serious issues, which directly affect our citizens, the Union needs to make its priorities clear and find suitable solutions."
"So I ask the Council to reconsider its position, accept the relevant amendments approved by the parliamentary committee and allow for a budget of EUR 380 million."
"Finally, I think it is important that the exact objective of the programme under discussion be made clear."
"Amendment No 23, which is referred to in Article 2, reinstates questions such as a holistic approach to health, highlighting mental health and well-being, and the importance of preventing and combating morbidity or premature mortality and reducing inequalities in health matters."
"I should like to finish by congratulating the rapporteur on his effort to reconcile opposing views and ensure that the procedure for approving the programme will be completed shortly."
"Madam President, I should like, in my turn, and this time on behalf of the Liberal Group, to thank Professor Trakatellis for his excellent report and for his particularly productive and effective collaboration with the notional rapporteurs, and in this case, believe me, that is not just a formality."
"He has succeeded in extracting from the 57 amendments our essential concerns, as expressed by our vote on the occasion of the first reading."
"Above all, I should just like to say that I am glad that he has abandoned the idea of creating a European centre for the coordination and monitoring of public health."
"On this point, I would just like to remind the House that the Liberal Group supports Amendment Nos 34 and 57 which, more prudently, are evidently intended to strengthen that coordination and also Community integration at the level of the various existing public health networks, under the auspices of the Commission."
"At a more fundamental level, of course, there are still points on which we disagree with the Council: first of all its refusal to include in the enacting terms any mention of a specific disease, any explicit reference to patients' rights, or the methods of action for preventing diseases."
"Amendment Nos 16, 22 and 47 are essential."
"They emphasise the importance of a policy of prevention and epidemiological monitoring."
"Finally, thanks to Amendment Nos 3, 26 and 42, the rights of young and adult patients are finally laid down in a Community programme."
"The second point on which we disagree is the budget, on which Parliament has already made numerous efforts to reach a compromise with the Council."
"The EUR 380 million which we had adopted at the time of the first reading in plenary session, on 4 April, is in our view the minimum minimorum."
"Moreover, as far as the budgetary aspect is concerned the Council' s position is to my mind somewhat paradoxical."
"It has drastically reduced the budget to EUR 280 million, and at the same time it intends to open up this programme to the candidate and associated countries."
"There is a problem here."
"Should it be necessary to remind the House, as our rapporteur has done, that health is one of the most important concerns of the citizens of Europe?"
"Food safety issues, changed attitudes in the face of the AIDS scourge, for example, or the threat of biological terrorism, remind us that the human race is not immune from outbreaks of new viruses or the reappearance of former pandemics."
"This fully justifies an appropriate budget for the next six years."
"The citizens - and I am just about to finish, Madam President - the citizens, the Members that represent them, and the Commission, all insist on that budget, in order to ensure that health is not sacrificed on the altar of budgetary dogmatism."
"We want a strong health programme as early as January 2002."
"It is in Europe' s interest."
"This is why we do not understand the attitude of the Council which, by not wanting to fill in the details of this programme, is in fact leaving the Commission with all the powers, while Members of the European Parliament will be deprived of any right of review for the next six years."
"The European Parliament must be consulted about the annual priorities, and I hope that our fellow Members will support us on this point."
"Far from being innovative, this programme restricts itself mainly to the setting up of an epidemiological monitoring network."
"As far as we are concerned, this is not the main priority; we already have comparable data from other countries."
"The Community added value should appear upstream, in the form of a reduction in the health risks emanating, for the most part, from our environment in the broadest sense of the word: transport, pollution, chemicals, food etc., but also from our behaviour and from social, economic and environmental inequalities."
"We recommend prevention throughout the world, but we have to start by applying it ourselves in our health programme."
"This programme should also give greater consideration to the risks arising from transmissible diseases, including in the candidate countries."
"AIDS remains a scourge in Europe, and tuberculosis is resurfacing everywhere."
"We also need to think about the therapeutic technologies that we wish to give priority to."
"The 'all-drug' approach has revealed its limitations with the increasing levels of resistance to antibiotics and vaccines."
"It is time to take other methods and replacement treatments into consideration, but this should also be done on the basis of relevant evaluations."
"Finally, we cannot give in on this matter of the budget."
"Even EUR 380 million over a period of six years is not enough."
"By sticking at EUR 280 million, the Council would be demonstrating a desire to restrict the actions of the European Union on public health issues, which is something that we cannot comprehend."
"That is why we support Mr Trakatellis' report, which is the result of numerous exchanges between us and which enables us to demonstrate to the Council that the European Parliament' s opinions on health matters must be taken into consideration."
"They are reasonable and they are essential to the health of all Europeans."
"To develop and harmonise public health at the highest level ought to be one of the tasks of the European Union if its raison d' être is not merely to concern itself chiefly with the movement of capital and goods."
"The recommendation contains some good intentions, but nothing about how they are to be put into practice."
"Yet even in the most highly developed countries of the European Union, in any case in France, public health is short of resources, personnel, premises and equipment."
"The idea of profitability is becoming more generalised."
"Local hospitals and maternity hospitals are being closed down."
"Because of staff shortages, nurses, carers and junior doctors have horrendous timetables."
"Healthcare, and health itself, are commodities which a part of the population is finding it increasingly difficult to afford."
"A proper public health policy implies disease prevention."
"Yet how can we prevent disease in a society wracked by unemployment and poverty, in which we are witnessing the reappearance of diseases that we thought had been eradicated, like tuberculosis?"
"A civilised society which has the resources of the European Union at its disposal ought to provide everyone with free, high-quality healthcare."
"Its inability to do so is one example of its failure."
"Thank you, Madam President, whenever there is a European Parliament debate on public health, people still assert for form' s sake that the subsidiarity principle must still be observed."
"However, this appears to be a hollow phrase."
"I have noticed that the EU' s public health programme is being extended and embellished by all manner of things related to public health."
"Certainly in the field of education and the provision of information, I do not expect Europe to outstrip the individual Member States."
"Moreover, the distance between Europe and the citizen is far too great."
"I do, however, support the promotion of health in the candidate countries where even basic health care is below standard."
"In those countries, the European Union can offer help to combat various illnesses effectively."
"A great deal can be achieved with relatively limited financial resources."
"However, the developments in the public health sector in the European Union are going one step too far, in my opinion."
"According to the Treaty of Amsterdam, public health is national policy and should stay that way."
"I am therefore opposed to public health programmes which are used as a means to undermine national policy while the present programmes hardly offer any added value compared to Member State efforts."
"Finally, rather than spending more money on public health programmes, it would be better to phase out subsidies on tobacco growing completely."
"This would greatly benefit public health in the European Union."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing the European Community's programme of action in the field of public health for 2001-2006."
"As we will, I think, probably end up going into the conciliation procedure, the programme will probably not become effective before early 2002 and its term will be delayed accordingly."
"The European Commission had allocated EUR 300 million for all the European Union's health projects over five years."
"I feel provoked by the way the Council of Ministers has again cut this amount and is willing to authorise only EUR 280 million."
"This programme set itself the extensive goals of continuing the eight existing action programmes, and there are additional tasks, considered to be urgent, especially in the area of information and, as Mr Trakatellis has already mentioned, in that of the challenges posed by international terrorism, whose scale we can as yet scarcely grasp. That being so, I cannot do other than give my full, whole-hearted support to Parliament's demand for EUR 380 million; indeed, I consider that the very least that the European Community must make available."
"We must not be amenable to compromise on this, and the Council must not be left under any misapprehension about this."
"The common position on the other areas, however, is in my view a great improvement on what the Commission originally submitted and on the documents produced by the first reading in Parliament."
"The great majority of the amendments that have now been resubmitted, and to which the Environment Committee has agreed, I do not see as an improvement in absolutely every respect."
"Despite the difficulties I have with them, I would like to express my thanks to Mr Trakatellis for the work he has done and, in particular, for his efforts at achieving a broad consensus in Parliament."
"I must say, though, that further and continuing education is certainly a good start across national boundaries, but I have great difficulty with training in healthcare, medicine, and so on, becoming a matter for the European Community."
"I see it as a matter for the Member States."
"Some Members have expressed doubt about everything having to be done at a European level."
"Coming as I do from a large Member State, I have seen only that the centralised allocation of tasks does not necessarily represent an improvement, but that individuals must really be helped where they actually are, and that, I believe, is done better by the Member States."
"Madam President, the adoption of Community action in the field of public health is greatly welcome."
"The new public health strategy will determine the EU's focus on health for the next five years."
"That is why having clear priorities is so important: firstly, improving information and knowledge concerning health issues; secondly, strengthening rapid reaction to health threats; and, finally, tackling health determinants."
"However, as many of my colleagues have mentioned, the budget remains an issue."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy would like EUR 300 million."
"This is an EUR 80 million increase which would correspond to the amount already in the existing programmes."
"As many have mentioned, this is EUR 100 million more than the Council asked for in the common position."
"This is necessary in order for the programme to work effectively, and it is more than fair."
"I would like to take this opportunity, in light of 11 September, to ask the Commissioner if any new action to combat bioterrorism will be funded by a new budgetary proposal and not from the framework programme?"
"Finally, I would like to emphasise the importance of working with NGOs."
"I am alarmed that the Conservatives in this House have called for a split vote on the issue of NGO networks."
"I fear that this will undermine the partnership which has been built up under the previous programme where the Community relied on NGO networks to deliver messages such as the ""Europe Against Cancer Week""."
"The new health programme is about protecting the health of all EU citizens, not just the privileged few."
"This will not be achieved without working with the EU citizens who are most interested and knowledgeable about public health."
"Health is what matters to the majority of EU citizens."
"We should make sure that this programme matters."
"Madam President, we are in the process of providing ourselves with an excellent public health programme by 2006, and I want especially to thank Mr Trakatellis for that."
"I want to mention a few points I think need to be part of this programme."
"The first is what is absolutely the most important objective of a health programme, namely to ensure that diseases do not occur at all."
"Preventative measures cannot be emphasised enough, and consideration must be given to these in all policies and all activities."
"That applies above all to environmental pollution which, as we know, damages public health when, for example, food is contaminated or poisonous chemicals that are dangerous to health are used in consumer products."
"I therefore really want to urge everyone to vote in favour of Amendment Nos 24, 40, 49 and 54."
"My second point relates to complementary medicine."
"It is important for this to be recognised in the action programme and for research, evaluation and the provision of information to be encouraged in the area of complementary methods of treatment."
"That is what Amendment Nos 25 and 44 are about."
"Thirdly, I want to draw your attention to Amendment No 60, tabled by my own political group."
"This says that we need to develop strategies for reducing resistance to antibiotics."
"This is a major public health issue and a major public health problem, as the World Health Organisation has also pointed out by way of a warning."
"My fourth and last point concerns the importance of the efforts in support of the activities of the not-for-profit and non-governmental organisations that operate in the public health field."
"They do sterling work in the field and need all the support they can get."
"Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work."
"At a time when there are many questions with regard to what Europe is doing and what it is about, the one area where we can claim to have success and where we have responded to the concerns of European citizens is in the area of public health."
"We have been to the fore with in bringing forward innovative programmes tackling common diseases such as cancer, biological hazards, risks to food and food safety, and also the ongoing problems of BSE and foot-and-mouth disease."
"The one certainty, the one foundation stone that European citizens could depend on was the European Union."
"This has been particularly the case because of the role of our present Commissioner, David Byrne with his proactive attitude to dealing with problems head on, refusing to hide behind any of the cloaks or daggers generally used to get through any difficult political situation."
"Instead, he delivers clear and factual information quickly to the people."
"What we are asking for in Parliament here, in the second reading of the Trakatellis, report is a continuation of that relationship with the European citizen, a continuation of the confidence that the European citizens have in us to deliver for them in real terms."
"I, like my colleagues, do not think that the European Union should be involved in setting out treatment programmes or setting out the delivery of medical services to individual citizens - that is obviously best dealt with at national or local level."
"However, there is much that we can learn from each other."
"There are practices with regard to medical devices and new technologies which are in use in one Member State and are not even discussed in another."
"The Commission and Europe can act as the honest broker in bringing together these sides to ensure that we deliver the best possible remedies for people within the European Union."
"I have one area of concern in particular - and there is nothing in the report to help resolve the problem - and that is having a clear account of the illness and diseases suffered right across the European Union."
"For instance, in areas such as autism, polio, cancer - breaking down the individual cancers is probably easier to collate than anything else - cystic fibrosis and other generic and genetic diseases, we have seen continuing problems for people trying to give services to sufferers."
"If the Commissioner could come forward with an idea of being the collator of information, at least we could then say that there is 10% or 12% or 50%, instead of using guess-work or guess-figures as regards the extent of disease, illness or disability prevalent in our Union."
"Along with my colleagues, I will support the measures looking for increased funding to be made available."
"We must live in the real world."
"The work we are asking for costs money, whether in terms of personnel or resources, and we should be fully supportive of that."
"I am very grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Trakatellis, the Members of Parliament and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for their work on this important and ambitious programme."
"This programme is important because protecting and improving public health is at the very centre of our citizens' concerns and their expectations."
"The recent terrorist attacks have underlined the need to strengthen and extend the existing Community preparedness and response mechanisms."
"Many of the amendments tabled are in line with our broad view of public health and how we should address it at Community level."
"We can accept 38 of the 60 amendments - 28 in full and a further 10 in part."
"I should like to concentrate on a few key areas where some clarification of the Commission's position may be of help."
"First, the implementation of the programme."
"The success of the programme will depend on the availability of resources and expertise."
"The Commission will do everything it can to ensure the necessary, effective coordination by establishing the appropriate structural arrangements."
"Putting these in place requires, in our view, a step-by-step approach."
"Firstly, the Commission services are engaged in the process of restructuring in order better to reflect the main areas of the programme."
"Secondly, in order to strengthen the Commission's capacity to coordinate actions, we intend to outsource some administrative and technical assistance."
"For the longer term, we are looking at the possibilities to set up an executive agency."
"However, this will have to await the adoption of the Commission's proposal for a regulation on such agencies which I hope will be adopted in the fairly near future."
"In the light of this, I can accept Amendment No 8 which calls for the appropriate structural arrangements to ensure the effectiveness and cohesion of measures and actions in the programme and to promote cooperation between the Member States."
"However, I am unable to accept Amendments Nos 6, 34 and 57 which impose a deadline on the Commission to carry out this work, and propose the creation of a coordination centre."
"This constrains the exercise of the Commission's executive powers under the Treaty."
"Having said that, I hope that Parliament will accept the Commission's firm commitment to proceed as rapidly as we can on the establishment of the structural arrangements to ensure effective coordination and monitoring."
"The second area on which I would like to focus is the programme's budget."
"The Commission's proposal was for a total budget of EUR 300 million over a period of six years."
"Amendment No 36 increases this amount to EUR 380 million."
"The Council's common position proposes a budget of EUR 280 million."
"The decision on this matter is for the Council and the European Parliament, as the budgetary authority."
"I would simply say that the Commission is keeping to its original proposal which, in our view, provides a reasonable figure for the implementation of the programme."
"I cannot, therefore, accept Amendment No 36."
"This amendment and the last part of Amendment No 56 also set limits on how we spend the programme budget."
"Such restrictions undermine the essential principle that the programme must be flexible and able to respond to new concerns and threats to health, as they arise."
"Recent events have clearly demonstrated the need to retain such flexibility."
"Therefore we cannot accept these amendments."
"Before I leave the issue of the budget, there is one point I want to make."
"The Council and Parliament stressed the need to put in place new structural arrangements to ensure effective coordination."
"This was not included in the composition of the original proposal in the budget."
"In view of this, when we put forward our opinion on the amendments adopted, we intend also to present a revised financial sheet for that programme."
"This would incorporate an increase in the budget line for expenditure on resources, for technical assistance and support which will be required for the structural arrangements."
"I wish to turn now to the amendments concerning the scope and structure of the programme."
"Amendments Nos 7, 13, 25, 30, 44, 46, 50, 52 and part of Amendment No 58 touch on a variety of subjects, such as giving support to regional and national centres of excellence in various fields."
"Complementary therapeutic methods - developing guidelines for medicine and healthcare interventions as well as actions to improve diet and eating habits."
"These amendments cannot be accepted since they cover areas under the responsibility of Member States."
"Moreover, there are a number of amendments that require specific comments."
"Amendments Nos 41 and 59 seek to impose an obligation for the Commission to report annually to Parliament on the implementation of the programme."
"Parliament will be informed on a regular basis of the development of the programme through both the comitology rules and the evaluation process foreseen in Article 12 of the common position."
"Therefore, we cannot accept these amendments."
"Amendment No 42 cannot be accepted since it limits the scope of the health information system by linking it explicitly to the right of patients to receive certain information on their illnesses and treatment."
"I stress, however, that I favour the concept of the promotion of patient rights and I am following the policy on this, which is included in the health forum and - you will note - is specifically referred to in the legislation at recital 3."
"Finally, there is a group of seven amendments that we cannot accept because they take away the flexibility necessary for the implementation of the programme or because they duplicate provisions of the common position."
"These are Amendments Nos 9, 10, 23, 27, 28, 35 and 43."
"On the other hand, there are a number of amendments proposing important new actions that will reinforce the broad objectives and aims of the programme."
"To name just a few, Amendment No 48 and part of No 26 that cover activities to counter health threats, including terrorists acts. Amendment No 47 which covers the development of a vaccination and immunisation strategy."
"As these amendments, as well as Amendments Nos 3, 11, 29, 31, 45 and 60 will serve to strengthen the programme and improve its effectiveness, they are all acceptable to the Commission."
"I should add that applicant countries can join in and that is provided for."
"Furthermore, I also want to mention the reference made to the extent to which it is necessary to acquire information on diseases and disabilities, as Mr Prodi mentioned."
"I can, of course, confirm that this particular programme can deal with these issues, particularly under the first strand of the programme dealing with information and data collection."
"Let me, in conclusion, Madam President, repeat my appreciation for all the constructive work that the rapporteur and the committee have put in on shaping the future of public health policy in the EU."
"For those points where difficulties remain, the Commission is, of course, ready and willing to assist in finding solutions."
"Thank you, Commissioner Byrne, the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"The debate is closed."
"Undesirable substances in animal feed"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position on undesirable substances in animal nutrition (A5-0408/2001)"
"I now give the floor to Mrs Paulsen, the rapporteur."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report has progressed very well."
"The Commission and the Council adopted most of what Parliament requested at first reading."
"Now, the user stage of the directive' s application is, for example, being included, and we have obtained a generic term so that we know what we are talking about."
"All products intended as animal nutrition are now defined by a common term in all animal feed legislation."
"It is very good that the important rules on, for example, the ban on dilution are now being implemented."
"This means that a batch containing unduly high levels of, for example, dioxin may not be taken and diluted with something else so that it comes within the limits."
"Personally, I think it is excellent that we have incorporated what are called action thresholds into the directive. That, ladies and gentlemen, is in practice the precautionary principle."
"It means that if, for example, a dairy discovers that the level of mycotoxin, a mould poison, is increasing in its milk, an investigation can be launched, in spite of the fact that the limit above which the substance becomes hazardous has not yet been exceeded."
"An investigation can then be begun into why the level of mycotoxin is increasing in the milk, and preventative measures can be adopted further back in the chain before the limit has been reached beyond which there is a danger of poisoning."
"The Council has accepted everything, except in relation to an issue which we in the committee have now been forced to re-address, namely that of whether or not unsuitable batches of feed should be returned to, for example, the Third World."
"The committee and I believe it is profoundly immoral simply to pass on in that way products which do not fulfil the requirements of the directive."
"We do not know in such cases where the products will end up, whether they will be used in the poorest areas or whether they will simply return to our own market in another guise."
"The committee therefore chose to table amendments which remove this option of re-export."
"We also chose to retain a transitional period of six months following the directive' s entry into force."
"Subsequently, the Commission and the Council came and offered negotiations under the Belgian Presidency."
"We tried to reach a compromise and, in fact, did so."
"I would thank both the Belgian Presidency and the Commission for the excellent and constructive way in which they have cooperated with me and my co-rapporteurs on this issue."
"We agreed on a compromise solution according to which re-export was to be regulated in the same way as in the general food law which we have today voted through Parliament with a very large majority."
"This solution is a technical way of plugging a time gap so that, when the general law comes into force, the provisions of this law will apply to re-export in accordance with this directive."
"It is not, then, a new proposal but is concerned with bridging a particular period of time."
"The compromise amendment we tabled has exactly the same wording as in the Whitehead report."
"This evening, when everything was ready, we learned however that the Council did not want to accept this compromise."
"I realise with deep regret that we have to withdraw our compromise proposal and are thus forced into a conciliation."
"I want to say to the Council of Ministers that this is purely and simply a misuse of the conciliation institute."
"This is not such a complex and serious dispute that we should need to go so far, but my co-rapporteurs and I find the situation such that Parliament is compelled to draw attention to it."
"When five political groups sign a compromise, then we are serious about it."
"Madam President, Commissioner, there are, under the circumstances, a lot of reports on animal feedingstuffs and animal nutrition before Parliament at the present time."
"Yesterday, we discussed the circulation of compound feedingstuffs; today, at a second reading, we are back with undesirable substances in animal nutrition."
"Mrs Paulsen has confirmed that, in its common position of 17 September 2001, the Council shared Parliament's view that, in order to ensure a comprehensive level of protection, no mixing or dilution should be permitted and that, in addition, the Member States should be empowered to lay down action thresholds."
"I think that the practicality of these proposals will be shown when the time comes to implement them, and if there are problems then we must be ready to make more changes."
"We know that everything that is prescribed must be capable of being monitored, which does not mean that only the possibility of monitoring must exist, but that monitoring is actually carried out."
"What we are actually hoping for is that we can complete this document today."
"Our misgivings about the issues raised by Article 13(2) have been put forward, and we continue to hope that there will be a compromise, even if Mrs Paulsen has now cast doubt on it."
"The groups have come to an agreement among themselves."
"What is at issue is the re-exportation of products intended for animal nutrition produced outside the Community and not complying with this directive's requirements."
"It is not enough to simply say, 'I do not want that, so I shall send it back' ."
"We ask ourselves questions and we face responsibilities. What happens to feedingstuffs like that?"
"Do they get destroyed, are they diluted, or do they reach us or other countries by other routes?"
"'You shall not to others do/what they should not do to you' , we say in Germany, so we are actually in favour of requiring the destruction of produce bought as feedingstuff but not permissible as such under this directive, and of it being done on the spot."
"The objection now raised to that is that it means the European Union being misused as a disposal plant."
"I think we would have no problems with that if we could resolve the question of how the costs would be met."
"So it is not enough to simply send the stuff back, and does not do justice to our responsibility as politicians."
"We continue to hope that the compromise that is taking shape, which we have brought in in Amendment No 4, will be supported by a majority in this House, and that we will be able to persuade the Council as well."
"It will make it possible to put abuses of the system on the record and to document them."
"The authorities in the exporting third country must give their express consent to the re-exportation."
"I would, though, see the next logical step as being for the exporting third country to also produce evidence of what has subsequently been done with the items taken back."
"Madam President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Paulsen, and the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for their recommendation for second reading on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on desirable substances in animal feed."
"The measures in the Council common position are a key element of the comprehensive strategy to improve the safety of feed."
"Prohibition of dilution will reduce the overall contamination load of animal feed."
"Operators across the production chain will also be obliged to put in place passive systems and good manufacturing practices to ensure that the feed materials and the feedstuffs they produce are safe."
"The setting of action levels will act as an early warning system, triggering a proactive approach to identify sources and pathways of contamination and to take measures to eliminate them."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3 as adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"Regarding Amendment No 1, the Commission considers that the possibility of returning non-compliant products intended for animal feed to the country of origin has to be maintained."
"The Commission shares, however, Parliament's concerns in this regard and agrees, therefore, that this return can only happen under strict conditions."
"Regarding Amendments Nos 2 and 3 on the date of application, the Commission cannot accept the time period of six months."
"Instead, sufficient time is needed to transpose these far-reaching measures into national legislation."
"Serious efforts have to be made by the operators to apply the measures in practice."
"The Commission is therefore pleased that compromise Amendments Nos 4, 5 and 6 have been tabled for this plenary session to replace Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3."
"I should confirm that the compromise amendments are - should you decide to keep them on the table - acceptable to the Commission."
"These compromise amendments address the Commission's reasons for non-acceptance of the first three amendments."
"Therefore the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 4, 5 and 6."
"The Commission will also try to persuade the Council to do likewise."
"I wish also to inform you that a revision of the maximum levels of the undesirable substances in Annex I is foreseen. The Commission has already requested the Scientific Committee for Animal Nutrition to provide updated scientific risk assessments."
"These assessments are the key scientific input to the revision of the Annex."
"The Commission hopes to finalise this review as soon as possible."
"It should be available before this directive becomes applicable."
"To conclude, I once again thank Mrs Paulsen for the excellent work she has done on this file."
"Emissions from two and three-wheel motor vehicles"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council' s common position on the reduction of the level of pollutant emissions from two and three-wheel motor vehicles (A5-0406/2001)"
"I now give the floor to Mr Lange, the rapporteur."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although we, sitting here together, are all good colleagues and agreeable people, one does wonder about the point of the five of us sitting here this evening to discuss this report, which is as much about lawmaking as it is about industrial policy and protection of the environment."
"It seems, though, to be part of the higher purpose of this Parliament that we should have to do this here, and at this time of the day, all the same."
"Since first reading stage, our aim has been to make motorcycles just as clean as passenger cars have become thanks to our legislation."
"I believe we can take pride in the reduction of emissions from passenger cars, lorries and buses, because we have in fact, despite greatly increased traffic, been able to achieve a marked reduction in exhaust emissions."
"One piece has not quite been fitted into the jigsaw, and that is motorcycles."
"Here, too, there is a two-stage strategy for reducing the emissions of new vehicles by 2003 and 2006 to such an extent that, in 2006, a newly licensed motorcycle will in fact be just as clean as a car complying with EURO III standards."
"That being so, we now have to boldly take the last step and make the 2006 stage binding as well, firstly, in order to make the objective mandatory."
"Secondly, though, in order also to make it safe for industry to plan ahead, as of course new emission technology and new engines are being developed, and 2006 is no longer quite so far ahead."
"In that sense, I can also understand that it is in industry's interest to ask for a safe space in which to plan ahead."
"We must make the 2006 stage mandatory."
"I do not believe there is much sense in waiting still longer for a new test procedure, perhaps one that will have been agreed on with the other world markets, Japan and the USA, and will be thoroughly suitable."
"Looking at the horizon, though, I do not see that being feasible in the foreseeable future, and so I suggest that we go back to the test procedure we applied to cars and that has proved itself over time, thereby demonstrating a more realistic way of going about things than has previously been the case with motorcycles."
"I believe, too, that the test procedure we now want to make applicable will tend not to produce results significantly differing from those produced by the new worldwide test procedure that is currently under discussion."
"We can therefore rely on the test procedure for passenger cars."
"What is more important is to decide whether or not to still discuss the procedure gradually."
"It is also more important to stipulate that motorcycles should not achieve quite different emission values outside the test cycle, in other words that motorcycles are tuned only to the test cycle, and that electronic manipulation does not take place."
"This is therefore both proper and vital, and, on this point, the Council has agreed with us that such electronic distorting apparatus should be unambiguously prohibited."
"Secondly, we want, in addition to the 2006 fixed stage, tax incentives for the early placing on the market of low-emission vehicles and for the retrofitting of older vehicles where that is technically possible and without discrimination against their owners."
"Another important point applies as much here as to other types of vehicles, such as passenger cars, lorries and buses, namely that it is not enough for vehicles to achieve great emission values only on a test bed; they must be able to keep to them throughout their working lives."
"For two-wheelers, too, demands must be made on their durability."
"When we vote tomorrow on the package we have presented to you, I believe we will be on the right road, adding this sector's chapter to the success story that is the reduction of emissions from European traffic."
"Thank you, Madam President."
"I would also like to thank Mr Lange for his excellent report."
"Traditional air pollution will in a few years' time be a thing of the past, thanks to the majority of the European Parliament."
"With regard to new cars, the second generation of catalytic converters will be compulsory in 2005."
"A lengthy and difficult conciliation procedure was required in order to achieve this outcome."
"Catalytic converters in lorries will be compulsory in 2008."
"This was not so difficult to achieve. The Council adopted the EP' s position at first reading."
"Today, we are discussing new motorcycles."
"One could sum this up by saying that catalytic converters will be compulsory in 2006."
"This is a fair position."
"BMW have had a motorcycle equipped with a catalytic converter on the market for a long time."
"It is unfortunate that the environmental ministers should refuse to take this reasoning on board. Conciliation will now be inevitable."
"However, because of the EP' s unanimity, the Council is bound to lose out."
"The significance of no more ozone smog and far less acidification outweighs the short-term interest of a few manufacturers."
"Madam President, I first wish to thank the European Parliament, and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Lange, for his speedy preparation of the report on the second reading of this matter."
"In general I might say that Mr Lange' s deep commitment to the issues in this area has been held in high regard in the Commission."
"I am happy that the rapporteur agrees with the limit values for emissions and their application dates, which are scheduled as from 2003."
"The rapporteur is once again proposing, however, an amendment that appeared in the first reading, which has to do with a second stage of mandatory limit values that would apply from 2006."
"This stage would be based on limit values and test cycles that currently apply to passenger cars."
"As you know, right from the start the Commission has supported stricter limits for emissions as from 2006, in compliance with the following principles: that we should employ a worldwide harmonised test cycle for motorcycles that reflects the actual way motorcycles are driven on the highway, with the corresponding limit values; that we should employ a reliable sequence of emissions measurements in a new test cycle for motorcycles, so that new limit values may be specified in a way that is scientifically sound and in accordance with improved emission control technology."
"A UN/ECE working party entrusted with the task has completed technical development work on a test cycle for motorcycles."
"In the last few months, a large-scale emissions measurements programme has been undertaken."
"I could also mention that test results on fifty motorcycles are now available."
"Next week the results will be evaluated by the working party."
"We do not have to wait until worldwide consensus is reached regarding harmonised testing procedures."
"The technical work carried out under this programme makes it possible to determine a solution for motorcycles that can perhaps be applied first in EU legislation."
"The rapporteur' s proposed approach is an option that nevertheless needs further improvements for it to be effective with regard to protection of the environment."
"This is an important issue and the Commission cannot support any of the amendments that call for the introduction of a mandatory second stage."
"However, the Commission is prepared to participate with the other institutions in shaping an agreement that would be ambitious in terms of technology and that would benefit the environment."
"The common position now contains a package of measures for improved in-use emission control, but there is still a number of amendments in the report which define time limits and the details of the regulations more precisely."
"The Commission supports Amendment No 6, which has to do with preventing the test cycle from being by-passed, and the first parts of Amendments Nos 5 and 14, which are connected with the conformity testing of in-service motorcycles."
"The Commission also accepts Amendments Nos 3 and 12, which would permit the retrofitting of older motorcycles."
"The Commission cannot accept the demands in Amendments Nos 5, 13 and 20 regarding durability."
"Such regulations could lead to ever-changing regulations in the period 2003 - 2006."
"The Commission supports the proposal that the measuring of carbon dioxide emissions and fuel consumption should be included in the type approval system as an essential requirement for a future reduction in carbon dioxide emissions and improved fuel economy."
"Measures connected with this can, however, only be taken after a thorough evaluation has been undertaken."
"For that reason, the Commission accepts Amendment No 7, but rejects Amendments Nos 15 and 19."
"Amendments Nos 8 and 9 are connected with the introduction of stage 2 limit values for mopeds."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 8, as it would delay the application of stage 2 to new type approvals to a time past that agreed in the existing Directive (97/24/EC)."
"However, the Commission accepts Amendment No 9, which provides for a clearly defined period of validity for stage 1 approvals, which in the directive is open."
"The Commission therefore accepts Amendments Nos 3, 6, 7, 9, 12, 17 and 22."
"In addition, the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 1 and 18 in principle and Amendments Nos 5, 14 and 23 in part."
"The Commission does not agree with Amendments Nos 2, 4, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 19 - 21, and 24 - 27."
"Thank you, Commissioner Liikaanen."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"The sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m."
"Address by Mr Kim Dae Jung, President of the Republic of Korea"
"We now welcome to the European Parliament President Kim Dae Jung, a tireless defender of universal values such as peace, democracy and human rights."
"Mr President, we have great respect for you and for your country, whose economic progress and, more recently, political progress over the last ten years have made a great impression upon us. We are pleased to welcome you here today."
"You were elected President of the Republic of Korea at the end of 1997, and came to office in February 1998. These are the crowning achievements of your remarkable career as a fighter for democratic change."
"Since the beginning of the 1960s, you have fought for free elections, founded parties and pressure groups and, on several occasions, stood as a candidate at elections, in order to defend the basic values which inspired you throughout your life."
"On a personal level, you have suffered enormously from the initiatives you have taken."
"When living in exile at the beginning of the 1970s, you were abducted on successive occasions in Tokyo by the secret services, arrested on numerous occasions, subsequently imprisoned for having criticised an unfair Constitution."
"At the beginning of the 1980s, you were accused of treason and condemned to death."
"This sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment."
"You lived in exile for a second time but, at the end of the 1980s, you were able to return to your country and worked to restore democracy to it."
"After having been elected President of the Republic of Korea, you continued to defend the values that underpinned your life and that we share."
"We all salute, in particular, the work that you have done to improve relations with North Korea."
"The list of international awards that you have received in recognition of your efforts is far too extensive to read out here."
"However, allow me to tell you how pleased we all were when you were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000."
"Your past is a lesson in determination and perseverance, given the terrible difficulties that you have experienced and overcome."
"Your past has not only been decisive for your own country. It has had a genuine impact on the region as a whole and has served as an example for the whole world."
"I am very pleased to welcome you here today, Mr Kim Dae Jung, and I now invite you to address the House."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, Commissioner Prodi, distinguished guests."
"It is with deep emotion that I stand here on this podium today."
"I have always admired the European Parliament, this great hall of democracy and the very symbol of European unity."
"This is the place where the unprecedented and monumental task of bringing the countries of Europe together was achieved."
"Here, the Members of the European Parliament are working for the realisation of democracy, economic prosperity and social justice in Europe and throughout the world."
"It is therefore my great pleasure and honour to speak from this most distinguished place."
"I am deeply grateful, moreover, to you, Madam President, for your kind and gracious words of welcome."
"When I was elected President four years ago, Korea was in a desperate situation, faced with a serious financial crisis."
"EU members responded to my appeals and supported our efforts to overcome the difficulties by sending, among other things, an investment mission to Korea."
"Thanks to such support, we were able to recover from the crisis."
"Neither the Korean people nor I will ever forget your friendly help."
"I thank you all."
"The 21st century is witnessing what will probably be known as the greatest revolution in human history."
"This great revolution is - to put it simply - about knowledge and information and about globalisation."
"In the 20th century, tangible elements, such as land, capital and labour, were the sources of economic development."
"In the 21st century, however, intangible elements such as knowledge and information, creativity and a spirit of adventure are becoming key to increasing competitiveness."
"Two hundred years after the industrial revolution, a new paradigm is needed, different from that of the age of industrialisation."
"Now, the age of knowledge-based economies is opening up."
"It is now possible for under-developed nations and poor individuals to create wealth just by learning to use a computer."
"However, humanity is also faced with a very serious problem."
"It is the problem of what we can call the digital divide."
"More than 75% of the benefits derived from enhanced information capabilities are concentrated only in advanced nations."
"Developing nations are being overlooked."
"The gap in information capabilities between the advanced and developing nations means a widening gap between the rich and poor."
"And the faster information capabilities are enhanced, the faster the gap widens between the rich and the poor."
"On the other hand, the information revolution is inevitably linked with accelerating openness and globalisation."
"Territorial boundaries are becoming practically meaningless as enormous amounts of information are spreading throughout the world almost instantaneously."
"Meanwhile, cultural conflicts are arising."
"The worsening of poverty and advent of cultural conflicts leads to various kinds of fanaticism."
"Thus, enhanced information capabilities and globalisation could also threaten global peace in the 21st century."
"I would like to stress that this is a very serious problem."
"The digital divide is further raising the level of antagonism between the rich and poor within a single nation."
"We must stop this."
"I would like to tell you briefly about our own experience."
"To overcome such problems, Korea has been pushing a policy of productive welfare."
"Productive welfare, while guaranteeing a basic standard of living, aims to concentrate on human resource development, especially for low-income families, so that they can stand on their own two feet."
"Furthermore, productive welfare strives to improve the overall quality of life for its citizens."
"In particular, we place high priority on a thorough and systematic curriculum for educating the young as well as the disadvantaged, to enable them to acquire information capabilities."
"This effort involves a broad spectrum of people, including elementary and middle school students, millions of housewives, 600 000 members of the armed forces, the elderly, as well as the disabled and prison inmates."
"With this policy, we are trying to prevent the digital divide from becoming wider, which would create a gap in earnings."
"And we are determined to cut off the vicious circle of poverty being handed down from generation to generation, parent to child."
"Korea built the first nationwide high-speed information network in the world."
"As a result, more than half of the 46 million citizens are now active users of the Internet."
"To identify and effectively resolve the problem of the digital divide, international awareness and cooperation are vital."
"I believe that advanced nations, including the members of the EU, must use their leadership to help developing countries, by providing various kinds of support, including the construction of a viable information infrastructure."
"Korea will actively participate."
"We have, in fact, already begun cooperating with individual countries."
"Now I would like to touch on the future of Korea and the EU."
"I proposed the construction of a high-speed information network at the Asia-Europe summit meeting in Seoul last year."
"I am pleased to remind you that the leaders of all the member nations gave it their active support."
"Under this project, we are envisaging the creation of a ""Cyber Silk Road"" linking Asia and Europe."
"It is a project for the new millennium aimed at furthering the exchanges between Asia and Europe by setting in place an ""e-EurAsia""."
"In this respect, it is very fortunate that the Trans-Eurasian Information Network project is proceeding smoothly at present with the cooperation of all ASEM member nations, as well as the EU member nations."
"There is another project that would greatly promote exchanges between Europe and Asia."
"This is none other than the construction of an ""Iron Silk Road"", directly linking Korea with Europe by land."
"For this project, one thing must be done - the linking of the railway between South and North Korea."
"This railway has been severed at the Demilitarised Zone for the past 50 years."
"On the occasion of the historic inter-Korean summit last year, the two Koreas agreed to relink this railway, as well as an adjacent highway."
"If we manage to link the remaining 14 kilometres of this railway, South Korea and Europe will finally be connected."
"When the trans-Korean railway (TKR) is linked with the trans-China or the trans-Siberia railways, a train leaving London could reach Seoul and Busan via Paris, Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Siberia or China."
"Then, goods could be shipped to all parts of the Pacific region, and beyond, from Busan, which also happens to be the third largest container port in the world."
"Transportation costs would be cut by 30% and time shortened by one third."
"On the day we achieve our plans for an e-EurAsia and complete our ""Iron Silk Road"", Asia and Europe will, for all practical purposes, become one landmass."
"Geographically, Asia and Europe have always formed one landmass."
"Historically, they have been interacting for a long time."
"From the 5th and 6th centuries onwards, a large number of people and goods have travelled by land over the Silk Road and by sea through the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf."
"History shows us that the cultures of the two regions have contributed to and influenced each other considerably, as they both developed."
"In modern times, the West's democratic system of governance, the industrial revolution and cultural achievements have exerted great influence on the politics, economy and culture of Asia."
"Meanwhile, Asia, as the birthplace and cradle of three of the major civilisations, namely the Tigris-Euphrates, Indus and Yellow River civilisations, and the spiritual centre of Confucianism and Buddhism, greatly influenced the entire world, including Europe."
"We all know that gunpowder and paper originated in Asia and then travelled to Europe."
"The political system featuring a centralised government, which has been prevalent in Asia, had a tremendous impact on the way Europeans governed themselves."
"Today, Asia and Europe are pursuing the common goals of promoting democracy and market economies."
"Three-quarters of the world's population now live in these two regions."
"Economically, they produce half the world's products."
"It is very important for Asia and Europe to deepen mutual understanding and cooperate further, not only for the development and prosperity of the two regions but also for the peace and prosperity of the world."
"This is the goal and ideal of ASEM."
"I am convinced that close cooperation between Korea and the EU will help put into effect this ideal of ASEM and greatly contribute to efforts to bind Asia and Europe closer together."
"The EU is a very important and substantive economic partner for Korea."
"It is the number one foreign investor in Korea and the third largest trade partner for Korea."
"Nonetheless, the room for expansion of trade and investment between Korea and the EU is boundless."
"Korea is located in the middle of a huge market that includes the United States, Japan, China and Russia."
"Its business and investment climate has been improved greatly through continuous economic reform."
"It also possesses ample human resources and is equipped with the economic infrastructure suited to the knowledge-based economies of the 21st century."
"I hope that the EU and Korea will continue to expand their cooperative partnership in the huge East Asia market with Korea as a bridgehead for the EU, as it advances into countries like Japan and China."
"When this happens, we will no doubt score a ""win-win success""."
"As you know, the Korea-EU Framework Agreement took effect last April."
"A systematic mechanism for further strengthening practical cooperation in such areas as investment and trade is now in place."
"On the parliamentary level, the Korean-EU Parliamentarians' Council was formed and annually discusses ways to develop Korea-EU relations."
"In the process of negotiating the Doha Development Agenda, Korea and the EU cooperated closely."
"Let me assure you that Korea will continue to step up its cooperation with the EU."
"As you know, the world is currently experiencing a global economic downturn."
"We must now reduce our dependence on the United States for our exports and open other avenues, while stimulating domestic demand."
"The flexible management of our financial policy is necessary to stimulate domestic demand."
"We must also push economic and social policies to raise the purchasing power of low-income families."
"In addition, we must push for more active and large-scale trade and investment between big markets like the EU and East Asia."
"Korea is opening its doors to EU members."
"And we also want actively to advance into the EU markets."
"Thus, I hope that both Korea and the EU will be able to overcome today's economic downturn through mutual cooperation and jointly pave the way towards a new and common prosperity."
"I would now like to take this opportunity to tell you about the issues surrounding the Korean Peninsula, in which you have taken great interest and given support."
"Peace on the Korean Peninsula is an issue that concerns not only the 70 million Korean people - it is also directly linked to peace and stability in the East Asian region and the world."
"I have consistently pushed the Sunshine Policy to prevent war and settle peace on the Korean Peninsula."
"And, at last, the historic inter-Korean summit was held in June last year."
"The crux of our Sunshine Policy calls for peaceful coexistence and peaceful exchange and cooperation between the two Koreas."
"After a period of time, perhaps ten or 20 years, when the peoples of the South and North have come to trust each other and feel comfortable with each other, we hope to accomplish our ultimate goal of peaceful unification."
"Unification will come."
"The Korean people lived in a unified country for over 1 300 years from the seventh century."
"It is unimaginable that we should abandon our desire for unification just because we have been separated for the past half-century."
"As long as the Korean people ardently wish for unification, and as long as support from you and the world continues, I am firmly convinced that we will be able to unify our country in the not-too- distant future."
"The EU has been taking part in the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organisation (KEDO) and has offered a range of humanitarian and economic assistance to North Korea."
"It is also pursuing an array of diverse activities, including technological assistance and training programmes, for the North Koreans."
"Many EU members are actively supporting our efforts for peace on the Peninsula by establishing diplomatic relations with North Korea."
"In May this year, when the inter-Korean relationship experienced a temporary setback, an EU delegation, led by Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson and including EU Commissioner for External Relations, Chris Patten, visited North Korea and helped us resume our dialogue."
"The EU is an important supporter of peace on the Korean Peninsula and exchanges and cooperation between the South and North."
"You, the Members of the European Parliament are genuine friends of the Korean people."
"I earnestly hope that your unsparing support will continue until the day when peace is settled and the first ray of unification shines over the Korean Peninsula."
"Right now, the world is gripped with anxiety, and we are filled with tension over the recent terrorist attack."
"This attack on the United States in September brought enormous shock and sorrow to all."
"Terrorism does not declare itself before striking, terrorism is faceless and terrorism indiscriminately kills innocent civilians."
"It is the most cowardly and cruel act one can imagine."
"Under no circumstances should such acts be justified or condoned."
"If we are unable to root out terrorism, the international order will collapse, and individuals will lose their lives."
"Terrorism must be eradicated."
"In this connection, I would like to praise the quick actions of the European Union in response to the attacks and for cooperating with the international community's efforts."
"Korea is also participating in the international coalition to eradicate terrorism, and we will continue to do so."
"However, no religion or culture should be regarded with hostility under any circumstances."
"We must keep this in mind as we carry on our war against terrorism."
"On the contrary, we must work to strengthen dialogue and cooperation among different religions and cultures."
"We must eliminate the fundamental causes of terrorism, first of all, by eliminating the gap between the rich and poor and addressing the social inequalities that are getting wider every day."
"Achieving peace in the Middle East is one of the most important and urgent tasks in front of us."
"People around the world are craving peace and a renewed sense of security."
"Peace and security is the task of our time."
"In this respect, I attach great significance to the World Cup games that are going to be held in Korea and Japan next year."
"We would like to make next year's World Cup a great turning point for establishing global peace and guaranteeing security for all peoples once again."
"The Korean people and I will do our utmost to make the 2002 World Cup games the safest games ever."
"We will make them a festival in which all people around the world will take part for peace and unity."
"We will give humanity hope for the future."
"There are only six more months to the opening of the World Cup."
"Of the 32 competing nations, 10 are EU members."
"I hope many of you will visit Korea then to watch your teams."
"We will soon complete our preparations and wait for you."
"For those of you who will watch the games on TV, we are putting state-of-the-art facilities and measures in place so that we can vividly transmit the lively action to you in images and in real time."
"We will stage the 2002 World Cup successfully as befits one of the greatest festivals for humankind."
"I hope all of you will take great interest in and help us make this a success."
"Rudyard Kipling who received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1907 once said: ""East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet."""
"But if he were alive today, he would have said instead: ""East is West, and West is East, and never the twain shall part."""
"Mr President, I should really like to thank you most warmly for the very powerful address that you have just given before the European Parliament, and also for the very positive opinion that you have expressed with regard to this House."
"You reminded us that it is the symbol of European unity, and you also mentioned the support that the European Union has been able to give you and hopes to continue to give you."
"We have, of course, seen and heard with great interest the proposals, the very specific projects that you have in mind in order to encourage trade between Asia and Europe, and you have told us that these projects would help to strengthen our mutual understanding and cooperation."
"You know that you have our full support in these undertakings, and we hope that the framework agreement that has been concluded will be a privileged instrument of that cooperation."
"Yet you also emphasised, Mr President, the responsibility that the developed countries have to help the developing countries to adjust to the information society, so that the poorest countries will not be isolated from the future development of the world economy."
"I can assure you that this is a view to which we in this House attach particular importance, and your message has been not only heard, but also understood and accepted."
"Lastly, and this is something that we had talked about at length before your address, you spoke of your hopes for peace and stability in Korea."
"I myself had pointed out how much you had encouraged cooperation between North and South Korea, and we share that hope with you, Mr President, with all our hearts and with all our strength."
"My last point is that you appealed to us most sympathetically regarding the World Cup match."
"We realise how enthusiastic you are about preparing to organise the World Cup."
"On this subject I can also assure you that all members of this House will be following it closely, on television of course, but we have also heard your kind invitation that you extended to us."
"Each one of us knows that sport and culture are forceful vehicles for bringing about peace, for developing freedom, the rule of law and respect for other people, and all those values that you defend with a perseverance and determination that we deeply admire."
"For all this, we thank you Mr President."
"(Loud applause) (The formal sitting was closed at 12.40 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I would like it noted as a matter of urgency that the case of Dr. Ganzert, an attorney from Wels, has been dismissed."
"He is at present being held without good cause by the authorities in Nicaragua and has for three weeks been endeavouring to get permission to leave the country. I wish, though, to thank you, Madam President, for writing to the authorities in Nicaragua and asking for him to be given an exit visa."
"I will raise that matter with the President."
"(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved) President."
"I should like to inform the House that the Minister of Justice for Belgium, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Verwilghen, cannot be present at the beginning of this debate because of fog in Brussels."
"We are expecting him to arrive at some stage."
"I suggest to the House that we will have to continue the debate and our agenda therefore."
"We look forward to the Minister's arrival."
"Mr President, I would like you to take note of my strong protest at the conditions under which this debate is to be held."
"I am not referring to the absence of the Minister, although this is also a problem, but to the systematic manner in which the Conference of Presidents organises debates relating to the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, amalgamating every topic into a joint debate."
"It seems to me to show a total lack of respect that, at the same time and for the same duration as a debate of such great importance as that on annual progress in the field of Justice and Home Affairs, we should also be debating the Hazan report on the Council report on justice and home affairs: EU priorities and policy objectives for external relations and the Watson report on a recommendation to the Council on an area of Freedom, Security and Justice: security at meetings of the European Council and other comparable events, and any other matter that may be on this Committee' s agenda."
"Mr President, this is the same as if we were to debate the assignment of radio frequencies and the association agreement with Egypt at the same time because they are both the remit of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"I hope that more respect will be shown in future."
"I suggest that you raise this matter with your own group leader and that this be a subject, therefore, for the Conference of Presidents to discuss."
"Mr President, on Monday, when the sitting opened, I asked for Members to be provided with a copy of the letters exchanged between Mr Bush and Mr Prodi."
"Mrs Fontaine assured us that she would do what was necessary."
"At Monday' s extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I put the same request to the Commission representatives, who seemed surprised that Members had not seen this correspondence."
"We did in fact manage to find Mr Bush' s letter to Mr Prodi, sent a whole two months ago, on the Internet, but we still do not have a copy of the reply Mr Prodi sent at the end of November."
"Furthermore, it seemed that our Committee on Citizens' Freedoms had agreed on the need to see this letter."
"I therefore ask you whether a copy can be provided."
"I have to inform you that the President did not say that she would make the correspondence available because the correspondence is not available to us as a Parliament."
"That is the difficulty that we are in."
"So I am afraid that cannot be instituted."
"Area of freedom, security and justice"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following two oral questions:"
"Oral question to the Council (B5-0534/2001) by Alima Boumediene-Thiery, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the 2001 annual debate on the area of freedom, security and justice (Articles 2 and 39 of the EU Treaty)"
"Oral question to the Commission (B5-0535/2001) by Alima Boumediene-Thiery, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the 2001 annual debate on the area of freedom, security and justice (Articles 2 and 39 of the EU Treaty)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, the conclusions of the Tampere Summit have given new impetus to the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice."
"With a view to attaining the objectives that were set, a plan of action was drawn up, which provides for its establishment between two and five years after the Amsterdam Treaty enters into force."
"It is now time for a mid-term review of the progress made on the Tampere agenda, in the light of the Commission' s timetable."
"The area of security, freedom and justice covers three major aspects: the Community' s asylum and immigration policy, strengthening judicial cooperation and police cooperation."
"So let us look at the situation regarding each of these three aspects."
"On the question of asylum and immigration policy and, more specifically, the management of migration flows, under the measures that have been taken, immigration is regarded as a palliative for manpower shortages and as compensation for the demographic imbalances of the states involved, without taking account of the human or social dimension or the consequences of the brain drain."
"However, surely this Community migration policy calls into question the universal nature of fundamental rights?"
"Is the re-admission policy consistent with international obligations regarding the protection of refugees and the right of asylum?"
"As for the European Observatory on Migration, I have a reservation."
"Surely we have to admit that first of all we need to reflect on its purpose, its usefulness and the position of the NGOs concerned with migration in this Observatory."
"Not a single significant measure has been taken to ensure that third-country nationals are treated fairly."
"As for their political participation and the re-definition of citizenship, this question has been evaded on the pretext of protecting national sovereignty, which comes down to denying the democratic rights of citizens resident in Europe."
"How does the Commission propose to promote citizenship based on residence as a means of ensuring their rights?"
"Furthermore, what action does the Council propose to take on the directives on reuniting families, on the status of non-Europeans who are long-term residents and on freedom of movement, establishment and work on the territory of the Member States?"
"The Geneva Convention forms the basis of asylum policy."
"However, the concept of refugee must encompass both the gender aspect and the social aspect."
"Is the Council prepared to respond to the specific sufferings of women and victims of civil war?"
"Surely the Eurodac system, based on a data bank of fingerprints, presents a risk to asylum seekers?"
"Furthermore, should the Dublin Convention not be reviewed?"
"The competence of a state to examine a file and the decision-making responsibility should be decided on the basis of the asylum seeker' s choice of country of residence rather than by the country of arrival, which is so difficult to decide in a Union that has supposedly abolished borders."
"The action plans adopted for partnership with third countries are looking more and more like a means of holding back immigration."
"What is the situation regarding development aid, a corollary to restricting emigration?"
"Has cooperation been reduced to financing extradition?"
"Surely the introduction of administrative police at the points of entry from third countries is a negation of the right to seek asylum?"
"Some progress has been made at civil level, in relation to strengthening judicial cooperation."
"Several texts have been adopted on judicial powers, the notification of acts, the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions and their enforcement, especially in the matrimonial field and in relation to parental responsibility."
"A proposal for a directive on legal aid is under consideration; it aims to secure better access to justice."
"The situation is much less promising with regard to reinforcing criminal judicial cooperation: the reservations here are mainly about what constitutes a specific offence."
"In the legislative field, framework decisions have been taken on protecting the euro against forgeries, money-laundering, combating the trade in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children."
"The Council also appears to be preparing to adopt those decisions that concern the fight against terrorism and the European arrest warrant."
"The slow progress is due mainly to Member States' resistance to the principle of mutual recognition."
"The setting up of Eurojust is a real step forward for the citizens; the rights of defendants and the protection of data do, however, need better guarantees."
"Unfortunately, we find that we are still far from establishing a European public prosecutor' s office or from common legislation and judicial procedures."
"We find the most marked progress in the field of police cooperation. There are now many areas where the police have to cooperate."
"The procedures for Europol' s participation in joint investigations, for the keeping of its records and for its cooperation with third countries need to be clearly defined."
"Surely we urgently need to guarantee better data protection and finally ensure that we have democratic and judicial scrutiny?"
"As for respect for fundamental rights, I believe we need to review the list of safe countries."
"Turning to the Schengen Information System, and looking ahead to the enlargement of the Union, new questions arise concerning its tasks, its technical capacity and its institutional form."
"We must not overlook the external dimension of justice and home affairs."
"The fight against trafficking in human beings and the fight against organised crime are both areas that should be dealt with under the external relations aspect of justice and home affairs."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"We cannot start off the day running overtime."
"Otherwise, at the end of the day, our agenda would be totally out of place."
"Mr President, this is a rather strange debate today."
"Different reports have been put together into an omnibus debate."
"My report deals with the question of security at summits of the European Union and similar international gatherings and it looks also at the question of citizens' rights."
"It is important that when Parliament looks at problems that affect the Union, it must do so without victimising individual countries."
"Just as my recent report on terrorism sought to be a generic report and not one that referred exclusively to the situation in the Basque country in Spain, so this report sets out also to be a generic report and not one that seeks to be particularly critical of any one country."
"We have seen violent protests at summits in EU countries - in Nice, Gothenburg and Genoa."
"Such protests have been serious, in the last instance resulting in a death."
"My report has been drawn up in my capacity as chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Rights and Freedoms, Justice and Home Affairs and I am pleased to say that it has enjoyed a wide consensus in that committee."
"I thank my colleagues for the work they have put into it and recommend that they adopt the report as it stands, and vote against the 30 amendments which have been submitted, which seem to me to relate to issues that have already been dealt with in committee."
"In looking at the problems of violence that we have seen, the European Union must understand the causes of such violent protest and seek to prevent it."
"There seem to me to be two requirements in this."
"The first is that we must improve political dialogue on the right to peaceful assembly and to peaceful protest."
"The second is that we must find a firm, but proportionate, response to criminal behaviour by demonstrators."
"I note that in Sweden and in Italy judicial proceedings have followed from the violent protests that we saw."
"The European Union, too, needs to look at whether citizens' rights have been violated, particularly in reference to Article 6 (1) and to Article 7 of our treaties."
"It must be recalled that Article 7 was strengthened by the European Council in Nice, which instructed the European institutions to monitor the application of fundamental rights even where there is simply a risk of a violation of them."
"In carrying out such surveillance, institutions must be guided by the European Charter on Fundamental Rights."
"Hence my report seeks to begin such a study of what has happened and look at whether we have in all cases abided by our commitments."
"When hundreds of thousands of people representing NGOs and church groups gather on the streets to express their concern and choose to do so at a series of international meetings, it is not just a coincidence."
"It demands an appropriate response and, indeed, a political response."
"We must avoid a situation where no answer is given because a society where citizens are afraid of their institutions - and perhaps more importantly institutions are afraid of their citizens - makes for a very weak democracy."
"In this context I welcome the démarche taken by Mr Guy Verhofstadt in seeking to engage in dialogue with civil society, in advance of the meetings that have been held under the Belgian Presidency."
"This approach needs to be complemented by a White Paper dealing with globalisation, looking at the European Union's position as a major actor in an area for which the Union is directly responsible and perhaps bringing together a number of Commissioners from different disciplines to look at a global strategy for the European Union."
"We must look at Article 33 of the Treaty, which gives Member States the task of ensuring the maintenance of law and order, and see whether the responses have been appropriate."
"The weakness in cooperation between the Member States' law and order authorities is a fundamental weakness of the Union."
"I hope that we will be able to examine this in the context of the creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice."
"Our citizens must know that they will receive the same treatment from authorities and enjoy the same rights under the law, whichever country they are in and wherever they are exercising their democratic rights."
"As Mrs Hazan cannot be with us, her report has been taken over by Mr Poignant."
"Mr President, I have stepped into Mrs Hazan' s shoes."
"This is unfortunate for you, but I hope you will excuse me and excuse her."
"On the eve of the Laeken Summit, Mrs Hazan said she was very pleased to have the opportunity to present this report on the Union' s priorities and policy objectives for external relations in the field of justice and home affairs and to play a larger part in this debate on the progress made in relation to the area of security, freedom and justice since the Tampere Summit."
"The Union is at a crossroads."
"We must not arrive late for this rendezvous that is so crucial and strategic to its future unless we want to end up one day with our back to the wall."
"Moreover, we now have an opportunity to examine the degree to which the Member States are willing to put justice and home affairs in the forefront of the Union' s policies."
"That is the purpose of this report, which highlights the need to fully integrate issues relating to asylum, immigration, justice and police cooperation, i.e. issues of very direct concern to our fellow citizens."
"With that in mind, all the Member States will have to take global, integrated and inter-pillar action."
"We must also stress the fact that hitherto the European Union has taken too little action in this field, which is still in its early days."
"This kind of report must be seen above all as providing food for thought on the added value of deepening the area of security, freedom and justice that is at the very heart of the Union, so that the Union can be prepared to meet the challenges of an external policy in this field."
"It is up to us to establish the necessary instruments, a lack of which has meant that we have hitherto been unable to respond to our partners' demands."
"Some of these objectives have been listed."
"They concern the following areas: combating all forms of organised crime, forming a common front against terrorism, coordination amongst Member States and candidate countries as regards training for the judiciary and police authorities, establishing a co-development policy, establishing close forms of cooperation with third countries in fighting racism, xenophobia and all forms of discrimination, establishing a strong link between immigration policy and development aid policy, the need to adopt a common asylum policy containing minimum standards for the reception and temporary protection of asylum seekers."
"This is a difficult task, which will take a long time and calls for complex international negotiations."
"By that token we must give the Union a mandate to take action to achieve this, by supporting the Commission proposals that do and will play their part in establishing this kind of coherent framework."
"In this sort of situation, we have to be bold enough to put our foot on the accelerator and ensure that decisions that are still blocked in the Council can enter into force."
"Obstacles do exist and we must do our best to overcome them."
"We must not overlook the human implications of these problems."
"Current events remind us of that, with the terrible tragedy of the eight refugees, including three children, found dead in a container in Ireland last Saturday."
"We also remember the 58 victims found at Dover in June 2000."
"I hope it will not take other tragedies of this kind for our States to realise how important it is to make progress in these areas."
"The Council must, of course, assume its responsibilities, because what is happening here is the result of its overcautious approach."
"Similarly, we must not allow ourselves to be blackmailed by any one country - I am referring to Italy - but I believe that yesterday' s events have changed things and Mrs Hazan cannot have known about this last night."
"In this regard, the tragic events of 11 September make it even more necessary for us to look at these matters from a long-term point of view."
"We must not now adopt an overly hasty position out of a sense of urgency."
"On the contrary, only if Europe is equipped with instruments that are permanent, operational and coordinated to a similar degree can it exert its influence on the international scene and impose its vision of humanism and the protection of individual freedoms."
"Lastly, we emphasise that Parliament must be able to exercise control over external policy and justice and home affairs policy by means of periodic consultation regarding the overall strategy pursued."
"Let me point out that this is not so much a question of making unrealistic and well-meaning proposals and but rather of analysing the situation objectively, which means we must look at this external dimension as a key part of our policy."
"The progress made since Tampere is not very encouraging."
"Whose fault is that?"
"It is certainly not the fault of the Commission, which is making a great effort to achieve these objectives. Instead, we should criticise the Council, which tends too often to put off the adoption of specific measures again and again, and the unanimity rule governing these areas, which blocks their adoption."
"Once again, none of this is new, as you know, since this question was also raised at the Tampere Summit."
"Today, we must seize the moment..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, the main phenomena that threaten democratic values, people and civil rights today are as globalised as our economy."
"Organised crime, drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings and terrorism are phenomena that no longer permit us to continue to think in national or regional terms."
"It is therefore by no means too late for the European Union to apply its policy on justice and home affairs to its external relationships."
"What is more, in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs we have noticed that there are more and more reports relating to cross-border problems, and Eurojust is only one example of this."
"The reinforcement or even the preservation of the constitutional state and democracy in the European Union is determined to a large extent by the situation in the countries surrounding us and those further away."
"A significant factor in this is the visible and invisible corruption that is particularly problematic in a number of countries and which is undermining our democracy."
"Thus an efficient and responsible immigration and asylum policy cannot be achieved without appropriate efforts for the countries of origin."
"However, in order to achieve a good understanding of the causes of migration and asylum applications, we must match our development policy to the actual socio-economic and political context in the countries concerned."
"The proposal by the Council, in collaboration with the Commission, is an important document that is pointing in the right direction."
"The principle of the constitutional state is being reinforced, both in the area of enlargement and in that of the European Union' s collaboration with other countries, and we should now be aiming to achieve proper coordination in our external policy."
"With her report, Mrs Hazan has furthermore managed to reinforce the original text."
"Naturally, the objectives, priorities and measures being proposed will still have to be achieved and complied with."
"It is also important that Parliament be kept properly informed about progress in this regard, because we have to be able to answer the question that concerns the man and woman on the street: 'What are you doing to solve all these problems?'"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, today' s debate in this Chamber is taking place in a particular international context, which only underlines the need, the urgent need, to achieve the objectives of the Amsterdam Treaty and to respect the programme set out by the Heads of State and Government of the EU countries in Tampere in 1999."
"It is also taking place in the context of yesterday' s Justice and Home Affairs Council whose heavy agenda reflected the intensive nature of the ongoing work, and of the forthcoming Laeken Summit, a mid-term meeting to evaluate the progress made since Tampere and, I hope, give new impetus to our efforts to bring our programme to fruition."
"Finally, it looks forward to the medium-term prospect of the Intergovernmental Conference to be held in 2004, against the background of the enlargement of the Union."
"Some of the questions that have been raised, especially on the role of the European Parliament in the field of justice and home affairs and on protecting the citizen' s fundamental rights in the European judicial area, will figure very largely on the agenda of that debate."
"Starting, therefore, with the questions put by Mrs Boumediene-Thiery, I will try to reply to the questions of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"The first question raised touches on a matter of principle: the objective of protecting the citizens, laid down in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"It is a question that stands at the top of the Union' s political agenda, in the light of the current, dramatic international events and of deadlines that are drawing increasingly near, such as enlargement."
"I would say that this objective will certainly not prejudice respect for the fundamental rights set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The Commission is most concerned to ensure that the proposals put forward for guaranteeing internal security and the protection of our fellow citizens are balanced and proportionate and are consistent with a system of values based first and foremost on the rule of law."
"First of all, a number of quasi-constitutional texts guarantee these rights in the European Union and are referred to systematically in the Commission' s proposals."
"This applies to the European Convention on Human Rights as also to the European Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"These texts govern the rights of the Union as they do national rights."
"Furthermore, I believe it is imperative to point out that the Union' s objectives with regard to the protection of citizens are not just consistent with the fundamental rights set out in the EU Charter but are based on these rights."
"In that sense, we welcome the recommendations made in the Watson report on demonstrations organised in conjunction with the European Council."
"These recommendations are reasonable and we believe they create a balance between, on the one hand, the citizens' freedom of expression and their full use of the fundamental right to demonstrate and, on the other hand, the need not to give free rein to those who are in fact against any democratic debate and believe they can pass on their messages by means of violent confrontation with the forces of law and order."
"As for the recommendation to launch a dialogue on the internal and external impact of globalisation, let me say that the same concern will be apparent in the communication the Commission will be submitting next January on the external aspects of a sustainable development policy."
"Turning to the second point, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery' s question about the possibility of taking special measures to combat the threat of terrorism, I do not think one could say the European Union is going down that road."
"Once again, although it is true that to some extent it is urgent to take decisions, and in particular measures to strengthen police and judicial cooperation to combat the most serious attacks on our freedoms, our values and our institutions, I do not believe that the initiatives the European Union has taken or has proposed can be described as special measures, i.e. as measures derogating from key principles because of special circumstances."
"No, the proposed measures are basic measures; they were taken, it is true, in special circumstances, but they are not makeshift measures and they are in fact consistent with the mandate our governments and our nations conferred on us when they adopted the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Let me also take this opportunity to express my pleasure and my congratulations to the Belgian Presidency for managing, yesterday in Rome, to consolidate decisions taken by the Justice and Home Affairs Council to adopt the framework decision on combating terrorism and the framework decision on the European arrest warrant."
"The rapporteur' s suggestion that we should include a temporary validity clause or a review clause is interesting in principle, i.e. the idea of introducing an obligation to assess the impact of a proposal adopted in terms of its objective."
"The third point that was emphasised concerns the delay in achieving the Tampere objectives."
"The speaker is addressing all the institutions and authorities responsible for implementing the programme decided at Tampere."
"The latest edition of the Commission' s programme includes an initial evaluation of the progress made."
"Delays have indeed occurred, especially in certain areas such as asylum and immigration or the minimal harmonisation of penal sanctions."
"As you know, the mid-term review that will take place at the Laeken European Council is therefore a crucial step."
"That will be the moment to check whether the commitments made in Tampere and reiterated on 21 September will be reflected by a real will on the part of the Member States to move ahead."
"It will also be the moment to learn lessons from the successes achieved and difficulties encountered to date."
"If the Tampere objectives were re-evaluated and, in particular, if the deadlines that were set were called into question again, we would see a crisis of public confidence vis-à-vis a political project, which, as everyone well knows, is essential and a matter of priority, whatever the remaining difficulties."
"So what we need today is resolve as much as method, in order not to disappoint public opinion' s legitimate expectations as also the men and women whose job it is to protect our freedom, guarantee our security and ensure that justice becomes more accessible."
"The Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers held last week produced encouraging results in terms of the Member States' resolve to match the commitments they made with their actions."
"However, it also illustrated all the limitations and ambiguities of a decision-making process based entirely on unanimity."
"In Laeken, the Commission will underline the fact that we can only overcome the reluctance to move forward if we begin by injecting a new dose of political will."
"When the Heads of State and Government embark on a new, more general debate on the future of Europe at the Laeken Summit, that will also be the time to establish a link between the progress achieved, the progress still to be made and the future of the Union and of the way it functions."
"They will have to reflect on how the next Intergovernmental Conference could introduce institutional changes and reform the decision-making mechanisms in such a way as to ensure the full achievement of the area of freedom, security and justice."
"The fourth question concerns harmonisation in the field of criminal law."
"First of all, let me remind you that the Treaty refers specifically to the harmonisation of criminal law as such."
"The object here is not so much to achieve mutual recognition as to make sure the EU Member States combat acts that affect all the countries of the Union in a coordinated manner, in the same manner and by imposing penalties of equivalent severity."
"This will be an instrument that complements the mutual recognition of judicial decisions."
"Of course, as I have always said and will repeat today, harmonisation must be handled with sensitivity and applied only where it is necessary."
"The Tampere European Council listed the sectors where this rapprochement is needed."
"There have been Member State initiatives or Commission proposals covering all these aspects."
"Several of them have been adopted, others are well on the way to being so and I believe I can say that we will soon have a common set of instruments to fulfil this mandate."
"Regarding procedural law, however, I have already had occasion to say that the Commission intends to present a communication on this subject, which has become all the more necessary in the light of the most interesting political debate on the European arrest warrant."
"The purpose of this communication would be to define common standards for the protection of individual rights in criminal proceedings in relation to a number of aspects that derive from the Convention on Human Rights and the Strasbourg Court' s case law."
"This approach would help strengthen the mutual trust on which the construction of the European judicial area depends, both in the Union as it is today and, later, in a Europe enlarged to 25 or 30 Member States."
"The fifth point concerns the democratic deficit that still exists within the Union in fields relating to justice and home affairs."
"This is a dual question, since it concerns, firstly, your institution' s role in the decision-making process in the field of justice and home affairs, and secondly, how it can exercise its powers in the appropriate manner."
"It is very important to ensure that our resolve to make progress in achieving our objectives goes hand in hand with improved democratic and judicial scrutiny."
"Firstly, I must say that over these past two years the Commission has endeavoured to inform and involve the European Parliament as closely as possible in the definition of its strategic guidelines and its initiatives."
"Nonetheless, it remains true that we need to think more deeply about Parliament' s participation not only in defining the Union' s strategy but also in its implementation. The Commission regards this as a key point with regard to the progress remaining to be made."
"Mainstreaming matters that come under the first pillar with those regarded as coming under the third pillar is proving a source of constant difficulties."
"Moreover, there is some risk that this situation could block the decision-making process; even if this risk is overcome at the price of artificially separating acts that in fact have the same aim, this deadlock would make the Union' s action unintelligible to the citizens."
"I therefore welcome the Council recommendation, which your Parliament adopted on 15 November this year, on criminal sanctions and Community law, calling for, at the very least, the communitarisation of judicial cooperation in criminal matters."
"Regarding Parliament' s access to sensitive information held by the Commission, one of the practical conditions allowing your institution to exercise its right of scrutiny properly, let me point out that a framework agreement, dated 5 July, exists between our two institutions and that the Commission will apply it to the full."
"Finally, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery asked about strengthening the candidate countries' institutional capacities."
"I believe that in the reports we have published and in our constant evaluation of the improvement in the candidate countries' capacities, we have borne this in mind and given all the necessary publicity to our evaluation of each of the candidate countries."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to the enhanced cooperation between the Union and the United States in the fight against terrorism, I believe this cooperation shows the extent to which the European dimension cannot now be dissociated from any complete and effective international action taken against transnational incidents."
"Of course, this cooperation is still in its fairly early days."
"It has given rise to problems, especially in guaranteeing full respect for the principles of our European law and of international law."
"I see the development of this European dimension as an opportunity to assert our values and our principles rather than sacrificing our principles on the altar of cooperation."
"To conclude, Madam President, Mr President, Ministers, ladies and gentlemen, the Union' s response to the challenges and issues of our times must be well considered but rapid, transparent but effective, progressive but coordinated."
"It is along these lines that I see the future of that vast building site, which is the area of freedom, security and justice, and that I intend to pursue the cooperative relations with the European Parliament on which we embarked two and a half years ago."
"I personally am very grateful for the commitment of all the members of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and above all its chairman, Graham Watson, to whom I offer particularly warm thanks."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, in view of the vast number of reports before us for discussion, I would like to make some fundamental observations, as Commissioner Vitorino has done."
"If we briefly review the past year in flashback, we can clearly see that we have, as rarely before, made progress in the area of internal security, even before 11 September."
"We have laid down the political guidelines on immigration and asylum policy; we have drafted detailed regulations; we have, in these areas, taken steps to deal with illegal immigration and also prepared for intensive judicial cooperation; and, after lengthy discussions, have even implemented a directive on money laundering."
"Progress has been made; it was heavy going, but we succeeded in moving ahead."
"We owe this in particular to the way Parliament and the Commission work so well together; they have led us to these very advances."
"Many thanks, Commissioner Vitorino!"
"There were more, indeed dramatic, developments after the attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September."
"The Member States' ministers - both of justice and of home affairs - appear at last to have woken up, with the consequence that the counter-terrorism package, which instituted Europol's joint investigation teams, could be wrapped up with the sole exception of the European arrest warrant, and I wish to express congratulations to Prime Minister Berlusconi and President-in-Office Verhofstadt for having brought about a settlement that may eventually make it possible to implement the European arrest warrant."
"The package of measures extends to the freezing of the money and other assets of suspicious organisations, as this will make it possible to sever the arteries of terrorism and organisations of a criminal nature."
"Renewed consideration, though, has led indirectly to greater security, one example being our most recent discussions here, in which we urged that a visa should in future be carried in exactly the same way as a residence permit, a document in its own right and unambiguously indicating the identity of the bearer."
"This is a plus for security, an added value which we have achieved through our discussions here."
"Our concern must, however, be with pressing the Member States to speedily implement all the measures we have decided on."
"I would, though, also like to use this opportunity to highlight some less positive developments."
"The working conditions in this House are, as a rule, among them."
"Cooperation with the Council leaves something to be desired."
"It is increasingly the case that documents are presented too late or not at all, resulting in Parliament and the committees discussing castles in the air."
"In important committee meetings, but also in the plenary sittings, the Council is frequently conspicuous by its absence."
"Monday was the classic example; in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, we met specifically to have important debates on the European arrest warrant and on cooperation with the United States, which involved an exchange of letters between Presidents Bush and Prodi."
"The Council distinguished itself by not being present, and there was no written material for discussion."
"Putting it mildly, that is unacceptable from the point of view of cooperation here."
"Take one look at the timetables and you will know that they result in impossible working conditions."
"We are increasingly getting documents at the last moment."
"This is not on."
"We want to make speedy progress, but not at the expense of quality."
"Mr President, I congratulate Commissioner Vitorino and the rapporteurs, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery and Mrs Hazan, whose report was adopted unanimously in committee, and the chairman, Mr Watson, whose report on security at international summits is meticulous from a legal viewpoint and politically balanced."
"This report reflects on the need to respond politically to the problems posed by globalisation in order to contribute to the political, social and economic progress of the international community and to overcome violence."
"Too many acts of violence have been committed during the anti-globalisation demonstrations, and also in some cases too many acts of violence against the demonstrators or even those arrested, as in the tragic events in Genoa in which a young man was killed, struck down in circumstances that are still unclear."
"I am glad to say that the courts in my country are independent and still able to mete out justice, even if it is posthumous."
"There have been too many acts of violence, too many violations of the rules and principles that govern the European Union."
"When faced with alarming events, we must not give up respecting the fundamental rights which we solemnly affirm and expect third countries that have barely entered the democratic arena to respect."
"Even today, when we are faced with terrorism, we must remember that these rights were won in Europe with the greatest difficulty."
"They cannot just apply on holidays and in times of peace."
"They exist to protect us in times of struggle and danger."
"Therefore, ready as we are to defend ourselves against terrorists, enemies of human rights, by every lawful means, we reject any temptation to use instruments that reduce the levels of civilisation on which we pride ourselves, even when faced with pressing, genuine demands."
"The end does not justify the means, especially when it is the means - respect for the fundamental rights of every human being, and the rejection of discrimination between citizens and non-citizens - that form the essence of our democracies."
"In this parliamentary term, the Europe of rights is being constructed."
"The Union' s Charter of Fundamental Rights has been approved and appreciable progress has been made in setting up the area of freedom, security and justice."
"We are behind schedule with asylum and immigration but we have made progress on judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters and police cooperation."
"The delays in Member States ratifying the agreements approved by the Council reveal the need for the Community method even in matters of the so-called third pillar."
"The strengthening of Europol, the creation of Eurojust, joint investigation teams and the fight against money laundering are just a few of the agreed objectives that are still waiting to be put into practice."
"The 11 September slaughter gave rise to the proposal of framework decisions on a joint definition of the crimes of terrorism and on the European arrest warrant."
"After incomprehensible resistance from - I regret to say - my own government, even the latter project is about to be implemented, and I hope my government does not make the country pay for its contradictions in this matter."
"In any case, I am glad to say that the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice really will be here soon."
"Mr President, I wish to talk specifically about the Council statement which we are expecting on cooperation between the EU and the USA and cooperation in combating terrorism."
"The events of 11 September were an excruciating flash of light and we had to react immediately."
"However, we must not be blinded into forgetting that terrorism has been a problem on our continent for many years."
"After 11 September, I remember Hans Gert Poettering saying here in a memorable debate 'we are all Americans', but we have learned since then that we must first be Europeans."
"I welcome the Justice and Home Affairs Council's agreement at the weekend on a framework decision on combating terrorism."
"I welcome the Council's recognition of a European Union legal base for the freezing of assets of groups linked to terrorism and, in particular, yesterday's agreement between Council President Guy Verhofstadt and Prime Minister Berlusconi on a European arrest warrant."
"Europe has put its house in order. Europe has shown its capacity to act."
"In tackling terrorism there is a fine balance to be struck between the security needs of our citizens and the rights and freedoms which make democracy what it is."
"The European Union has shown that it can be tough on terrorism and still be true to its treaties and to the values which underpin them."
"It has recognised that networks of terrorism stretch beyond its borders and that we need cooperation between democracies, particularly across the Atlantic."
"The next step must be an agreement on better cooperation with the United States."
"Articles 24 and 28 of the TEU allow us to build a cooperation agreement on police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters with our friends in North America."
"We note that there is a famous exchange of letters between Mr Bush and Mr Verhofstadt - some 40 US proposals on what we could be doing to improve our capacity to fight against terrorism."
"Most of these can be and I believe are being complied with."
"Some of them cause a few doubts since the US appears to be asking for things which it does not require in its own laws, such as retention of traffic data."
"Yet others highlight a difference of legal culture between our democracies."
"On a visit to Washington DC last week, in talks with senators, congressmen and members of the Administration, I was concerned to learn that the US Patriot Act, adopted by the United States to fight terrorism, appears to discriminate against non-US citizens."
"We will need to explore with our American friends quite how it affects those from the European Union."
"I was struck too at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing of Attorney General John Ashcroft by the way in which the proposal for military tribunals - the executive order from the President - would provide for hearings in secret, for a prosecution being able to withhold evidence from the defence, for defendants not necessarily having the right to an independent lawyer or to a private conversation with their lawyer, and by how a sentence - including a death sentence - can be passed by a majority of two-thirds of the jurors."
"Even if we were able to get an agreement on an extradition package in which the US would not apply the death penalty, the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights, to which all of our Member States are signatories and on which the Union is founded, would prevent extradition of suspects to appear before such military tribunals."
"Here, in Europe, we have developed a rights-based approach to international law."
"We would like a permanent international criminal court to try those guilty of crimes against humanity and we have called on the Americans to join us in that."
"We recognise that democracies need to work together in the fight against terrorism and other forms of serious cross-border crime."
"My fear is that, if the US goes down the path of military tribunals, we are on divergent paths."
"We must make that clear to Mr Ashcroft on his visit to Europe later this week."
"Mr President, one of the most enduring impressions of those who were victims of the violence in Nice, Gothenburg and Genoa is that of helplessness, especially towards the national authorities."
"Increasingly often, these authorities close borders indiscriminately and unlawfully, expel citizens with a clean record (as recently happened to a Swedish citizen, a member of a non-governmental organisation, who was expelled a few days ago from Belgium on no real grounds), and arrest defenceless demonstrators and subject them to unacceptable procedures, if not torture and terrible violence, as happened in Genoa."
"How can it be possible that there is nothing we can do?"
"How can it be that, with all the debates we have had on rights, on respect for dissent and the freedom to demonstrate, with all the talk on the Europe of the citizens, this same Europe is unable to take any action alongside the national courts?"
"The merit of the Watson report is precisely that it shows the way for Europe to stop being mute."
"The open statement that Schengen has often been violated and that this must not happen again; the threat to the freedom of the individual from secret, illegally compiled blacklists; the need to penalise, not least through international instruments, the disproportionate use of force by police forces; the ban on discrimination between European citizens: all this, which is contained in the Watson report, is the plan of work for this Parliament, which, unlike the other parliaments in the Member States, manages to find a spirit of true unity on these matters."
"I hope it is also the Commission' s agenda, and I hope that this plan of work will succeed in preventing the horrors we have seen in Nice, Gothenburg and Genoa, and will be an important contribution to all the measures being taken against terrorism."
"Mr President, I should just like to speak about the draft extradition agreement between the European Union and the United States."
"On 7 December 2000, at Nice, we signed, proclaimed and upheld the Charter of European Citizens' Rights."
"It is very clearly stated in Article 2, under the heading of dignity, that nobody may be condemned to death or be executed; the Charter thus makes a clear distinction between the two things and states that, for us European citizens, a prohibition on being executed is not enough and a prohibition on being condemned to death is also necessary."
"Well, we are committing ourselves to cooperation with the United States, which has kept the death penalty, condemns people to death and applies the death penalty, has a justice system that uses military courts, and detains thousands of Arabs without charge and without defence."
"We are about to vote on a joint resolution with the other groups - we, of course, will vote against it - stating that extradition may be granted provided the United States guarantees that the death penalty will not be applied; that means that the United States courts may issue capital sentences provided they then refrain from applying them, and all that in spite of the Charter of civil, human and fundamental rights that we have been highlighting so much recently."
"We are opening up an enormous breach in our defences against the death penalty."
"Friends from the People' s Party, Greens, Socialists, British Liberals, take care!"
"We are saying we can extradite our citizens to be condemned to death in the United States even if that country then undertakes not to apply the sentence!"
"It is a complete break with our tradition; it is a complete break with our commitment!"
"Today, we heard Commissioner Vitorino give a speech full of references to our values and our principles."
"What, then, are our values and principles?"
"Extradition to a country that will condemn European citizens to death?"
"I appeal to your feelings, but also to your moral integrity."
"We must vote against this resolution!"
"Mr President, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms has done some notable work in opening up a debate within the European Union Member States and thus assuring the highest security at European Council meetings and other similar events."
"Indeed, since the events of 11 September, the significance of these topics has increased enormously. Nevertheless, both the rationale underlying the organisation of these summits and the views of many of the peaceful demonstrators remain current."
"First of all, it is important that international Summits should continue to be held regularly and, where possible, they should be expanded to include representatives of the Third World, as happened at the G8 summit in Genoa."
"Indeed, it is only through discussion, dialogue and, especially, the preparation of a genuine cooperation and development policy that the poverty and marginalisation of vast regions of the globe can be overcome."
"This is precisely why we do not share the extreme, though peaceful positions of those demonstrators who, in Genoa, called the validity of the Summits themselves into question."
"Then there are the views of the so-called anti-globalisation movements, which are also topical and important; they are the views of those who imagine a development model with greater respect for people and the environment, those who imagine a more just society in which wealth is redistributed more fairly."
"That is why we should appreciate the innovative method introduced at the Genoa Summit by the Italian Government, which lined up a series of preliminary talks with the demonstration leaders in order to make participation in the Summit itself more democratic."
"It must be made quite clear, however, that there can be no tolerance for violent demonstrators."
"At Nice, Gothenburg and Genoa, some people, even politicians, succumbed to the temptation of seeking to justify violent behaviour."
"We should, rather, have the courage to condemn it unconditionally in every case, because, in addition to the views of the authorities and the views of the demonstrators, there are the views of the silent majority of European citizens, who want practical answers to the issues discussed at these Summits, and that is also thanks to the stimulus provided by the demonstrators, but without the unfortunate excesses and violence that completely devastated the city of Genoa."
"Lastly, I should like to mention the views of many men and women in the forces of law and order who, every day throughout Europe, strive to deal with major and minor emergencies of public order and crime, often with inadequate resources."
"If, as happened in Genoa, some of them went too far, they should be identified and punished individually, but without a whole class of people who often risk their lives for the good of society being unjustly and undeservedly criminalised."
"Finally, I congratulate the Italian Government and its Prime Minister, Mr Berlusconi, and the Belgian Prime Minister for having reached that important agreement yesterday on the European arrest warrant."
"I hope this will be the first step towards European harmonisation on matters of justice, and especially an important precondition for a European political Constitution guaranteeing all European citizens the right to security, freedom and justice."
"It is important to put this very broad debate in perspective, and the perspective is terrorism."
"Now, we are able to put names to the world' s most dangerous terrorists."
"What has for a long time been clear to some people is now, following the military operations of recent weeks and months, obvious to everyone."
"The terrorists who are most deliberately and effectively ravaging our planet and threatening world peace are the governments of the United States and Israel."
"Daily, these two governments combine in using their huge death-dealing military technology to wreak far greater destruction than any other of the countless terrorists of world history."
"Monstrosities of military technology, they practise terrorism in multiple senses of the word."
"For one thing, they leave their victims in precisely that state of desperation and impotence that creates fertile ground for reactions similar to Bin Laden' s."
"It is absolute power, economic and military, that creates terrorism."
"In addition, there is the psychological warfare that is in the process of doing away with the concepts of justice which Europeans usually regard as fundamental to the values to which we subscribe and which, specifically, are a defence against terrorism."
"Two months ago, the United States sent Mr Prodi a list of 40 different decisions which, according to the United States Government, should be taken by the EU and the Member States in order to satisfy the United States: surveillance, control, arrest with no counsel for the defence or court hearing provided, and the handing over of suspects for legal proceedings in the United States, involving military courts and the death penalty."
"On the last point, I entirely agree with Mr Di Lello."
"We must protest most vigorously against the handing over of suspects in any form as long as there is the possibility of the death penalty' s being carried out and as long as no guarantee can be given by the United States of its not being carried out."
"It has been shameful to see the way in which the institutions of the EU have complied with demands that are also aimed at abolishing our concepts of justice."
"What is at issue here is not military technology but politics and the defence of the law."
"Mr President, the documents on terrorism are certainly notable, although I believe we should pay far greater attention to the dangerous, worrying, serious signs of anti-Semitism and aggression against Jewish institutions and figures, including religious ones, as shown by the extremely serious attack on the Chief Rabbi of Brussels."
"These are also very worrying signs in a climate of passive habituation to such acts by exponents of Islamic fundamentalism in all the countries of Europe."
"The European arrest warrant: what a great result for liberal Europe!"
"Giuseppe Mazzini and the revolutionaries who breathed life into 'Young Europe' in 1840 will be turning in their graves at the thought of a Europe which before giving itself a democratic Constitution is already thinking of a European arrest warrant: necessary certainly for terrorist and criminal emergencies but certainly not for other areas."
"We autonomous Members see it as a dangerous sign and therefore we have addressed an open letter to all autonomous and independent movements that are fighting for the principles of freedom."
"Some Italian Members have spoken here to stigmatise our government' s behaviour regarding the events in Genoa: well, then, I should like to remind them of the serious acts of delinquency and hooliganism that the false anti-globalisation protesters in Genoa were responsible for."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, nothing in this world is certain any more, and to illustrate this I would like to return to the presidency which Belgium had prepared."
"We had focused primarily on the interim evaluation of Tampere, of the decisions and recommendations made there, and on the four priorities which we had chosen for our presidency, namely the conversion from pro-Eurojust to Eurojust; the fight against trafficking in human beings, not only by standardising the laws but also operationally in the field; the fight against the disappearance of children; and last but not least, the freezing of assets."
"However, who could have guessed at the beginning of our activities that there would be two incidents which would have a decisive impact on some other choices which the Presidency had to make?"
"More specifically, I am referring to the problems in Gothenburg which obliged us, as Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs, to take measures to guarantee freedom of expression, and to secure the safety of citizens, states and also demonstrators."
"Who would have thought that the events of 11 September would have had such a profound impact on our political attitudes, now that the framework decisions relating to the fight against terrorism and the European arrest warrant have seen the light of day and have experienced an accelerated genesis."
"All the same, I also offer my apologies on behalf of the Presidency for the fact that no one from the Presidency was present during your proceedings on Monday."
"However, I am sure you will understand that in the context of the European arrest warrant, which is a matter very close to our hearts and with which we are determined to make headway, we have taken every opportunity to continue our work in this area and, I may say, with some success, as we achieved the breakthrough yesterday, and the European arrest warrant has become a reality."
"I would like to focus particularly on some of your questions, which in my opinion were very appropriate."
"Firstly, the possibility of achieving the aim of the European Union, namely to create a high degree of security for our citizens in an area of freedom, security and justice, whilst - and this has also been clearly expressed by the various speakers - our fundamental rights as set out in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights are fully respected."
"The Council recognises that it is immensely important to fully respect fundamental rights in all areas in which it is active, particularly in the area concerned with guaranteeing the security of our citizens."
"I would like to illustrate this issue on the basis of two topical examples which I know have been the subject of intense discussion in your Parliament."
"I am referring in particular to the framework decisions relating to the definition of terrorism and the introduction of the European arrest warrant."
"In our response to the threat of terrorism, we need to be able to take effective measures quickly in order to demonstrate that Member States are capable of common action, whilst at the same time ensuring that decisions are made quickly, with top priority being given to our devotion to and constant vigilance in respect of the freedoms of our citizens."
"Our work has been done at top speed, but no one, and I would like to emphasise this, no one has ever been willing to sacrifice the quality of the texts in order to achieve rapid acceptance."
"By working enormously hard over the past three months we have succeeded in taking this justified endeavour into consideration, and in this regard I am particularly pleased with the input provided by the members of the Article 36 Committee."
"Furthermore, I understand the apprehension that some people initially expressed when they saw what we were doing in connection with the increased public concern about security after 11 September."
"I understand that this apprehension clearly played a role at times during the negotiations."
"I understand this fear and I admire the vigilance, but the outcome of our work and the compromises made by the Council of 6 and 7 December demonstrates that the Council never intended to sacrifice the rights in the European Charter, and I think that this is the only result that counts."
"The framework decision on the combating of terrorism contains clear instructions for national legislators, which makes it impossible to interpret it in an unnecessarily repressive way."
"The obligation to honour these rights as set out in Article 6 of the Treaty has been added, as has the work we have done on the European arrest warrant."
"The preamble bears the traces of a well-considered advice by your Parliament which we took into account."
"Finally, these precautionary measures are rounded off by the political declaration of the Council included in the decision."
"It makes it clear that the decision does not relate to people whose actions are aimed at protecting or restoring democratic values, nor to those exercising their right to freedom of expression, even if they break the law when doing so."
"Our work is now complete, and last Thursday the Council reached a political agreement in respect of this framework decision."
"There are similar guarantees for the European arrest warrant."
"In addition to the explicit references to fundamental freedoms in the preamble, Article 1 contains the connection with Article 6 of the Treaty which I have just explained in respect of the previous instrument."
"That the 15 Member States ultimately reached agreement on the European arrest warrant is therefore only to be expected."
"Besides the developments that have resulted in the explicit integration of the fundamental guarantees in the European Charter, I would like to add that it is advisable not to lose sight of the future role that the Court of Justice of the European Communities will have to play in the bringing together of the guarantees and the fundamental rights, especially on a procedural level."
"In view of its pre-judicial competence, and taking into account the traditionally sensitive relationship between criminal law and fundamental rights, it goes without saying that the Court is ideally placed to perform a particularly important role which consists of harmonising the guarantees offered to our citizens."
"To return to the implementation of the action plan to combat terrorism, negotiations on an agreement with the USA in respect of Article 38 of the Treaty on the European Union concerning mutual legal assistance in criminal matters are on the agenda."
"At the moment we are still in a preparatory phase."
"This is a very important activity, and I am convinced that you will maintain your vigilance with regard to the protection of human rights in this area."
"As far as the points on extradition that could be stated in this agreement are concerned, I would like to draw attention to the European Union' s unchanging position regarding cooperation with countries in which the death penalty is still in force."
"Extradition cannot take place without the inviolable guarantee that the person will not receive the death sentence."
"The Council' s standpoint on the special military courts in the USA for crimes connected with terrorism is not yet known, but I can already tell you that certain delegations are of the opinion that this situation may entail considerable risks in the area of fundamental rights, particularly with regard to the right to fair treatment as set out in Articles 47 to 49 of the Charter."
"I would also like to come back to another delicate point, namely the possibility of reaching an agreement on proposals for which negotiations have now reached deadlock, which is preventing the set deadlines on the scoreboard from being met and is preventing the creation of the area of security, freedom and justice."
"The Council is aware that some negotiations on the proposals currently on the table are being postponed, albeit, I may say, primarily for impartial reasons."
"I do not have the impression that negotiations have reached deadlock per se."
"Instead, the Council noted that there were several reasons for this delay and in fact it took the necessary steps to ensure that these discussions could be put back on track."
"The blockades without doubt form one of the points of the Laeken debate and I think that this will give the evaluation of Tampere a boost, especially that part in which we have not yet managed to achieve as much progress as we would have liked."
"At the same time I would like to draw your attention to the particular progress that we have made in legal matters in the extremely short time in which we have been in action."
"I think that a certain amount of quantitative and qualitative effort still lies before us, but I reiterate that everything we need to enable us to achieve this is in place, namely harmonisation of legislation, mutual recognition of court decisions and the creation of a number of European players."
"Concrete and decisive progress was made on all these levels in 2001."
"The framework resolutions on trafficking in human beings and the combating of terrorism in the area of harmonisation, the European arrest warrant in the area of mutual recognition, and Eurojust in respect of the players, are likewise elements which demonstrate the substantial progress we have made and which should enable us to achieve a truly European policy on criminal law."
"On behalf of my colleague Antoine Duquesne, President-in-Office of the Justice and Home Affairs, I would like to bring you up-to-date with regard to the progress of the files I know are close to your hearts, namely asylum and immigration."
"I have already told you that the progress in this area does not meet our expectations. Nonetheless we must remain objective."
"We have achieved a breakthrough during the course of this year."
"Both the Swedish and the current Belgian Presidency have made efforts to achieve progress in these affairs, which are particularly sensitive."
"These efforts have not been fruitless."
"Various basic texts, such as the visa regulation and the Eurodac regulations, the directive on temporary protection and the European Refugee Fund have been approved in this manner."
"However, it is clear that if we want to adhere to the deadlines set in the Treaty as well as at the Tampere Summit, we will have to redouble our efforts and make it even clearer that subjects such as managing the immigration flows, asylum policy and family reunification will have to take on a European perspective."
"I think that we still have a very great deal to do in this area, but you can be sure that the Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs, just like you yourself, are as keen as you are to achieve this."
"Please also allow me to pause at another subject that has also been touched on briefly, namely the question of whether the fact that numerous arrangements and international agreements, particularly those relating to the prevention and combating of organised crime, have not been ratified by the Member States, is being taken into account in the acceptance of measures."
"The Council is aware of this matter."
"The Council forums regularly examine the ratification situation and try to make it clear to delegations that it is absolutely essential that the decisions be rapidly enforced."
"However, the Council realises that every Member State wants to achieve a ratification procedure that fits in with its own constitutional requirements."
"This matter is also on the agenda as part of the evaluation of the implementation of the Tampere conclusions."
"I am sure that the conclusions of the Laeken summit will demonstrate how important the Council considers this matter to be."
"The Council has established that national procedures have been speeded up, and that almost all Member States have completed the ratification procedure for some instruments; for example, the agreement to protect the European Community' s financial interests as well as the two conventions on extradition of 1995 and 1996."
"We will continue to endeavour to ensure that these efforts bear fruit."
"I might add that the Council has been paying particular attention to this in the adoption of the action plan on the combating of terrorism."
"The action plan identifies various instruments including the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters and the United Nations Convention on the Suppression of Financing of Terrorism."
"These conventions must be ratified within carefully defined deadlines."
"Then of course we come to the questions concerning the democratic deficit within the European Union, about which the European Parliament does in fact have a number of issues to which it regularly returns. These include not the absolutely essential democratic control over activities that come under the third pillar, and in particular over Europol and Eurojust activities."
"With regard to Europol, the Council first wishes to emphasise that since 1 May 1999, the date on which the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force, all legislative decisions to be adopted on the grounds of the Europol Convention have been presented to the European Parliament for advice."
"By doing so, the Council has tried to guarantee that the European Parliament would have control of Europol as far as legislative measures are concerned."
"With regard to the executive board' s activities, as well as Europol' s operational activities, the Council is currently studying ways and means of organising effective democratic control whilst at the same time meeting the organisation' s operational needs."
"Various scenarios are being examined."
"One of the problems that need to be dealt with is the involvement of national parliaments in the control procedures."
"The Presidency has made this a priority."
"The Integrated Security in Europe conference which was held in November gave rise to a debate on stricter control of the sector."
"The Council wishes to point out that the concern expressed by the European Parliament is at the top of the agenda."
"However, the careful implementation of such mechanisms is a complicated process in which the balance in the Europol system must be carefully monitored."
"According to the draft instrument, Eurojust, for its part, should only be assigned a cooperative and coordinating role."
"All decisions will be taken by the competent national authorities who will be handling the cases."
"However, it is possible for the European Parliament to be kept up-to-date with Eurojust' s activities provided that they are not of an operational nature."
"The instrument establishing Eurojust therefore specifies that Parliament will receive an annual activity report which deals amongst other things with data protection."
"Parliament is also giving discharge for the implementation of Eurojust' s budget."
"A democratic deficit has also been observed by the European Parliament. This deficit refers to the lack of the EP' s involvement in the definition of the strategy of the European Union in all its parts, both inside and outside the Union, except for the fact that Parliament is only kept fully informed and has access to the so-called sensitive information."
"I must say at this juncture that the Council is applying the institutional convention provisions to the letter."
"In this context, when the matter relates to a proposal or initiative that falls under police or judicial cooperation in criminal matters, the Council applies the provisions of Article 39 of the Treaty establishing the European Union, and when the matter is one that is covered by Title IV concerning asylum and immigration or judicial cooperation in civil matters, it applies Article 67 of the Treaty establishing the European Union."
"Experience shows us that the Council has consulted the European Parliament whenever the Commission or one of the Member States has submitted a proposal or an initiative to it."
"The Council was in fact present during the plenary sessions and meetings of the appropriate committee of the European Parliament, and Parliament was given ongoing information about the state of affairs."
"And now to the final set of problems I would like to discuss with you, which concern the need to keep the European Parliament informed about important changes occurring in the negotiation process within the Council, both in relation to legislative proposals by the Commission and in relation to initiatives developed by the Member States."
"As I have already said, it was the Council' s wish to fully involve the European Parliament in the legislative procedures at Community level in accordance with the provisions of the convention."
"It is true that the activities of the Council bodies will result in changes to the tenor of some provisions of the proposals or initiatives being submitted to them."
"This is in fact in keeping with the common wish to find solutions which have the support of everyone in the Union."
"In practice we know that if the European Parliament has not yet issued its advice on a proposal or an initiative, the Council has always been willing to provide the information requested so that the European Parliament can satisfy itself as to the direction the activities are taking."
"This having been said, the Council knows that the European Union' s standpoints have a specific value added which differs from those of the Member States. Since it aims in its advice to respond to a different institutional logic and give the Council the right elements within the framework of the democratic task with which it is charged, this task must obviously not depend on developments of the work done by the Council on one decision or another."
"What is more, the Council consults the European Parliament, if necessary, in accordance with the provisions of the convention."
"Please allow me to conclude this part of my speech by expressing my satisfaction as President for the way in which we have been able to cooperate with the European Parliament."
"We sometimes had to seek advice about very profound matters in particularly difficult circumstances and at very short notice."
"I think that this is something that may even have been unique to this Presidency."
"We have never appealed to you in vain."
"The European Parliament has exercised flexibility when giving advice, sometimes at very short notice."
"This method of cooperation, coupled with our cooperation with the Commission and the Commissioner, has made it possible to take a major step towards, amongst other things, the European arrest warrant, which I believe is the most important common denominator, because this has enabled us to undertake an action in this area which is comparable to the introduction of the euro in the financial and monetary sphere."
"Thus the European arrest warrant has also come into being as far as cooperation in judicial matters and mutual recognition in criminal matters are concerned."
"This is only possible if all players demonstrate the good, positive attitude that we have encountered."
"I am therefore pleased that in these circumstances, the early annual report relating to judicial and home affairs matters has been given a different perspective than it has in the past."
"Mr President, first of all, allow me to say that, once again, I consider this Parliamentary procedure whereby the Commissioner speaks after three speakers and the Minister after seven, as if to say that all those who will speak from now onwards are not even worthy of an answer, to be strange."
"Having said that - I do not agree with it but I abide by it - I shall speak particularly about the Watson report, which proposes a useful, appropriate initiative to regulate the security side of future summits of any kind. The proposal started off, it must be said, in decidedly lifeless tones as regards an objective analysis; then the tone improved along the way."
"This is just the opposite of what happened with a parallel initiative for the fight against terrorism, which arose out of the emotional response to 11 September and then all of a sudden became an opportunity not only to produce a European arrest warrant but more especially to cause a real witch-hunt within Italian politics."
"But the leader of my Group, Mr Tajani, will speak at greater length on this."
"I return now to the Watson report, which proposes the requirement of agreeing public order measures for major summit meetings."
"A truly appropriate idea, I was saying: it is a pity that it should have become both an excuse for preparing a summary trial of the events at previous Summits, and especially a Trojan horse in its attempts at party political speculation in a decidedly national vein."
"This has all come about through instrumental amendments, in the form of direct attacks on the Italian Government and its President."
"Not just this, but it also reiterates a defamatory action, as has already been mentioned, against the Italian forces of law and order, which are accused of serious offences and Gestapo-like behaviour that have never been proved in the numerous inquiries that have so far been opened."
"This, then, amongst other things, violates the Italian State' s legitimate autonomy and sovereignty to deal with public order issues."
"To those Members who still confuse the limits between national sovereignty and Community competences I say quite plainly - but still calmly - that it is time to stop doing the dirty washing of national politics in the European Parliament, but it is also time to put an end to the widespread sport of misusing points of order and questions in order to provoke improper debates and vitriolic attacks on persons rather than on ideas and political positions."
"I say this particularly to the Italian left-wing Members, the diligent supporters who regularly find room to express themselves in this House and also in the newspapers, thanks to the work of partisan reporters with little objectivity."
"Fortunately most of Parliament has understood this."
"In the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, almost all the amendments from the left were rejected."
"I propose that Parliament should do the same in its plenary session, and to make it quite clear I shall indicate the dangerous points: Amendment Nos 22, 25 and 29 are real chemical weapons against the truth."
"They should be rejected, otherwise I shall be forced to ask my coordinator to vote against this report."
"Mr President, I am glad that, although you are from Regensburg, you are willing to give a minute's speaking time to a Nuremberger like myself."
"Mr Santini, who has just spoken, has shown what this is all about."
"If we are talking about an area of freedom, security and justice in Europe, if, like the President-in-Office, we are talking about a European home affairs policy, then even such a faithful servant of this master as Mr Santini will have to come to terms with the fact that we will also discuss Italian domestic politics."
"Now, I am not an Italian left-winger, but a German left-winger, and I can tell you that I do not share the view expressed by Mr Verwilghen and Mr Vitorino, according to whom what happened in Rome yesterday represents progress."
"Yesterday saw us achieve a victory in the first round, for 14 States of the European Union were consistent and determined in ensuring the failure of the attempt by the Italian Prime Minister, out of naked self-interest, to make use of his office of state to obstruct a criminal investigation that could involve him, and in ensuring that private interests were prevented from paralysing the European arrest warrant."
"Yesterday, this same Mr Berlusconi - a former Member of this House, who, thanks to its President, was not subject to any proceedings to lift his immunity - had this to say, and what I quote relates to what was told me by President-in-Office of the Council Verwilghen, who drew a parallel between the European arrest warrant and the euro - accurately, in fact, in terms of their dimension and political significance."
"What does Mr Berlusconi have to say about it?"
"Mr Berlusconi says: ""Other nations have named 2004 as the deadline for the European arrest warrant to be put into effect, although it could be later."""
"I quote word for word."
"If the Italian constitution is not amended, then we cannot join in, in much the same way that Great Britain is not joining in the euro."
"Why do I speak in terms of winning a round?"
"I prophesy this to you: After all we have experienced in the Council, after all Italy's stonewalling in the interest of its Prime Minister, I tell you here and now that the same Prime Minister will now hold a referendum in order to prevent the European arrest warrant from being effective in Italy."
"This is very likely, and so I do not yet believe that we have now implemented the European arrest warrant."
"I do believe that this House will have to insist, with the utmost consistency, on the isolation Italy has imposed on itself over the last few weeks being maintained by the 14other European states, because anyone who has, like me or like Mrs Paciotti, crossed swords in this House with Mr Berlusconi or Mr Dell'Utri, will be painted by the Berlusconi press, as I was, as an old Stalinist - and I am not old yet, nor am I yet a Stalinist - or, like Mrs Paciotti, will be described as head of a communist conspiracy against Italy."
"Looking at you, Mr Tajani, I understand why the people of Rome did not elect you as their mayor."
"I can understand it, above all, when I hear you speak."
"Anyone who, even tentatively, questions Italian policy, gets slandered in this House."
"Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Watson, who has presented a very balanced and good report despite the ongoing attempts at blockade and the policy of permanent obstruction which Forza Italia, part of the Group of the European People's Party - though hopefully not for much longer - has adopted."
"(Applause)"
"Sir, your speaking time is up."
"Mr Tajani has a point of order."
"On which item of the agenda do you wish to speak, sir?"
"Mr President, Parliament' s Rules of Procedure must be enforced!"
"It seems that in this House there is a claque supporting Mr Schulz in the public gallery, although in this House, as in all parliaments, members of the public are forbidden to applaud or call out in support of one argument or another."
"I therefore ask you, Mr President, to enforce the Rules of Procedure and perhaps have spectators removed if they are supporters of one side and do not intend to watch the work of Parliament but just want to cheer someone on."
"Mr Tajani, on this point you are right, but I ask you what the President is supposed to do."
"Should I have the visitors removed from the gallery?"
"Should I have their hands tied behind their backs?"
"What has happened, has happened, and I cannot do anything about it."
"You are right, but I cannot do anything about it now."
"In the fight for security from terrorism, we have rightly proclaimed that we are defending fundamental values but, if we compromise individual rights in the pursuit of security, we will have sacrificed some of what we hold so dear."
"In the last two years since Tampere, the programme of cooperation on justice matters has been heavily weighted to the security side of the scales - especially since 11 September with the anti-terrorism package."
"All this is necessary, but it is time to rebalance the work programme."
"At the Laeken Summit, Heads of Government should commit themselves to a thorough review of the degree of respect in practice for the standards we have signed up to in the European Convention of Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"There needs to be a programme to ensure observance of minimum standards of due process, fair trials in criminal proceedings and approximation of rights of defendants."
"We should project these standards in our international agreements because there are some worrying developments."
"In the UK, there are proposals for executive decisions for detention without trial and an attempt to avoid any significant degree of judicial review."
"In the United States, President Bush has signed an order providing for trial in military courts in the absence of fundamental safeguards for fair trial provided for in international law."
"The EU must not agree to any extradition agreement with the US whereby people could be convicted in these military tribunals."
"Finally, the case of the 14 British and Dutch plane-spotters detained for nearly five weeks in Greece without trial is extremely disturbing."
"They have been denied bail, the evidence has been presented in secret and there has been no transparent schedule of court hearings."
"They may be guilty at most of a misdemeanour."
"It will be a disgrace if the European arrest warrant is agreed this weekend and this situation has still not been resolved."
"I call, in particular, on Prime Minister Blair to withhold agreement if they have not been either charged or released by Friday."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-office of the Council, Commissioner, fellow MEPs."
"Our desire to create a European area of safety and justice is a common one."
"Over the past few weeks and even over the past few days, we have taken some important steps, and I would like to personally congratulate you on the efforts you have made in this regard and on the results you have achieved, because efforts are not always enough; we also have to achieve results."
"Having said this, I would like to point out - and I share your opinion, but I know that there are others who do not - that security cannot be used as an excuse for threatening fundamental rights."
"I am indeed a little concerned when I see how quick some people are to use the word 'terrorism' and to apply it to all kinds of things they do not like, both in international and national politics."
"The European Parliament has rightly been pressing for a strict definition, and has been knocking the eagerness to label all dissidents as terrorists on the head."
"I am pleased to hear you say that the Council is following Parliament on this."
"I would also like to see this confirmed in all texts, because people who want to change the constitution in their country are not necessarily terrorists, and people demonstrating against globalisation and injustice in the world are also not necessarily terrorists."
"Absolutely not, in most cases."
"We believe that anyone who equates this with terrorism is violating fundamental rights."
"We would like to return to the European arrest warrant, including the guarantees being demanded by the European Parliament."
"However, I think it is very important that you have been able to implement this and that you were able to bring us this message today."
"Mr President, in correspondence that is still being kept from Members in spite of my requests, Mr Bush put four intolerable demands to Mr Prodi."
"They are intolerable because they are made by a government that has set up military courts and introduced measures described as 'patriotic' but that in fact take away any right to defence, by a government that, since 11 September, has kept nearly a thousand immigrants in prison without lawyers and without charging them, by a government that, when all is said and done, has still not abolished the death penalty."
"In the name of urgency, but also in a state of total confusion, the Council and Commission are trying to make us swallow texts on terrorism that are always questionable and often have not even been put to the vote."
"I believe it is time to call a stop to this masquerade and this caricature of democratic debate."
"In the name of the war against terrorism, they are waging war against democratic freedoms and the social acquis."
"This is not our war; the war we should be waging is against violence, poverty, unemployment, hunger in the world and dictatorships, against corruption and safe havens for Mr Berlusconi."
"Mr President, the Watson report uses the issues of the day to accelerate the communitisation of the EU."
"This is because better coordination between Member States overcomes the problem described to a large extent."
"It is incomprehensible that the report only refers to the Charter, a political statement, whilst the European Convention on Human Rights, the perfect convention for the protection of our citizens' rights, is not mentioned in it."
"Since the US terrorist attacks of 11 September, the EU' s attitude towards the US has been highly critical as well as supportive."
"The object of our criticism is the new anti-terrorism legislation. Some discretion in this regard would not be out of place."
"Please do not get me wrong; I am no advocate of trials by military tribunals without the possibility of appeal, and I believe that the USA must reconsider this, but I do wonder how we would have reacted if these attacks had taken place in the EU."
"Refusing point blank to extradite terrorists to the USA is sending out the wrong signal."
"It would be more reasonable for the EU to make clear arrangements with the USA about the conditions of the extradition."
"Mr President, first I would like to say that I entirely agree with what Mr Vitorino said about the problems besetting our quest for an area of justice, freedom and security, while remaining very much aware that we cannot have an area of security without justice or justice without police."
"We should be lucid enough to realise that generally speaking Europe is in quite a privileged position in this respect, for we have a fairly well-established level of citizens' freedoms, even though we have to remain very vigilant."
"We know how to alternate Community responses - and I hope the arrest warrant and our response will be worthy of us - with the proper degree of subsidiarity."
"We base our activity on a system of values that have been set out and listed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and on an approach under which monitoring by the states of the level of citizens' freedoms alternates with recourse to the Court of Justice, both the Court of Justice of the European Communities and the Strasbourg Court."
"Unfortunately, however, Europe is not an oasis and the world is interactive: if I may put it this way, the world around us does not stand still, which justifies taking external action in the field of justice and home affairs."
"First there are the candidate countries."
"We cannot allow any differentiation in respect of these countries."
"Naturally, we will have to require the same level and the same perception of citizens' freedoms."
"Then there are the countries close to us, the countries that will become close to us by what I might call capillary action."
"I am thinking of countries such as Russia, Belarus and the Ukraine, in respect of which we will have to decide how to act."
"Lastly there are the partner countries, countries that are the source of immigrants and asylum seekers and with which we must maintain a constant dialogue."
"Hence the need for external action. We have two types of external action."
"The first type is rather messianic, involving the export and globalisation of law and order and the constitutional state as we understand it."
"Then we have protective action vis-à-vis this external world, because, of course, there are crimes and scourges that know no frontiers, a problem to which we will have to find the appropriate answers, without of course ever abandoning the values we have set out and proclaimed."
"In this respect I would like to defend the European Parliament, which has to play its full role, because traditionally parliaments are meant to be the custodians of citizens' freedoms and we have to play this role."
"Obviously this means more than involving our Parliament in the strategy and implementation of external actions in the field of justice and home affairs."
"It is also a question of our resources."
"In this regard, in my few remaining seconds of speaking time and under the authority of Mr Watson, the chairman of our Committee on Citizens' Freedom and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I would plead for this committee to be given additional resources in terms of staffing."
"After many struggles, including a decision this Chamber adopted unanimously, we have managed to acquire one extra member of staff for the committee, although this person is in fact employed by DG IV; meanwhile the Committee on Foreign Affairs has nine members of staff assigned to human rights."
"I find it irresponsible that if a Parliament wants to give its Committee on Citizens' Freedoms the resources to do its job, it does not to give it the staff needed to assist the colleagues who are responsible for the committee' s reports."
"Mr President, the European arrest warrant was saved in the nick of time."
"It was dragged away from the gates of Laeken."
"How pleased should we be now?"
"The creation of an area of freedom, security and justice goes to the very core of the relationship between governments and citizens."
"The exercising of legitimate pressure versus the upholding of the citizen' s essential fundamental rights."
"In the past, revolutions were fought and extensive constitutional debates were held in Europe over this tense relationship."
"However, legislation on this matter is now being introduced in the third pillar of the European Union by means of framework resolutions engineered by the Council using secret diplomacy, monitored by national parliaments and the European Parliament."
"In this respect, we are back in the 19th Century."
"Our desire to reform the European decision-making process and to close the so-called democratic loophole are well-known."
"However, it will require a Treaty change and sufficient political will to do this, but we cannot wait that long."
"The procedure concerning the European arrest warrant demonstrates that a critical boundary has been crossed."
"Our own credibility as representatives of the people is at stake, so democratic legitimacy must also be increased in the current Treaty in the near future."
"The proposal that was recently adopted in the Dutch Upper Chamber is one way of doing this."
"It asks for the introduction of a phase of active openness in the Council' s decision-making process."
"According to this proposal, a final decision on draft framework resolutions is only taken after a period of at least six weeks, during which time citizens and organisations in the Member States are given the opportunity to form their opinions."
"The role of national parliaments and the European Parliament should also gain in significance in this way."
"This would at the very least prevent us from voting on out-of-date documents as we did in November, or only nodding our assent retrospectively, which we may do this week."
"I propose that we lay down such a modest reform of the decision-making process in a new interinstitutional agreement, and if anyone thinks that this is asking too much, they should say so."
"Mr President, of course terrorism must be combated, but a number of the measures currently being introduced at breakneck speed are in danger of undermining the rule of law in society which the war against terrorism is intended to strengthen."
"Sweden, for example, has frozen all the assets of a number of Swedish citizens of Somali origin on the basis solely of a US list."
"They have no opportunity to defend themselves or to lodge an appeal."
"Two days ago, a Swede was expelled from Belgium for having put up posters for one of the legal demonstrations to be held in conjunction with the Laeken Summit."
"With this in mind, one may well ask how far we can go before destroying both the rule of law and freedom of movement within the EU."
"Are all these precipitous measures really only targeting terrorism or is it in actual fact the case that, despite all promises to the contrary, this is in practice turning into a campaign on the part of the authorities and the establishment against both immigrants from Muslim countries and normal legal protest movements against the neo-liberal class-based society?"
"It would be excellent if the Commission and the Council could show that this is not the case."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, whereas Mrs Hazan seeks by means of her report to make the methods of 'Fortress EU' an export hit around the world, the Watson report expresses concern for the safety of the Heads of State and Government at their meeting within the framework of democracy as it really exists."
"What security in Laeken will mean was learned by the people, who, in the run-up to the summit, got a letter in which the police in Göttingen advised against participation in protest actions and threatened that disregarding this advice would meet with preventive measures."
"The murder victim Carlo Giugliani probably did not get such a letter, any more than did the people who were beaten up and shot at in the Diaz School or on the streets of Gothenburg."
"They were told about the framework programme on terrorism only after the event, because they had demonstrated against the EU and G8 and had defended themselves against police violence."
"I wanted to say in addition that the rulers are enforcing their right to security, which is defined in the context of security, justice and freedom, at the expense of the lack of freedom for demonstrators, and so it will not only be demonstrators at Laeken who will not have much to laugh about."
"Mr President, an agreement was reached in Rome yesterday on the European arrest warrant; Italy too will sign it."
"It is certainly a positive step, but it is no more than the beginning of a long process of trying to set up, at last, a genuine European area of freedom, security and justice."
"The new European Constitution should lead to harmonisation of criminal law and procedure in our Union."
"The Member States should work towards a situation in which crimes and penalties do not differ from one place to another."
"We must all, in short, commit ourselves to establishing fair trials, that is, to having a third judge, allowing evidence to take shape in the course of the trial and to having the prosecuting magistrates separate from the judges."
"This is not blackmail, Mr Watson; it is not an Italian caprice, as has been suggested in this House; it is the will of Parliament, which, in 1997, voted for the Roth report, which invited the Member States to carry out a genuine reform of justice in favour of a fair trial."
"That is why so many criticisms levelled by the left against the Italian Government in this House are unfounded and the result of propaganda by a handful of fundamentalist magistrates."
"Moreover, the foreign press in Italy has recognised this; in this respect, I quote the words of a respected journalist in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Hans Jürgen Fischer, who said, 'All these charges against the Berlusconi Government seemed quite out of proportion to me.'"
"It is therefore our duty to reject all the attacks made on the Italian Government by left-wing MEPs who do not understand the situation in Italy and who, beginning with the leader of the Socialist Group, Mr Barón Crespo, have made absolutely unfounded attacks on the Italian Government and on Italy."
"I repeat, they are attacks that we firmly reject because it is all just propaganda."
"In short, a lot of fuss has been made about nothing and Parliament has not achieved any results."
"The results were actually achieved thanks to the action of the Italian Government, which concluded the agreement with Mr Verhofstadt yesterday."
"Mr President, Mr Tajani, who has just spoken, makes me very glad that I have a minute less in which to speak, and that is the least I can offer, for what is a mere minute against Mr Berlusconi?."
"After an intervention like that, I am glad Mr Schulz got a minute from me and was able to speak for longer."
"Now, though, I really do want to deal with different subject matter, one that is very, very important to me."
"For 16 months we have had an EU-wide problem that we have not yet been able to resolve."
"It was terrible for us to have to face what happened at Dover."
"Now we have another 13 people found in a lorry in Ireland, eight of them dead, among them two children."
"Minister, I ask the Council, the Commission and Mr Vitorino, that in this area, above all, we should, as we must, carefully go over our homework again, in order to bring in the measures that are so urgently needed if we are not to find even more refugees dead."
"Mr President, more than two years ago, on the initiative of the Aznar Government, a new page was turned in Tampere with regard to European integration: to make a politically and judicially viable new common European area of freedom, security and justice, which would make the freedom and security of citizens compatible - and here is the great political debate - with the efficient functioning of, and access to, justice within this area."
"The events that have taken place over these last two years, such as the tragic deaths of Moroccan and sub-Saharan citizens in the Straits of Gibraltar and off the Andalusian coast, the death of immigrants in Dover or the recent incidents in Ireland, the repugnant traffic in, and corruption of, minors, and prostitution, combined with the horrific murders committed by ETA and the tragedy of 11 September, have caused an upheaval in the debate and have accelerated the need for the speedy implementation of measures to cope with such a dangerous and worrying situation."
"Ladies and Gentlemen, the work carried out by the Council, the Commission and Parliament in this field has its good and bad points."
"The good points include the fight against terrorism, where the important role which our President, Nicole Fontaine, has played in this area, as well as Commissioner Vitorino, deserve a special mention; the European arrest warrant and the definition of terrorism are the result of a difficult battle against terrorism that started in this House before 11 September."
"I would also like to stress what a good thing it has been to separate the debates on economic migration and asylum, which has helped us to clarify ideas, debates, and even approaches."
"However, in my opinion, there is still a long way to go."
"There are too many bad points and the most worrying of these in my opinion is the disorder caused by the hastiness and lack of agreement in the Council in areas such as the family reunification of immigrants, minimum standards on the asylum process, conditions for the reception of asylum seekers - to give but a few examples - where our work is sometimes ineffective due to the fact we have to chop and change what is carried out by the Council, which shows that the method with which we have to work is not ideal by any means and needs to be amended."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as the last Justice and Home Affairs Council demonstrated, the system for taking unanimous decisions on matters of justice and home affairs has come to the end of its cycle."
"If the Berlusconi Government manages, even for a short time, to block the decision on the European arrest warrant, can you imagine what will happen when the Union of the 15 becomes a Union of 30 if we continue to insist on an intergovernmental rather than a Community method for taking decisions?"
"A propos, my congratulations to the Belgian Presidency on the battle which it won in Rome yesterday."
"The Council is clearly unwilling to make any fundamental reforms on the basis the commitments made in Tampere, despite the assiduous efforts of Commissioner Vitorino and the political will demonstrated by the European Parliament."
"The only sector in which the Council has evinced any particular interest or enthusiasm is in the fight against terrorism, under pressure from and at the suggestion of the United States which, I am afraid, is trying to export and impose its system of justice on Europe, a system which clashes with European customs and values."
"How can we extradite European citizens to the USA when the United States cannot guarantee that it will not impose the death penalty?"
"I am afraid, Commissioner, that the alliance with the USA is becoming more and more dangerous for the European Union."
"The fact that strict rules are being promoted within an already strict framework is understandably causing concern among citizens, who fear that the fundamental liberties and human rights which they have fought long and sacrificed much for will be restricted."
"The end clearly does not justify the means."
"For the rest, half way through the five-year period set by the Amsterdam summit for creating a European area of freedom, security and justice, we are seriously behind schedule, for example in formulating a common immigration and asylum policy."
"Finally, I wonder, what has happened to European sensitivity and our humanitarian values, when we are incapable of resolving the drama of refugees and immigrants despite witnessing daily tragedies such as the recent suffocation of eight immigrants in southern Ireland?"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, a little more than two years have elapsed since Tampere and the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"It is important to point out that major progress has been made but that, on the other hand, there are still many obstacles to be overcome."
"The Union is proud, and rightly so, of its constant defence of respect for human rights in the world and within the Community."
"The recently proclaimed Charter of Fundamental Rights reinforced our commitment in this regard and the area of freedom, security and justice only makes sense if all three of these elements are taken together and if no one of them prejudices any other."
"The tragic events of September 11 and the intensified attention to safety measures cannot detract from this fundamental approach."
"Since it is necessary to meet citizens' expectations in terms of fighting terrorism, special care must be taken not to fall into excesses or exaggeration, that is to say, 'everything for security' ."
"The Member States' commitment to building an area of freedom, security and justice was once again reaffirmed at the last Justice and Home Affairs Council."
"It is vital that within this area citizens may enjoy the right to express themselves, demonstrate and meet freely and peacefully, provided that they do so in a way which does not constitute a threat, either to their own safety or to the safety of other citizens and property."
"Here too, we must not exaggerate."
"Any individual or group of people wishing to take part in legitimate demonstrations should not be blocked at the borders, that is, they cannot be denied the right to cross frontiers, i.e. they cannot be denied freedom of movement, which is a fundamental right granted to all citizens of the Union by the Treaty."
"Because security is merely an instrument to ensure freedom. Security loses its meaning when it prejudices freedom."
"Security without freedom is tyranny."
"In this festive season, my best wishes to Commissioner António Vitorino for the continuation of his excellent work."
"Mr President, as this is a debate which deals with various topics, I would firstly like to say that I completely agree with all that Mr Watson said in relation to his report."
"It appears to me that Parliament is going to make a worthwhile contribution today in confronting a violent situation in the streets of Europe which is a worry to us all."
"With regard to the advances made in the area of freedom, security and justice, I would firstly like to congratulate the Commission on what they were able to achieve yesterday, especially with regard to the European arrest warrant, and I would also like to congratulate the Council for a very particular reason, for the sincerity of the report from the Belgian Presidency with regard to the progress made."
"Just as the Council does in its report, I would like to express my concern at the lack of progress made in the area of common asylum policy, and even more so in the area of common immigration policy."
"Not only is there no European policy but, as we have seen recently, there are quite a few governments who are developing their own new national policies, and, what is inexcusable in some cases, justifying these decisions citing Europe as the underlying cause."
"I hope that in Laeken we can make progress, however small, and make a new commitment in accordance with what the Commission said in its two communications on asylum and on immigration."
"On the other hand, I think that the agreement reached on the mutual recognition of judicial decisions, the so-called European arrest warrant, is very important."
"This seems to me to be a giant step forward, of course, in the fight against terrorism, but also in the fight against money laundering, in the fight against corruption, in the fight against human trafficking, including of women for sexual exploitation, and in the fight against organised crime."
"To me, this seems important, but it also seems that we should take some time to think and it is this that, thirdly, I would like to ask the Council: I think that in Laeken you should take into account not only the advances made in the agenda but also how these have been achieved and which problems must be dealt with."
"It seems to me that the unanimity and the lack of real power of this Parliament do not help."
"We are living in a world of paradoxes."
"A few days ago, in a manner of speaking, we said that Bin Laden had provided the impetus for implementing methods for fighting terrorism that the Commission had been planning and that Parliament had requested some time ago."
"Paradoxically, it was also the spectacle made by Mr Berlusconi' s government that brought the debate on the European arrest warrant onto the front page of the papers."
"I would sincerely have preferred for this debate to have taken place in Parliament, for there to have been a public debate and for you to have accepted it."
"I would like to tell you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that I am pleased that you appreciate the institutional loyalty of this Parliament."
"I would just like it if you could, in return for this, display a little more institutional loyalty in the analysis of our texts, in the inclusion of some of our positive ideas in your documents and I think that this would help in strengthening the positive nature of the Commission/Parliament/Council work cycle."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be relatively brief."
"I only have four objections: one about the past, one about yesterday, in a manner of speaking, one about tomorrow, although I really mean the day after tomorrow, and one about the future."
"Let me start with the past."
"I think that the concept of creating a European area of freedom, security and justice first saw the light of day about 25 years ago."
"I think that we have taken a number of essential steps in the right direction without crowing about it, but also without achieving the results we want to achieve."
"We did not - and I would like to say this here in the European Parliament - have to organise a witch-hunt or use Gestapo-style practices."
"On the contrary, anyone who has read the Watson report and the advice from the European Parliament and who knows the position of the Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs and that of the Commission, knows that we do not use such methods."
"However, yesterday - and I am now thinking back to Tampere 1999 when we took the decision to put a series of recommendations to the Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs - I discovered that since then we have in fact been correctly following the three paths that were delineated there to create this area, namely those of harmonisation, mutual cooperation and the creation of players."
"Tomorrow, and by that I mean the day after tomorrow, I hope that at the Laeken Summit we will give new impetus to the Amsterdam resolutions and the Tampere recommendations that have not yet been implemented."
"I am saying this here with all the more conviction because I believe that there are two areas to which attention absolutely must be paid: the fight against trafficking in human beings and the fight against the sexual and economic exploitation of children."
"And finally to the future."
"I have often heard people say that we would have to choose between freedom and security, but I do not think that is necessary."
"Justice and security are two instruments that are necessary in order to guarantee freedoms."
"A pertinent comment that I often hear, and one that we cannot ignore, is that we will have to ask ourselves about institutional decision-making and more specifically whether unanimity should be maintained in the third pillar."
"These are a number of objections that I wanted to put to the European Parliament at the end of this debate."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you very briefly, in reply to a question put during the debate, that the American President wrote a letter to the Belgian Prime Minister and to the President of the European Commission pointing to a number of areas in which the United States of America considered that there was a need to deepen cooperative relations with the European Union in the fight against terrorism."
"Prime Minister Verhofstadt and President Prodi replied to that letter on 28 November."
"That is the first point I want to clarify."
"There is no private or special correspondence between the President of the European Commission and the American President."
"There was an exchange of letters between the American President and the European Union, represented by both the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission."
"On the substantive questions, let me tell you quite frankly that the truth is that we had already taken decisions on most of the aspects referred to by President Bush, during the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting of 20 September; these decisions were in fact supported by the Heads of State and Government at the European Council in Brussels on 21 September."
"Looking to the future, I believe that there are some difficult areas in the context of cooperation with the United States; we must not conceal that fact."
"Incidentally I have always said this and I said it again to Mr Colin Powell, the American Secretary of State, at the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting last week."
"Of course we supported and still support the agreement signed between Europol and the American police agencies on cooperation in the fight against terrorism."
"The agreement does not cover possible exchanges of personal data because we realise that this is a sensitive area in which the Europeans and Americans apply different standards. So this area will have to be approached separately as a specific task, which we will indeed do as soon as possible."
"Secondly, there is one rather important area of cooperation, namely judicial assistance; as soon as Eurojust is established definitively, we will have an important tool in our hands for mutual judicial assistance with third countries."
"Here again, however, we will have to clarify the rules on exchanges of personal data within the framework of mutual judicial assistance involving third countries."
"Thirdly, on the subject of extradition, I agree with what Mr Watson said about the internal imbalance of the US Patriot Act as regards the legal status of US citizens vis-à-vis other citizens, including Europeans."
"That is no doubt an area we will have to look at together with our American friends."
"I also had occasion to say that Europe has not taken any exceptional measures to combat terrorism."
"We have not derogated from the Charter of Fundamental Rights; we have not introduced any exceptional measures to combat terrorism, so I do not think it is fair to criticise Europe for being in the process of adopting measures it is not in fact adopting."
"All the measures that have been taken to combat terrorism and that are now in force are measures based on the existing legislative framework or are measures, such as the European arrest warrant or the framework decision on terrorism, which were planned well before 11 September."
"Furthermore, in the case of the European arrest warrant, there is no doubt at all: we were asked to introduce it by the Heads of State and Government in October 1999 to replace extradition."
"All those who keep on trying to interpret these measures as emergency measures are wrong: no, Europe did not react to the terrorist threat by departing from its fundamental principles or taking emergency measures."
"It reacted by taking measures that were no doubt introduced in an exceptional climate, but that are measures we had been asked to take and that had been planned a long time ago."
"Moreover, on the question of extradition, let me repeat to the European Parliament that the Commission has always said that we have never changed our position on the death penalty and that we have said quite plainly that our position in this dialogue did not allow for any possibility of extradition to Member States that apply the death penalty."
"Having said that, I will certainly read the resolution the European Parliament is about to adopt very closely and reflect carefully on the implications of your recommendation."
"I do not agree with Mr Di Lello, for, in my view, if there are guarantees that the death penalty will not be applied that is sufficient to guarantee respect for the fundamental values."
"This needs to be said very plainly."
"Finally, Mr President, I want to tell you that I hope the Laeken European Council will enable us to give fresh impetus to the major task of establishing the area of freedom, security and justice, in the field of asylum and immigration as in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation, by accepting the gradual and pragmatic approach we are taking."
"I have no illusions, however."
"When it comes to turning Europe into an area of freedom, security and justice, we are looking at the very heart of European political cooperation. We know, from our 50 years of experience, that this political integration is never easy."
"That said, we shall persevere because I believe that our citizens expect us to find a political response to the needs of European integration."
"That is why I am so excited to be taking part, at your side, in this project for an area of freedom, security and justice."
"Mr President, I should like to say to Mr Tajani, who has accused my Group of criticising and being against his government and Italy, that only the first part of what he said is true and that the confusion between criticism of the government and criticism of the country, nation or its people is the first step on a very dangerous path, which in Europe we all know very well."
"(Applause from the left)"
"I inform you that I have received two motions for resolutions in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote on the reports will take place today at 11.30 a.m."
"The vote on the motions for resolutions will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.20 a.m. and resumed at 11.30 a.m.)"
"Mr President, I wish to denounce the unacceptable behaviour of Mr Schmid, who was acting President this morning, who during the debate allowed some left-wing Members to make really personal attacks on Members of the Italian centre-right and in particular the Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, as well as involving President Fontaine by accusing her somehow of blocking in an evidently improper manner the request to waive Mr Berlusconi' s parliamentary immunity."
"I believe and we believe it is unacceptable that Members from other countries should attack the sovereignty of the Italian Government and the democratic choices of its people."
"If this unfortunate habit and this constant lowering of tone are not stopped, next session we shall make sure we bring to this House' s attention all the examples, public and private, of European party leaders who, in our view, damage Europe' s image."
"Mr President, I want to appeal to the Rules of Procedure, with regard to Rule 116."
"This morning, during the debate on the Watson report - a particularly heated debate - in the course of the speech by Mr Schulz, who had attacked the Italian Prime Minister, the President of Parliament and certain Italian Members, there was an interruption from the public, who loudly applauded what Mr Schulz said."
"I appealed to the acting President - I did not argue with Mr Schulz, naturally - and asked him to make the members of the public present in the House remain silent."
"I recall that Rule 116 says: 'Members of the public admitted to the galleries shall remain seated and keep silent."
"Any person expressing approval or disapproval shall immediately be ejected by the ushers.'"
"When I turned to President Schmid I was given the following answer: 'You are right, but I cannot tie the hands of those present in the House.'"
"I believe the acting President contravened the Rules of Procedure."
"I believe the Rules of Procedure should be obeyed to the letter: this applies to the left, the centre and the right; it applies to everybody, because it is the Rules of Procedure that dictate civilised coexistence in this House."
"This is Parliament, not the Strasbourg stadium!"
"Mr President, on Monday evening I asked Mrs Fontaine to make the exchange of letters between Mr Bush and Mr Prodi available to all Members."
"Mrs Fontaine replied that it would be done."
"The next day, during the meeting of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, the Commission representative expressed surprise that Members had not seen Mr Prodi' s letter of reply to Mr Bush."
"These letters have still not been made public."
"In plenary this morning, Mr Vitorino acknowledged that this exchange of letters was not private and that Mr Prodi had replied in the name of Parliament as a whole."
"Before the highly important vote we will soon be holding on relations between Europe and the United States, I would urgently ask for the exchange of letters between Mr Bush and Mr Prodi to be made available to all Members."
"Mr Krivine, I am informed that Mrs Fontaine has not received a copy of this letter."
"If one arrives before the end of the day, a copy will, of course, be sent to all Members."
"Mr President, personal reference to me having been made for a second time, I am unfortunately obliged to comment on it, and I do so referring not to Mrs Angelilli's assertions, but to what has just been said by Mr Tajani."
"Mr Tajani is right to say that the Rules of Procedure do not permit manifestations of approval from the galleries, but we have to recall what happened."
"Mr Tajani had made several interjections during my speech, whereupon I remarked that I could better understand his behaviour now that I could see him, or have a better understanding of why the citizens of Rome did not elect him mayor."
"Vigorous applause then broke out in the galleries."
"""Vox populi, vox dei"" - even if the Rules of Procedure make no provision for that."
"(Vigorous applause)"
"Mr Schulz, allow me to comment that appealing to this saying is not at all appropriate in this House because, if vox populi were the voice of the galleries, we could also do without debating, speaking and voting."
"Mr President, I would like to clarify just two things."
"The first is that, while chairing the sitting, I heard applause, but was not sure that it came from the gallery."
"Secondly, when the honourable gentleman spoke up, I told him that he was in the right and also pointed out that I could do nothing about the gallery after the event, but it was made clear that applause is not permitted."
"That is what has to be done under the Rules of Procedure."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Vote"
"Owing to financial interests, I shall abstain from voting on this report and the following four."
"Mr President, although strictly speaking Rule 9 does not provide for this, I would like to declare an interest in relation to the four reports on the Telecom package."
"Mr President, the Commission has passed its opinion on the amendments to the Sittings Directorate, and this is widely known by Parliament."
"In addition to that, I wish to reply to the rapporteur's question."
"If this directive is adopted as now proposed, the Commission will publish the relevant MHP multimedia home-platform standards in the list of standards published in the Official Journal of the European Communities under Article 16 of the Framework Directive."
"According to this directive, Member States have to encourage the implementation of the standards contained in the list."
"One year after the date of application of these directives, the Commission will examine whether interoperability and freedom of choice for users have been adequately achieved in the Member States."
"If that is not the case, the Commission can propose making implementation of relevant European standards mandatory."
"The directive requires the Commission to carry out a public consultation on such a proposal."
"Following the public consultation, the proposal would be submitted to a regulatory committee procedure requiring support from a qualified majority of Member States before being adopted as a formal Commission decision."
"I should like to remind Members that there are links between amendments that may be adopted or rejected and amendments that may lapse, and between the Paasilinna report and other reports in the whole telecommunications package, and therefore we must be rather careful."
"Mr President, I understand the need to maintain the integrity of the telecoms package, but I understand there have been some final changes to the declaration the Commission has issued on 'must carry' rules."
"I would like to know whether this text genuinely reflects Parliament's views, particularly the amendments of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and whether the Commission would be kind enough to read out that text so that we can see what we are agreeing to vote on."
"Mr President, if you had given me the floor first, as rapporteur, I would have been able to cover the point raised by Mrs McCarthy."
"Could I just formally ask you for a separate vote on Amendments Nos 2, 11, 23 and 24?"
"I have been asked to do this as a formality, even though it is included in colleagues' voting lists."
"Could I also say to colleagues that this is part of the compromise package we discussed."
"I want to make it clear in your voting list, colleagues, that the first part of Amendment No 15 is part of the compromise text and I am recommending you vote against the second part."
"My Amendment No 36 is also part of the compromise text, and for clarity for colleagues on the Legal Affairs Committee, this is the amendment you voted on in committee with just the addition of the word 'television' after 'digital interactive'."
"That was a compromise."
"I agreed with the Council to clarify the wording - there have been no other changes."
"Can I also make it absolutely clear that Amendment No 11 is also a compromise text and that is shown at the bottom of your voting list."
"I turn now to the points quite rightly raised by my shadow rapporteur, Mrs McCarthy, on the question of 'must carry' obligations."
"This is an issue that many colleagues are concerned about and reflects Article 31 of the proposal."
"I am recommending that you vote against the committee amendment as part of the compromise but I would ask you, Mr President, to give the floor to Mr Liikanen."
"He has prepared a statement clarifying the access provisions for public service broadcasters in the whole electronic communication package."
"That access provision is the key concern of colleagues."
"So, can I ask you to give Mr Liikanen the floor?"
"Mr Harbour, if I had seen you before Mrs McCarthy, I would have given you the floor before her."
"I could not have foreseen that she would speak first."
"In the light of Parliament's concern over the extension of 'must carry' obligations to conditional access and other associated facilities, the Commission wishes to make the following statement."
"First, the provision of Article 6 of the access and interconnection directive guarantees all broadcasters access to conditional access systems on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms."
"Under Article 5(1)(b) of the access and interconnection directive, Member States may impose obligations to provide such access on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, on other associated facilities, in particular application programme interfaces (APIs) and electronic programming guides (EPGs)."
"Second, the Commission will monitor the application of these provisions at Member State level, including 'must carry' obligations, taking into account any problems that public service or any other specified broadcasters may have in gaining access to satellite and other broadcast networks."
"The possibility of guidelines for Member States could be considered."
"Third, the free movement of television broadcasting services in the Union is covered by the 'television without frontiers' directive."
"In its forthcoming review of this directive, the Commission will assess inter alia the impact of technological and market developments on the production and distribution of European audiovisual networks."
"In conclusion, I have noted the importance the European Parliament attaches to the promotion of multicultural and multilingual Europe, also in this context."
"Mr President, if I heard the Commissioner correctly he said the possibility of guidelines 'could' be considered."
"Did I mishear that?"
"The House needs to know whether they 'will' be considered."
"Commissioner Liikanen spoke in your language, Mr Perry, so I think it is quite clear!"
"Perhaps the Commissioner would like to repeat this part?"
"Mr President, please permit me to address a question to the Commission before the vote is taken."
"The text that the Commission originally submitted for a resolution envisaged the formation of an expert group on radio spectrum policy to continually discuss radio spectrum matters."
"The European Parliament was to be involved in these discussions."
"Legal and institutional considerations make it impossible to embed the founding of this group in the Frequency Decision, but I would ask the Commission whether they are holding to their original intention and establishing such a group by a Commission decision, that is to say on a voluntary basis."
"If so, will Parliament be involved in the work of this Group?"
"I turn to the Commission again for its opinion on the amendments."
"Mr President, as the EPP shadow rapporteur I should like to ask if your secretarial office is in possession of an erratum regarding point 5.5, which the translation office has circulated but which, oddly enough, does not yet appear in the text distributed so far: it is a note made some time ago regarding a very serious translation error which falsifies the rapporteur' s original text."
"In point 5, fourth line, the rapporteur wrote: 'The use of guns must be absolutely avoided.'"
"I repeat, the rapporteur' s text says: 'The use of guns must be absolutely avoided' , and the translation is: 'The use of guns must be absolutely forbidden.'"
"There is a substantial difference there, apart from the fact that Parliament can, I believe, neither consent to nor forbid the use of guns by any police force in this Community."
"In any case, the translation is evidently wrong."
"I should like to check whether you are in possession of this corrigendum before voting - irrespective, therefore, of the result of the vote."
"Mr Santini, at the beginning of the vote on the Watson report I had already pointed out that there was a corrigendum to the Italian version."
"A further check will, of course, be made on the basis of your remarks."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0414/2001) by Mrs Hazan, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Council report on European Union priorities and policy objectives for external relations in the field of justice and home affairs [7653/2000 - C5-0102/2001 - 2001/2051(COS)]"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE"
"Jackson report (A5-0383/2001)"
". I voted against the Jackson report on Codex Alimentarius because I am heartily sick of the gross intrusion into the European Parliament e-mail system of mass mailing of lobby letters."
"It has been totally counterproductive and every effort will be made in future to prevent similar intrusions."
"Dary report (A5-0443/2001)"
"For more than thirty years, the European Union has worked hard to construct its special partnership agreement with the African, Caribbean and Pacific States."
"It was within this policy of openness and solidarity that the common organisation of the market in bananas was established to guarantee access to the European market for a certain percentage of the bananas produced by ACP countries, which include some of the poorest countries in the world."
"This measure was opposed from the outset by the major, multinational banana companies, which are very competitive, but this often entails exploitation verging on slavery!"
"Owing to political pressure, economic sanctions, compromises and concessions, the entire quantity protection system will be abolished from 2006 and will be replaced by a protection system based solely on tariffs."
"As yet, no one knows how effective this will be in protecting the interests of the traditional ACP banana producers."
"The agreement reached in April 2001 did of course end the trade war that had poisoned our relationship with the United States for almost ten years."
"But some of the measures genuinely are a bitter pill for the ACP countries to swallow."
"These include the abolition, in 2006, of quota protection guaranteeing traditional producers access to the European market and a 100 000-tonne reduction in the guaranteed production quantity from January 2002. In addition, they are affected by the deficiencies and delays of the financial and technical assistance measures established to help ACP producers adapt to the new market conditions."
"Michel Dary' s report, that we will reach a decision on today, proposes that we offer the ACP countries a number of safety nets to be used during the transition period, before they step out into the unknown when the common organisation of the market in bananas ceases to exist."
"(Speech shortened pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"Ever since 1993, the issue of bananas has been at the heart of trade relations between the European Union and the United States."
"Some have even gone so far as to say that it has poisoned transatlantic relations and that this conflict should be resolved as quickly as possible."
"I would even venture to say that it should be resolved at any cost."
"Those in positions of power, like Louis Vuitton, Hermès and Gucci have had enough!"
"So much so that people all over the world from the West Indies to Brussels and Strasbourg, some individuals have decided to fight back rather than capitulate."
"But who in Parliament can fail to recognise that by giving in to the diktat of the United States, in the guise of the WTO, the European Union is supporting future unemployment? At some point in the long term, 35 000 people in the Canary Islands will be made unemployed, and 30 000 in the West Indies."
"Who can fail to recognise that by progressively giving in on this issue, the European Union is disregarding its social model, which it is so keen to export throughout the world?"
"Finally, who can fail to recognise that by giving in now on this issue, in the future we will inevitably have to give in on sugar, and not just on sugar cane but also on sugar beet? Soon we will have to write off our own agricultural model."
"Mr Dary has not avoided these various issues and I think that this Parliament should be proud of having voted in favour of his report today."
"Inspired by the strength of our democratic legitimacy, we have chosen the path of resistance, in the face of the intransigence of the European Commission."
"Our request for 'cyclone' licences to be available when crops are destroyed and, particularly, our demand for a transition period prior to the start of a purely tariff-based system in 2006 illustrate our opposition perfectly."
"This is why I naturally voted in favour of the report by Mr Dary. Overall, I felt it was pertinent to the issues involved, despite having some reservations, which, as I explained to the rapporteur, relate to the distribution within quota C between Caribbean and African producers."
"Given Africa' s trade links, in which France has been pivotal for historic reasons, I fear that this change will represent a further blow for the European producers of Guadeloupe and Martinique."
"Paasilinna report (A5-0435/2001)"
"Mr President, Mr Paasilinna' s framework directive refers in general to all rules concerning the creation, maintenance, development and improvement of citizens' communications networks that are integrated together, that is, they provide for the use of televisions, computers and telephones."
"I voted for this report with pensioners and the elderly in mind, Mr President."
"What have the elderly and pensioners to do with this document?"
"Well, they are the ones who spend most time in front of the television and so, as end-users of these technological advances, they should be taken into consideration."
"Unfortunately, they are not taken into consideration enough in this document."
"Brunetta report (A5-0434/2001)"
"Mr Brunetta' s report, Mr President, also refers to telecommunications, and particularly access to and interconnection of electronic communications networks and associated facilities."
"Going back to what I said in the last explanation of vote, although this is a document that I approve of in its entirety, here too, unfortunately, I have noticed something missing: there is no provision to allow access to these means of electronic communication - i.e. television, the Internet, mobile telephones - at rates suited to those who are elderly or pensioners, receive modest pensions and should be entitled to have access to these means of electronic communication without any further financial burden, and even with state support."
"Niebler report (A5-0433/2001)"
"The Niebler report, as you have said, Mr President, refers to authorisations for electronic communications service networks."
"As the representative of the Pensioners' Party, I voted for it, but I should like - and this is something lacking in this document - exemption from payment of various fees, charges and rates when authorisation is granted for new television service and network players to enter the market."
"In this document there is nothing to help those who propose to use these means of communication to give information on employment rights, pension rights or social matters of interest to all citizens, particularly the elderly."
"Harbour report (A5-0438/2001)"
"Mr President, Mr Harbour' s document - another directive on telecommunications, on universal service and users' rights relating to electronic communications networks and services - seeks amongst other things to obtain the greatest possible benefit for consumers."
"If, then, what I said in the previous explanation of vote is true, that consumers are for the most part the elderly and pensioners, that means that it should seek the greatest possible benefit for the elderly and pensioners."
"That is precisely what many pensioners asked me when once again they went with me to the airport on Sunday afternoon, when I was catching the plane to Strasbourg."
"They asked me to tell Parliament, with regard to these documents, that they would like there to be much more on television about their problems and their desires."
"Can I say that we fully understand the wish of the Commission and Council to ensure the success of the telecom package in advance of the Laeken Summit."
"It is vital to achieve the Lisbon targets, but as the shadow PSE rapporteur, I wish to complain about the procedure."
"I also object to the deals which have been struck at the last minute behind closed doors resulting in a compromise package which seriously weakens the provisions for must-carry services and for people with special needs and disabilities."
"These were approved unanimously in the Legal Affairs Committee."
"It was of course disappointing that the British Conservative rapporteur informed me of his decision to abandon these important provisions for consumers and users in order to achieve political expediency."
"My delegation or the Labour MEPs voted in favour to maintain the committee's positions on these important provisions."
"Can we remind perhaps the Commission and Council that we are co-legislators, not co-drafters of declarations which have no legal force and rely on the Commission's goodwill to deliver on must-carry."
"We will, of course, monitor the Commission's progress to deliver on these provisions."
"I have to say that today was a victory for Laeken, for the Commission and Council on the telecoms package, but it was not a victory for democracy in this House."
"I would first of all like to remind you of the background to this report. To begin with it was allocated to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, like other reports on the telecoms package."
"At that time I was appointed rapporteur. Then the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market declared that it was the responsible committee and the report was handed over to Malcolm Harbour, a British Member of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"I remained the draftsman of the opinion, but the opinion I expressed had little influence in the discussions!"
"This is a terrible shame, especially when the issue is the protection of universal service in such an important sector which is undergoing such important changes."
"The report adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs last November makes astonishing reading. The measures relating to universal service have been reduced to a disappointing level and the report focuses mainly on consumer protection."
"As I said in my report of the opinion, if universal service includes, within the definition of its component services, the same kind of criteria that are usually used to assess services provided for consumers (affordable prices, availability, delivery timetables and quality), its raison d' être has different types of objectives if we look at the issue for the point of view of regional policy, social policy (preventing the poorest people from being excluded) or public safety policy."
"I would like to stress the importance for democracy of the ability to access new communication networks."
"New technologies make it possible for people to speak out, to participate in democratic debate and to influence decisions."
"Technology can also be used to bring government closer to the people."
"Local democracy can benefit greatly from the interactive aspect of online local public services."
"Public services can be given a new lease of life through these new technologies, if the means are made available to them, and of course if they have the will to do so."
"Lastly, Internet access is essential to the creation of a knowledge-based information society."
"The committee' s proposal needs to be improved in order to meet these challenges. This is what I attempted to do in my amendments, all which were rejected by Mr Harbour."
"Today we have voted on a report that proposes some interesting changes concerning the protection of consumers, particularly disabled consumers, and the 'must carry' principle, but which, regrettably, cannot claim to provide universal service in this sector!"
"Niebler report (A5-0432/2001)"
"Mr President, I voted for Mrs Niebler' s report on the radio spectrum in the European Community and its distribution, just as I voted for all the measures on telecommunications."
"In my opinion, however, a quota should have been reserved for Europe of the frequencies available for the electromagnetic emissions with which the electronic messages are sent which are then converted into pictures on our televisions and computers and into signals in fixed or mobile telephones."
"Europe must take the lead in the future, and it will only be able to do so if frequencies are available for Europe as such and not just for the national States."
"Trakatellis report (A5-0420/2001)"
"Mr President, EUR 280 million is being appropriated to public health care."
"Do not worry, I am not about to suggest you become a surgeon - although, for all I know, you might be dreaming of becoming a surgeon. I would just like to say that, with regard to this Community action programme, that I hope that the resources of all 15 Member States of the Union will be combined to fund a single European programme which, in addition to the funds appropriated by us, will also benefit from the funds that the individual national States make available to it from their national budgets."
"In particular, however, I call for a reduction in the working hours of those who work in toxic environments and, as a result, suffer from occupational illnesses, for this is one of the causes of the high public health costs, not just in terms of human lives but in financial terms as well."
"The programme of Community action in the field of public health is an important element of the work towards improved public health in Europe."
"Public health is an issue close to the heart of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and a precondition for a dignified and decent life."
"We therefore support the Commission' s proposal and the amendments proposed by Parliament in its first reading."
"However, it is our view that the amendments proposed by Parliament in its second reading would only lead to the concept of public health being undermined, to a breach of Article 152 of the Treaty and to encroachment upon Member States' self-determination in the area of health care."
"We have therefore chosen to vote against all the amendments, with the exception of Amendment 1 on respect for the principle of subsidiarity in the area of public health and Amendment 60 on reduced resistance to antibiotics."
". (NL) Without democratic regulation by the state, health becomes a commodity."
"This commodity is available to anyone who is rich and powerful but not to anyone who is poor and powerless."
"We see that the average life expectancy of disadvantaged population groups is shorter than that of privileged groups."
"There is constant pressure to replace income-dependent insurance premiums with a premium that is the same for everyone regardless of their income."
"Commercial companies offer special care to anyone who can and will pay for it."
"Hospitals are going into the commercial market; people with the most money can queue-jump and loss-making treatments are being scrapped."
"Waiting lists are being created, people are being referred to distant hospitals in other Member States, and the number of unnecessary deaths is increasing."
"To combat this trend, it is important for governments to provide good healthcare that is accessible to everyone."
"A European programme of Community action in the field of public health can contribute to this."
"However, it is necessary that the amendments rejected after the first reading get a comfortable majority today, so that we can clearly establish that health is not a commodity and is not subject to financial compromises, and that there is a great deal to be improved in the area of healthcare in many Member States, which has been neglected for the past twelve years."
"With regard to this programme, I have voted against the proposal to 'develop a specific action to promote, by means of public awareness/information campaigns, an improved diet and eating habits which are better suited to the needs of the human body' at European level."
"The European Union must concentrate on its main tasks - promoting peace and democracy, human rights, free trade and initiatives for improving the environment."
"This is the only way for our cooperative venture to win public support and understanding and gain legitimacy among our citizens."
"Otherwise, the EU project will still principally be seen as centralising decision-making among only a few people."
"This weekend will see discussions on the outline of future EU legislation/new instruments or treaties at the European Council at the Royal Palace of Laeken in Brussels."
"Here, it is more important than ever for the European Parliament to show the political maturity and discipline required not to demand new policy measures at European level, but instead to rally around the central joint undertakings."
"It is vital that the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in the Treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam, is actually applied."
"A body wholly independent of the EU institutions, the European Court of Justice, should be given the authority to monitor adherence to and respect for the principle of subsidiarity, in order to ensure that more powers are not transferred to European level."
"This certainly does not include the centralised implementation of a uniform Europe-wide campaign for 'an improved diet and eating habits' involving all the various cultures, eating habits and tastes that characterise the 370 million citizens of the EU Member States."
"Let taste, culture and lifestyle remain different for Greeks, Spaniards, Swedes, British and Germans."
"Such diversity is a great asset."
"Paulsen report (A5-0408/2001)"
"Could I express surprise that the compromise package negotiated by the three largest groups has been rejected by the Council?"
"We would have preferred to have voted on the compromise amendments."
"The compromise on the two contentious issues, namely time allowed for setting limits and the right to return contaminated feed to the country of origin with the consent of that country's government, was realistic and workable."
"I wish to put on the record the position of the ED wing of the EPP that the Council was crazy to reject the package that was on the table."
"If it thinks it can get a better deal in conciliation, then it has another think coming!"
"Incidentally, the compromise was the best deal for the Italian pensioners as well."
". The implementation of key provisions of the EU White Paper on Food Safety is of paramount importance if we are to restore confidence in the food chain."
"The inclusion of undesirable ingredients by feed manufacturers in animal feed was responsible for BSE and the Dioxin scare."
"It is to the credit of this Parliament and the other EU institutions that measures were quickly put in place to deal with the crisis and to agree long-.term measures to prevent any re-occurrence."
"Today' s debate is a further positive step on this important road ensuring that animal feed available to farmers is of the highest quality."
"Not for the first time do I want to put on the record that in all of this sorry debacle, farmers were the innocent victims of circumstances which were beyond their control."
"It is also important to say that farmers welcome the controls concerning animal food production."
"It is to be regretted that some people used the debate on food safety to undermine the profession of farming and the role of farmers as guarantors of a quality food supply for citizens."
"We need to be careful as to how we deal with comments concerning food."
"The Dioxin and BSE debates failed to get across the strong message that the quality of European food is the best in the world, and consumers get both quality and value for money."
"Any exceptions to this are condemned outright by European farmers."
"Recent reports concerning the future of CAP are certainly worrying."
"If we are serious about the European model based on family farming, then we must ensure that those who operate within that framework are all guaranteed a decent living."
"Lange report (A5-0406/2001)"
"This document we have just adopted regulates pollutant emissions, particularly from motorcycles."
"Mr President, I am sure that you can hear now the deafening noise caused by large numbers of motorcyclists riding through the streets near Parliament."
"The noise is unbearable and, most importantly, the pollution is not odourless: quite the opposite, it often stinks."
"It is not the effect on our noses which is important but rather the fact that harmful substances are released into the atmosphere."
"Would you not agree, Mr President, if you were a policemen trying to enforce these directives we have adopted, that the motorcycles of those who produce so much noise and pollution while using them should be seized without delay?"
"I would have voted for the motion much more willingly if the directive had included these measures."
"We Swedish Social Democrats voted in favour of the report on the Directive on the reduction of the level of pollutant emissions from two and three-wheel motor vehicles."
"We believe that the recommendation has intrinsic environmental value."
"However, in this explanation of vote, we wish to state that we do not agree with Mr Lange' s desire for a binding emission limit for 2006."
"We believe that the limit should be voluntary until there are improved grounds for a new limit to be set."
"If the limit were to be established now, there would be a risk of emissions from future motorcycles becoming higher than necessary."
"We believe Mr Lange' s proposal to use the test cycle for cars is inappropriate as motorcycles are not driven in the same way as cars."
"They accelerate in a different way and are usually driven at higher speeds."
"Instead, we should wait for the new test cycle currently under development for motorcycles and, until then, have voluntary emission limits."
"Turchi report (A5-0439/2001)"
"Mr President, before I tell you why I voted for the Turchi report, which is on the granting of Community financial assistance in the field of Trans-European Networks, that is to the transport, energy and telecommunications sector, I would like to thank Mr Goodwill, who has joined me in protecting the interests of the pensioner citizens of the whole of Europe, not just Italian pensioners, that is."
"We are back to televisions and television programmes - this certainly is the day for telecommunications!"
"I voted for the motion but I hope that, when we vote on this document in future, in the coming years, economic support will be laid down for television stations which broadcast, in one of our States, programmes made in other States of the European Union."
"We have to get to know each other, Mr President - Italians, British, French, Finnish and so forth - and what better way to do so than to watch programmes made in another State, translated into our own languages of course?"
"I fully agree with the conclusions reached by Mr Turchi."
"I would reiterate the points made by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism with regard to the lack of information on financing provided by national, regional and local bodies and by the private sector for the completion of TEN projects, since 95% of the financing still comes from outside the EU."
"There is also a lack of information on specific investment in modes of transport via EIB loans, the financial instruments for third countries, other public and private programmes and the Structural Funds themselves that is broken down by transport mode."
"Indeed, the Commission only provided information broken down by transport mode for budget heading B5-0700."
"We feel we should also point out that, in future, the Commission should attach to the report a clear, simple table containing dependable, transparent data which can not just be used to monitor the correct use of the amounts already made over but will also improve the scope for planning."
"This is a monitoring procedure which the Commission' s report reserved exclusively for the 14 priority projects established at Essen which, as we know, are not the only ones on the list."
"Finally, I feel I must draw the Commission' s attention to the need to address properly, once again, the issue of Corridor 8 - which does not even feature in the White Paper - and peripheral regions, which are isolated even more by the excessive focus on Trans-European railway lines and the neglect of the air transport crisis."
"Watson report (A5-0396/2001)"
"I voted against this report, Mr President, because it should have been more vehement in its condemnation of demonstrations."
"Demonstrations are legitimate in themselves as a means of displaying one' s opposition to a policy - where this is the case - but they must be always and exclusively peaceful."
"I myself, Mr President, have demonstrated many times against government decisions with which I did not agree."
"What method did I use?"
"I chained myself to the furniture in the Bergamo municipal council building, I chained myself to the furniture in the Bergamo provincial council building and I chained myself to the furniture in the Lombardy regional council building in Italy."
"Who knows, maybe one day in the next two and a half years, I will chain myself to your Presidential bench, Mr President."
"In any case, this is a peaceful means of protest; it does not involve arms or violence, unlike the protests which, I am sad to say, have been taking place for some time now throughout the world, which I condemn, which the Pensioners' Party condemns and which everybody here condemns."
"Should you decide to act on that deplorable idea, you will be freed from your chains, if necessary against your will!"
". (EL) I worry that the European Union is on a slippery slope, with the recent plethora of measures reducing civil liberties."
"Unfortunately, Europe is to acquire an arrest warrant before it acquires a constitution."
"This being the case, the EU-USA extradition agreement as part of the fight against terrorism is particularly worrying."
"Article 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights adopted by the European Union Council in Nice in France on 7 December 2000 does not allow anyone to be sentenced to death."
"This being so, it is unthinkable to cooperate on extradition to the USA, which has the death penalty and where the conditions for a fair trial do not apply following the courts martial or the detention of hundreds of immigrants with no judicial guarantees."
"Even if people are only extradited to the USA if the USA promises that ""the death penalty will not be applied"", the death penalty may be imposed by the court without being enforced."
"In this way, with this agreement with the USA on criminal matters, the European Union is reintroducing the death penalty through the back door."
"And that is a huge step backwards."
"Finally, I should point out that the USA is applying the death penalty en masse in Afghanistan without even any judgements from their own courts."
"This was confirmed both by Defence Secretary Rumsfeld yesterday when he said that we would kill Al Qaeda and in its use of the 15000 pound daisy cutter bomb, which is the most powerful non-nuclear bomb of mass destruction."
"Dismantling the Taliban and Al Qaeda and punishing those responsible for the crime perpetrated on 11 September in order to set an example is one thing and the mass murder of all its members and supporters, which not even the Nazis suffered, is another."
"It is Europe's duty to react."
". (EL)In its own initiative report entitled ""Security at meetings of the European Council and other comparable events"", the European Parliament committee wrongly named the ""Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights..."", has forged another link in the heavy chain which the ruling class intends to use to stem the swollen tide of resistance and opposition to its policies."
"The rapporteur, Mr Watson, suggests how we can become peaceful and legitimate demonstrators, the first requirement being to work together peacefully and avoid any manifestation of violence."
"Ôhe question is, who is guilty of violence and terrorism?"
"In Nice, Gothenburg and, even more so in Genoa, violence was indeed perpetrated, except that the perpetrators were the police and state forces."
"And, more to the point, in both Gothenburg and Genoa, the target of police violence was clearly not the few hot-blooded demonstrators, but the huge crowd of ""peaceful"" demonstrators."
"Then we read that organisers of demonstrations should avoid cooperating with people suspected of carrying out acts of violence."
"It is easy to conclude that, if they do not, they run the risk under the forthcoming terrorism law of being sentenced as terrorists for the crime of supporting terrorist action."
"Our response is that protecting demonstrations from extremist elements, who are often agents provocateurs, is a matter for the mass grass-roots movement itself."
"According to the report, if we want to cross the borders of our country and take part in an international demonstration, we must earn the authorities' trust by convincing them that we intend to demonstrate peacefully in a legitimate demonstration."
"We are extremely worried that soon we will be asked for credentials or to sign a statement."
"It also suggests that we need to agree on a common definition of ""dangerous person and dangerous behaviour"" for all the Member States."
"This proposal refers to articles about two new black lists which Europol is planning to publish, one for ""troublemaking"" demonstrators and one for foreigners."
"This being so, the report's recommendation that there should be no black lists or new databases is pure hypocrisy."
"As far as police violence is concerned, the only thing the report has to say is that a disproportionate use of force should be avoided and it sits firmly on the fence as regards the conduct of the demonstrators and that of the police forces."
"In fact, especially in Genoa, the demonstrators faced unprecedented violence on the part of the police, with illegal charges, hundreds of illegal arrests, dozens of injured and the cold-blooded murder of a young man."
"It is no coincidence that the UN Commission against Torture has called for a report on events in Diaz and Bozaneto jail in Genoa."
"Obviously, the political mouthpieces of the European monopolies know full well that their anti-grass roots policy is going to come up against more and more grass-roots opposition, which is why they are attempting to use repressive measures to terrorise and restrain popular unrest."
"However, history has shown that this sort of action always brings in the opposite results."
"The reasons behind the grass-roots movement are increasing social inequality and the attack on fundamental social rights."
"The longer these reasons apply, the more mass grass-roots resistance and opposition will grow."
"It is for these reasons that the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the Watson report."
"Hazan report (A5-0414/2001)"
"Mr President, thank you for your response to my explanation of vote on chaining myself to the President' s bench."
"I remember, on one occasion, I could not release myself from the chains because I had unwisely thrown the key out of the window, but your comment makes the idea of carrying out such a peaceful form of protest and there being such a peaceful likely conclusion to it more feasible, more probable and more pleasant."
"As regards the Hazan report, which I voted for, I have to say that I particularly welcome the intention it expresses to combat the intolerable level of corruption which persists in all the States of our Europe, but also - and, I would say, in particular, regrettably, in the candidate countries."
"Genuine progress must be made when the chapters are closed with these candidate countries."
"That concludes voting time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.48 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Middle East"
"The next item is the joint debate on the statements made by the Council and the Commission concerning the situation in the Middle East and on the proposal for a recommendation (B5-0747/2001) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on the crisis in the Middle East and the role of the European Union in the region."
"Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, you have the floor."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at the beginning of December, we once again witnessed a tragic series of events in the Middle East. As time passes, there is a growing risk that the situation could spiral out of control."
"The prospect of a serious political dialogue is becoming an increasingly distant possibility. Dialogue however is the only way forward; there is no other credible option."
"The various parties appear to lack the confidence and the political will needed to end this crisis, so opening the way for violence and extremism."
"It is now more important than ever that the parties concerned are offered help in reaching a different way of thinking."
"However, the recent active re-engagement of the United States in the Middle East lead to the expectation of progress towards the resumption of talks."
"Unfortunately, the terrible events of recent days have made this work much more difficult."
"Nevertheless, the United States, the European Union and the other players most directly concerned have no other choice than to reiterate the firm intention of the international community to prevent extremism and terrorism from undermining diplomatic efforts."
"Although the situation in the Middle East is extremely serious, the European Union must not give in."
"Both the Israeli and the Palestinian people have the right to live in peace and security."
"The Members States of the European Union must therefore work indefatigably towards reconciliation."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is therefore the reason why Mr Shimon Peres and Mr Navril Shaath were each invited to meet the Foreign Ministers separately within the framework of the General Affairs Council of 10 December."
"By inviting them, the European Union once again wanted to express its intention to relaunch and continue the political process, and it has therefore used this additional opportunity to prepare the ground for a return to the negotiating table."
"In short, it is of prime importance that the European Union once again focuses on the essential need for a political perspective in order to lend weight to the current security negotiations."
"The European Union published a declaration after the General Affairs Council of 10 December which was mentioned earlier."
"At this juncture, I would like to very briefly repeat the most important elements of this, but at the same time I would like to point out that the text was not shown to either Mr Peres or Mr Shaath before publication."
"In this declaration, the European Union clearly sets out the obligations to which it expects both parties to adhere straight away."
"With regard to the Palestinian authorities: most importantly, the dismantling of the Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorist networks, including the arrest and prosecution of all suspects and a public call in Arabic to cease the armed Intifada."
"With regard to the Israeli government: the withdrawal of its troops and the cessation of all summary executions, the reversal of the area closures and all the restrictions imposed on the Palestinian people, and finally a freeze on the building of new settlements."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this wording clearly demonstrates that the European Union always holds a middle position, siding with neither party. Other external players should follow this example."
"The wording also clearly explains the conditions necessary for restoring a basic trust between the parties, and also the conditions needed for a genuine peace process."
"The European Union is aware of the complex nature of the undertakings that it is calling for the parties to agree to, especially given the current situation on the ground."
"However, these requirements have been established on the basis of a rational assessment of the present differences between the parties, and of the ways of overcoming these in the context of a peace process."
"The High Representative Mr Solana has undertaken another visit to the region on a mandate from the General Affairs Council."
"He will report back on his mission at the European Council at Laeken."
"On this basis, it is thus up to the European Union to continue its work to find the most effective ways of bringing the parties to engage fully in the search for a just and lasting peace."
"In the meantime, we remain convinced that the implementation of the Tenet ceasefire plan and Mitchell Committee recommendations is the only way to re-establish a political process in the short term."
"The plan and recommendations should be implemented without prerequisites or conditions which extremists only use for their own ends. We must not allow extremists to prevent the resumption of negotiations."
"As far as the European Union is concerned, the basis for political negotiations is well known."
"These are Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 and the terms of reference of the Madrid Conference, including the principle of exchanging land for peace and the Oslo Accords."
"Lastly, the political negotiations have two objectives."
"Firstly, the irrevocable right of Israel to exist in peace and security, within its internationally accepted borders, should be fully recognised and reaffirmed. Secondly, a viable and democratic Palestinian state should be established, and the occupation of Palestinian territories should cease."
"The European Union also continues to believe that establishing an impartial monitoring body would be in the best interests of both parties. This could help them to overcome the distrust and obstacles encountered in trying to achieve a definitive settlement."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I know that I do not have to explain that the situation is and remains very serious. I know I do not have to explain how important it is that we remain vigilant and ready to act."
"Along with the United States and other interested parties, we need to continue to evaluate the potential options, including the possibility that the situation will deteriorate."
"The European Union has more than proved its interest and active commitment to seek political solutions, especially in the last few months."
"Of course, the parties themselves bear the principal responsibility, but it is important that the international community reaffirms its willingness to help them back onto the path to peace."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, over the last couple of years I have had the opportunity - perhaps I should say that alas I have had the opportunity - of making all too many statements to this Parliament on the situation in the Middle East."
"It is with regret that I note a dramatic deterioration of the situation in the region despite the tremendous efforts of the international community, in particular the United Nations, the United States, the Russian Federation and the European Union."
"I am dismayed by the fact that more than 1 000 people, Palestinians, Israelis - among them, as we heard this morning, many women and children - have died since September last year."
"I am also dismayed at the fact that we have seen the withering away of the aspirations and the hopes that Israelis and Palestinians have pursued since the peace process began ten years ago."
"We need to focus our efforts on how to prevent the death of the peace process itself."
"Much of what has been achieved with the help of the international community is now at risk."
"We want to see two states living side by side, peaceful and prosperous."
"Today, that prospect seems all too distant."
"The number of deaths keeps increasing and so, less importantly, does the record in physical and economic damage."
"The World Bank has estimated that the Palestinian economy has suffered losses of between USD 155 million and 165 million in physical damage and USD 2.4 billion of gross national income since September last year."
"The number of Palestinians living below the poverty line on less that USD 2 per day will have risen from 600 000 to between 1.2 million and 1.5 million by the end of 2001."
"Even worse, the World Bank projects more than 50% of the population may fall below the poverty line by the end of this year."
"The economic decline and the non-transfer of taxes owed to the Palestinian Authority by Israel have caused a fall in Palestinian revenues from a monthly average of USD 91 million to USD 22 million."
"Palestinians lost more than 100 000 jobs in Israel and about 66 000 jobs in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as a result of Israel's closure policy."
"But the Israeli economy is also suffering, which is not surprising when one considers the extent of economic interchange that was taking place before the current Intifada."
"According to recent forecasts, the year 2001 is going to be one of the worst years since the 1950s for the Israeli economy."
"This is mainly caused by the global economic slowdown but also by the current political security crisis."
"Preliminary figures indicate that one in five Israelis live below the poverty line, absolute numbers are up by 10% compared to last year and the rate of unemployment stood at 9.3% in the third quarter."
"What is the European Union's stance, given this dramatic undermining of political and economic stability in the Middle East?"
"We understand Israel's longing for security."
"We respect the fact that it is the Israeli Government's duty to try to provide safety for its citizens and we also understand Palestinian frustration over the continuous military occupation and the remorseless spread of settlements."
"On Monday, as the Minister has just pointed out, the General Affairs Council discussed these issues with Shimon Peres and Nabil Sha'ath."
"As ever, they were extremely eloquent in what they said."
"The Council's declaration reaffirms Israel's irrevocable right to live in peace and security within internationally recognised borders and the need for the establishment of a viable and democratic Palestinian state and an end to the occupation of the Palestinian territories."
"The way chosen by people like the late Prime Minister Rabin was to find a negotiated solution leading to two states with the 1967 line roughly as their shared border, Jerusalem as capital of both, and a solution to the refugee issue acceptable to both Israelis and Palestinians."
"Unfortunately forces on both the Palestinian and Israeli sides have been working against this goal."
"They have set out quite deliberately to destroy the achievements of the Oslo process."
"It is our collective duty to try to stop them doing so."
"The only way of returning to meaningful negotiations is to embark once and for all on the path laid out in the Mitchell report."
"The Council on Monday strongly encouraged the parties to take the first steps to end this devastating and self-fuelling cycle of violence that we have seen over the last 14 months."
"I confirm our strong call for the parties to implement the Mitchell report without delay."
"It is crucial to apprehend extremists and continue fighting those terrorist groups opposed to the peace process, as the Minister said."
"The Union must continue to press the Palestinian Authority to take concrete steps to arrest and bring to justice those who commit terrorist acts."
"This is why the Council on Monday called clearly for the dismantling of the terrorist networks of Hamas and Jihad."
"And it is equally crucial that Israel withdraws its military forces, ends the extra-judicial killings, and ends the closures and restrictions on Palestinian people, particularly the senseless bombing of property and infrastructure."
"It is difficult to see how the destruction of the Gaza airport, the destruction of an EU-funded forensic laboratory and the destruction of vast areas of arable land can help fight terrorism or increase Israel' s security."
"I would strongly argue the opposite."
"In the World Bank report, they state 'that the main proximate cause of the recession is closure'."
"Removing, or significantly easing closure is the most important requirement if further decline is to be arrested and economic pressure removed from the Palestinian population."
"Continued economic hardship will make people easier prey for extremists."
"We need to persuade Israel that its security will be increased, not hampered, by allowing the Palestinian economy to develop so as to give people a reason to hope for a better future."
"Where in history is there an example of poverty and economic decline leading to greater security and political moderation?"
"Let me add to this an argument put by Henry Siegman - a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York and a distinguished expert on the Middle East - in the article in the International Herald Tribune today, which I strongly recommend to all Members of this House."
"Mr Siegman wrote as follows: 'policies which reinforce the despair of Palestinians by killing their hope for an end to the occupation will inevitably fuel escalating violence'."
"We must not allow ten years of political and financial investment to be wasted."
"The European Union has contributed more than EUR 3 billion to the West Bank and Gaza Strip since 1994."
"Some may say unfairly that the European Union is only a payer and not a player."
"I have heard that remark in this Chamber."
"But what we have done is to provide some grounds for hope - and in recent months to prevent further economic misery and to keep the Palestinian Authority barely alive and in place by providing EUR 108 million in budgetary aid over the last 14 months."
"Some people have criticised us for that, although members of the Israeli Government have explicitly supported these efforts in the past."
"We have worked to maintain the only viable partner in peace that Israel can find and we should continue to support the Palestinian Authority, especially in its fight against terrorism."
"Although the Palestinian Authority has made mistakes and must correct them, the Palestinian Authority is the only structure that can provide stability in the Palestinian territories."
"It is the provider of necessary basic services and in the end the guarantor for a minimum of security for both the Palestinians and the Israelis."
"If the Palestinian Authority is disabled, we will face a situation of anarchy where Hamas and Jihad will no doubt gather increasing support and local extremist committees will compete in an escalation of violence."
"It is utterly absurd to suggest that by doing this we are funding terrorists."
"Our funding actually helps to strengthen the secular administration against the real terrorist organisations."
"We have put a considerable number of safeguards in place that allow us to monitor the use of our funds."
"The most important of these is the regular checking and reporting by the International Monetary Fund on the austerity budget agreed by the Palestinian Authority."
"I want to make this point very strongly."
"The European Union has done more than anyone else to promote elections, the fight against corruption, and the rule of law in the Palestinian territories."
"There is much further to go."
"But how do we best promote decency, moderation and pluralism?"
"By allowing public services in the Palestinian territories to collapse or by trying to keep them going against the odds and by trying to promote reform?"
"The alternative to the Palestinian Authority is Palestinian anarchy."
"However long and difficult the road, we should remain committed to supporting moderates, whoever they are and while - thank God - they still exist, on both sides of this tragic feud."
"Some commentators have referred to the problems in the Middle East as one of the root causes of terrorism - or they have pointed out that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has been and is abused as a cheap excuse for violence or as a wicked justification for committing evil criminal acts."
"The international community needs to take action now to help resolve this potentially explosive situation."
"The risk of wider regional spillover is very real and we must use every means to prevent a return to the time when the Palestinian cause was pursued largely through terrorism."
"One final point. Today the focus is mainly on Afghanistan."
"But increasingly it will shift to the Middle East."
"If we are to solve the problems there, it is no good dwelling in the past, exchanging half-truths, casting blame, arguing about what Mr Arafat should have done at Camp David or what Mr Sharon should not have done on the Holy Mount."
"What is past is past."
"Peace will only come if there is a real and brave and lasting commitment to achieving it, looking ahead to a brighter future, ignoring those who try to derail the whole process through terrorist acts of violence and by disproportionate military responses."
"That is the way progress was made in the past, for example by Mr Rabin."
"It must be the path that we Europeans advocate for the future."
"Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I must say that these two speeches and also the Council's decision this week demonstrate how seriously we have to approach this problem, and that the European Union, both in the observations that have been made here, and also in this resolution, has sent a clear signal as to what is to be supported."
"We in Parliament would like our recommendation to contribute to the European Union's ability to be an intermediary in this region, finding an opportunity to achieve a peaceful solution."
"If I might put it in cautious terms, we will assuredly be able to achieve a balanced text within the framework of the resolution, that is, during tomorrow's procedure."
"There is no need for me to analyse the situation now, and I wish to support what Chris Patten said - that there is no point whatever in looking for questions of guilt among the issues currently facing us. What we do know is that the situation has got worse since Arafat refused to give way at Camp David and Sharon went to the Temple Mount."
"Moreover, 11 September did not contribute to a more reflective mood. Instead, things have worsened since then, and what is now at stake is the breaking of the cycle of violence."
"There comes a point where it no longer makes sense to ask who is guilty and who innocent, because the cycle of violence no longer has a discernible beginning or end."
"As Europeans, we not only have a great interest in peace being genuinely established in this region, but it is in our most fundamental interest, as the whole issue of the Mediterranean and the issue of terrorism defy solution unless the conflict in the Middle East is resolved."
"I am not saying that the Middle East conflict is at the root of these issues, but it serves as an excuse for many of the things that cause us grave concern, and it is for this reason that the resolution of this problem in our neighbourhood is in our own fundamental interest."
"Having, as Chris Patten rightly said, given this amount of financial help to date, we therefore want to take this situation as our starting point in joining the United States in playing an active political role in this region."
"It is clear that we are working with two basic presuppositions."
"As far as the first is concerned, it is absolutely clear that Israel's citizens must be able to live within frontiers that are secure and recognised."
"That is an absolute requirement."
"It is not even up for discussion, as Israelis have a right to it for reasons which I, as a German, do not need to justify in detail, and which are obvious."
"The second point is that the Palestinian people, too, must be able to look forward to a state of their own in which they can shape their own future."
"What this means is that we must make an attempt at progressive removal of the factors that work against this."
"Settlements and occupation do not help the Palestinians to develop in an appropriate way."
"Terrorism on the part of the Palestinians does not contribute to a feeling of security in Israel and to Israeli withdrawal."
"I do think we can now clearly see that Arafat is, for this reason, in a position to act against Hamas and Islamic Jihad."
"It would, then, have made sense for him to do so at an earlier stage, but if it is to be done now, that should be enough, and combating them with all vigour should be seen as a precondition, just as much as Israel' s refraining from hampering subsequent development by riddling the infrastructure in Palestine with bullet holes."
"It must, though, be clear to us in exactly the same way that the return of the refugees must not be used as a means towards imperilling the existence of the State of Israel."
"The Arab states must also see that keeping people in camps is not the right way either."
"With our financial support, the whole of the Arab world must help young people to come out of the camps and to have enough of a chance to grow up."
"The Council and the Commission are well aware that Parliament is ready to contribute financially, too, to significant solutions, if it would help to achieve peaceful development."
"We believe that our position on the guaranteeing of human rights must be seen in the right context, both by the Palestinian Authority and in the State of Israel."
"We have seen three winners of the Sakharov Prize here today - a Muslim, a Jewish woman and a Christian, thus representing the three monotheistic religions."
"This, I believe, is where the starting point is to be found."
"These three religions, which have so overwhelmingly given the world its shape over the past millennia, must find in themselves the strength to achieve a peaceful solution in that centre which was their source, so that people adhering to these three faiths may be able to live together in the city that is holy to them all, Jerusalem."
"I believe that this is what our actions must accomplish."
"I believe this to be one of the tasks for us in our day, perhaps the central one."
"Madam President, from the start of this legislature, the European Parliament, through its various bodies, has been working extremely hard to achieve peace in this region, making its contribution, of both a political and an economic nature, through the Union budgets."
"As Chairman of the Delegation for relations with Israel, it has been a privilege to share initiatives and trips with Mrs Morgantini, the Chairperson of the Delegation for relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council."
"Although we have certainly not always shared the same point of view, I am convinced that we have always shared the same good intentions."
"We have travelled together with Mrs Fontaine, the President of this House, and last Monday, as has already been mentioned, we received Mr Avram Burg, President of the Israeli Parliament and Mr Abu Ala, President of the Palestinian Legislative Council."
"We had lunch with this year' s winners of the Sakharov prize this very afternoon - as Mr Brok has just mentioned - a prize whose award is intended to symbolise and be understood as an expression of the European Parliament' s good intentions."
"We are now participating in this debate on a recommendation from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"I think that, right now, for the first time, we are facing a situation where no reason can be found to be optimistic and for this very reason, I think that the Council recommendation is most appropriate and useful, above all in its final version which the Groups agreed on this morning and which I am sure we will vote for, because the only thing left is intercession, even international intervention, without which we would probably be facing a situation of all-out war."
"Faced with today' s tragic circumstances, which are worsened by the international crisis, I firmly believe that the various parliamentary Groups should put our party political differences to one side, which would make our contribution, and that of the representatives of the European Union in this region, all the more effective."
"The situation we are experiencing is not akin to some kind of movie with good guys and bad guys and for this reason, and to maintain credibility, we need to call on the Israeli Government to stop its bombings, and the Palestinian Authority to prosecute without exception those extremists who are at the root of this terrorism which, under no circumstances, can be justified."
"At times such as these, political leaders cannot withdraw. They must stand up, for example, against the hatred of Israeli youth who call on the streets for the bombing of the Palestinian people in response to the terrorist attacks, and also stand up against this horrendous image of Palestinian children who gleefully celebrate the death of numerous innocent Israeli citizens in Jerusalem or Haifa."
"What exactly is being taught to these youngsters in schools?"
"And if the current Israeli and Palestinian leaders are not capable of putting a stop to this, I am sure that sooner or later their peoples will punish them with their contempt."
"Madam President, whilst we are talking here today in this House, in the Middle East, Israeli tanks are once again occupying the supposedly autonomous Palestinian territories."
"The Israeli army continues to carry out extrajudicial executions and its planes are still bombing Palestinian police - not army - headquarters, a police force that has no freedom of movement but which has been asked to dismantle terrorist networks and to detain all suspects."
"I am not ignoring the fact that the Council, and especially the High Representative, Mr Javier Solana, are redoubling their efforts to achieve some kind of tangible result."
"I wonder whether the declaration made by the Council last Monday will contribute to this in any way."
"In any case, I would like to refer to this declaration."
"In it, the Union, as is well known, insists, in the following order: firstly, that the Palestinian Authority dismantle the terrorist networks, detain all suspects and make a public call for the end of the Intifada."
"Next, in second place, that the Israeli Government withdraw its armed forces, put an end to the extrajudicial executions and also to the blockades and restrictions that oppress the Palestinian people, and that they put an end to the building of settlements."
"I applaud this declaration, like Prime Minister Sharon, who stated that this is the first time such a demand in the fight against terrorism has been addressed in such a clear and unambiguous fashion to Arafat by the Union."
"Obviously, Sharon' s satisfaction refers solely to the EU' s demands to the Palestinian Authority."
"There was no declaration from Sharon on the Council' s demand that Israel end its violence."
"The Israeli Minister for Foreign Affairs, Shimon Peres, also liked the declaration."
"He said that he thought it was 'a responsible European stance' , which was a more positive statement than that given by Sharon, but he went on to state that the Israeli military action is necessary."
"He states that this action - which the EU calls for an end to - is necessary to prevent attacks being made on Israeli citizens, and added that 'it is very easy to give advice to countries whose problems are very different from your own' ."
"It appears that the EU' s attitude is responsible if it gives advice to the Palestinian Authority, but this is not the case if it tries to advise the Israeli Government."
"In my humble opinion, it is probably this type of statement that prompted Louis Michel to say that the EU did not have Israel' s interests in mind when it made such a declaration."
"I am aware of this, but the question remains that there continues to be a situation where there is an occupier and the occupied, and the occupier wants to continue playing the game by its own rules, whilst the second - the occupied - is asking for a straightforward end to the occupation, and, with this, peace."
"The Council is also aware of this, and it has always hoped to have, like this Parliament, greater influence in the peace process."
"I think that it also knows that this cannot simply be requested, it has to be worked for and achieved."
"Finally, I would like to say that I expect - and I am sure of this - that this recent mission led by the High Representative and the possible decisions to be made at Laeken will take us in this direction."
"Madam President, I think it would be difficult for myself and the other speakers to find words more appropriate or of more use than those used today by the winners of the Sakharov prize, especially Mrs Peled-Elhanan and Mr Ghazzawi."
"But we must go on."
"Let us follow their example."
"I think that the Groups should congratulate ourselves on the agreement reached with regard to the recommendation, but it should be of concern to us that, even though we are not part of the conflict, it should have cost us more than what is reasonable to reach it."
"During the discussion, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party attempted to give priority to both the agreement and a balanced position."
"However, I think there can be no doubt that our greatest demand is to be efficient, given that our purpose here is not to be conflict analysts, but to be politicians with responsibilities within the framework of the European Union."
"From this point of view, I think that the clear position that has been taken with regard to the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli Government is logical and in line with the position of the Council."
"However, while insisting on this required level of efficiency, I would like to associate myself with the opinions already expressed by Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck and Commissioner Patten, that there is much need for international action, that the conflict must stop and that the basic approach well established by the Mitchell report must be followed."
"In this respect, I would say that it is not sufficient to remain observers and apply pressure."
"In a conflict there needs to be strong advocates."
"The European Union, the United States, and, obviously, the UN and Russia, are all strong advocates, and it would be difficult to name another moment in history when it has been possible for them to act together in a such an efficient and balanced way."
"However, I believe, without a doubt, that this should be our priority: to be able to act as forceful and powerful advocates, if this is a possibility for all of those involved, for the gravity of this conflict requires this."
"Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, it is a somewhat peculiar experience to be talking about the Middle East here a few hours after the impressive and emotional presentation of the Sakharov Prize to Mrs Peled and Mr Ghazzawi."
"But it is just that - the existence of wise people on both sides of the line who have managed to remain tolerant under tragic personal circumstances - it is precisely the existence of people of this kind that makes it meaningful and necessary for us to continue to search for a solution to a problem that at first glance seems so hopeless."
"It is to the cynics in this room, and particularly those outside Parliament, that I say: yes, the European Union has its own special role to play."
"We will not succeed without the Americans, but neither will we succeed with the Americans alone."
"What does that mean from my point of view?"
"It means that the European Union must be critical of both sides; critical towards Israel with regard to her reoccupation of Palestinian areas, the erection of blockades and extrajudicial executions."
"On the other hand, however - and let there be no misunderstanding on this point - critical of the Palestinian authorities who could have done more and must do more in the future to combat terrorist attacks and dismantle networks."
"However, whilst we wish to keep a balance, let us not forget that this is not a struggle between two equal parties."
"It is the State of Israel that bears prime responsibility for the current conflicts and their resolution."
"This means that we must exert as much pressure as possible on Israel to find a solution."
"This means exerting pressure in order to prevent them from finding ways out and excuses for not starting negotiations when they could in fact be taking place."
"This also means exerting pressure on Israel to distance herself from the kind of thinking which, for example, equates Arafat with Bin Laden."
"This is a highly dangerous comparison which will only serve to make it extremely difficult for a solution to be found."
"We also owe it to the winners of the Sakharov Prize to do all we can to keep their hope alive."
"Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, I had just returned from a memorable trip to the Palestinian territories and Israel when I heard the news of the terrible carnage in Jerusalem, followed by a second attack in Haifa."
"I was horrified by these deliberate and cruel acts of murder and I immediately expressed my deepest sympathy to the families of the victims."
"I stressed that no cause can in any way justify the killing of innocent people."
"Those responsible must be arrested, tried and punished."
"You do not have to be a genius to understand that these latest crimes are disastrous for the Palestinian Authority."
"During my visit to the region I was able to appreciate the difficulty in containing the exasperation of the people, especially those living in the refugee camps, in the face of the daily violent attacks by the occupying forces, and especially after the irresponsible assassinations of the long-established leaders of the fundamentalist groups."
"I thought to myself, if the Israeli Government has decided to take revenge for the victims of attacks in its own way, the Palestinian Authority' s remaining small margin for manoeuvre will be greatly reduced."
"It would then become almost impossible to break the terrible vicious circle of humiliations, attacks, reprisals and revenge which the conflict has been in since the election of Ariel Sharon."
"Now this has all come true, and how terribly!"
"Israel has wreaked revenge on the fundamentalists in a barrage of fire targeting Arafat."
"The Palestinian police force, charged with arresting Hamas and Islamic Jihad activists, has itself been bombarded."
"International Human Rights Day was marked in Hebron by the intolerable image of two children aged three and 13 blown apart by an Israeli missile that missed its suspect target."
"Who can now doubt Ariel Sharon' s desire to destroy the Palestinian Authority and all that remains of the Oslo process?"
"What is Europe saying in the face of the very real danger of the total annihilation of the Palestinian nation and the overwhelming tidal wave of the fundamentalist reaction that would follow?"
"Do we condemn Sharon' s policy of adopting the worst possible line?"
"Are we encouraging those courageous people in Israel who are calling for the resumption of negotiations?"
"Are we congratulating the Palestinian Authority on its first arrests of fundamentalist activists, at some risk?"
"Do we deplore the death of Palestinian civilians as much as we deplore the death of Israeli civilians?"
"Do we at least repeat our long-standing call for international observers to be sent to the region?"
"However unbelievable it may seem, none of the points I have mentioned appear in the European Union' s press release."
"On the contrary, the European Union has sent a message to the Palestinian Authority, whilst the press has highlighted the unprecedented severity of its tone."
"Now the only hope rests on strong political intervention from the international community. At this time, it would be a tragedy if Europe were to turn a blind eye to the situation, and do nothing to stop George Bush from giving the green light to Ariel Sharon."
"I think of the men and women of Israel and Palestine, who, like our Sakharov prize-winners Mrs Peled-Elhanan and Mr Ghazzawi, are counting on us to support their resistance, their hopes and their work towards a just peace."
"Their struggle must remind us of our responsibilities."
"Madam President, the day before yesterday the Council took a very clear position on the escalation of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict."
"The fact is that the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the EU Member States are placing political responsibility for the ongoing Palestinian suicide attacks on Israeli citizens where it belongs: with the Palestinian Authority."
"Because of this, they demanded three things of the Palestinian Authority: the dismantling of the Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorist networks, the arrest and prosecution of all persons suspected of terrorist activities, and a public announcement in Arabic of the end of the Intifada, the Palestinian uprising."
"Regrettably enough, I cannot consistently trace the Council' s political clarity with regard to Palestinian terrorism back to the recommendations of this Parliament."
"I am therefore standing by my Amendment No 6 even after the coordinators' consultation this morning. The linking of support for the Palestinian Authority with the demands of the Council."
"This amendment meshes with the spirit of the compromises that resulted from this consultation."
"I therefore ask my colleagues to support this vote by roll call."
"Madam President, if this Parliament does not clearly follow the same political line as the Council with regard to the insidious spread of Palestinian terror, the evil forces of 11 September will capitalise on this, because they are really not interested in what the European Parliament expressly states in this recommendation: a safe Jewish state in the Middle East."
"Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are continuing to conduct an anti-Israeli campaign in the style of Picasso' s Guernica, with children' s bodies, usually, elsewhere, the victims of the US, here victims of the Israelis."
"Commissioner Patten and we ourselves, with this draft motion, are rushing to provide the Palestinians, at last, with what they need, with what the Palestinian men and women - the Arabs, moreover, in general - and the victims of the dictatorships in the Arab world are certainly demanding."
"We are making promises to Mr Arafat and we are agreeing to fight, but for what?"
"To give them rights?"
"To give them what all the human rights declarations in the world, including the European declarations, fail to recognise as an individual right?"
"So you want to give them a national State."
"This is precisely what they need: another Syrian or Yemeni national State, a State of whatever kind; they need a national State."
"Commissioner Patten, maybe this is what we need in Italy too to solve our problems; maybe this is what you need in Great Britain to solve yours, would you not say?"
"The illusion of possible national independence affects Israel too."
"You wanted a Yugoslav national entity which would be neutral towards both parties."
"Our pleas for democracy and Europe went unheeded."
"Do not take sides. Be good Samaritans."
"Mrs Morgantini is probably all set to call upon the Israeli soldiers to desert, as, on Italian television broadcast throughout the world, she urged the US and British soldiers to desert in the Afghanistan war."
"You are the just like the pacifists and communists of 1938 who supported nazism and urged the allies and the French to desert in that war."
"Well then, if this is what you are going to continue to propose, I feel that it is our duty to point out that the Palestinians and all the citizens in the world - but the Palestinians, in particular - have the right to say ""no"" , as do we on their behalf, to this illusion."
"If there were three States - Jordan, Palestine and Israel - the State of Jordan would go immediately, and there would immediately be attempts to use Palestine to eliminate this oasis of democracy between Israel and Palestine representing a third of the democracy in the Middle East."
"An emphatic 'no' to this document, which places a condition on continuing our cooperation with Israel and places no condition on our supporting Yasser Arafat."
"Well then: this Europe, this Palestine and this Arab world are, quite frankly, not ours."
"We will vote accordingly."
"Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, this morning we have all been moved by the testimony of Mrs Peled-Elhanan, who made this Chamber echo to the cries of child victims and the voices of mothers in mourning for them. Because these women have given life, they are now working to prevent further deaths as men continue the senseless killing."
"We have also listened to Mr Ghazzawi' s appeal for the dream of peace. Our founding fathers shared this dream and it remains the cornerstone of the European Union."
"In listening to Mrs Peled-Elhanan and Mr Ghazzawi, painful memories of past events in the Balkans came back to me. Political and military leaders ignored the fact that the majority of their people wanted peace."
"They fought from intransigent positions, the result of their deep-rooted distrust of their enemies. In order to allay this distrust, the international community had to take resolute action."
"This led to the signing of the Dayton agreement, which eventually led to a lasting cease-fire, guaranteed by the deployment of troops. This force has not yet achieved its aim, but Mr Wurtz, it has succeeded in finally breaking the vicious circle of fear, violence and hate."
"I think that the international community must today display the same resolve and commitment in response to the desire for peace of the majority of Israelis and Palestinians."
"The European Union should lead this action."
"I therefore welcome the statement made by the Council the day before yesterday explaining the impartial position of the European Union. The statement was remarkably strong and no less remarkably concise."
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I am delighted to hear the European Union express its determination not to give in to a slide towards increasingly indiscriminate violence."
"In the same spirit, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has worked on the recommendation drawn up by our chairman Elmar Brok. This will be submitted to our fellow members for approval."
"I hope that Israeli and Palestinian political and military leaders will finally understand that we are only aiming to help them restart the peace process. They have already agreed on the basis of this peace process, but they do not want to implement it because both sides mistrust each other."
"We implore them at least to trust the international community to guarantee the implementation of the peace process with the utmost impartiality."
"We can and must undertake to do this."
"Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, eight years after the Oslo accords and 15 months after the start of the second Intifada, the situation in the Middle East in December 2001 is disastrous."
"Mr Sharon has not been able to keep his electoral promises regarding improving the security of Israel and its population."
"The leader of the Palestinian Authority is weakened, surrounded and besieged in territories which are autonomous in name only."
"The Palestinian civilians are more subjugated than ever before and do not have any future prospects."
"The international community wants peace. It is now working towards an intermediary objective, but this is unattainable."
"The objective is the plan named after the American Senator Mr Mitchell. The Mitchell Plan is well intentioned in that its primary aim is to put an end to the killing."
"It is however misconceived. Every mini-agreement is reached on such a restricted basis that they remain at the mercy of the next suicide attack and then have to be re-established all over again."
"Even supposing that the preconditions required by Mr Sharon are satisfied, and even supposing that the Mitchell Plan is implemented in full and with great difficulty, this will in no way address the fundamental causes of the conflict. Nor will the deep-seated personal hatred of Mr Sharon for Mr Arafat disappear as if by magic."
"The fundamental causes of the conflict are to be found in the continuing occupation of the Palestinian and Syrian territories seized by Israel during the 1967 war. According to the winner of the Sakharov prize, Mrs Peled-Elhanan, who spoke to us this morning, this occupation is cruel."
"Only when the army of occupation has withdrawn from all of these territories, including East Jerusalem, as the United Nations' resolutions demand, will the conditions for a stable and lasting peace be created."
"This is why the European Union should speak out in support of an immediate and definitive agreement to establish secure and internationally recognised borders. These would be protected if necessary by an international force for an interim period."
"With the support of the European Union, all the countries of the region would then be able to embark upon the reconciliation and reconstruction process from new foundations."
"Israel should withdraw to its 1967 international borders, and the Arab world must give its formal and binding recognition of these."
"This is the overall objective that the Council should pursue determinedly on the world stage."
"If we act in this way on the issue of Middle East, we will fulfil the role everyone wants us to take on."
"What is required today is not an equidistant role but a fair role."
"Madam President, the war in the Middle East has been going on for over a year now."
"The Intifada and the Israeli reprisals continue, and the number of dead on both sides is growing. We feel impotent, concerned and extremely angry."
"The extent of our anger is a measure of the hope we felt last year when the Middle East was within a whisker of a peace agreement."
"We can blame Ariel Sharon for his policy of 'an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth' ."
"However Mr Sharon was not in power when Ehud Barak, Shlomo Ben Ami and Bill Clinton tried to persuade Yasser Arafat to sign a peace agreement which would have been historic."
"That said, the past is the past, as Commissioner Patten so rightly said."
"We still want to believe that there is light at the end of the tunnel, to paraphrase the words of the Belgian Presidency of the European Union."
"We want to believe that the unprecedented appeal the European Union sent on Monday will be noted. Contrary to what was previously said in the House, this appeal was sent to both parties."
"It presents Israel with her responsibilities, but for the first time the European Union makes an equally clear appeal to Mr Arafat to dismantle the Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorist networks."
"There may be light in that yesterday Israel recognised that the Palestinian Authority had, for the first time, begun to take serious action to combat fundamentalists."
"There is also light in that Mr Arafat has admitted, quite objectively, that the European Union' s appeal is fair."
"At lunchtime today, the Israeli Nurit Peled-Elhanan, winner of the Sakharov Prize 2001, expressed the hope that the voices of the mothers of the Middle East would drown out the voices of those calling for arms."
"We also hope and want to believe that European Union' s voice will ring out loud and clear and help re-establish a spirit of hope."
"Madam President, I am becoming more and more inclined just to stand back and watch us and watch you in silence."
"I am tired, so tired of these repeated debates where it is so difficult to make progress: it would, however, be a silence in which you could hear the muffled voices of those who have been killed, who are calling for peace and justice, as Izzat Ghazzawi and Nurit Peled said this morning; it would be a silence which tells the consciences of all men and women that there can only be peace in Palestine and Israel if the Palestinian people is allowed to exercise the right to live in its own State, existing alongside the State of Israel, in mutual security."
"We must make this peace possible and not just by providing economic aid."
"We see it every day."
"What we build and our citizens pay for is destroyed by shells and bulldozers: from the airport to the port; even the anti-terrorism laboratory was destroyed the day before yesterday."
"I support the positions of Commissioner Patten and the Minister, but there can be no economic development if there is no release from Israeli military occupation."
"Europe is resolutely taking this line."
"A decision must be taken, even a unilateral decision, to establish international protection for the civilian population."
"There is no equality between occupied and occupier."
"We must take a balanced approach but not be afraid to make political choices."
"For peace to be achieved we need clear measures, for our benefit and for the benefit of both Israelis and Palestinians."
"Madam President, my group is deeply shocked by the violence that has once again flared up in the Middle East."
"The people of Israel live in grief, fear and anger, but they at least have political freedom, elections, economic development and the hope of a better future."
"It is in Israel' s interest that the Palestinians also have hope for the future."
"People who have hope have something to lose."
"Without hope, there will never be the willingness to enter into compromises."
"How can people be expected to hope as long as settlements are being built in their back yards, as long as collective punishments are being meted out for the outrages of the few, and as long as Europe does not take a stand against the gross violations of international law?"
"It is a delusion that more force and more suppression will make the Palestinians more compliant."
"There should be an international peace-keeping force monitoring the implementation of the Mitchell Agreement so that a start can be made with the immediate withdrawal from occupied territories and the immediate dismantling of all settlements."
"Finally, I would like to ask the Commission a question."
"European projects have been destroyed in Israeli attacks;"
"Commissioner Patten himself has already mentioned the forensic laboratory."
"How extensive is the damage, and can Commissioner Patten promise that the Commission will recover the loss from Israel?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I do not really have much to add to what has been said during this debate, except to emphasise that the decisions of the Council, also in the light of what Commissioner Patten has said, are entirely focused on the future, and therefore contain a number of urgent reminders in respect of the two main parties involved, that is to say Israel on the one hand and the Palestinian Authority on the other, and are not intended to be a balanced and reasonable way of commemorating, mourning, and perhaps honouring the victims on both sides."
"The violence is terrible. So indeed is the spiral of violence."
"It seemed to us that an urgent call to action was required and that this urgent call needed to be addressed both to the Palestinian Authority and to Israel."
"However, the operative part of the conclusions contains a plea for an early meeting at which the European Union, the United States, Russia, the Palestinian Authority and Israel sit down at the table to try to find a way out of the spiral of violence and extremism. That is our most fervent hope."
"I do not think that it is helpful to try to accuse the Council of favouring one side over the other. That is not the case."
"We are in favour of peace, and we are trying to do our level best to achieve it."
"That is what this presidency is doing; the next one will undoubtedly also be doing so, and we can definitely use all your support."
"Mr President, I will first of all respond to the characteristically direct question from Mrs van der Laan."
"We have done a calculation of the damage so far to our projects."
"There are nine projects in all which have been damaged in one way or another."
"The very approximate loss estimation is EUR 2.289 million with, for example, EUR 60 000 also lost with the bombing of the forensic laboratory which we had provided."
"There was also some support from the Israeli Government to try to help the Palestinian security forces."
"Those figures are extremely approximate."
"If you think of the investment that has gone from Europe to the West Bank and Gaza over the years to try to establish decent services, to try to help in the creation of a potential viable state, the loss is incalculable."
"That is the chartered accountant's balance sheet so far and I hope it does not get any worse."
"Perhaps I can just add one or two points in relation to the debate."
"The honourable Member, Mr Poos, who does not use words lightly - he knows about these matters very well - described the situation as catastrophic and that is not too strong a word."
"My honourable and gallant friend General Morillon reminded us of the consequences in the Balkans of intransigence."
"Mr Lagendijk and Mrs Morgantini and others spoke about the moving speeches that we had heard this morning about the sacrifice of the next generation because the present generation cannot find a way of living peacefully together."
"I suppose that when people can behave with that extraordinary resilience and courage and moderation, there is still some hope for the region."
"My friend, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr Brok, has said that the aim was that the three great religions that we saw represented here this morning should be able to live one day in the holy city in peace together which, in the words of an English poet, is ""a consummation devoutly to be wished""."
"I would just say one thing to Mr Belder - and I say it very gently and not critically because people are entitled to their own passions - and that is that I am not sure I share his view of balance."
"I will tell you what my idea of balance is."
"On Monday of this week a number of Palestinian and Israeli parliamentarians and intellectuals met at the Qalandia checkpoint to emphasise ""the urgent need to continue dialogue between the two sides"", even when this is the only venue where it is possible to do so."
"They argued that these meetings are especially important in the light of the escalation of violence through the past week which they said is threatening to drag their whole region into war."
"If an immediate halt to the current cycle of violence is not achieved, the situation may spiral out of control, perhaps with irreversible consequences."
"A group, including Yossi Beilin, the former Minister for Justice and one of the architects of the Oslo process, and Yasser Abed Rabbo, the Minister of Information and Culture in Palestine, argued that ending the current crisis entails the immediate abandonment of violence as a political tool and the unconditional implementation of the Tenet work plan and Mitchell report."
"This requires immediate steps, including prevention and punishment of terrorist acts, the lifting of the closure on and withdrawal from the Palestinian areas and putting a stop to the policy of assassinations."
"Settlement activity - they argued - is not compatible with an honest move to de-escalation and the pursuit of peace."
"It must be halted."
"Incitement in all its forms, both official and unofficial, cannot coexist with rebuilding a climate of trust and non-violence."
"It must be ended."
"We clearly state that under no circumstances should the Palestinian Authority or its presidency be harmed or targeted if a way out of this crisis is to be found."
"I will tell you what I believe the European Union should be doing."
"As long as there are any moderates on the two sides - in Israel and the Palestinian Authority - we should be there supporting them, supporting their courage, toleration and decency."
"That is a balanced European Union policy."
"I would say ""Hosanna"", in suitably biblical form, to all the sentiments expressed in that joint statement."
"I pray to God that in three, six or nine months' time there are still some moderates left with the bravery and courage to offer a better prospect for the future of the region."
"Many thanks, Commissioner, for your very moving appeal in this difficult situation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"Mr President, I would like to send my greetings to a group of young people, who have not only the modest merit of coming from a town - Pontremoli, in the Lunigiana region - which is particularly dear to my heart and of which I am Mayor, but who I see as representative of the many young people who are looking to Europe."
"They have had their eighteenth birthdays this year, 2001, which is the year which has seen the most extreme world violence, but it is also the year in which many of the world' s young people have gained the ability to exercise their full rights and responsibilities in coming of age."
"I hope that this mediation operation, this firm moral message from Europe, will be a constructive witness for peace in the future for the young people of Europe and all the young people of the world."
"Mr Mayor, that may well not have been quite on the agenda, but there is a saying from the Bible, to the effect that the mouth speaks out of the abundance of the heart. In that sense, I too can to some extent understand your intervention."
"Access to documents as implemented by Council and Commission"
"The next items on the agenda are the declarations by the Council and the Commission on access to documents as implemented by Council and Commission."
"Whereas Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, the Minister, had earlier spoken at the end of a debate, she now has the opportunity and the pleasure of speaking on this subject at the beginning of this one, and we have the honour of hearing her."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the presidency of the Council gave you a commitment, through my good offices, to take the necessary provisions to keep to the deadline of 3 December 2001 for the implementation of the European Parliament and Council regulation of 30 May 2001 concerning public access to the documents of the European Parliament, Council and the Commission."
"I am pleased to announce that the Council has kept to this deadline. It took the decision to modify its own internal regulations on 29 November this year."
"This decision was published in the Official Journal of 30 November and came into force on 3 December, that is to say the same day when the regulation I referred to came into effect. It brings the provisions of the internal acts of the Council on access to documents together into a single instrument."
"It also contains new provisions on the implementation of the regulation. In accordance with Article 2 of the decision, certain other acts have been repealed."
"These are as follows. Firstly, the Council decision of 20 December 1993 on public access to Council documents, last modified by a decision of 14 August 2000."
"Secondly, a Council decision of 6 December 1999 concerning improving information on Council work and the public register of Council documents. Lastly, the Council decision of 9 April this year on the public communication of certain categories of Council documents."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the process concerning the right to access to documents that started with the Treaty of Amsterdam is being cast in a legal framework in this way."
"However, a number of further provisions still need to be established."
"The discussions amongst the institutions about the establishment of an interinstitutional committee that will examine what the best practices are, handle any disputes and discuss future developments relating to public access to documents in accordance with Article 15 of the regulation, are still ongoing."
"The Council is of the opinion that this committee must be put together at the level of the secretaries-general of the three institutions concerned, and it must be able to submit questions of a general or political nature or relating to matters of principle to the chairmen of the three institutions."
"As a result of the recent informal political trialogue between the Presidents of Parliament, the Council and the Commission of 28 November, the Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs de Palacio, formulated an interesting proposal as a solution to the problem of the level of representation within this interinstitutional committee."
"Her proposal was to allow this committee to meet at secretary-general level by way of an authorisation - par délégation in French - from their political bosses."
"I find this concept very interesting, and I told my fellow Presidents of Parliament and the Commission at the time that I would put this idea to the Council bodies for evaluation."
"May I just explain what it is about, because this discussion between the Council and Parliament on the matter of the level at which discussions should take place seems rather parochial."
"The Council is worried that the presidents of Parliament, the Council and the Commission would have to act as a kind of appeal court, as it were, if it were to be decided at Secretary-General level that access to a document cannot be granted."
"We believe that this is not the kind of role that these presidents should play."
"They must not become a kind of appeal court; on the contrary, they must focus on broad issues, general questions, principles and the like. And that is what concerns us."
"It is not about the fact that the Council does not want this interinstitutional committee; it is about making sure that we do not create a court of appeal that is approached quasi-systematically, because we do not think that that will be to anyone' s benefit."
"There are other bodies that can be enlisted for this purpose, and this is therefore at the heart of the discussion."
"I thought that the suggestion by Mrs de Palacio, Vice-President of the Commission, offered a way out. For if the secretaries-general of the three institutions meet on the basis of an authority from their presidents, they will then have a mandate and in specific cases will then have to take decisions themselves concerning access to a document."
"I am telling you this to clearly explain where the problem lies as far as the Council is concerned."
"I hope that my fellow Council members will also find Mrs de Palacio' s procedure positive and that we will be able to solve the problem in this way and get the interinstitutional committee off the ground."
"I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that Article 11, Paragraph 2 of the Regulation gives 3 June 2002 as the last date by which the document registers must be operational."
"How far have we got in this regard?"
"As you know, the Council' s document register has been available to the public since 1 January 1999."
"This register contains all the documents that have been put before the Council or the preparatory bodies and which either serve as the basis for consultations, or have a definite influence on the decision-making process, or give an indication of the situation in certain files."
"In November of this year, this register contained references to more than 250 000 Council documents in all our official languages, and it provides access to the contents of more than 50 000 documents."
"The register therefore seems to be an effective and reliable instrument with which the institutions' documents can be identified and queried."
"Since the register has been operational, there has understandably been a significant increase in the demand for documents, most of which have in fact been available in the register."
"The number of consultations of the register is continuing to increase."
"In 1999, more than 70 000 hits resulting in about 600 000 requests were registered - and by this we mean screens consulted or clicked on."
"In 2000 the number of hits and requests increased to 160 000 and 1 260 000 respectively."
"This trend is continuing, and we have already had 130 000 visits and more than 1 million screens consulted in the first six months of 2001."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as regards measures to ensure the public is made aware of the rights they have under the regulation, the three institutions concerned are at present examining the various, specific measures to be taken, such as jointly drawing up a practical guide for citizens."
"In accordance with Article 9(7) of the regulation, the Commission and the Council must inform Parliament of sensitive documents."
"In this regard, the Council remains ready to conclude negotiations with Parliament on an inter-institutional agreement on common security and defence policy. This could be followed by other agreements, particularly on justice and home affairs."
"However, given this situation, Parliament should re-examine its position on its application to annul the Council security regulation. It should also adopt measures on the protection of documents classified as sensitive, in compliance with its own Rules of Procedure as recently modified."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last month I came here to witness Parliament' s adoption of the report by Mrs Maij-Weggen on amending Parliament' s Rules of Procedure regarding public access to the documents of the three institutions."
"This brought to an end some quite considerable work by Mrs Maij-Weggen, and also, if I may say so, by Mr Cashman."
"A week ago, and a few days after the Council, the Commission adopted a decision amending its own Rules of Procedure."
"Prior to this, on 28 November, we held a discussion to ensure the regulation is applied with the greatest transparency. It is true that we needed a few extra days for this."
"This is why the definitive decision of the Commission was only taken on 5 December. This prompted a number of questions, and your President raised the issue with us."
"I would like to reassure you in no uncertain terms that, in practice, these few days of delay had no repercussions for citizens."
"The Commission has in fact been implementing the regulation of 30 May since 3 December."
"Accordingly, we have a central point of access to the Secretariat-General of the Commission."
"We have a postal address, an e-mail address and a fax number available for people to use. It is also possible to consult the Commission' s website."
"In addition, there is the new access guide produced by ourselves, which you have discussed, Minister. This will be available on the website from next week."
"Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, as far as we are concerned, all the practical measures necessary for the implementation of the regulation are in place. In fact, the Commission services have already started processing applications to access the new database established in accordance with the regulation."
"Article 18 of the regulation provides not only for the amendment of the Rules of Procedure, but also for the amendment of other existing provisions."
"Therefore, the appropriate services of the Commission have checked whether the 1983 regulation on opening historical archives to the public was in accordance with the regulation on access to documents."
"Some changes were needed. The Commission will shortly put to the Council and Parliament a proposal to change the regulation on historical archives."
"The third consideration also concerns Article 18 of the regulation of 30 May. The Commission' s services have drawn up a list of the rules which are to be found throughout Community law which concern access to documents or information within existing Community legislation."
"This work has allowed us to identify almost fifty provisions that the Commission will examine in the light of the new regulation."
"All provisions that do not comply with the new rules on access to documents will either be modified or repealed."
"The fourth point I wanted to make today concerns how the regulation can be applied to agencies."
"Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Cashman, I understand that this is one of your concerns, which you have rightly raised. The matter is included in the joint declaration adopted along with the regulation."
"Work is under way on this issue too."
"Since adopting the new regulation, the Commission has provided the agencies with information on it and had invited them to re-examine their own rules on access in the light of the regulation."
"The existing instruments of incorporation of the agencies will be modified."
"An additional clause will be included in the instruments of incorporation of new agencies."
"Lastly, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission' s services have drawn up a guide to inform citizens of their rights under the regulation. In the first instance, this guide will be available on the Commission' s website in a few days' time."
"However, in the near future, we plan to develop a common citizens' guide on all three institutions. I hope this will happen soon."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have outlined all the work that the Commission has undertaken to implement this regulation on access to documents."
"This work will of course be followed up by an interinstitutional committee. The committee will be set up shortly and will establish a firm foundation for our cooperation in implementing this new regulation."
"Minister, I was pleased to hear you refer to the compromise proposal made by my colleague Mrs Loyola de Palacio on 28 November in the three-way discussion."
"She put it forward because a solution has to be found."
"I would like to thank you Minister for having noted that Mrs de Palacio put forward this compromise proposal with due regard for Parliament' s concern that political authority should play its full part in the interinstitutional committee."
"In order to apply the regulation, each institution has worked independently to modify their own Rules of Procedure when they judged it appropriate."
"For its part, the Commission will continue to respect this independence."
"The Commission hopes to respect the spirit and the letter of this new regulation, which, we believe, represents a real step forward in terms of transparency and democracy within the European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, Minister, the public access to documents regulation, better known as the Act on the public nature of Government, was approved in May this year after protracted negotiations."
"My colleague Mr Cashman, the President Mr Watson and myself were very closely involved in this."
"It was agreed at the time that the practical implementation had to be ready by 3 December, and that applied to all three institutions - the Council, the Commission and Parliament."
"The registers were to be ready by 3 June 2002, and today is 12 December."
"Where are we now, one week on from 3 December?"
"Parliament approved its revised Rules of Procedure on 13 November, and Parliament' s Bureau saw to its implementation on 28 November."
"So as far as we are concerned, everything is in order."
"However, as Parliament we feel partly responsible for what the Commission and the Council do, and that is why we have opened this debate."
"First the Council: the Council adapted its Rules of Procedure to the regulation on 29 November and published them on 3 December - just in time, in other words."
"Two comments: firstly an earlier comment about the Solana decisions."
"It is not entirely clear from the Rules of Procedure whether or not the Solana decisions have been overruled by the regulation."
"Can Mrs Neyts please once again give us a very clear answer on this?"
"And then a comment about Article 12, Paragraph 5, of the Council Decision, which states that notes, letters and suchlike relating to legislation and addressed to the Coreper, for example, are indeed covered by the regulation."
"However, Article 6 states that if Member States make comments about European legislation with regard to the Council or the Coreper in individual notes or letters, these do not have to be published."
"It seems to me that this is not acceptable."
"In the Netherlands, letters from a municipality to the national government always have to be published, and it seems to me that this should also be the case for Member States in respect of the Council."
"And then the Commission; the Commission implemented an amendment to the Rules of Procedure on 28 November and approved it on 5 December."
"Now, I am not quibbling over the two days' delay, but I do have a few comments to make."
"The first is that the Commission has decentralised the implementation of the regulation."
"Is that wise?"
"However, I have now heard Mr Barnier say that there will be one PO box and one e-mail address after all."
"So why is that not spelled out clearly in the Rules of Procedure? I cannot find it."
"My second comment is about the following problem: why hasn' t the Commission produced a clear definition of the term 'document' , as Parliament and the Council have done?"
"My third point is Article 8 of the Commission Decision."
"Why is it so vague about the author of the document? Is his name not allowed to be known if he is an official?"
"After all, he puts his signature to it in this position, so I believe that this should fall under openness."
"It is also not entirely clear what will happen with the agencies."
"The Commissioner has said something about that, but has the Commission initiated anything in this area?"
"And then the security rules. Nothing has been published about these either."
"Why have the Council' s security rules been published and not the Commission' s?"
"And now to my last comment, and I would like to pick up on Mrs Neyts' point."
"I do not know whether it is wise to have an interinstitutional committee on a non-political level."
"Do you have to do this on an official level?"
"I am very hesitant about that. I think that more consultation is needed on this point; at least we have stated in our Rules of Procedure that one of our Vice-Presidents would have to be responsible for it and Parliament would have to back this pronouncement."
"Mr President, first of all let me remind both the Council and Commission that the purpose of the regulation is: ""to give the fullest possible effect to the right of public access to documents and to lay down the general principles and limits on such access""."
"When looking at the Council and Commission decisions, I see an attempt to rewrite the regulation, in particular references to it in Article 9 of the Commission decision - documents which do not reflect opinions or individual opinions will not be made available."
"The same applies to Article 11 of the Council decision."
"I should like to remind both the Council and Commission that a restriction on access to documents can only refer to the exemptions listed in Article 4 and Article 9, which in turn relate back to Article 4."
"Equally, in the Commission's proposals, third country nationals are denied the right of complaint to the European Ombudsman - again, a violation of the spirit of the regulation."
"Under delegated powers the Commission believes it will not make legislative papers available until adoption of the final text."
"I would remind the House and the Commission that 90% of some 5 000 legislative acts adopted every year in the Union are under delegated powers."
"The Council has widened access to some of its internal documents, but maintains confidentiality on Member State demands on national delegations and national positions."
"Why is it that six months after the regulation entered into force, no information campaign has been launched by the institutions?"
"Why?"
"When are we going to have the Commission's proposals on amending secondary legislation?"
"Has the Commission adopted security rules? If so, can it publish them according to the regulations?"
"When will Parliament adopt its own security rules? I am extremely worried that if someone were now to approach and gain access via either the Commission's decision or the Council's decision we would see a violation of the regulation."
"Furthermore, I should like to echo Mrs Maij-Weggen's very important point."
"It is not acceptable that we should have secretaries-general representing politicians in this interinstitutional committee."
"Politicians must be accountable and responsible for their decisions."
"'May we see the telephone directory?'"
"'Sorry, this has certainly not been classified information for two years, but you cannot be given it.'"
"'How many laws are there?'"
"'Sorry, we are not counting.'"
"'How many projects are you running?'"
"'We stopped counting when we reached 100 000.'"
"'How many committees are there?'"
"'Sorry, that is a secret.'"
"'Who takes part in the preparative meetings?'"
"'That is unfortunately something we do not know.'"
"'But you pay travel expenses, do you not?'"
"'Sorry, we do not know whom we pay these to.'"
"'May I see which laws are being negotiated with the twelve applicant countries, together with the screening reports?'"
"'Sorry.'"
"Those are the types of answer which we, who have been elected to monitor the Commission and the Council, have received."
"Like the Ombudsman, the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control, we are unable to obtain what ought to be available to elected representatives in all parliaments."
"On 3 December, the regulation on public access to documents came into force."
"We were right there with a renewed request to scrutinise the documentation, but the officials discovered that there was nothing to be made available on the basis of the new rules, either."
"We have asked for a complete list of committees and working parties and the members of these."
"We have asked for details of the enlargement negotiations and to see the declarations and statements associated with current laws."
"When we debated the regulation on public access to documents, Parliament' s rapporteurs expected us to be able to obtain that type of information in the future."
"I should therefore like to ask our rapporteurs if they will be involved in taking proceedings against the Commission if our renewed request for access to documents also fails in the end to produce a satisfactory answer."
"Mr President, most people say they believe in open and transparent government."
"I am quite sure the Commission and the Council are genuine in what they say."
"I congratulate them on the progress made so far but none of us should deceive ourselves into thinking that we do not need a lot more work before Europe is truly open and transparent."
"I want to use my time to cite just one example - a petition to the European Parliament from various names at Lloyds of London."
"The petition claims that the United Kingdom Government has not properly applied the EU insurance directives."
"As a result of the petition the Commission very properly submitted, over a year ago, questions to the United Kingdom Government."
"That is when secrecy and cover-up begin."
"The Commission has allowed members of the Committee on Petitions - but only members - to see the actual questionnaire, and then only under extremely stringent conditions."
"Why not reveal the questions to the public, why not to the petitioners?"
"The Commission would show it is doing its job."
"As for the answers, they are top secret."
"Nobody is allowed to know them - neither the Members of Parliament nor the petitioners - nobody."
"The UK Government says it is an informal communication and that it does not reveal informal communications."
"The Commission says that under the Framework Agreement it is not allowed to reveal the answers because there may be legal proceedings."
"The British Government does not have a leg to stand on."
"If this is not a formal communication, I would like to know what is."
"The Commission may have some argument, but I would remind the Commissioner of the Zwartveld judgement."
"In 1990 the Commission refused access to documents because it claimed there might be legal proceedings."
"The ECJ insisted that the documents were presented."
"So I would say to the Commissioner this afternoon - you have made some progress but I can give you this example to show that a great deal of progress is still needed in this respect."
"Mr President, we are talking today about the implementation of the regulation on public access to documents: the famous Act on the public nature of Government."
"We had a nice compromise, the best result we could have achieved this spring, a reasonable improvement on the Commission' s original proposals and the existing Rules of Procedure."
"We have essentially brought together the best practices of our Member States to form a new European standard."
"What we now have to do is to implement it, of course, and we must do all we can to really make it a success."
"As the European Parliament, we naturally want to keep a very close eye on how this will be done in practice, and my colleagues Mr Cashman and Mrs Maij-Weggen have put forward a series of in-depth questions and comments which I wholeheartedly support."
"We attach a great deal of importance to the annual report which will be issued about the implementation of the public access regulation and it is very significant for us that we have heard the Council' s and the Commission' s explanation here today."
"When I hear the comments about the institutional tale of the Secretaries-General, I am of the same opinion as my colleagues; namely that it sounds as if we are putting it on an official institutional level instead of on a political one."
"If you say general and policy criteria, then I would rather speak on a political level."
"The 3 December deadline came around very quickly, of course, and we ourselves were only ready in November."
"We now have to put our money where our mouth is. But then I look at the Council and I notice that the documents relating to the Justice and Home Affairs Council have not yet been released, or that not all documents have been included in the register."
"Then things start getting tricky again, because then I think: let' s make giving access to our citizens our number one priority, otherwise it sounds as if we are being contemptuous."
"I have two specific questions for the Commission and the Council in addition to my colleagues' questions."
"How many sensitive documents have been included in the register so far?"
"How are the Commission and the Council informing citizens about the possibilities offered by the Act on the public nature of Government, apart from the guide which Commissioner Barnier announced?"
"The Act on the public nature of Government is to be evaluated in 2004."
"If it then turns out that the regulation does not guarantee sufficient public access, it will be our duty as Parliament to make sure that it does, because we must never lose sight of the fact that the picture that our citizens have of us sitting working in little closed rooms must never be accurate."
"This regulation is a fantastic way of doing this differently, but we will have to ensure that it is not just a series of fine words and that it can actually be implemented in practice."
"I am greatly looking forward to hearing the answers, particularly to my colleagues' critical questions."
"Mr President, I am sorry that my comments have to be directed at Commissioner Barnier, whom I hold in the highest regard, because my complaint applies to a different Commissioner."
"As a member of the Committee on Petitions, and to follow on from what Mr Perry has already said, I should point out that this is not the first time the Commission has refused to divulge the contents of documents and other records which we need to see if we are to draw the right conclusions and make the right decisions in cases where European citizens have taken recourse to the European Parliament."
"This refusal on the part of the Commission infringes, in my view, the principle of transparency and hampers the Committee on Petitions in its work."
"The main excuse for the Commission's refusal is that the information and documents requested would disclose sensitive personal data."
"The merits of this contention are contested both by the Committee on Petitions and the European Ombudsman."
"To give you an example, the Commission refuses to give us the names of the representatives of a professional organisation whom it consulted and who, it appeared, influenced its decision."
"We deny that this is how personal data is protected and are worried that a possibly less than transparent deal is being hushed up."
"Mr Perry also referred to the Lloyd´s affair."
"I have to tell you that this hush-up conceals bankrupt companies, a great deal of human misery and several suicides, which is why the report by the chairman of the Committee on Petitions, Mr Gemelli, which Plenary adopted today, calls for the powers and efficiency of the Committee on Petitions to be enhanced so that petitioners can obtain justice promptly and avert irreparable damage, for example to the environment or cultural monuments."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I will limit myself to answering the questions that have been asked, the question from the rapporteur, Mrs Maij-Weggen, as to whether the new decisions overrule the so-called Solana decisions; the answer is yes, they do."
"As far as the committee on an institutional level is concerned, I would reiterate that the Council has no objections at all to this committee starting work; the only question is whether it will be beneficial for the presidents to meet and take the decisions?"
"If it is a question of general principles, I do in fact believe that it will have to be the presidents who do this, although this is only my personal point of view."
"The solution I have outlined does in fact provide for this."
"The only thing that I personally do not regard as a favourable development is the situation where the presidents would become a kind of court of appeal, as it were, if a common decision not to permit access to a certain document or a certain type of document has been taken at the highest official level."
"I think that the result will be like a game of ping-pong right up to the highest official level."
"I would, however, like to emphasise that the political level is of course always accessible and politically responsible for what the official level decides, including what the highest official level decides."
"I do not understand the distinction that some of you are making, as if the official level should by definition not be responsible and the political level should be to the greatest possible degree."
"This is not the case; this is not my philosophy; it may be yours, but I do not share it."
"I think that we must take another clear look at these things."
"It has been pointed out that there are a number of Council documents relating to justice and home affairs that have not yet been included in the Register."
"That is right."
"We are waiting for the Rules of Procedure on guaranteeing the security of documents, which your Parliament has yet to vote on."
"Until such time as this has been done, we find it particularly difficult to make highly sensitive documents accessible, even to your worthy institution."
"Mr President, I would now like to respond in as much detail as possible to those who have contributed to the debate."
"In general, I am not surprised at the expressions of impatience and vigilance, and at the calls for further action directed at the Commission."
"Mrs Maij-Weggen, you reminded us, although I had already done so, that the Commission arrived at its decision after several days extra delay, which we really needed. As you can imagine, I took part in all these debates within the College to assess the implications of this new system, this new instrument for the internal organisation of the Commission."
"However, I have assured you, very candidly, that these extra days we required in no way prevented the system from coming into operation on 3 December. Ladies and gentlemen, there have indeed been results since 3 December, as I said to Mr Bonde, who asked me about this."
"Since then, we have already received quite a number of inquiries. These have been processed by the Commission' s services, according to the new procedures."
"Mrs Maij-Weggen, the register you mentioned will come into operation in June, on 3 June next year. You also remarked that there is some uncertainty over the author of the report, as did Mr Cashman."
"We refer to the author of the document in Article 8 of our text. We have not gone into further details on this as, naturally, the author' s description depends on the nature of the document."
"Documents may be written by an institution, another public authority, a natural person, a civil servant or a private company. I would therefore like to explain that the precise description of the author depends of course on the nature of the document."
"However, this register will indeed come into operation on 3 June next year, we are working to meet this deadline. Mrs Maij-Weggen, I would also like to say that the Secretariat-General has a centralised management structure."
"As I said a few minutes ago, we have, for instance, an e-mail address, a postal address and a fax number that can be used."
"We can therefore reply to people if they write to any specific Directorate-General. If a problem arises, the Secretariat-General acts as arbitrator."
"However, we have a central main address and the Directorates-General can reply. Of course, the decision is taken in the first instance by the Directorate-General which produced the document."
"I would now like to address the definition of the document, a subject you are all concerned with. Mrs Maij-Weggen, as I said when I spoke a few minutes ago, we did indeed restrict ourselves to reading the text of the regulation which gives a broad and neutral definition."
"This was the wish of the Community legislator and we did not want to limit the scope of our own Rules of Procedure."
"As regards the security rules, which you and Mr Cashman also mentioned, I can confirm that these rules, adopted at the end of November, will be published very shortly. Publication is only being delayed by legal and language issues."
"I would like to ask for your understanding on this matter. However, the security rules will be published very shortly."
"In any case, in the light of what you both said on this matter, we will further increase the speed of work towards publication."
"Mr Cashman, you also referred to the need for a publicity campaign."
"I promise you we will ensure that information on this new regulation, the arrangements entailed and the new provisions available to citizens is disseminated as widely as possible."
"Unless I am very much mistaken, the three European institutions decided not to hold a publicity campaign on this regulation at the forum of the inter-institutional technical working party. However, we will publicise the existence of this citizens' guide thorough our website and all our documents."
"Mrs Hautala, you mentioned the issue of the inter-institutional committee, as did Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Cashman, I cannot elaborate further on what I have already said, though I do appreciate Parliament' s concern over a sense of political responsibility."
"Mrs de Palacio' s compromise proposal endeavours to go as far as possible towards meeting Parliament' s wishes. I think you understand this."
"To sum up, I told Mr Bonde that we have had results. We are receiving our first inquiries and we are processing them according to the new regulation."
"Mr Perry and Mr van den Berg bear out this concern for vigilance."
"I believe that this regulation can bring about real progress. Maybe other regulations will go further."
"We will see the effects of change as we go along. I promise that the Commission is wholeheartedly committed to implementing this regulation."
"I would now like to address the need for transparency and democracy as far as citizens are concerned. The regulation is an initial response to this."
"This is also one of the issues of institutional reform and the Laeken Declaration. It is also the subject of the open debate that will be possible within the framework of the convention and the forthcoming reform in 2004."
"In my opinion there is still much to be done to increase transparency and democracy and to ensure citizens are more closely involved in the decisions we take."
"Then, Mr Marinos asked me a question on the ability of the Committee on Petitions to access documents."
"Access is of course possible, though we must respect the protection of personal data. The documents of third parties can be accessed but they remain protected by Article 4 of the regulation, which must be adhered to."
"Lastly, Mr Cashman asked me a question on the significant issue of the Ombudsman. I would like to respond to this."
"Although I know that you are aware of this, I would like to confirm that the Treaty and the very statute of the Ombudsman means that complaints from third-country citizens living outside the Union cannot be dealt with. This is all I wanted to say to you."
"Your reactions came as no surprise to me. We shall henceforth take them into account when implementing this regulation in a specific and operational manner."
"Mr President, I would like to put a question to the Commissioner."
"Is this the way in which the principle of transparency is to be applied, for two days ago it was impossible to discover which regulations you had adopted on access to documents."
"It is reminiscent of Orwell' s Animal Farm, where some are more equal than others."
"Despite searching, I have been unable to obtain access to your decision."
"This is not the way that transparency should function, with its taking more than a week to obtain information."
"Secondly, your reaction to the special report of the Ombudsman which was approved..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, the Commissioner intimates that we have been given an answer."
"We have not."
"We tried to renew our old request to Mr Prodi."
"That was agreed."
"The same day, officials told us that nothing at all new could be made available under the new regulation."
"So there is nothing new."
"We had raised another question with Mr Prodi in the Conference of Presidents."
"We were given promises from both..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, this debate has been quite unsatisfactory and, under the pertinent rule in our Rules of Procedure, I wish to propose to my committee and to the House that we have a resolution to close this debate, to vote on it at our January part-session, and to look at what further action we need to take, given the quite unsatisfactory nature of the responses from the Council and Commission."
"Yes, that is a suggestion we will take up."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I made quite a serious allegation that there was an attempt to rewrite the regulation."
"That has not been addressed."
"I maintain that allegation in that both the Council and Commission have introduced a new mandatory and blanket exception on the basis of opinions or individual opinions."
"This is not contained in the regulation."
"I direct honourable Members to Article 4(3) - public interest disclosure."
"It has to be proven that such disclosure would undermine the institution's ability to function."
"Mr President, I understand that the debate is closed, but I am here and I am ready to continue."
"I am trying to understand why the Chairman, Mr Watson, has said that we have failed to answer the questions."
"I have tried to take note of all contributions as quickly as possible. I have also tried to respond in as much detail as possible to at least the main questions, which I was naturally able to answer immediately."
"I am willing to appear again before your committee, Mr Watson, and to continue this dialogue."
"I have explained the spirit in which the Commission took this decision a few days ago."
"The communication to which you refer, Mrs Thors, is certainly possible. I shall endeavour to let you have a copy of our decision, if you have been unable to obtain a copy through any other means."
"I have informed you that since 3 December citizens have been able to access Commission documents within the terms of this regulation. We will provide concrete confirmation of this trend, and we remain wholeheartedly committed to applying the spirit and letter of this regulation."
"I have tried to respond as fully and as sincerely as possible to the questions put to me. I feel that I had to reiterate this point, Mr President, with your permission."
"Question Time (Council)"
"As they deal with the same subject, Question Nos 1 to 4 will be taken together."
"Question No 1 by (H-0861/01):"
"Subject: Informal European Council meeting in Ghent on the Laeken declaration On Wednesday, 4 July a representative of the Belgian Presidency of the EU spoke in positive terms of the role of constitutional regions in the process of European integration."
"But there are also 14 other Member States, and it will therefore be important that the constitutional regions ensure they themselves work closely in harmony, Ms Neyts stated. In a joint declaration issued at the end of May, seven constitutional regions expressed a clear, united position in favour of greater Treaty-based involvement in the European project."
"At the informal European Council meeting in Ghent on 19 October, EU Member States promoted the Convention procedure to prepare for further reform of the EU/EC Treaties."
"Does the Council endorse the request by Catalonia, Salzburg, Scotland, Flanders, Wallonia, Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia to be directly involved in the Convention to prepare for further reform of the EU/EC Treaties?"
"If not, why is it opposed to greater Treaty-based involvement of constitutional regions in mapping out the future of Europe?"
"Question No 2 by (H-0862/01):"
"Subject: Regions' powers in a globalised world In Nice an additional Declaration on the future of the Union was annexed to the Treaty."
"It offered, inter alia, the prospect of a more precise delimitation of powers between the EU and the Member States, reflecting the principle of subsidiarity."
"I am not alone in thinking that regions with greater powers within the European Union are a precondition for a more workable, democratic and transparent Europe."
"Furthermore, such European regions are closer to citizens and form a new framework with which the latter can identify, preventing movements such as that of the 'democratic globalists' becoming a movement feeding off anti-European sentiment."
"The Council, the European Commission and the European Parliament have a duty, at this key point in the process of European integration, to be resolute and united in opting for a clear division of powers between the EU, the Member States and the regions."
"Does the Council intend to give concrete shape to the concept of the delimitation of powers between the Union, the Member States and the regions at Laeken?"
"If so, how precise is this delimitation to be, and will adequate account be taken of the subsidiarity principle?"
"If not, does the Council consider itself to be sufficiently armed in the face of the growing gap between European citizens and institutions and in the face of growing antipathy within certain movements to all forms of expansion in scale whether at European or world level?"
"Question No 3 by , which has been taken over by Josu Ortuondo Larrea(H-0863/01):"
"Subject: Informal European Council meeting in Ghent on the Laeken declaration On Wednesday, 4 July a representative of the Belgian Presidency-in-Office of the EU spoke in positive terms of the role of different nationalities and constitutional regions in the process of European integration."
"But there are also 14 other Member States, and it will therefore be important that the constitutional regions ensure they themselves work closely in harmony, Ms Neyts stated. At the informal European Council meeting in Ghent on 19 October, the Laeken declaration and the future of the European Union were discussed."
"In connection with the process of establishing a constitution for the European Union, which, for some, goes hand in hand with simplification of the Treaties, does the Council intend to ensure that the principle of constitutional pluralism is enshrined in the Laeken declaration, so that the constitutions of the Member States and their nationalities and states exist independently of, and do not depend for their validity on, a possible EU constitution?"
"Question No 4 by (H-0864/01):"
"Subject: Informal European Council meeting in Ghent on the Laeken declaration On Wednesday, 4 July a representative of the Belgian Presidency-in-Office of the EU spoke in positive terms of the role of constitutional regions in the process of European integration."
"But there are also 14 other Member States, and it will therefore be important that the constitutional regions ensure they themselves work closely in harmony, Ms Neyts stated. At the informal European Council meeting in Ghent on 19 October, the Laeken declaration was discussed."
"Are the powers and position of internal political entities in the Member States in respect of their relations with the EU institutions in an executive, legislative and legal connection to be enshrined in the Laeken declaration?"
"If not, why does the Council oppose recognition in the Laeken declaration of the powers and position of internal political entities in the Member States in respect of their relations with the EU institutions in an executive, legislative and legal connection?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in response to the questions by Mr Bart Staes, Mr Camilo Nogueira Román, Mr Miquel Mayol i Raynal and Mrs Nelly Maes concerning the content of the future Laeken Declaration, the Council can only in the first instance refer to future discussions of the European Council which are yet to take place."
"It is indeed up to the European Council to adopt the practical rules and the framework of ideas for the Convention which has to prepare the forthcoming IGC."
"This framework should encompass, inter alia, the list of the issues to be discussed, as well as give indications as to how these issues could be tackled most effectively."
"The Council will not confine itself to the description of the above-mentioned elements, but will also remind us that the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference must find concrete answers to the questions raised."
"However, in the light of the Declaration of Nice regarding the Union' s future, it is obvious that one of the topics that will need to be discussed in the next few months is a more clearly defined demarcation of powers between the European Union and the Member States pursuant to the subsidiarity principle."
"Back in July, a number of you already asked the Council - through myself as its personal representative - various questions about these constitutional aspects, and I responded to you at the time. In my response, not only did I officially refer to the preparation of the future IGC, but also to the presidency' s report to the European Council of Gothenburg, in which numerous initiatives are mentioned that are taking place in the Member States in which various regional entities were involved, as well as events that are organised within the framework of the debate in the Committee of the Regions on this issue."
"The presidency has now read the resolution on the strengthening of the roles of the regions within the European Union with great interest. The resolution was adopted in Liège on 15 November by the Conference of Presidents of the regions with legislative powers, as they will be referred to henceforth."
"The Committee of the Regions' opinion which pertains to the participation of that Committee to the future Convention is now also known."
"However, no decision has been taken on the issues regarding the organisation of the debate and the topics which need to be discussed."
"As I have already said, these are matters to be dealt with by the European Council of Laeken."
"Speaking for myself, I should like to add that I am very keen to find out when the debate within the Committee of the Regions will be opened, for this is an issue that is being avoided at all costs by those involved."
"Outside the Committee, a number of its members complain about the fact that surely, a distinction should be drawn between those who have this legislative power and those who have not."
"The Committee itself is keeping tight-lipped. I have to say, I have some qualms on the matter."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, you will understand, of course, that those posing questions have scheduled this Question Time at a very strategic moment, namely a few hours, a few days away from the Council of Laeken."
"We would be delighted if you were to give us an idea of what will be discussed at that Council."
"Prime Minister Verhofstadt has toured the capital cities and paid a visit to Madrid yesterday."
"Madrid is a difficult customer in this regional issue."
"The Spanish Government has more or less made the fight against terrorism its number one priority."
"In Spain, defending the rights, the real rights of nations and regions is often considered as terrorism or part of terrorism, and this is of course unacceptable."
"This is not a European stance that we can accept."
"I would very specifically like to ask you whether the difficulties which the Spanish very often cause with regard to the representation in the Committee of the Regions have meanwhile been resolved and secondly, and whether they will indeed not be opposed to the concept of 'constitutional region' being mentioned in the Declaration of Laeken."
"I would be very obliged if you would look into this."
"Honourable Members, I cannot answer that question for the very simple reason that I do not know the answer."
"Since I did not have the opportunity of accompanying the Prime Minister to Madrid, I do not know exactly what was discussed. Consequently, I am unable to answer your question in the light of this lack of knowledge."
"I am sorry, I do not know."
"I am certain that the topic has been discussed, but I am ignorant of the content of the discussion."
"I was not there and I have not had the time to find out."
"I apologise."
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I would lend you my mobile, but unfortunately, it is broken."
"I wanted to ask you what place the regions will occupy within the framework of the Convention."
"I know there are certain things to which you do not know the answer, but we would be very interested to find out whether the regions will actually have the role that was assigned for them by the Belgian Presidency."
"We hope that you have been able to adhere to that position after that tour of the various capital cities."
"With regard to your own challenging question about your opinion on the Committee of the Regions, I would like to state that, as you know, the constitutional regions are very much in the minority in the Committee of the Regions, and it is of course unnecessary to stage one' s own defeats."
"The Committee of the Regions was composed in such a way as to ensure that the constitutional regions would form a minority, and I would want them to be considered as federal states that, in the course of history, have never been given the chance to develop into Member States."
"If you allow me, I would also point out that there will be a number of small states that will soon be joining, including Malta, Cyprus, Slovakia, etc. You will understand that the constitutional regions would feel cheated if they were not to have any rights at all in this company."
"I should like to say to Mrs Maes that she is fully aware of the dangers of swapping mobiles and subsequently leaving them switched on, but this is a Belgian inside joke, Mr President, which all fellow countrymen will be able to enjoy to the full, and this is why it is best if we did not."
"This was the first point I wanted to make."
"Secondly, I have never been aware of the fact that being in a minority is a reason not to engage in a certain fight which is deemed justified."
"The times may have changed, but we used to think differently about this."
"It is, of course, true that the regions with legislative powers are in the minority in the Committee of the Regions, but I would question whether this was done on purpose."
"I do not believe so, but this is a matter of opinion."
"I can only note that the discussion on this point is far more heated outside the Committee than it is inside."
"This is my observation, and maybe this may change one day, but not in the foreseeable future."
"I have my own thoughts about a fight which is not even fought at the right forum, but this is my personal opinion."
"Mrs Maes, I have read the text, the appeal to the Belgian Presidency which was published either yesterday or the day before."
"I cannot share the opinion that regions are a kind of Member State, as it were, but which, by a stroke of really bad luck, ended up not being Member States."
"This is a reasoning which could, of course, be taken to extremes, bordering the absurd."
"The reply I received from a State Minister of the Indian State of Andarpradesh to my question how many people lived in that province, will always stay with me."
"He said 79 million."
"79 million for Andarpradesh, just imagine."
"This compares to a large Member State in Europe."
"But this is not how things work, evidently."
"It is the statute according to public and international law of an entity that determines the position of this entity in the hierarchy."
"Belgium has found a solution with which you are familiar."
"I also believe that we are perfectly entitled to propagate this solution or to publicise it to the others, which is what Belgium did."
"It is therefore also the other Member States which, if necessary, should do this for their own delegations and should not expect the Union to solve the problem which they have, as yet, been unable to solve within their own borders, but, honourable Members, this is a strictly personal opinion."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, today, we want to strengthen the new, not only economic, but political and social, identity of Europe."
"I think that in order to do this we need to find a new internal structure that is suited to the reality of our diversity."
"Our present reality is not, however, simply shaped by the Member States alone, but there is a greater diversity and richness, represented culturally and socially by the historic peoples and nations of Europe and, politically, by the federated States, constitutional regions and autonomous communities, in particular, and also, of course, on another level, by the purely administrative regions, the provinces and the local authorities."
"Do you not think, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, that, by virtue of the mandate laid down in the Treaty of Nice, that in the Laeken Declaration, this question of European diversity, of the different cultural, social and political realities, should be specifically included as an important part of the debate to take place during the years 2002 and 2003 on the future of the Union and the division of competences between the institutions, in order to seek and find the best possible structure, which will allow us to share, without tension or conflict, the various, necessary levels of competence and sovereignty in existence in Europe?"
"Mr President, in response to the remarks that have just been made, I think it is important to bear the nature of the issue in mind."
"On the one hand, we have the cultural, linguistic and other diversities which constitute one of the greatest resources of the European Union and of Europe in general."
"I am aware that these diversities are presented as one of the European Union' s most important assets in the present version of the text."
"This poses no problem."
"On the other hand, we have the question of whether we should depart from what, to date, has been current European Union practice. The various institutions of the European Union do not concern themselves in assessing the constitutional arrangements of Member States, providing of course that these arrangements are compatible with fundamental principles, such as human rights and the protection of minorities and so on."
"I think that we should not confuse respect for diversities with a departure of this nature."
"In essence, this would involve breaking a long tradition. I regard this as a wise tradition, although this is merely my personal opinion."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, it does seem that Belgium has found an institutional solution to its diversity."
"It is a solution that you are pleased with and I welcome this."
"For those who are not directly involved, Belgium' s constitutional structure is of a complexity that pays tribute to the ingenuity of your public law specialists, but it is a solution which I would describe as bespoke."
"As you know, I support independence for Catalonia and I do not think this is a viable solution for Catalonia, for instance, within the Spanish State."
"The question I have, therefore, is very simple."
"Constitutional regions aside, although I recognise that these present some difficulties, could we not include, in the future European constitution, a right that, in my view, is elementary, which is the right to self-determination."
"Do the Catalan people not have the right to self-determination, will they not have the right, one day, to their own State within the European Union?"
"Given that Slovenia will soon be a member of the EU, why should Catalonia not be a member as well?"
"I repeat, that is not the question."
"The Member States belong at a specific level in the hierarchy of political entities of public administrative law and international law."
"This is a factual reality that you can - and that is another debate - desire to change, you are entitled to do this."
"I think that it is too early to say what the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference will do."
"The IGC, as you know, will work on the basis of a mandate which is due to be drawn up and approved by all the European institutions."
"In any case, it will certainly not turn out to be a repeat of the Congress of Vienna or the Congress of Versailles, but I could of course be mistaken."
"Without giving my personal opinion which, as President, I should not do, I would like to support the President-in-Office of the Council in her opinion that the questions are not following any kind of logical order."
"The questions we are dealing with are on the subject of the Laeken European Council and the current European Union, however interesting the proposals made by some Members of this House may be."
"I now give the floor to Mr MacCormick for a supplementary question."
"I wonder whether I might say with real sincerity what a pleasure it is to take part in Question Time when Mrs Neyts is with us because she really does make an effort to answer the question fully and faithfully."
"That is genuinely appreciated."
"I hope you will pass this message to your Prime Minister and try to ensure, when the Council meets next week, that it really does address itself to the issue of democracy in Europe."
"We face a crisis of democracy in the Union and it will become in some ways yet more acute as the Union enlarges."
"If people in the regions and localities of Europe feel that their democracy means nothing, because all decisions are taken in remote places; if they are always merely told 'look to the constitution of your Member State if you are not happy with things', that will damage democracy in Europe, not help it."
"I therefore ask you most sincerely to try to ensure that the type of issue which my colleagues and I have been putting to you this evening is really thought about at Laeken."
"I would like to thank Mr MacCormick for his kind words."
"As this is my last Question Time, you must forgive me if my answers to your various questions are slightly too long."
"The Belgian Prime Minister is familiar with the issue and he has his own views on the matter."
"But in his capacity as President of the European Council he also knows that he will need unanimity in order to have the declaration approved."
"Whatever his personal feelings might or will be, he will need a consensus."
"We will have to see how far we can go."
"That is all I can commit him and myself to."
"I just wanted to point out, Mr President, that my surname was misspelled."
"It has now disappeared from the board and I hope it will not be misspelled in the Minutes of the sitting as well."
"Mr President, on a point of order, it does not seem fair to me that, if any Member is entitled to ask a supplementary question after his initial question, the four of us are only allowed to ask one joint supplementary question."
"I do not think that this is what is laid down in the Rules of Procedure."
"No, I allowed supplementary questions to be asked by Members other than those who had originally asked questions, as stated in the Rules of Procedure."
"We can read it together afterwards. Then we will see that we are in agreement on this matter."
"This is a joint answer."
"As you already know, if we were to allow four questions with small differences between them, it would take up the whole of question time."
"Mr President, I have a supplementary question along the same lines and I would ask the Minister if she would be prepared to reply to it."
"It follows on from some of the comments and questions that have been asked already."
"I come from Wales, a nation with four times the population of Luxembourg, which is of course a EU Member State."
"Now in its November resolution on governance, Parliament stated categorically that it will welcome proposals from the Convention to redraft Article 5 of the EC Treaty to include a specific reference to the function of constitutional regions within Member States."
"This repeated a resolution of the previous October which stated that the Treaties should be amended specifically to recognise and respect the political and legislative powers of the internal nations and regions."
"Is the Council aware of these resolutions and if not, will it seek to ensure that attention is drawn to them during its deliberations at Laeken?"
"I have answered your various questions at length as much as I can."
"The degree of awareness of Parliament resolutions, which are many and manifold as you know, is directly related to people's interest in the issue concerned."
"Therefore, those who are very interested in federalism, in the internal organisation of states, in the most effective and the most equitable distribution of powers, certainly are aware of these views."
"Those who are less interested in the issues are probably less aware of the existence of these resolutions."
"It seems to me that it is Parliament's task and responsibility to make other people aware of the resolutions it has voted, so I invite you to do just that."
"Question No 5 by (H-0865/01):"
"Subject: Demand for drugs to fight anthrax The anthrax crisis in the USA has produced a rise in demand for Cipro, a patented drug manufactured by Bayer."
"The Canadian Government's response was simply to ask the country's industry to produce 'copies' of the drug."
"The US Administration appears to be pondering the same course of action as US legislation apparently allows the Administration, when there is a need for a patented drug, to ignore the restrictions imposed by the patent and authorise its manufacture."
"Evidently double standards are operating in regard to the developing countries' request for a reduction in the price of patented drugs and a relaxation of the legislation protecting patents in order to treat AIDS and other diseases."
"Has the Council considered what action it would take in the event of a rise in demand for a particular drug, as has occurred in the USA?"
"Is it consistent with Community law for a Member State to have US-type legislation which allows it to ignore the restrictions imposed by patents?"
"Will it respond positively to the developing countries' request for a price reduction and a relaxation of patent rights, which would clearly be beneficial not only for the developing countries but also for European and American consumers?"
"In response to Mr Alavanos, I would say that the Council is perfectly aware of the importance of the issue that he raised."
"I would also reiterate that Article 152 - formerly article 129 of the Treaty establishing the European Community - specifies, in general terms, that Community action in the area of health shall supplement national policies."
"The Community shall encourage cooperation between the Member States in the areas mentioned in the Treaty and, if necessary, shall lend support to their action."
"In this context, the Community shall also ensure a high level of human health protection by defining and implementing all the policies and actions."
"As you know, the Fourth WTO Ministerial Conference, which took place in Doha between 9 to 14 November this year, adopted a Declaration on the TRIPS agreement and public health."
"In the Declaration, the ministerial conference acknowledged, on the one hand, the gravity of public health problems, particularly afflicting many developing countries and least-developed countries and, on the other hand, that intellectual property protection is also important for the development of new medicines."
"In this Declaration, WTO members agreed that the TRIPS agreement does not prevent Members from taking the appropriate measures to protect public health and affirmed that the Agreement can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of WTO Members' right to protect public health, and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all."
"More specifically, the Declaration recognises that the flexibilities in the TRIPS agreement include the right of each Member to grant compulsory licences and to determine what constitutes a national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency, it being understood that public health crises, including those relating to HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other epidemics, can represent a national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency."
"Furthermore, the Declaration reaffirms the commitment of developed-country WTO Members to provide incentives to their enterprises and institutions to promote and encourage technology transfer to least-developed countries."
"The Declaration also specifies that the least-developed country Members will not be obliged, with respect to pharmaceutical products, to apply Sections 5 (Trademarks) and 7 (Protection of non-divulged information) of Part II of the TRIPS Agreement or to enforce rights provided for under these Sections until 1 January 2016, without prejudice to the right of the least-developed country Members to seek other extensions of the transition periods."
"I would add that, in the Declaration, WTO Member States made a commitment to propose, before July 2002, genuine solutions that could be consolidated in order to resolve the problem of those developing countries and least-developed countries that do not have manufacturing capacities for medicines."
"There is the problem of possible parallel imports or other measures which must enable these countries to have access to these medicines at a price that is reasonable, and the lowest possible."
"This will be done between now and next summer and I assure you that we will have to work like Trojans to achieve this."
"Time is not on our side."
"The problem is extremely complex, but this is a very important commitment, because it relates to an aspect of the problem which could not be dealt with by the agreement."
"I thank the President-in-Office both for her detailed reply and her cooperation over the past six months."
"Good cooperation is sometimes marked by a degree of tension."
"Thank you very much, it is just that I need to study your reply."
"I should like to ask a supplementary question, now that Nigeria has just starting producing AIDS drugs which are, however, old generation drugs of very dubious effectiveness."
"You referred in your reply to the transfer of more modern technology for use in particular by the countries of Africa which have been struck by mass epidemics; how can we achieve this?"
"I have mentioned a few of the things that will make it possible to get access to cheap medicines: compulsory licensing, cooperation with the big pharmaceutical firms - you are aware that the World Health Organisation is working on that and has already devised a number of mechanisms - and cooperation with organisations such as Médecins Sans Frontières that are also active in this field."
"Finally, if an agreement can be reached next summer, we will find ways of importing those medicines into countries that do not have the possibility of producing them themselves."
"Question No 6 by (H-0869/01):"
"Subject: Attention paid by the Council to the resolutions adopted by the European Parliament concerning the conflict in Western Sahara and assessment of the visit by the King of Morocco to that territory On 25 October 2001, Parliament' s plenary tabled an amendment to its resolution on the progress achieved in the implementation of the CFSP, as a result of which paragraph 33 of that resolution now reads: 'insists, furthermore, that the European Union should cooperate actively in settling the conflict in Western Sahara in accordance with the United Nations resolutions, along the lines requested by the European Parliament in its resolution of 16 March 2000 and the Statement by the German presidency of the Council of June 1999' ."
"In what way is the Council planning to take what Parliament has called for into consideration?"
"Will it finally combine forces in order to participate in the speedy, accurate implementation of the UN Peace Plan for Western Sahara (which provides for the holding of a referendum on self-determination), as called for in paragraph 6 of Parliament' s March 2000 resolution?"
"Does it believe that such joint action would enable the positions of its members - particularly Spain and France - to be coordinated in support of the UN Peace Plan?"
"In this connection, what view does it take of the visit by the King of Morocco to Western Sahara, which was strongly criticised by the Polisario Front?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during the part-session of 19 and 20 September, the Council took note of the European Parliament resolution on the progress made on the implementation of the common foreign and security policy, and agreed to consider this resolution within the framework of the discussion of the different points it contains."
"As was also stated at the time, the Council is delighted with the efforts the European Parliament has made to reach a sustainable solution which is acceptable to all parties involved in the conflict in the Western Sahara. This solution forms a crucial goal for the stability and welfare in that region."
"The Council fully and actively supports the process which is now taking place within the framework of the United Nations, as formulated in the resolutions of the Security Council, particularly the efforts made by Mr James Baker."
"In Resolution No 1359 of 29 June, the Security Council clearly marked the path to be followed."
"In this connection, the extension of the mandate of the MINURSO was significant, because this has made it possible to continue the present consultation among the parties, under the auspices of Mr Baker."
"The presidency is in contact with Mr Baker."
"The leading role in this process is being played by the United Nations."
"In this connection, the Council is prepared to mediate in order to create a climate of trust among the parties and hence to facilitate a sustainable solution, but it does not intend to take the place of the United Nations."
"The Council is acutely aware of the great sensitivity surrounding this dossier and of the need for observing strict neutrality. This is to avoid the Council being used by one of the parties involved as an instrument, which would only have a negative impact on the search for a solution, as well as on the role of the European Union in that region."
"Moreover, the Council is urging the parties to take a number of urgent, humanitarian measures, such as permitting family visits and liberating political prisoners."
"Whichever solution is opted for, it will have to be founded on broad compliance with democratic principles and respect for human rights, including the disquieting issue of refugees, but also of Moroccan prisoners, notably when these people need urgent care, in general, and medical care, in particular."
"In addition, I should like to emphasise that here too, the European Union is by far the largest donor of humanitarian aid to the refugees from the Western Sahara."
"Since 1996, the Commission has set aside EUR 56 million for this cause."
"The visit by King Mohammed VI to the Western Sahara has not impacted on the above-mentioned approach in any way."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, what an interesting answer."
"This may be the first time that this House has heard a political statement from the Council which goes much further than the usual strictly formal statements on the conflict in the Western Sahara."
"This answer with real content is very welcome."
"But I have to tell you the following: having listened to this response, I am under the legitimate impression that in the Council too much weight may be given to a view of the conflict in the Western Sahara that does not consider that the solution to it may only be based on compliance with the United Nations Settlement Plan, which includes holding a referendum on the self-determination of the Sahrawi people, a referendum that has been blocked for many years by one of the parties concerned, Morocco."
"You talked about many things: for example, the latest Security Council resolution, but at no time did you refer to the United Nations peace plan."
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, in July this year, at the start of the Belgian Presidency, I submitted a question to the Council, to be answered in writing, on statements made by Mr Javier Solana, the person responsible for foreign and security policy in the European Union, in relation to the United Nations Peace Plan, the future of the Western Sahara and the referendum."
"Now, in December, with the Belgian Presidency about to draw to a close, I am still waiting to receive an official answer from the Council."
"Although it is public knowledge and a well-known fact, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, that an official answer was circulated in the United Nations in the month of October - which was even the cause of a diplomatic incident between various representatives of the Member States - the question I am asking is this: when can I have my answer?"
"Please, before you leave us, can you give me this political Christmas present."
"The Honourable Member appears to be extremely well informed, which is his right, if not his duty."
"The same is not true of us, as we are still trying to find your question;"
"I have no doubt that we received it, but we cannot find any trace of the letter. So, if you can help us to find it, we will do our best to provide an answer for you before the end of the year."
"I apologise for this oversight and for our negligence because, of course, these are the only reasons I can give to explain this."
"Thank you."
"We would urge the President-in-Office of the Council to look for this missing question, because the question and the answer have been widely reported in the press, at least in the Spanish press."
"Mr President, we are probably addressing the question or the comment to the wrong person, but here you represent the Council as a whole."
"I have a feeling that the Western Sahara issue, to which I have devoted over half my political life so far, is actually a tragedy."
"How the conflict should be resolved is clear - after all, the UN peace plan was there at the beginning of the 1990s - and it is equally clear which European countries have very strong geopolitical interests in its not being adhered to."
"I must of course take note of the response that what is done in the UN must be adhered to."
"I believe, though, that the European Union and the Member States must, for the sake of a common foreign and security policy, choose a coordinated way of proceeding, one that is in accordance with the UN peace plan."
"Following the visit of King Mohammed VI, events have followed in rapid succession."
"There has also been a visit to the Western Sahara by the French President, Jacques Chirac, who, in defiance of all international legal positions, said that the Western Sahara was made up of the southern provinces of Morocco - a point we are discussing in the Council of the European Union."
"Mr President, the Honourable Member must understand that it is impossible for me to answer such detailed questions."
"Mrs Scheele, I have outlined to you what the Council' s position is and what the discussions might have related to. That is the Council' s position and the Council' s answer."
"Question No 7 by (H-0874/01):"
"Subject: Minorities in the Republika Srpska What measures have been taken to make return and reconstruction possible for repressed and exiled minorities - above all Croats and Muslims - in the Bosnian mini-state Republika Srpska?"
"The Council has already drawn the Honourable Member' s attention, in its answer to oral question H-0689 during the October session, to the fact that the return of displaced people was part of a whole raft of conditions imposed by the European Union as part of the stabilisation and association process, and the countries of the region subscribed to these conditions at the Zagreb Summit."
"The Council's report assessing the progress achieved by the countries of the region towards the conditions for European integration, which was approved on 11 June 2001, stated that the process of the return of refugees and displaced persons to Bosnia-Herzegovina should be speeded up and that the measures to create the proper conditions to enable people to return under the correct circumstances, in accordance with the Dayton-Paris agreement, should be strengthened."
"It is, first and foremost, the responsibility of the local and national authorities to take the necessary measures."
"The European Union will certainly use the monitoring process to follow this issue and, where applicable, to assess whether, on the one hand, the progress made in respecting the conditions and, on the other hand, the level of relations established and the level of technical and economic assistance are still appropriate."
"The 1995 Dayton-Paris Peace agreement, which brought an end to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, established the post of High Representative who is responsible for monitoring the implementation of this agreement, amongst other things."
"The current post-holder, Mr Wolfgang Petric, has not previously hesitated to dismiss local leaders from their duties when it turned out that these leaders were opposed to implementing the peace agreement, including Annex VII, which provides for the return of refugees and displaced persons."
"He did so in accordance with the powers granted him by the Ministerial Conference of the Council implementing the Bonn peace accord in December 1997."
"On several occasions, the Council strongly supported the efforts made by Mr Petric to fulfil his mandate."
"Regarding the material support that the European Union is providing to assist the return and resettlement of these people, this question is primarily a matter for the Commission, which manages Community assistance."
"However, the Council understands that, since 1998, in line with the recommendations of the High Representative' s Office and the Return and Reconstruction working group, increasing funds have been granted to support the return of minority groups to Republika Srpska."
"This area should also continue to occupy its rightful and important position within the framework of Community assistance provided under the CARDS 2000-2006 programme, Article 2 of which explicitly mentions aid for the return of refugees and displaced persons."
"I can assure you, as we near the end of six months of holding the presidency, that the Council and its various members attach extreme importance to the issue of the return and reintegration of refugees in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also in other areas of the Balkans where this issue unfortunately persists."
"The tense situation appears to be gradually easing and the number of people returning to and resettling in the area will increase. Of course, the same amount will not return to each area, but there is no escaping the fact that numbers are on the increase."
"We shall continue to attach great importance to this issue and this item is on the agenda of all the meetings where it can be discussed."
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, thank you very much for this detailed answer and also for your intensive involvement in this area."
"I would just like to put two specific questions."
"First: Is it possible for the Council to try and find a precise figure for the number of refugees and expellees who have to date returned to the Republika Srpska?"
"There were agreements about this, which can in fact only be monitored by finding out exactly how many people have gone back."
"I would ask you, if you are unable to do that today, to perhaps let me have that information in writing."
"My second point relates to tangible aid for the minorities."
"I have heard that, especially in the Banja Luka region, the Catholic Church is intensively engaging in care for the sick across cultural boundaries and in many activities in the spheres of social welfare and agriculture, and that funds promised for these have simply not been granted."
"That is the second question I am putting, and I am keen to learn whether you know anything about this."
"In response to the Honourable Member' s first question, I can only say that I do not at the moment have the exact figures to hand; we are finding them out and they will be communicated to you."
"As far as the second question is concerned, I believe that this is more a question for the Commission, which is responsible for the specific implementation of all forms of humanitarian aid, urgent or otherwise."
"As you are aware, I believe, it is the Commission that manages these very specific dossiers and I think that it is the Commission to which this question should be addressed."
"Question No 8 by (H-0876/01):"
"Subject: EU and international measures providing for the return of illegally transferred assets Under the terms of the Tampere Council conclusions the Member States committed themselves to taking concrete steps to trace, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime."
"Member States were urged also to implement fully the provisions of the Money Laundering Directive (which includes the conversion or transfer of property and the identification of the customers of credit and financial institutions), the 1990 Strasbourg Convention and the Financial Task Force recommendations."
"They were also urged to adopt the revised directive on money laundering which is now under conciliation."
"The Council called for the competences of Europol to be extended to money laundering in general and for common standards to be developed to prevent the use of corporations or entities registered outside the jurisdiction of the EU in the hiding of criminal proceeds and money laundering."
"EU States have signed the UN Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime which commits governments to adopt within their domestic legal systems the measures necessary to enable the confiscation of the proceeds of crime."
"Does the Council consider that the above EU, UN and Council of Europe measures and strategies confirm that the European Union does have a legitimate interest in relation to money illegally transferred by former dictators, i.e.. Nigeria, and will the Council now undertake to ensure that these monies in banks throughout the EU are returned to the democratically elected Government of Nigeria?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as is evident from the question, the European Community and the Union have already taken a number of measures and others are in the pipeline, notably within the framework of the fight against financial crime."
"The specific aim of these measures is to combat the laundering of money and to seize the proceeds of crime."
"Since the events of 11 September, a special effort has been made in the fight against funding terrorism."
"Alongside this, there are a multitude of other instruments, including the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of 1959 and the EU Convention of 2000 on the same topic."
"Both treaties contain a number of general regulations in the field of cooperation among states and this package of instruments also undoubtedly contributes to the fight against financial crime."
"Furthermore, reference can be made to a number of instruments in the field of substantive law, such as, for example, the framework decision on the fight against forgery."
"On 16 October of this year, the Council convened in a joint formation of Ecofin and Justice and Social Affairs. On that occasion, the Council laid down the decision to adopt a protocol as part of the Convention of 29 May 2000 on mutual assistance in criminal matters between the Member States of the European Union."
"This protocol considerably improves cooperation among the Member States in the fight against economic and financial crime and, in particular, the fight against money laundering, corruption and forgery, and it provides for broad agreement concerning the dissemination of information concerning financial transactions, accounts and bank details."
"The Member States have committed themselves to ratifying this protocol by the end of next year at the latest."
"I cannot answer the specific question concerning the repatriation of capital illegally transferred to banks of the Union by former dictators, since this question falls outside the scope of the Council, as the honourable Member was notified in the first part-session of October 2001, in answer to an identical question he then posed to the Council."
"Thank you, President-in-Office, for your comprehensive reply to the first part of my question."
"Yet again, however, you fail or you are unwilling to understand the thrust of the latter part of my question."
"It suggests that there are vast amounts of money removed from places such as Nigeria and the Congo and now in European banks which many people over the years have tried to find a means of returning to the people of Nigeria and the Congo without success."
"What I am suggesting is that you, as President-in-Office of the Council, have a responsibility, under the various conventions I refer to, to ensure that these monies are returned to the various former colonies."
"Surely you now understand fully the meaning of my question and will reply to it and ensure that these monies, which were illegally removed by dictators and terrorists, are returned to the people in the various former colonies?"
"I can only repeat the same answer."
"For the time being, the Council has no instrument which would enable it to do what you want it to do."
"It might be that, in future, such an instrument will be developed and improved, but for now, this is not the case."
"In the absence of such an instrument, action by the Council is not possible."
"Mr President, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, ladies and gentlemen, corruption is an issue of significance in some countries desirous of joining the EU, and we are currently engaging in accession negotiations with them."
"Funds gained by privatisation have often disappeared from these countries in a questionable manner."
"Do you believe it would be possible to resolve these issues within the framework of accession negotiations, or at least to apply unambiguous legal provisions in this area?"
"My response to the honourable Member is that, during the negotiations with the candidate countries, the quality of the constitutional state is an important element."
"We therefore examine whether the mechanisms which ensure that a state can be considered a constitutional state are in place, or not, as the case may be, and close attention is also paid to the quality of the judiciary."
"For example, individual reports on the situation in a candidate country may state that, so far, judges receive inadequate training and are not paid enough and that this inevitably encourages inadmissible practices and such like."
"So in that sense, yes, Mr Rübig, in terms of achieving maximum transparency and consistent jurisdiction and ensuring that there are bodies to which one can appeal when one deems oneself to be treated badly, and so on, in that sense, yes, I do believe it is possible. However, in the sense of delving deep into individual cases, I do not believe it to be possible."
"Question No 9 by (H-0879/01)"
"Subject: The case of Tracey Housel, a British national on death row in Georgia, USA Is the Council aware of the plight of Tracey Housel, a British national on death row in Georgia, USA?"
"Is the Council concerned that Mr Housel may not have received a fair trial that accords with the standards of international human rights law?"
"What steps will the Council take to assist Mr Housel?"
"The European Union believes that the death penalty, which is, of course, irreversible, is a particularly inhumane punishment."
"The EU is therefore opposed to the death penalty in all cases and it has agreed to work towards its universal abolition."
"The EU is concerned that approximately 90 States keep this punishment, although only a minority - thirty countries or so, one of which is the United States - continues to carry out executions every year."
"In 1998, as part of its objective to universally abolish the death penalty, the European Union drew up a series of guidelines to specify the circumstances in which it should undertake specific and targeted actions."
"In countries where the death penalty still exists, the Union is working to progressively limit its application and insists that the punishment be carried out whilst observing specific minimum standards."
"I know that this is only partly limiting the unbearable awfulness of the act, but, even in such horrible circumstances, this is how things must be done..."
"The European Union is closely monitoring the situation in the United States, where numerous executions take place."
"In 2001, steps were taken to help a number of people on death row, in line with the European Union' s guidelines, in Georgia, Oklahoma and Texas."
"In addition, in the autumn of 2000, the Union decided, for the first time, to intervene as amicus curiae in a trial before the Supreme Federal Court involving a condemned man, in order to raise before the Court the issue of the legality in international law of the sentencing to death of a person who was a minor at the time of the events."
"The Presidency-in-Office of the Union submitted another request to intervene as amicus curiae for Alexander Williams, who was condemned to death for a crime that he committed when he was under 18 years of age. The matter is still before the Supreme Court of Georgia."
"In another case - Atkins v Virginia - the European Union intends to make another request to intervene as amicus curiae before the Supreme Court in order to reaffirm its position on the application of the death penalty to people suffering from mental illness."
"The Council is aware of the details of the Housel affair and, in particular, of the fact that a judgement by the Supreme Court of the United States could be handed down before the end of the year."
"We would like to emphasise that, for those facing the death penalty who are nationals of a Member State, the European Union acts at the request of that Member State, which is best placed to judge whether it is appropriate for the Community to intervene."
"At this stage, the Council has not yet received a request from the United Kingdom to assist Mr Housel."
"The Council was informed that the United Kingdom is very actively monitoring this matter, in conjunction with Mr Housel' s lawyers."
"I should like to thank the President-in-Office for that very detailed reply."
"I have no supplementary, but I would urge the Council to continue that attitude to the plight of EU citizens because many Members of this House may have constituents who have received what is clearly an unfair trial."
"This is something that is on the increase."
"I believe that, as well as the Member State intervening on behalf of these EU citizens, the Council also has a clear role."
"I fully expect the UK Government to make representations to the Council in what I believe in this case is an example of an unfair trial leading to an irreversible death penalty."
"On a point of order, I would like to point out that, with the exception of the last speaker, not one of our colleagues has respected their speaking time."
"The result is that we have dealt with only nine questions, the first four of which had a joint answer."
"I completely agree, Mr Zacharakis, but you will understand that it is not appropriate to suddenly take the microphone away from Members."
"As a Member of this House you will understand why we need to call upon the solidarity and the common sense of all Members."
"I pay very close attention to the comments made out loud."
"I think we should all give thanks to Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck for the extraordinary degree of cooperation she has shown over these last six months."
"I am sure that her former position as a Member of this House has increased her sensitivity in this regard, including her willingness to answer Members' questions."
"Thank you very much."
"As the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 10 to 38 will be replied to in writing."
"That concludes Questions to the Commission."
"Conflict prevention"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0394/2001) by Mr Lagendijk, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the Commission communication on Conflict Prevention (COM(2001) 211 - C5-0458/2001 - 2001/2182(COS))."
"I now give the floor to Mr Lagendijk."
"Mr President, over the past few years, conflict prevention has developed into a real 'feel-good' concept, to use a traditional Dutch phrase."
"Everyone is in favour of conflict prevention. Why not?"
"There is always something that can be done with it, and why should it not be included in a list of measures?"
"In that way, conflict prevention slowly developed from a priority of and for pacifists, via a kind of interesting subsidiary activity alongside military activities, to what I would call one the European Union' s central ambitions, currently recognised by many."
"It is no longer a plaything of one group, it has become the central pursuit of the European Union as a whole, and this is also the reason why the time has come to translate much of what has been written to date about conflict prevention - stunning reports have been published over the past few years, also by the European Commission, for which congratulations are due - into practice."
"Fortunately, we do not need to start from scratch, for notably experience in the Balkans over the past ten years has taught us what the European Union is capable of, and has already done, in the field of conflict prevention."
"As you may know, I am also rapporteur for the Stability Pact, which I always extol as the greatest conflict prevention project."
"I am really convinced that the coherence in this programme between democracy, economic development and security is an illustration of how conflict prevention has developed from a concept on paper to a very usable instrument in practice."
"In my report, I have outlined three points, and today, I should like to do this again."
"Maybe the most straight-forward point, yet very tricky in practice, is the cooperation between the European Union and the OSCE."
"Everyone says that this should be done, that it is positive that it happens, and it is already happening."
"In a high number of locations, cooperation with the OSCE is good, but all too often, I visit places where this cooperation is faltering."
"I visited Macedonia recently, with a few fellow MEPs, where the European Union has an observation mission, but so has the OSCE. Cooperation between the two is not really ideal, to put it mildly."
"A week ago in Bucharest, the Commissioner made a number of sound proposals for cooperation between the EU and the OSCE, for example in the southern Caucasus and in Central Asia. In my opinion, it would be good if in future, the Commission could possibly monitor cooperation with the OSCE more effectively than it is doing now."
"The OSCE often has the same mission and is often active in the same field. This applies to each campaign - including the Balkans, where, once again, things often go well but all too often they do not - in order to better implement this cooperation and this distribution of tasks."
"A second point in my report is the European Civil Peace Corps."
"Once again, one could state with a certain degree of self-mockery that it has developed from a fun plaything of the Greens to a crucial instrument in the EU' s toolbox."
"I would therefore call on the Commission not simply to be grateful to Parliament for the concept of the Civil Peace Corps, as it did five or six years ago, and do nothing else with the idea, but instead to seize the opportunities now, which I am convinced are presenting themselves, to develop this European Peace Corps and to turn it into a central point of EU policy."
"This is possible, not only because I, or Parliament, welcome it, but also because in the meantime, experience has been gathered with civil peace observers."
"The European Union has an observation corps and has observation missions in several places worldwide."
"Germany and Sweden have experience of training civil observers, and I believe that the time has come for the Commission, for the European Union, to better coordinate and pool this expertise and these people, so that in future, the European Union is not only able to act rapidly at military level, but also when it comes to sending civil observers."
"Finally, I have come to the third point, which may well be the most sweeping in my report."
"I would positively welcome it if conflict prevention were to be removed from the remit of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"What do I mean by this?"
"It is no longer acceptable for us to talk about some or other EU policy, for example in the field of agriculture or trade, of which we are of the view that it should serve, for example, to better develop Africa' s economy, while at the same time continue to apply components of that policy - and I would cite the well-known export subsidies - of which we know that locally, in Africa for example, they do not have a stabilising effect."
"If anything, they mess up the economic structure or hamper its development."
"I would prefer it if in future, conflict prevention, like human rights and the environment, were to become a goal of all EU policy, not only in the external policy area, but also in the area of trade and agriculture, for example."
"If that is possible, if it is possible to make conflict prevention a central point in all areas of EU policy, then I will be happy, and what I refer to as a hobbyhorse of the 'soft' forces will then have developed into the favourite subject of the hard core of the EU' s policy abroad and all over the world."
"Mr President, I should like to concur with the observations made a moment ago by the central proponent of conflict prevention, Mr Lagendijk."
"I very often share his views in areas of this kind, for indeed - and we should credit him for this - particularly the green sector has very often put forward the idea of conflict prevention by non-military means with great clarity."
"One could also say that this is very topical in this day and age."
"The European Union is weak as far as its military contribution to international security and national law and order in countries surrounding us are concerned."
"This was clear from the difficulties in setting up this rapid reaction force."
"We got off to a good start, but it is often still in doubt, maybe with good reason, whether this will lead to early results."
"All the more opportunities present themselves to the Union in terms of non-military means. And it appears to me that this also falls more within the competences of the Commission."
"We have competences in this area."
"That is why the civil instrument is gaining in importance, notably for the European Union, in the light of the Union' s military weakness and of the topicality of the civil means in controlling and preventing conflicts alike."
"The cold war is over and the entire security context has changed."
"Large-scale threats have given way to smaller, sometimes persistent, wars with ideological, Mafia-related and ethnic facets."
"The flaring up of such conflicts can be prevented very effectively by civil means, certainly when these conflicts recur."
"This explains the flurry of activity which is also especially being generated by the European Union at the moment in areas of tension or precisely where tension has been averted."
"Situations of lawlessness require a completely different approach and involve the police, government officials, aid organisations, technicians, observers, economists and people who know how the civil society develops."
"In other words, these situations require a comprehensive approach."
"I therefore agree with the provoking statement ""It should be removed from the remit of foreign affairs"" ."
"As far as I am concerned, this means that it requires a comprehensive approach from society."
"This is what matters in conflict control, and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy will probably continue to play an important role, but so will other sections of this Parliament."
"Indeed, a country' s development as a whole also very much relies on averting violent conflict."
"And I have to say that Mr Lagendijk has listed the options very eloquently."
"He is right in saying that we, for example, should not simply accept the existence of this two-pillar structure, that we should put them back on the agenda and that there should be a budget for the things we intend to do in this field."
"In my view, the unity of the European Union, particularly in this field, is a direct security interest."
"We must speak with one voice, even in this field of conflict prevention. We must therefore keep our own activities as governments and as industry in our countries well under control."
"I appreciate the rapporteur' s preference for a peace corps, but I would like to point out that the erratum that I received, which concerns Article 17, is an erratum that is ineffective."
"Article 17 is still an excellent article and I said with good reason that the peace corps must be developed within the framework of the rapid reaction facility."
"We have this framework, and I hope that it is maintained."
"Mr President, the PSE Group sets great store by the debate on the EU' s role in the field of conflict prevention, and we greatly appreciate the efforts the European Commission has made in this connection, and also, of course, the excellent report by Mr Lagendijk."
"This is an important topic, and it is certainly not only a Dutch pastime, even if we perhaps give this impression a little bit with the list of speakers, the first four of which accidentally, very accidentally, happen to hail from that country."
"The European Union is the perfect organisation to play a greater role in preventing conflicts, resolving these or in the subsequent reconstruction."
"The Community is the manifestation of a broad security concept based on economic and political cooperation and on shared values."
"This successful model is about to be exported to Central and Eastern Europe, Cyprus, and Malta, of course."
"Activities are under way in the Balkans with the same intention, and the EU is now facing the task of finding itself a useful role in the reconstruction in Afghanistan."
"In my view, all these actions fall under the umbrella of conflict prevention."
"Despite this, one can still claim that there is already a culture of conflict prevention within the European Union."
"There is sometimes still envy with regard to NATO or the military scope of the United States, as if the European Union would need to emulate this position."
"The military instrument is only one of a whole set of instruments which can be deployed to secure safety."
"It is used as a last resort."
"The aim of conflict prevention is to prevent violence or recurrence thereof by intervening in good time, mainly by using civil instruments."
"If conflict prevention is to become an effective instrument of EU security policy, it must form an integral part of our thoughts and actions."
"This will force the European Union, more often than is now the case, to anticipate and trace hotbeds of conflict in good time."
"It also forces the European Union to develop new instruments, such as rapid reaction facilities, and to considerably improve the three pillars."
"It is easy to think of an example where an effective operation requires instruments from all three pillars."
"At the moment, this is still often a bureaucratic and institutional nightmare to contend with."
"The European Union acquires its strength from the multitude of instruments either available or yet to be developed, including, in a few years' time, the military instrument."
"In order to deploy these effectively for the short or longer term, a kind of conflict prevention centre is needed."
"What is happening where and what are we going to do about it?"
"But ultimately it is also about political will."
"The European Union is active in many, more or less, unstable areas and regions where the level of conflict is mounting, and the European Union should visibly emphasise its conflict prevention policy, more than is now the case, and report on it regularly."
"Its ambition should be to play an equally visible role as NATO but then in the field of conflict prevention and the deployment of civil instruments."
"I believe that most EU citizens would be very proud of such a role."
"The most important exception to general human progress is the inability to prevent violent conflicts."
"Science has reached unknown heights, we are undergoing a communication revolution and erstwhile impenetrable problems can now be solved, but the world is no safer for it."
"In the nineties, some five and a half million people died in 100 armed conflicts and many times more people were driven out of their homes."
"In many countries, the war efforts thwart any form of economic and social development."
"Since 11 September, the Americans have come to realise that our responsibility does not stop at our own borders or the countries that are of strategic importance to us."
"Not only economies are interconnected worldwide, but so too is human suffering."
"We are gaining an increasing insight into the deeper causes of violent conflicts; something which both the Commission and Mr Lagendijk have borne witness to."
"These include the unjust distribution of welfare, religious and ethnic contrasts, a lack of democracy and bad governance."
"Solving these structural problems is both crucial and difficult."
"Better structures must prevent political leaders from indulging in their unbridled hunger for power and wealth undisturbed."
"Time and again, it is the masses that are the victims in the struggle for power of which they themselves form no part."
"For the first time, our generations experience large-scale contact between civilisations, cultures and religions, and this is bound to lead to a lack of understanding and intolerance initially."
"The cause of this is that cultures and religions take their own values and standards too much for granted."
"However, believers all over the world not only believe, they know for certain. And if faith becomes an element in ones own dissatisfaction, this can easily lead to disastrous extremism."
"The effective management of conflict prevention and globalisation of value systems is the greatest challenge of this time, and Europe must, in tandem with the United States - that is very important - adopt a strategy which tackles these conflicts at the root."
"If the European Union wishes to strengthen its conflict-preventing role, also in the light of Cotonou, it must be adequately equipped."
"Resistance in many governments to reinforcing the Commission and its delegations is pernicious for the effective implementation of European policy."
"Impressive speeches this morning by the Sakharov prize-winners have allowed us to share in the immense grief and also the moral strength of these victims of senseless violence."
"There is little hope as long as tolerance is regarded as treason and the eye-for-an-eye principle leads to blindness, as is the case in the Middle East and Angola."
"There is only hope if we actually tackle the injustices, and if tolerance, mutual understanding and intense dialogue all over the world become the leading principles."
"After the economy and science, it is now the turn of moral values to make progress."
"Mr President, conflict prevention cannot consist only of rapid reaction mechanisms and contingents of police."
"Conflict prevention, as Jost Lagendijk has already said, means for our Group that all EU policies should be aimed at the reduction and prevention of conflict."
"It means cutting agricultural export aid, opening EU markets to sensitive products, a trade policy characterised by social justice and, above all, preferential trading relationships only where respect for human rights is guaranteed."
"There is no doubt in our mind that the Gothenburg Resolution marks a milestone for European foreign policy, yet, despite that, what now matters is that we should not only talk about the need for conflict prevention but also do something about it."
"This means that a culture of prevention must be created in the European Union, and that it must permeate all its political dealings."
"Stopping all armaments exports and supplies of small arms to potential areas of conflict will play a crucial role."
"Support for human rights and sustainable development must be the core objective of European foreign policy."
"Conflicts can, though, only be successfully prevented if the civil actors are involved, and so we propose the establishment of a platform for NGOs and cooperation with them."
"This would mean financial support for non-governmental organisations, but that would be significantly cheaper than armed conflicts."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to state that the majority of Members in our Group are in favour of this excellent report by Mr Lagendijk."
"However, there is an issue which affects the very essence of this report: September 11."
"There is a 'before' and an 'after' September 11, which brings to light the weaknesses in this fundamentally important approach which the EU has taken towards conflict prevention."
"I think that we should make it very clear that we need more information on those secret services, which, taking as an example those of the United States, have been supporting a State, such as the Taliban in Afghanistan, which have later become a public enemy of the whole world."
"There is another issue of great importance, which also appears in the Lagendijk report, which has not been mentioned until now: that either the European Union chooses to give its wholehearted support to the United Nations and the efforts of the UN to use international law to resolve conflicts, or it will continue to be the world superpower, the United States, that makes the most important decisions and we Europeans will be virtually powerless, only able to put on tiny sticking plasters to cover the wounds that have been inflicted."
"This is the reason why it is important that we implement what is set out in the Lagendijk report."
"Another aspect I would like to mention is the importance of the economic dimension, which, there can be no doubt, is the cause of many conflicts, and we have to see this also in a global perspective."
"For this reason, we have to clarify certain statements, because sometimes wide-scale liberalisation can be a greater evil than the possibility of protection."
"Mr President, I should like to use this brief contribution to say a few words of appreciation for the Lagendijk report."
"The rapporteur, however, is advised to prick up his ears now, for I was the only nay in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy."
"Unexpected support from an opponent?"
"Indeed, when it comes to the substance of the report."
"I appreciate Mr Lagendijk' s integral approach to conflict prevention. Not only with regard to the explicit causes of conflict, but also with regard to the hidden implications of policy that has ostensibly very little to do with conflicts."
"I therefore endorse the call to the Commission to carefully study the impact of European policy on local conflicts."
"However, where the tasks of the European Union in conflict prevention are concerned, I do not share the rapporteur' s view."
"Recognising greater international connections, he calls for an extensive role for the EU."
"I have my reservations about this."
"Out of appreciation for the report and so as not the create the impression of opposing conflict prevention, I will change my vote against to an abstention."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Lagendijk on his excellent report on conflict prevention, a subject on which Parliament' s position has always been very clear."
"There can be no doubt that the best way to win a war is to prevent it from happening in the first place and in order to do this there is no better weapon than to be able to see it coming."
"That is to say, to find the underlying causes of war and to work to resolve them."
"In order to do this, it is essential that we do not take a solely horizontal approach - an approach quite rightly proposed by Mr Lagendijk -, that is to say, one that includes all of the European Union' s common policies, but also a global approach, which includes the whole of society."
"From this point of view non-structural methods to promote reconciliation are important, above all in those regions emerging from conflict."
"Without these methods, all of the international community' s peace efforts, or those of the very local communities which the conflict has created, could come to nothing, given that the least dispute can once again light the flames of hatred that had provoked or been the cause of the conflict in the first place."
"We need - and I address this particularly to the Commission - to dedicate not only more attention but, above all, more resources to education for peace programmes, along the lines of the work carried out by Mr Mayor Zaragoza when he was the Director-General of Unesco and which Kofi Annan reminded us of a few days ago."
"On the other hand, if control of the arms trade is very important, then so is the traffic in diamonds and raw materials."
"In this respect, I would also ask the Commission to tell us which methods it intends to adopt in order to improve, and make more efficient, the code of conduct with regard to the control of the trafficking in diamonds, in particular, given that, as the European institutions and the United Nations themselves have reported, on many occasions the fight for raw materials is behind many of the world' s conflicts, especially in Africa."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, Europe is continuing to pay for a well-established failing in its conflict prevention policies: we are slow, predictable and not sufficiently authoritative."
"I therefore feel that one of the strong points of Mr Lagendijk' s report is that it sees the point at which a political institution such as Europe acquires legitimacy in terms of conflict prevention rather than military force, and it gains legitimacy in the knowledge, not least, that sustainable, equitable peace must be pursued through politics, certainly not through military force."
"We particularly welcome the way Mr Lagendijk' s report sees conflict prevention as a result of Europe' s social policies rather than just the effect of good judicial cooperation, although we must never renounce that."
"Social policies mean that prevention, the ability to predict, to prevent and to resolve conflicts before they happen must be part of all European Union policies, as has already been pointed out by other Members, and these policies must provide for an investment in terms of both financing and human resources."
"In this sense, we feel that the number of European Union delegations to other countries is completely inadequate to meet the requirements of the prevention policy."
"As Mr Lagendijk said, we must avoid development cooperation becoming conflict cooperation, and we must therefore be particularly careful, rigorous and rational in developing all our economic policies."
"Lastly, I share your criticism of the Council and the Commission for not having accepted in the last six years - and six years is an extremely long time in which countless conflicts occur - the proposal put forward by Parliament at that time to institute a European civil peace corps."
"We must prevent conflict, and in order to prevent conflict it is often necessary to take risks, and that is what we are asking the Council, the Commission and Parliament to do."
"Mr President, it is good to remind ourselves that at the moment there are many people listening other than those in this House."
"I should like to congratulate Mr Lagendijk, precisely on this symbolic day when we awarded the Sakharov Prize to peace activists from Israel, Palestine and Angola."
"In my opinion, by broadening our horizons, we retain a sense of realism."
"We must assess our present actions in the Middle East and Africa, with three million victims in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and we will need to evaluate what we need to do in Afghanistan."
"We must avoid conflicts, conflicts that become militarised or that flare up again."
"This requires an integral approach, as has already been underlined by many fellow MEPs."
"In my one and a half minutes, I should particularly like to draw your attention to one aspect in the report, namely the Civil Peace Corps."
"Commissioner Patten, I really expect you to come up with an initiative."
"I am amazed at how much money and how many people can be mobilised over the course of a few months to start a war."
"Could we not work in an equally focused manner, deploy as many resources, people, when it comes to keeping the peace and preventing war?"
"And that is why I applaud this Civil Peace Corps."
"The funding and the framework are in place. If the political will is there, then what are we waiting for!"
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his sterling work and focus on three paragraphs towards the end of the report."
"Paragraph 24 addresses the need for increased cooperation between the EU and the UN, as well as between the EU and the OSCE."
"In this context, I should like to take this opportunity to ask the Commissioner responsible for external relations, Mr Patten, about his view on the methods for strengthening co-operation specifically between the UN and the OSCE."
"I would also like to draw attention to paragraph 27 on the proliferation of light weapons and small arms and the need for a joint code of conduct for arms exports."
"Last but not least, I would like to focus on paragraph 28 on the significance of education as a key element in conflict prevention."
"It is a real shame that we cannot have a debate here between the rapporteur and us Members of the European Parliament, as I wonder what view of humanity and what ethic and morals are to form the basis for this work on conflict prevention."
"Is it not the case that conflict prevention and democracy ultimately rely on reconciliation, compromise and the ability of each and every one of us to tolerate a defeat?"
"Finally, on a slightly more personal note, as a member of this Parliament I was dismayed when around 200 Members filed out as Kim Dae Jung was about to speak."
"One of Asia' s very greatest advocates of democracy and human rights, Kim Dae Jung has paid a very high personal price for his fight for democracy."
"Two hundred Members walked out when he was due to speak."
"This is no way to maintain the dignity of Parliament."
"Rather, it brought shame on this House."
"Mr President, Commissioner, a few hours ago we heard three personalities whom we have awarded the Sakharov Prize."
"We were moved by the speeches and inspired by their example, but we were also left with an uncomfortable feeling."
"Uncomfortable because, while there is no doubt that in the European Parliament we have succeeded in identifying the ways to prevent and resolve conflicts and recognise, even before others do, who can promote them, we have lacked the effective capacity to influence such processes."
"I remember having attended a meeting chaired by President Nicole Fontaine at the beginning of this year, with Commander Massoud."
"At the time, few people were interested in the visit and we were unable to mobilise sufficient support to bolster Commander Massoud' s position and, perhaps, prevent some of the great tragedies that followed."
"We therefore welcome the Commission' s communication and acknowledge its work and merit."
"We fully agree with the strategic principle set out by the Commission, and I quote, ""the development policy and other cooperation programmes constitute the most powerful instruments the Community has to deal with the causes of conflicts"" ."
"We support the aims of the document generally; however, we also feel, as does the rapporteur, that there are a few vague aspects, possibly prejudiced by the rigidity of the current system of support."
"We believe priority should be given to a strong and serious effort in terms of interinstitutional cooperation."
"The specific aspects of this are listed very thoroughly by the rapporteur, whom we congratulate."
"But I would like to emphasise one aspect: the role of the Commission' s delegations should be reinforced, which also leads us to the issue of the external representation of the Union."
"The document of the Commission, referring to the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, mentions joint training of diplomats. And my question is: when will there be programmes for joint training of diplomats within the European Union itself?"
"Mr President, there were enough warnings before the crisis in Kosovo really got under way."
"Before 11 September, Afghanistan was on the EU' s list of forgotten crisis regions."
"I think these are two examples of the way in which we are all too often all too wise all too late."
"Unfortunately, when it is too late there is every willingness to employ quite fabulous sums on military action."
"This is in stark contrast to the willingness to employ resources on civil crisis prevention and on peacekeeping."
"Now, the EU has decided to play an active role in conflict prevention in Africa."
"That is something I view in positive terms."
"However, we should also play a more active and independent role in relation to the conflict in the Middle East."
"That role has unfortunately fallen somewhat by the wayside since 11 September."
"The Sakharov Prize is not enough."
"We must make pro-active use of the tariff agreement in this crisis."
"Mr President, what concerns us is that conflict prevention using military means is just the other side of the same coin, by which I mean of the intervention policy of the European Union, which has nominated itself international peacemaker, especially in crises and conflicts which it itself foments, so that it can then intervene and save the day."
"Of course, the objective is always the same: to suppress the progressive grass-roots movement and advance the interests of big business in Europe."
"The report by the member of the Group of the Greens, Mr Lagendijk, is not, unfortunately, free of the political, economic and military interventionist spirit."
"Without doubt, as the rapporteur himself acknowledged today, the right hand of the proposed non-military rapid reaction unit and European police force will be the European army, which the Laeken Summit will be busy preparing in a few day's time."
"Anyway, an official source in the European Union has already stated that military solutions will be imposed wherever political proposals are rejected."
"That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece cannot vote in favour of the report..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Lagendijk for another excellent report. I would also like to welcome his challenging remarks today about, for example, the civil peace corps which I suspect will continue to be a subject of lively debate."
"Above all I would like to thank him for what he said about the external aspects of sustainable development."
"That is a subject on which we should all focus our attention in the run-up to the Johannesburg Conference next year."
"I hope in particular that Parliament will take a special interest in some of the issues he raised, which are of fundamental importance if we are to be credible on sustainable development."
"This is a topical debate."
"Mr Wiersma suggested it was a Dutch hobby."
"I am bound to say that, if it is, it is an extremely good Dutch hobby and I recommend it to every one of the Member States."
"There is a growing appreciation of the need to reinforce our efforts to tackle the factors that make conflict and violence arise in the first place."
"In the last century, conflict tended to be between states; I do not argue that sort conflict is over and done with."
"But in today' s world we face a new type of danger - the failed state, the state that is a danger to its own people and a menace to the rest of the world."
"Let me be crystal clear."
"Nothing excuses or mitigates terrorism."
"But in rooting out terrorism, we have to work to make sure that the world is hostile terrain - not fertile ground - for terrorists and those who back them."
"That can mean taking tough military action, as we do from time to time."
"But it also means exporting and entrenching democracy, the rule of law and good government; it means liberalising world trade, and using that and our development assistance to shrink the gap between the richest and the poorest, in a world in which the planet's three richest men own the equivalent of the GDP of the 48 poorest countries."
"Earlier this year, the Commission published the communication setting out our new strategy of conflict prevention."
"It is based on four main objectives."
"First, we want to make a more systematic and coordinated use of the European Union's instruments to address the root causes of conflict."
"Simply put, we want to get better leverage from our position as the world' s largest donor and as the top trading bloc."
"We are starting by integrating conflict prevention into our strategies towards partner countries, taking account of conflict indicators, for example, in our country strategy papers."
"The second objective of our communication is to raise the effectiveness of our actions in tackling 'cross-cutting issues' such as trafficking in drugs or arms, the trading of illicit goods, environmental degradation and so on. On all these fronts, the challenge is immense."
"Let me just take, for example, the issue raised by Mrs Ferrer."
"The Commission has played, over the last few months, an active role in the Kimberley process, dealing with conflict diamonds."
"That is aimed at establishing an international control regime for the import and export of rough diamonds."
"After the political agreement reached at Gaborone, two weeks ago, between the participants in this process, the Commission is now launching the preparatory work for the full implementation by the Community of the control regime in the course of next year."
"The third objective is to develop our ability to respond rapidly to emerging crises."
"Concrete recommendations have been put forward, notably to improve the CFSP instruments, such as political dialogue or the use of special representatives."
"I can only agree with Mr Lagendijk that 'conflict prevention implies stronger commitment and political direction on the part of the Member States, as the Community instruments alone are not enough to resolve all possible sources of conflict'."
"What is required is a bit more of that old-fashioned commodity - political will."
"At Community level, we have set up, at my initiative, a special rapid reaction mechanism to equip us to respond with the speed that events in the real world demand, but which the Commission' s procedures are not always brilliantly designed to cope with."
"It is now fully operational, and is proving invaluable in current crises, for example in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and in Afghanistan where I hope to use the mechanism first of all to provide support for Ambassador Brahimi's team, secondly to provide support for the interim administration and, thirdly, to begin the work of demining."
"The fourth message is to promote international cooperation with governments, international organisations and civil society."
"The honourable Member raised this."
"Mr Sacrédeus raised this as well."
"The UN is a key partner here."
"We have a new framework, agreed by the General Affairs Council in June, for EU-UN enhanced cooperation on conflict prevention and crisis management."
"As recommended by Mr Lagendijk, I am ready to work together with the Council on an enhanced framework for cooperation with the OSCE."
"Let me finish by giving you one example of what we have we done and what we are doing concretely in a key zone of conflict."
"I am just back from the Great Lakes region where we had a useful troika mission."
"Last month, we committed funds under the rapid reaction mechanism to support the inter-Congolese dialogue, to launch preparatory actions for the reintegration of child soldiers and to support independent media or other confidence-building initiatives."
"In November, we also committed money under the CFSP budget to finance the South African Guard Support Unit for the protection of the recently returned political leaders in Burundi."
"I was pleased to be able to meet them and have a briefing from them."
"In the region, we continue to carry out rehabilitation, to deliver humanitarian aid and to contribute to poverty alleviation."
"We stand ready to finance demilitarisation and demobilisation programmes as soon as they get started."
"So we are, I hope and believe, raising our game."
"We were starting to do so before the horrific events of three months ago which the honourable Member referred to."
"But we know now how much is at stake; we know how preventing conflict abroad is vital to our own security here at home."
"We know that we cannot slacken our efforts, but rather, as Mr Lagendijk has argued, we need to redouble those efforts."
"That is the very least we should be doing in response to the atrocities of 11 September."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"EU Relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran"
"The next item is the debate on report (A5-0418/2001) by Mr Gahler, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on EU relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran [COM(2001) 71 - C5-0338/2001 - 2001/2138(COS)]."
"Before we move on to the debate, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that there is going to be a slight alteration to the timetable: with a great deal of effort, we are going to exceed the time limit of 7 p.m."
"With the cooperation of the interpretation service, I think that we can work until 7.15 p.m., which means that, from 7.15 p.m. there will be no interpretation service, no Commissioner and no President, because we all have other commitments."
"I am sorry to have to tell you this, but this is the truth of the matter."
"However, I think that the best way to deal with this situation is to let the rapporteur speak, then the Commissioner, and then the Members of this House, depending on how much time we have left."
"Therefore, the more concise we can be, the more possibility there will be of ending the debate before 7.15 p.m."
"For those of you who will not be able to speak, you will have the chance to do so once again when we resume at 9 p.m. tonight."
"Mr Gahler has the floor."
", rapporteur."
"(DE) Mr President, I think we will get the last speakers just before the break."
"On 7 February this year, the Commission published a communication on relations between the EU and Iran, in which it notes that dialogue, which began in 1995, has from 1998 onwards been in the form of half-yearly consultations between the troika and the Iranian Government and has taken on a comprehensive character, including global issues such as terrorism, human rights and the proliferation of nuclear weapons, as well as regional issues and cooperation in the areas of drugs, refugees, energy, trade and investment."
"According to this communication, the EU, with about 40% of Iranian imports, is Iran's biggest trading partner, but at the same time bilateral relations are impeded by the absence of the framework that a treaty could provide."
"The Commission recommends development of closer relations building on the progress made in the following areas: the rule of law, minority rights, freedom of the press, legislative and economic framework conditions and Iran's role in foreign relations and its position on security issues."
"Since the communication was published, President Khatami has been confirmed in office by a seventy-five per cent majority, and the world's attention has been focused on Iran's immediate neighbours by the terrorist attacks in the USA, which Iran has unambiguously condemned."
"The draft Council decision on negotiation guidelines for a trade and cooperation agreement with Iran, drafted by the Commission, was delivered to the Council on 20 November."
"In this report, I have especially tried to shed light on Iran's internal developments in the political, economic and social spheres and to draw from them political conclusions for our attitude towards Iran."
"My concern was to explore the EU's interests in enhanced commercial exchanges in view of the country's wealth of raw materials, but also in political dialogue on the fight against terrorism and the trade in drugs, and our respective contributions and potential contributions to resolving the Middle East conflict."
"In addition, I would particularly like to make it clear that we in this Parliament take the Commission and the Council at their word, when they take progress in the rule of law, minority rights and press freedom as their benchmark when assessing to what extent relations should be stepped up."
"We welcome on principle the planned trade and cooperation agreement and do not make its conclusion conditional on the prior attainment of a specified standard when it comes to the rule of law and respect for human rights."
"I wish to highlight two reasons why that requirement can be dispensed with."
"One is that we expect the agreement to include a human rights clause comparable to the Cotonou Agreement, which will help us at any time to effectively demand adherence to the international agreements Iran has signed on this subject."
"The formularies on this subject in the preamble to the draft mandate, and the general reference to the final provisions on the possibility of suspension in the event of grave offences against significant elements of the treaty do not strike me as adequate."
"I am, moreover, convinced that Iranian civil society is capable of implementing under its own steam the reforms appropriate to a modern and developing Islamic society."
"Its intellectual potential, shown by its students, press and cultural life, is clear to outsiders."
"Looked at as a whole, this country, with its culture and natural raw materials combined with human resources has in essence every chance of opening up to a better future."
"However, the fact that elements in the judiciary and the clergy find it necessary to repeatedly ban newspapers, which then often re-establish themselves under new names, shows something of its dualism and contradictions and, in the final analysis, of the still-open question of who should wield power - a question which dominates in almost every area of this society."
"The most recent example of this is the disappearance of the journalist and film critic Siamak Pourzand, to which the PEN Club drew attention on 5 December."
"We have seen appalling photos in magazines of death sentences being carried out, as they have been to an increasing extent. There have been repeated reports of stoning being used as a method of execution, and there have been many public floggings this year, all of which indicate that ever greater effort is required to keep civil society in check."
"The most recent reports by the United Nations also, and also the report of 12 November by Maurice Copithorne, the Special Representative of the Commission on Human Rights, are noticeably more critical than their equivalents in previous years, in terms of their estimate of the situation and the language they use."
"All this makes it, in my view, a matter of urgent necessity that we should for our part build up our contacts and thereby strengthen the forces that the majority of the population know to be behind them."
"By that I mean the forces that are in Parliament demanding greater freedom for the press and more rights for women; and the economic sector, which wants to demolish the encrusted structures and to promote a constructive role for Iran in the Middle East peace process."
"It is our desire that these forces be encouraged by parliamentary dialogue, so that they may better do justice to the task committed to them by the electorate and to the hopes and expectations of society."
"The contradictoriness I have mentioned runs like a thread through other areas."
"I gather that Iran, although not actually at the table of the Afghanistan conference in Bonn, played a very constructive role behind the scenes."
"I think that should definitely be mentioned to Iran's credit."
"Iran could, on the other hand, exert a more moderating influence on certain groups tending to seek confrontation in the Middle East."
"The European Parliament will not, though, do a deal on human rights in exchange for participation in the anti-terror coalition."
"I expect the Council and the Commission to take a similar line."
"Women have struggled to gain a number of positions in parliament, government, administration and culture, more so, perhaps, than in other neighbouring states."
"On the other hand, regulations on clothing are imposed on them by male exegetes of the Koran, along with much else besides."
"Nor are they adequately represented in many areas of society."
"They are quite explicitly not on an equal footing as regards many aspects of the law, for example in family law."
"We must - and will - treat all this as a central theme, just as we will acknowledge any progress made."
"I would like, in this context, to thank all my colleagues whose amendments have further improved this report."
"What mattered to me was that none of the facts should be passed over in silence, but also that the words used should not unnecessarily make the commencement of dialogue more difficult."
"It is important in the economic sphere that it be made clear to the Iranians that fundamental reforms are needed, such as, in external terms, conformity with the standards set by the WTO and the opening-up of the market to overseas investors and their products; collaboration in combating drugs is in the interests of both parties, and changes in Afghanistan mean that we must play our part in putting an end to their transit via Iran."
"There is an extensive agenda for this dialogue."
"We in Parliament want to make contact with our colleagues in the Iranian parliament."
"I hope I can count on your support."
"I very much welcome this report and congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Gahler, on his excellent work."
"I hope the House will understand if I am not able to be here until the end of the debate, but the Commission will be represented."
"As a regional power, Iran has an important influence on developments in its area that has sometimes been called the arc of crisis."
"We in the European Union have every interest in encouraging the authorities in Teheran to use this influence constructively, to promote stability, cooperation and development in the region."
"And as the process of reform and liberalisation goes forward in Iran, we also have every interest to develop our bilateral relations as we tried to do with our troika visit a few weeks ago."
"Over the past few years, and especially since the first election of President Khatami in 1997, the European Union has engaged in a broad dialogue with Iran."
"It has been useful but now we should go much further."
"That is why we recently presented draft directives for the negotiation of a trade and cooperation agreement."
"Once we have a contractual basis for our relationship, we will be in a much better position to develop exchanges not just in the economic area, but also on matters such as migration, drugs, energy and the environment."
"That will also give us a sounder basis, with real shared interests, for continuing and deepening our political dialogue with Iran on regional and international issues."
"We have welcomed Iran's constructive and measured response to the atrocities of 11 September, to which the honourable Member referred."
"Even before those terrible events President Khatami launched a very useful initiative in the UN for a Dialogue between Civilisations."
"I was interested myself to have an exchange with the president about the works of Nicolo Machiavelli."
"I have the impression that Iran fully understands the importance of implementing UN Security Resolution 1373 in the financial fight against terrorism, the need to ratify the twelve existing anti-terrorist conventions, and the need for a comprehensive convention."
"In the aftermath of 11 September and in line with the efforts of the global coalition against terrorism, there will be increased scrutiny and less tolerance of states attempting to build arsenals of weapons of mass destruction."
"In this regard Iran has adhered to the relevant treaties and conventions, but we want to see additional steps and increased transparency."
"Full compliance with these agreements is essential."
"We will also welcome co-operation to ensure a better future for Afghanistan under a new, broadly based administration."
"We wholeheartedly support and encourage the process of reform in Iran."
"But unfortunately things have slipped in the last year."
"We share the concerns expressed by the UN Special Rapporteur, Mr Copithorne, in his recent report on human rights in Iran."
"So we still have to adopt UN resolutions on this subject."
"I believe we should explore other ways of conducting a more effective human rights dialogue with Iran, and I have begun this dialogue with the Iranian Foreign Ministry."
"I have repeatedly told my Iranian interlocutors that we are keen to do that, if they also show a real commitment to reform."
"The growing contacts of the Iranian authorities with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs Robinson, is a promising sign, as is the recent agreement between the UNDP and the Islamic Human Rights Commission on human rights covering monitoring and capacity building."
"A lot more can and should be done, and the Commission will watch these developments closely and contribute in whatever way we can."
"The potential for EU/Iran cooperation in trade, energy and economic matters is enormous."
"That is recognised in our draft mandate for a trade and cooperation agreement."
"The discussion among Member States in the Council has already got under way and I hope it will soon lead to a decision allowing us to start negotiations."
"As always, there will be some difficulties on detail, but I am confident that everyone accepts that we have a strategic opportunity to develop our relationship with Iran."
"In reply to some of the queries in the report, I can confirm that there will of course be a clause on human rights in the agreement, as there is in all our agreements with third countries."
"Equally, we will include provisions on readmission of illegal immigrants, while also developing our cooperation with the Iranian authorities on the broader issues of migration."
"Finally, I share the honourable Member's pre-occupation with the drugs control issue."
"I know that our Iranian counterparts do as well."
"So I expect that the agreement will also help us extend and deepen cooperation in this area."
"And in terms of the structure of our dialogue with Iran, I wholeheartedly support the suggestion of closer parliamentary contacts."
"To conclude, let me thank Mr Gahler again for a very well-argued and balanced report on EU-Iran relations."
"I take note of the constructive comments, and am pleased to see that the report encourages the line pursued by the Commission, including the establishment of contractual relations with Iran."
"I will report back to Parliament on the progress that is made."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"If the debate continues after 9 p.m., then the Commission will of course be represented and will be willing to answer your questions."
"However, I thought it would be more appropriate for the competent Commissioner to speak at this time."
"Mr President, Iran is particularly noteworthy since it is an area that is surrounded by all manner of countries undergoing turbulence: Afghanistan, the southern Caucasus, Iraq and further away, Palestine."
"That in itself is reason enough for expressly concerning ourselves with that country and especially because what we see happening there is not only negative, for there are also some positive developments."
"This is why it makes sense to call for a dual-track policy: on the one hand, to maintain effective cooperation in the field of trade, the fight against drugs, against terrorism and such like, and possible cooperation in the reception of refugees, which is a full-scale problem in Iran at the moment, and on the other hand to level tough, clear and honest criticism on everything that contravenes the rule of law, democracy and human rights."
"In my view, backed by the underlying attitude that we would like to see more democracy in Iran and the introduction of the rule of law - this can be encouraged in all kinds of ways - we could break through the deadlock which has come about in Iran in the wake of its conflict with the United States."
"The EU' s own attitude could possibly break this deadlock, and this is why I warmly welcome what the rapporteur has stated."
"We should bear in mind that Shiite Iran, of course, represents, in fact, a modern version of Islam, although there are all kinds of things which we do not like, particularly the fact that a clericracy has declared itself a theocracy, which has always sounded rather blasphemous to me, and which means that the normal, human wishes of young people and women are suppressed."
"On the other hand, we should note that the career opportunities of women too can indeed withstand the test of modernity."
"With regard to the introduction of democratic wishes, we hear of quite a few positive developments."
"In any case, I should like to subscribe to the rapporteur' s conclusion that it is a logical step for us to contact the parliament in Iran, and offer my congratulations to the rapporteur."
"Mr President, I feel that this is a balanced report on a complex subject. Its merit is that it lists the signals of progressive opening-up coming from Iran, particularly from its people, who, in the last elections, quite clearly expressed their desire for a policy of economic, social and political reform."
"However, at the same time, the ultimate point of reference for us, for the European Union and for Parliament must be respect for human rights."
"In this sense, I think we can say to the rapporteur that we do not support some of the amendments he has submitted for the perusal of this plenary in that they seem to be inspired by excessive indulgence in the area of human rights, an area in which we must never make any concessions."
"Of course, the Iranian Government has condemned the violence of the destruction which took place on 11 September in New York; of course, it declared its willingness to discuss human rights issues - we welcome that just as we welcome the way that women too have been able to resume their role in the course of recent years in institutions and in schools and university education, and also the Iranian Government' s responsible endeavours to help stabilise the region."
"However, certain facts remain, such as the unfulfilled expectations of Iranian society and the international community regarding the abolition of torture, the abolition of the death penalty, the abolition of the special religious courts and press courts and the abolition of particularly degrading and humiliating punishments."
"I believe our task is to encourage the democratic forces, civil society and the many women and students who feel that, in the struggle between theocracy and democracy, it is possible for democracy to prevail."
"We need to urge the Iranian Government to fully respect the mandate it has received from its people."
"Lastly, we must promote political dialogue between the European Union and Iran."
"In this sense, we are in favour of sending an ad hoc delegation to Iran and we hope, in particular, that the European Union will be able to play a full, useful political role to help Iran find its own path to democracy as soon as possible."
"I feel, Mr President, that it is never our place to judge."
"Encouragement and persuasion are part of the spirit of this report and must also characterise the way the European Union reinvigorates its relationship with Iran in the future."
"Mr President, we in the Group of the Greens have absolutely nothing against improving economic, cultural and other relations with Iran."
"As Commissioner Patten and Mr Gahler have said, positive moves are being made, but there is also much that is negative."
"Improved relations should not lead to criticism being weakened."
"This report raises the issue of whether criticism of a country with which general cooperation is improving needs to be toned down."
"I believe this is a wholly incorrect view but, unfortunately, it appears to be the view of those on the right in this House, who wish to water down Mr Gahler' s report."
"In contrast, we believe that the Gahler report has its merits, but that it is too weak and must be made bolder on a number of points."
"We have therefore submitted no fewer than ten amendments, of which I will mention only two."
"Amendment No 13 is based on the proposal submitted by the EU to the UN, in which the Council is stronger in its criticism than Mr Gahler is in his report."
"The amendment mentions issues such as stoning, which continues to occur."
"I heard Mr Gahler mention it orally just now, but it is not included in the resolution."
"I see this as watering down."
"It is an omission not to clearly state that we utterly condemn such a terrible form of punishment."
"There are a number of other matters which we believe should be included and which we have addressed in our Amendment No 13."
"Amendment No. 19 states that Iran is not a safe country for refugees."
"It is very important to point out, in these times of strong sentiment in favour of expelling people from within the EU in a quite haphazard manner, that Iran is a highly unsafe destination for refugees."
"Mr President, what I want to say is that the events of 11 September have, I think, made us all much wiser."
"The human cost was tremendous but they made us all much wiser, both us and Iran, I think, and we understand the need for new bridges, dialogue, discussion and cooperation between the European Union and Iran to get under way in such an extended, important and dangerous area of instability."
"I think that both the troika and Commissioner Patten have done interesting work and I think that the report and the motion for a resolution are generally on the right tack."
"However, I must say that there is a little schizophrenia going on."
"I am worried that the report contains a double message."
"It is like saying to a neighbour with whom you are on bad terms, for whom you have little respect left, ""Let us sit at the same table, but just remember that I think you a vulgar, good-for-nothing thief""."
"That is more or less what our report says."
"In paragraph 19, for example, we are, I think, directly intervening in Iran's internal affairs, given the past pattern, the lack of faith in even in the most straightforward people in Iran, who look at the United States, Great Britain and the European Union and suspect that they are about to come and impose their control again."
"This being so, I think that we should tread very carefully."
"We need to be in favour of the reforms."
"Not for the reformists or against the conservatives."
"As with any other country, we only have the right to insist on our own terms, based on the principles of the European Union and European culture, as the basis for meetings and discussion, but not for intervention if Khatami behaves or the clerics do not."
"Because we shall be the ones opening up an opposition front in the European Union."
"I think that the logic behind our past and present approach to Turkey, which is now a candidate for integration into the European Union, should also inform our relations with Iran."
"This does not mean, I repeat, that we should underestimate the importance either of basic questions of human democratic rights, women's rights, prisoners' rights or the rights of religious minorities."
"If we are careful, I think that these steps, which are important to both sides, can be taken."
"Mr President, as an historian and ex-journalist, I have been quite fascinated by the emergence of, and developments within, the Islamic Republic of Iran over the years."
"This particularly applies to the country' s internal power struggle which flared up recently."
"An interesting phenomenon in this connection is that quite a few current reform-minded people were once advocates of the power system they now denounce."
"It is only natural that the conservative forces in Iran consider this sense of reform as an erosion of the political system."
"They control the essential positions of power and neutralise reformist initiatives at their discretion."
"They do not eschew highly repressive means."
"With this, we have, in fact, outlined the duality in Iranian society."
"The very detailed report by Mr Gahler analyses this in more detail."
"We are on the side of the Iranian reformists."
"They pursue a more open society and openly denounce coercion in religious matters."
"Their fervent opponents, on the other hand, create an uncertain internal climate."
"Our hesitation about endorsing a formal trade and cooperation agreement between the EU and Iran is epitomised by two concerns."
"These are the violations of constitutional rights - think of the beleaguered position of religious minorities in that country - and the material support to terrorist Lebanese and Palestinian organisations."
"On the other hand, an agreement would give us a formal foundation for addressing Tehran on a permanent basis with regard to the social abuses cited by Mr Gahler."
"It is of crucial importance, however, that we do not wish to isolate the forces of change internationally in ancient Persia."
"In fact, this course of action corresponds to the wishes of the majority of the population."
"Like the reform-minded forces in the Islamic Republic, Iranian citizens are reaching out to the west, to Europe for help. We must lend a truly helping hand."
"Thank you, Mr Belder."
"This presidency would like to sincerely thank Mr Souladakis for his cooperation this session."
"He will obviously be able to speak tomorrow as an extraordinary explanation of vote."
"If he wants to repeat his whole speech as an explanation of vote, he will have the opportunity to do so tomorrow."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.22 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Maritime safety"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report (A5-0440/2001) by Mr Watts, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 95/21/EC concerning the enforcement, in respect of shipping using Community ports and sailing in the waters under the jurisdiction of the Member States, of international standards for ship safety, pollution prevention and shipboard living and working conditions (port State control) (PE-CONS 3657/2001 - C5-0525/2001 - 2000/0065(COD));"
"the report (A5-0441/2001) by Mr Ortuondo Larrea, on behalf of European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 94/57/EC on common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations and for the relevant activities of maritime administrations (PE-CONS 3656/2001 - C5-0526/2001 - 2000/0066(COD));"
"the recommendation for second reading (A5-0344/2001), by Mr Hatzidakis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation on the accelerated phasing-in of double hull or equivalent design standards for single hull oil tankers and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 2978/94 (10221/1/2001 - C5-0389/2001 - 2000/0067(COD))."
"Mr President, I should like to begin, perhaps unusually for me, by thanking the various people who have made this evening possible, in particular the Commissioner and all her staff within the maritime unit of her DG, and the maritime safety unit in particular."
"Also the Council, who are not represented this evening, but it should go on record how helpful the Belgian Presidency has been. I should also like to say how helpful the French presidency was in making sure that we made rapid progress."
"I should also like to thank my colleagues in the European Parliament who stood together through this process, with the difficult challenges we faced, but which we overcame together."
"Because of that we are able tonight to celebrate a historic victory for the European institutions in the field of maritime safety."
"Together we have achieved a great deal."
"I will not dwell on the other reports."
"My fellow rapporteurs will do that."
"I should like to focus on my report on port state control, which is an essential part of our regime to make sure that events such as that involving the Erika never happen again."
"Two years ago today the Erika was a symptom of a failed system of maritime safety."
"It was not the first of its kind, nor, sadly, was it the last maritime disaster of its kind."
"It symbolised to me and my colleagues in the European Parliament the fact that the flag state controls had failed."
"The classification society controls had failed."
"The port state controls had failed and the IMO itself had failed."
"It is only because of the collective action of the European Union and its institutions that we have stimulated in the last two years unparalleled levels of activity in the field of maritime safety."
"Without the European Union, we would not be as advanced today as we are."
"We should all be very pleased that we have the European Union to spearhead action in this area."
"What do we have to be so pleased and proud about?"
"I want to list some of the achievements that we have secured in respect of port state control."
"Firstly, there is going to be mandatory inspection for certain ships."
"That is an innovation and I welcome it."
"It means that the most dangerous ships will be inspected in future."
"Secondly, enhanced inspection for other categories of ships and, thirdly, the guidelines on inspections themselves will become mandatory."
"In other words port state control authorities will have to inspect certain types of ships in certain ways."
"Fourthly, we want the Member States that have been a weak link in the system to train and recruit adequate numbers of port state control inspectors."
"They will have until 2003 to do that, but it is a challenge for them and it is a challenge, I hope, that they can rise to."
"Fifthly - and this is absolutely critical to the success of this new regime - we want public access to the information."
"Again that is in the amended directive and will be made available via the Equasis database."
"Sixthly, we want the Member States and the port state control authorities in particular, to convey the information to the Commission so that the Commission can do its job in making sure the amended directive is uniformly implemented across the European Union."
"The seventh point, which I mention with a certain pleasure, concerns the ability to ban and detain certain ships - banning the most dangerous ships, particularly those that fly the flags of blacklisted flag states."
"I welcome the strong controls we have to ban certain ships from European Union waters if they have a poor detention record."
"That effectively will be a warning shot across the bows of these blacklisted flag states: over a period of time their ships will be banned one by one if they do not improve."
"A very important message will be going out from this Parliament."
"But also there will be the power to detain, in particular the power to detain ships which, by 2008, do not have a fully functioning voice data recorder, a black box."
"Again the message can go out tonight that by 2008 all categories of ships, if they want to come to a European port, must have a black box voice data recorder."
"If they do not have one, we will detain the ship until one is secured."
"Once more, I welcome the fact that we have all worked together to secure that particular achievement."
"The black box will change the culture of shipping."
"It will not just be a tool whereby we can learn lessons from disasters and apply them in the future."
"A ship with a black box is a safe ship."
"Our common aim tonight is to make sure the Erika and disasters like it never occur again."
"I do not believe that we will achieve that simply by adopting these reports tomorrow but we will have gone a long way to securing our goal to protect lives at sea and to protect the marine environment."
"But we must remain vigilant."
"Our duty now must be to make sure that the laws we pass tomorrow are implemented by everyone - the Commission, Member States and port state control authorities."
"That is our duty and responsibility."
"I hope we can live up to that."
"Mr President, Commissioner, after the sinking of the oil tanker Erika on 12 December 1999, this Parliament and the Council requested a significant strengthening of the Community rules on maritime safety and the prevention of pollution."
"The Commission responded quickly to these demands by presenting the three proposals known as the Erika I package, which we are still debating two years after that disaster, although we have finally reached agreements on each of them in Council, which are definitive in the case of the first two."
"In the case of the modification of the Directive on the common rules and standards for organisations which classify, inspect and examine ships on behalf of the maritime administration, from the outset, the parliamentary amendments to Commission' s original proposal focussed, above all, on the practical aspects of the application of the classification system, on improving the transparency of the information relating to the quality of inspections, on the periodic auditing of those organisations and the withdrawal of their Community recognition in the event of serious accidents, as well as the financial liability of those organisations for damages and accidents where is has been proved that that there has been negligence in inspections."
"After the Council' s adoption of its common position, we moved on to second parliamentary reading, where we insisted on issues relating to resolving the conflicts of interest which may arise between classification societies or organisations and the owners and/or charterers of ships, as well as on financial liability in cases of negligence or omission in judgements."
"When the Council communicated that it could not accept all Parliament' s amendments, we moved on to the stage of conciliation between the representatives of the two Community institutions."
"The discussion focussed firstly on the issue of the conflict of interests, where the Council finally accepted that a classification organisation must not be controlled by owners or builders of ships or by other persons or entities which are commercially involved in the construction, equipping, repair or operation of ships."
"It also focussed on the idea that, at the point of requesting recognition, the classification society and its inspectors should commit themselves in writing, on an individual basis, to not accepting regulatory duties where there is a risk of a conflict of interests and, in particular, where those societies are the owners of the ship which is to be inspected, or have commercial, personal or family connections with those owners."
"For its part, the parliamentary delegation, while considering that much of the work of the inspectors should be done by the maritime administration and that the latter should have subsidiary responsibility, accepted that it should not be obligatory for the Member States to establish a maximum limit for the financial liability of classification societies in the event of damages due to slight negligence in inspections, although in the event that those Member States wish to establish that maximum limit, that limit should not be less that EUR 2 million and EUR 4 million respectively, depending on whether the damage only affects material objects or also people."
"However, the delegations of the two institutions considered that this issue should be examined within the framework of the evaluation report, which the Commission will present within three years, on the economic impact of the liability regime and, in particular, its consequences for the financial equilibrium of recognised organisations."
"If necessary, the Commission will present, in the light of the said evaluation, a proposal for a modification of this directive which deals specifically with the principle of liability and the maximum limit for the financial contribution."
"In conclusion, I believe that the European Parliament should be satisfied with the final result of the conciliation, since the majority of our amendments have been incorporated, either fully, in a revised form or in spirit, into the joint text, and we therefore propose that this latter text be approved by the House at third reading."
"Finally, I would like to draw the attention of the relevant legal authorities to the fact that certain people harmed by the Erika accident are yet to receive any compensation for the damage suffered, despite the fact that two years have passed since this tragic event took place."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President and dear fellow-believers - I can call you that, because all of those sitting here are those who have moved this project forward over the years and who are committed to making ships safe."
"Speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats, I would like to observe - it being two years since the Erika disaster - that we may be a little late with the adoption of this legislative package, but we have not done at all badly in terms of keeping to the timetable if you consider the difficulties that have been involved."
"Even then, two areas of the legislation have involved us having to go through a second reading and the conciliation procedure."
"Today, we can see that, on the basis of the Commission's initial proposals submitted two years ago now after the tanker crashed, our joint efforts have brought progress, and I again wish to thank you, Commissioner de Palacio, for the committed support you and your colleagues gave us in the conciliation process."
"By means both of these two results from the conciliation process and the common position, we have significantly increased not only the safety of ships, but also that of their crews, the environment and of people who live in coastal regions."
"I believe that enhanced port state control, more stringent regulations for classification societies and the progressive introduction of double hull tankers mean that we really have moved ahead in preventing accidents like that of the Erika, or at least alleviating their consequences."
"Commissioner, I would like to say this about port state control. I believe it was a good thing that, in the conciliation process, we - and especially Mark Watts - insisted on sorting out the 'black box' issue now."
"You will see that the 'Erika II' package does not quite go that far."
"I hope it soon will do, but you will be aware that it is still causing a few difficulties."
"That being so, we were right to insist on the requirement for a 'black box' being incorporated into the 'Erika I' package."
"My colleagues are aware that I am less happy about the result of the ship classification issue."
"We may well not have an upper limit, but we do have an appeal clause."
"I trust that the Commission will, after three years, produce a report submitting new proposals to us on how damage can be compensated for."
"This affects shipping companies, shipping agents, and classification societies - how about a fair compromise on who should shoulder the damage?"
"We were, I think, very wise when it came to the common position on double hull tankers."
"We should let the whole world know that."
"We are always being accused of drafting European norms and disregarding worldwide conventions."
"No!"
"We have accepted that the IMO sets the ground rules and have only made minor changes affecting implementation and time limits."
"What we have insisted on as regards implementation looks quite harmless in comparison with what the Americans forced through!"
"I hope we will be able to adopt the second package next year."
"So, Commissioner, bring some pressure to bear on the Council!"
"As far as the 'cope fund' compensation rule is concerned, we do not want to be kept waiting for the next five years."
"I am relying on you to push for this."
"rapporteur."
"(EL) Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, this report on the accelerated phasing-out of single hull tankers seemed at first to be an extremely complicated matter and we have been down a long hard road in order to reach today's result."
"Nonetheless, I think that we have finally done so in a most satisfactory manner, which has gone beyond all our expectations."
"On the one hand, we have managed to find an effective response to the concerns of the citizens of Europe, especially in France following the shipwreck of the Erika, as regards environmental protection."
"At the same time, we have taken fundamental measures in maritime safety because, as all sides agree, double-hull tankers may not be a panacea but they are at least proven to be safer than single-hull tankers."
"However, we also achieved another objective: the objective of protecting the competitiveness of the shipping industry."
"We must not forget that this is a vital sector of our economy, a sector which employs tens of thousands of workers throughout Europe and one of our priorities must be to protect it."
"We also achieved something else which I think I should highlight: we managed to find an international solution to a problem which goes beyond national borders."
"We have before us a solution which has now been adopted by all the countries in the International Maritime Organisation."
"I think that credit for this has to go to the European Commission, the Member States and the European Parliament because, thanks to our initiative, thanks to our - how shall I put it? - our threat that we would proceed unilaterally if the International Maritime Organisation failed to act, the International Maritime Organisation which, we must admit, has not always acted quite as fast as we would all like it to act, has pushed ahead and adopted a number of measures which mirror the initial proposals submitted by the Commission and the Member States."
"So clear, efficient measures are being taken for all the classes of tanker which have concerned us and I am happy to say that today we have achieved something which did in fact appear to be beyond reach just a short time ago."
"On the one hand, I think that people in France are relatively satisfied with the measures we are adopting and that every European with an environmental conscience is satisfied with the significant progress made while, on the other hand, industrial factors, people engaged in shipping, seamen and shipowners, feel that we have not gone too far and undermined the interests of this important sector of the economy."
"So I should like to thank all the honourable members with whom we cooperated so efficiently that we now have this text before us and, of course, to thank and congratulate the Vice-President of the European Commission, Mrs de Palacio, for the way in which she has handled this issue and for her decisiveness and excellent disposition towards the European Parliament."
"Mr President, I would like to join those who have spoken before me in expressing thanks to you, to the Commissioner, to your colleagues and also to our rapporteurs, for I do think it was a good thing that we, as Parliament and Commission, worked together so closely on this issue."
"That today is, of all days, the anniversary of the sinking of the Erika, is not something that should fill us entirely with pride, for two years have passed before today's debate and tomorrow's vote."
"Then it will take a bit longer for it all to be implemented."
"It should be done more quickly next time!"
"The results are actually quite respectable."
"We are getting the safe double hull tankers more quickly."
"The old single hull tankers will be phased out with effect from 2003, and port state control will at last live up to its name."
"Stricter controls mean for me that blacklists will be used rigorously and, in consequence, black sheep, or black ships, will no longer be welcome in European ports."
"Classification societies for ship types will be subject to stricter conditions."
"Although we know that the majority of these societies do sound work, they must no longer be permitted to be slipshod in what they do."
"The Member States now have 18 months in which to transpose all this."
"The legal framework is in place."
"Yet laws that only exist on paper are, in the final analysis, ridiculous."
"What use is port state control without controllers?"
"I therefore believe - and here we are putting our trust in you, Commissioner - that you will have to check very punctiliously how the Member States transpose the things we have just brought into being."
"It will cost the Member States money, but safety at sea must be worth the expense."
"So here are two more points."
"One is something I have already mentioned."
"Erika II must not be allowed to last as long as Erika I did."
"Accidents involving oil are one thing, but damage to people, nature, fisheries and tourism are something else, and result not only from accidents involving oil, but also from those involving chemicals and other hazardous substances."
"So we should implement more quickly the proposals Parliament has made."
"My final point is that enlargement of the EU is almost upon us, involving as it does two candidate states, Malta and Cyprus, which have cropped up in discussions again and again."
"So I would again implore the Commissioner to apply the so-called acquis communautaire very stringently to these states too in the event of their becoming members of the EU, so that there may be no black sheep, only white ones."
"I have said already that we have a saying to the effect that one is in the hand of God at sea and in court!"
"As far as the sea is concerned, we can give the Almighty a bit of a helping hand, so that everything will be safer, and that is what we should be doing with the Erika package."
"Mr President, my colleagues, on behalf of my group I thank the rapporteurs for the preparation of their fine reports, and also for the good outcomes in conciliation."
"These statutory proposals belonging to the ""Erika I"" package contain essential measures for the increasing of marine safety."
"These matters have also made reasonably rapid progress, and in conciliation the essential changes to the texts demanded by Parliament have been incorporated."
"In the case of the classification societies, the Community's authority needs to be increased with regard to the approval and control of these societies."
"As the rapporteur stated, the classification society must not be under the authority of the owners or builders of the vessels, or of others engaged in commercial activity in the sector."
"Inspections of vessels must also be increased."
"Extended inspections must be directed specifically at vessels which represent a risk."
"In the case of vessels on the ""black list"" which are associated with a high risk, the criteria for entry of the vessel to a port must be stricter."
"In order that accidents can be prevented in advance as effectively as possible, we need an advance notification obligation for vessels and mandatory inspections of high-risk vessels."
"The port control directive will improve the uniformity and effectiveness of the inspection procedure of port States."
"It is appropriate that vessels be furnished with Voyage Data Recorders in future, and that access to EU ports can be denied to vessels which are clearly in a poor condition."
"An accelerated phasing-in of double hull vessels must be managed in such a way as to avoid generating insurmountable problems with the scrapping of ships and the building of new ones."
"At the same time, the flexibility of oil transportations must be safeguarded."
"The safety of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution may be promoted by the flag States enforcing the currently valid conventions so as to make them obligatory."
"Along with the further tightening of regulations, care must be taken that the decisions to be made are realistic and feasible."
"One of the points of emphasis of the EU's White Paper on transport is the favouring of water traffic in transportation."
"Because of its environmental friendliness, water traffic is indeed very suitable for heavy goods transportation."
"In the event of accidents, however, water routes are highly vulnerable, and environmental damage recognises no borders."
"For this reason, decisions made only within the Union are not sufficient; instead, questions of responsibility for marine safety must be dealt with on a worldwide basis."
"We need international agreements which also involve (for example) Russia, whose vessels will in future be sailing more and more in the world's seas via the Gulf of Finland and the Baltic."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should at any rate like to thank everyone, including the team behind the Commissioner, for example, for the quality and volume of work they have all done."
"When I wake up, I just hope and pray that another oil tanker has not run aground. I hope that will not be the case in the next three years either, for - everyone has already said it - it has been long enough, it is actually taking too long before we can lay down legislation, and we are only halfway."
"Speeding up processes of this kind can do no harm at all."
"A disaster such as the one involving the Erika is simply a real disaster, not only environmentally, but also economically and socially, and it can be entirely traced back to 80 000 ships, some ten percent of which, 8 000 ships, are absolutely sub-standard."
"This is to a certain extent where the problem lies, or in large part at any rate."
"Despite the fact that classification bureaux were involved and despite what has happened with, and is suggested about, double hulls, I should briefly like to focus on the port state control, for in the final analysis, what matters is that inspections should become effective."
"Mr Piecyk, but also others, have already drawn attention to this."
"Actually, we want 25% of inspections by way of a yardstick. But what mainly matters is that these inspections are carried out by well-trained people, and that they are carried out in the first place."
"We should, for example, call the French Transport Minister to account for the fact that his country scores exceptionally low in the percentage of inspections that are carried out."
"Although we now have a perfect and itemised list, enforcement still appears to be a problem."
"This is often the case when we draft legislation, but particularly so now."
"I therefore intend to monitor annual surveys of the Paris memorandum of understanding and other matters in the next few months with the help of others, and check whether inspection of this kind is, in fact, on the increase."
"I would also ask the Commissioner to ensure that we receive an annual overview, so that we can be active and pro-active to ensure that what we want to achieve actually happens."
"Secondly, I would mainly call for a prompt completion of the Erika II, and for accelerating the process in the light of the tiresome pace on the part of industry with regard to separate funding and such like."
"I would like to finish off with one point."
"Malta and Cyprus have been mentioned in connection with enlargement."
"There are still two that, let us say, are on the waiting list, including Romania."
"Romania is another country with an exceptionally bad track record on this black list, and I would call for extra attention to be paid to it."
"Mr President, it is by sheer coincidence that today we are sadly commemorating the second anniversary of the sinking of the Erika oil tanker."
"On the stormy night of 12 December 1999, this oil tanker, which was flying a Maltese flag, certified by an Italian classification society, manned by an Indian crew, insured by a company registered in the Bermudas, financed by a Scottish bank, chartered by a Shell company that sub-chartered it to a foreign subsidiary of the Total Group, which was transporting extremely polluting hydrocarbon belonging to another subsidiary of Total, sank off the French coast, thus polluting 400 kilometres of coastline and causing considerable damage estimated to cost more than FFR 5 billion."
"So, what progress has been made, two years after this tragedy?"
"Hardly any of the victims have received compensation."
"The IOPC Fund will only cover FFR 1.2 billion out of the FFR 5.5 billion of damages caused, and procedures are turning out to be lengthy, complicated and inefficient."
"The remainder will be borne by the victims, the local authorities and the French Government, pursuant to the application, not of the polluter pays principle, but of the perverse principle dictating that the victim pays."
"The various measures that we are currently debating in the three reports by Mr Watts, Mr Ortuondo Larrea and Mr Hatzidakis have taken too long."
"Yes, we must strengthen State port controls, Mr Watts; yes, we must ensure the work of classification societies is more efficient, more reliable and more transparent, Mr Ortuondo Larrea; yes, Mr Hatzidakis, we must take concerted action at international level to phase out single hull oil tankers, whilst bearing in mind that double hull tankers cannot guarantee that ships will not sink or run aground."
"But why will we have had to wait more than two years after the disaster for such basic measures to be taken in these three areas?"
"And, more importantly, there are two fundamental questions that remain unanswered, and it has also not yet been established whether it is appropriate to take these decisions at European level."
"The first question relates to compensation."
"All the victims must be fully compensated."
"Today, however, there are considerable differences of opinion at European level."
"Some people are in favour of setting up a specific European fund, whilst others prefer to increase the IOPC Fund."
"The differences of opinion persist and we cannot move ahead with this issue, whereas the United States, on the other hand, has unilaterally set up a very efficient and comprehensive compensation system, which is effectively funded by consumers of oil products, which is perfectly logical and legitimate."
"In Europe, Member States have different ideas about the risks of maritime pollution and it would therefore be perfectly legitimate for the countries that are at the forefront of this risk to take the necessary measures themselves."
"I urge them to do so."
"The second fundamental question that is yet to be resolved relates to the issue of responsibility."
"We cannot allow events, such as that involving the Erika, to ever happen again, where the front company was based in a tax haven, the flag of convenience was sub-chartered, the sub-contractor was an off-shore subsidiary and no less than 11 different companies had an interest in the ship and its cargo, thus creating a real labyrinth, in which the real decision-makers and those bearing the actual responsibility could hide."
"This situation is particularly hazardous."
"The Member States that are most concerned must ensure, as a matter of urgency, that there is clarification and transparency in the area of responsibility. This must also be done at a global level, as, Mr President, only the threat of very heavy and very severe penalties will be enough to deter the potential polluters of the future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am optimistic."
"We are going down the right track as regards the safety of ships."
"We have already clearly defined the first measures that may lead to substantial improvements in safety at sea."
"One considerable contribution to this is the introduction of the black box, with which we are familiar from aircraft, as well as of the double hull tanker."
"Parliament has emphasised certain features - where necessary in the Conciliation Committee, as Mr Ortuondo Larrea mentioned."
"Does this, though, also apply to the settlement of liabilities?"
"You are all familiar with the regular technical examination of private cars."
"It is a similar position that the classification societies take with regard to safety at sea."
"The extent of liability in the event of accidents at sea is based on inspectors' evaluations of the condition ships are in."
"This brings us at once to the core of the discussion, for the issue of the classification societies' standard upper limits for liability, particularly in cases of minor negligence, needs to be resolved finally and coherently."
"The decartelisation of the interests of the classification societies, the shipowners and the other actors means that we are now already achieving a high degree of transparency and independence for the inspectors."
"Decartelisation of interests must not, though, be allowed to go so far that the actors are played off against each other and end up eventually outdoing each other."
"The liability issue becomes of fundamental importance at this point."
"It is in the final analysis the classification societies that occupy the most vulnerable position in the liability chain."
"Their assessment is admittedly decisive in determining the extent of liability, but, for example, they have no police powers, so that they could not, for example, confine a ship to port if that were to prove necessary."
"In the end, responsibility for the condition of the ship and for its handling remains with the owners."
"The classification societies and the shipping companies must act jointly with the other parties involved in this, and we must create the conditions for this to happen."
"There are at present different upper limits for liability in each Member State, but it would be fair to limit liability to one standard across the board."
"In three years' time we will be re-examining this regulation on a varying upper limit."
"The knowledge and experience we will have gained by then will influence our further action and leave their mark on it."
"I see this as our task for the immediate future."
"We want to end up with a balanced chain of liability and responsibility."
"We need this binding regulation in order to enhance competition and limit risks, both indispensable to a functioning market and safety at sea."
"It is true that we are subjecting the classification societies to tighter control, but, at the same time, we should make it possible for them to calculate their risks."
"I consider this regulation to be a fair one, which takes all sides into account in an appropriate way."
"Having chosen our road ahead, we must now go down it and pursue it to the end."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the Conciliation Committee, I am delighted that we have achieved a positive result and can now press on and apply effective measures to protect our seas and our shipping industry."
"We have taken a moderate line and brokered a series of realistic measures, seeing shipping not as an 'enemy' but as a friend who could do better, given that, may I remind you, shipping is only responsible for 12% of total maritime pollution."
"So, ships which seriously endanger our seas will be denied entry to Community ports and voyage data recorders will be fitted to all ships, so that their course can be checked following an accident, God forbid."
"Compulsory double hulls will be phased in and the rules governing ship survey and control organisations will be improved."
"Clearly, the catalyst behind this successful outcome, or at least one part of it, was the International Maritime Organisation, which took the right stand thanks to the initiative taken by the Member States of the Union."
"So now we need to concentrate on fast implementation, and here we are putting our faith in fast reaction on the part of the Commission, not forgetting that five Member States which, I may add, do not include Greece, have been charged by the Commission with not applying a previous, more lenient directive."
"May I also remind you and highlight the fact that Greece, whose economy, as you know, is far more dependent on shipping than that of any of our partners, is leading the way and is at the vanguard in the fight for maritime safety and efforts to protect human life and the environment."
"We must also give special thanks to everyone who helped to bring this endeavour to a successful conclusion, especially the Commissioner, and I trust that we shall not forget that the seas of Europe are not a separate entity from the other seas on our planet."
"Mr President, Commissioner, today being the anniversary of the sinking of the Erika on 12 December 1999, my group and I are pleased to see that conciliation on three sets of proposals has been successful."
"Concerning the Watts report, we are particularly pleased that the European Parliament' s delegation succeeded in making black boxes compulsory, which was not the easiest thing to do."
"This means that, from now on, a ship will be detained if it is not fitted with a functioning VDR system."
"With regard to Mr Ortuondo Larrea' s report, the question of the conflict of interests has been resolved in such a way that classification societies can no longer have any links with shipbuilders, shipowners, operators or charterers."
"Likewise, there is the question of the limits of the financial liability of these companies with regard to the financial balance of recognised organisations."
"There is also the problem that Mr Souchet mentioned of providing compensation payments from the IOPC Fund or from a European fund in a more efficient manner."
"It is also a matter of urgency, as Mr Hatzidakis said, to settle, at third reading, the problem of single hull ships, mainly in view of the 2015 deadline, as maritime safety issues cannot wait any longer - it is already two years to the day since the sinking of the Erika."
"Intermittent spills and substandard 'dustbin ships' , such as the one that recently sunk off the coast of Brest, are still all too topical and it is a test of the EU' s credibility to resolve this situation once and for all."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, following the Erika accident, the profound, and totally legitimate, concern of the European citizens and the urgent need to consolidate the Community legislation in the field of maritime safety became clear."
"This concern led to the Commission' s proposals and I would therefore now like to congratulate the Commission and its Vice-President, Mrs de Palacio, since we have all witnessed the tenacity with which she has personally dealt with these issues."
"I also congratulate the rapporteurs on the wonderful work they have done, completing this package of measures."
"Ladies and gentlemen, during my intervention in the May part-session, I said that we could be relatively satisfied with the way we have responded to the expectations of our citizens, in trying to approve these initiatives as quickly as possible - in inverted commas - by Community standards."
"The Erika I package and future approval of the Erika II package will make it possible to create a genuine European area of maritime safety and must guarantee an optimum level of protection for the maritime environment and the European coastal regions."
"Today I simply wish to repeat part of what I said then, since the circumstances have not changed."
"This Parliament has shown its great interest throughout the negotiation process."
"We must now continue to work in this direction and promote the measures which are yet to be approved."
"We must not rest on our laurels and we must call on the Council so that progress can be made on the Erika II package and, in this respect, Commissioner, your role and your tenacity will be very important if we are to try to convince the Council once again, so that we may have the Erika II package more quickly."
"Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate all of my fellow Members, who, in my view, have done some excellent work."
"The European Parliament will have had a great influence on these documents."
"I would also like to thank the Commissioner, Mrs Loyola de Palacio who, I believe, has worked as quickly as possible within the procedures laid down."
"Mr Souchet thought that the progress made was slow."
"I think that he is right."
"On the other hand, we had reached the end of a parliamentary procedure, which is very difficult to cut down when we embark on conciliation."
"I therefore believe that we have worked as quickly as possible and yet, it will take a total of three and a half years to draw up a text on Erika I after the law has been transposed by the national governments. All this leads me to make some comments on governance."
"We discuss this elsewhere, outside the context of transport, and I think that these subjects require the codification of urgent parliamentary procedures that will allow us to proceed legally."
"I think that this is a proposal which is expected from bodies such as ourselves or which could be drawn up by them."
"We see that we have the same problem with the tunnels and the revision of the Seveso Directives."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I think that we must spend time considering the urgent procedures which will be included in the Treaties."
"I also think that we must ensure that these directives are transposed into national law."
"We now have a body of texts and of maritime law without equal at European level, and also the Erika II package which is currently under discussion."
"The Member States will no longer be able to play hide and seek with the European Commission, as they could at the beginning of the Erika I crisis."
"Furthermore, we have no guarantee - as President Prodi recently said - that the directives are being transposed into national law within the time allowed."
"And, at the end of the day, if we can be satisfied that we have produced some good European legislation today, we still do not know whether all these measures will be implemented, and within what time scale. The victims of the oil spills and accidents have been waiting for these measures for a long time."
"Lastly, I think that the controls do not give enough reassurance, and this is true of all the operating provisions."
"These usually involve self-regulation at national level, and I think that, in terms of governance as well, and if we truly wish to move forward, we must ask ourselves the question of how we are to monitor the monitoring systems."
"Mr President, the running aground of the oil tanker Erika triggered a large number of activities on the part of the Commission, which were truly welcome."
"However, I stand by my earlier reflection that it is better to act before an accident occurs than to react after it."
"Both the rapporteur and the Conciliation Committee have done an excellent job with regard to the Commission' s proposal to further improve various measures, and Parliament has improved the proposal even further."
"We have now pushed through our view with regard to conflicts of interest."
"We have, moreover, succeeded in getting the lower limit for classification societies' liability for damages to the level at which we always wanted it."
"This must be seen as clear progress."
"The report on port State control also looks significantly better now."
"In conciliation, Parliament managed to push through the requirement for black boxes, which I believe is a particularly positive move."
"The solution regarding the third issue of introducing double hulls or such like for single-hull oil tankers has also been considerably more positive than it long appeared would be the case."
"In this case too, Parliament has had almost all its amendments included in the Council' s common position."
"In summary, I would like to say that, on these issues, Parliament has clearly shown its capacity to act."
"Each of the proposals alone would not have sufficed, but together they constitute a significant step in the right direction."
"In a tangible way, we have taken developments in the right direction towards safer and better seafaring and a better marine environment."
"Hopefully, this will ensure that accidents such as those involving the Erika or the Levoli Sun will not occur in the future."
"Mr President, two days ago, we Finns received tragic news - the beautiful beaches around Runsala near Turku had been affected by an oil slick from an unknown source."
"Unfortunately, the proposals being debated today will not help in this type of case."
"This is a classic example of a discharge from an unknown source, and despite the restructuring of port and pilotage fees which we have adopted at EU level, these small discharges have increased in the Baltic Sea."
"The risk of being prosecuted is also very small."
"At the same time, we are now, unfortunately, seeing the opening of the port in Primorsk."
"This port has severely icy conditions, and we know that the package which we are approving today may not perhaps lead to vessels having double hulls until 2017."
"However, double hulls are no help now, as the ice has already formed in Primorsk port."
"Only through compulsory pilotage, effective strengthening of the hull against ice, efficient traffic monitoring and good teamwork between the rescue services can we do anything for this port and this unique part of the world."
"I would ask you, Commissioner, in your continued contacts with Russia, to focus attention on the safety of traffic to Primorsk."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the sinking of the Erika reminded the world of the general risks involved in the sea transport of certain types of pollutants, especially oil and oil-based products."
"It also highlighted the inadequacy of safety controls and the lack of transparency in sea transport practices, as well as the profound discontent of the populations affected, owing to the slowness of compensation."
"As the rapporteur, Mr Ortuondo, has quite rightly pointed out, the victims of this accident have yet to receive their money."
"It was also a test of the European Union' s capacity to react quickly and to offer its citizens a suitable response to their concerns."
"I must say that, despite the fact that all has not gone perfectly, that perhaps we could have adopted it on first reading - as I would have liked -, that perhaps both Parliament and the Council could have shown greater flexibility, the reality is that, despite everything, within one and a half years of the Commission presenting its initiative, today, two years after the accident, we are finally approving the Erika I package."
"In this respect, we must remember that there was a serious disaster off the same coast ten years ago and initiatives were presented by the Commission, but they did not overcome the hurdle of the Council."
"I would therefore like to point out that the considerable success of approving this Erika I package today would certainly not have been achieved had it not been for the insistence and firmness of this Parliament, which has maintained systematic pressure on the Council throughout the negotiation process."
"I would like to expressly thank Mr Watts, Mr Hatzidakis and Mr Ortuondo Larrea for their work and tenacity over these two years."
"Their determination, which I welcome, has allowed us to persuade the Council to approve texts which initially enjoyed only a very small majority yet have been able, at the end of the day, to overcome any reservations."
"We have considerably strengthened the European Union' s legislative arsenal."
"Furthermore, the texts approved will have significant specific consequences, whose effects will be immediately noticeable."
"The Member States must recruit a large number of inspectors in order to deal with greater obligations in controlling ships in ports."
"Furthermore, shipowners, charterers, flag States and classification societies who are complacent or negligent in their operation or monitoring of ships will henceforth be liable to severe penalties such as the prohibition of ships not meeting minimum requirements from entering European ports, the publication of the names of negligent charterers or the withdrawal of the authorisation of classification societies in the event of poor performance."
"Finally, I believe it is important to highlight another point of fundamental importance: Europe has once and for all made its mark as an indispensable partner in the international arena in the field of safety and all aspects relating to the maritime sector."
"In this regard, on the delicate issue of double hull ships, the States of the Union have not only reached an agreement so that, from 2015, no single hull oil tanker will be able to stop in any Community port, but also, and above all, the Union has persuaded the International Maritime Organisation to approve these requirements for all the oil tankers in the world."
"I believe it is also important to point out that the Erika II package which completes the whole initiative has made considerable progress recently."
"Last Friday the Transport Council approved a common position, pending final and formal approval next week, with regard to the Community system for monitoring traffic and the European Maritime Safety Agency."
"With regard to the proposed regulation on the Community fund for compensating damages resulting from accidental pollution, it is true that we are once again waiting for things to move ahead within the International Maritime Organisation."
"But I would like to say that it is already a great success that the Community initiative has led the current international debate - specifically within the IMO - towards the creation of an international fund which takes up the principles of the Commission' s proposal."
"Of course, we must ensure that the final result in the IMO conforms to our demands and ambitions."
"We are working on this and, just as we have ensured that things move ahead in the Union - thanks to Mr Watts' insistence - in relation to black boxes, we also hope that the same will happen on this issue within the IMO."
"I would like to clarify certain matters."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say publicly that Malta and Cyprus are making a considerable effort to update their ship' s registers and to exclude and expel those that do not conform to the requirements of the Union."
"I would like to end my speech by thanking Parliament and the three rapporteurs, who have worked brilliantly, for their support to the Commission."
"I would also like to ask them to cooperate with the other parliamentarians so that the Erika II package may pass through this House as soon as possible and that it may enter into force without delay."
"I would also like to publicly thank the services of the Commission, whose efforts have been wonderful."
"For your information, I am going to give you a piece of information on the subject of governance: the services relating to the maritime sector in the Directorate-General for Transport - including secretaries - comprise no more than 40 people, and they are the human team behind all these initiatives, as well as a series of other tasks and functions relating to the maritime, port and other sectors."
"This may give you an idea of the workload and the efforts made throughout this time."
"This time the European Union has demonstrated that we have taken the fight against marine pollution seriously."
"I would like to end by saying that, two years after the Erika tragedy, the satisfaction and success represented by the approval of the Erika I package today really must be a homage to all the citizens whose lives have been affected as a result of the sinking of the Erika two years ago."
"It must be a homage to all Europeans, who, over recent years, have seen the systematic repetition of huge disasters involving pollutants without any suitable or tangible measures, with sufficient rigour and sufficient demands, being taken, and also those of us who are genuine lovers of the sea and of the environment, who are thinking not just of today but of future generations."
"Thank you very much to all of you for your cooperation."
"Thank you so much, Commissioner, for your important statement."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"Cross-border provision of occupational pensions"
"The next item is the report (A5-0388/2001) by Mrs van den Burg, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission communication on the elimination of tax obstacles to the cross-border provision of occupational pensions (COM(2001) 214 - C5-0533/2001 - 2001/2212(COS))."
"It is a pleasure for me to present here today a virtually unanimous draft opinion of the European Parliament on two often very controversial topics: tax policy and pensions."
"This illustrates the urgency of this dossier."
"Two aspects that are very topical at the moment in the European Union are the ageing population and labour mobility. It also illustrates that the report is broad-based."
"I was appointed rapporteur for this topic more than a year ago."
"The Commission notification had not been published at the time."
"We were waiting for a directive proposal and were initially very critical because you, Commissioner Bolkestein, presented nothing but a notification."
"Moreover, it took a very long time, until April of this year, before it was published."
"As it happens, we as Parliament are now late ourselves with the plenary discussion of my report, also late in the day, but that is purely for reasons of scheduling."
"Meanwhile, the report has already had its effect in part."
"The ECOFIN Council of 16 October decided to take a pro-active approach based on my recommendations. This has culminated in the automatic exchange of data and support in the collection thereof."
"The first success has therefore been achieved."
"It is, in fact, rather apt for the report not to feature on the agenda until now. Indeed, it can enjoy the benefits of being discussed immediately prior to the Laeken Summit, to take place next Friday and Saturday."
"For this Summit also has the topic of pensions on the agenda."
"A joint report is scheduled for this Summit which has recently been adopted in the Social Council and the ECOFIN Council by order of the European Councils of Stockholm and Gothenburg and which concerns the social quality, the modernisation and financial sustainability of pensions."
"The Ministers have committed to starting a process of open coordination;"
"Member States will be presenting reports before September of next year, and at the spring summit in 2003, more detailed policy on this subject matter will be outlined in the European Union."
"As you can see, in my report on the fiscal treatment of pensions, I too have called for the introduction of open coordination process of this kind."
"The fiscal policy of Member States is closely intertwined with Member State policy on the content and qualitative aspects of pension schemes."
"Indeed, the fiscal incentive to accumulating a pension and fiscal levies on pension payments are conditioned by requirements based on the view of Member States of what a sound pension scheme is, and the conclusion in my report is not by any means that we should simply put these requirements to one side to make way for opening the pensions market within the European Union, as some may be inclined to do."
"No, I would clearly draw a distinction between two different situations."
"The first situation concerns migrant workers who are allowed to take their pension schemes with them to another Member State on the basis of earlier directives."
"The Member State is to give these schemes the same fiscal treatment unconditionally, and the Commission is to be active in bringing matters before the European Court, and that receives my full support."
"The alternative situation is that all workers, including those who simply remain in their own countries to live and work, should be eligible for tax deductions in respect of contributions to a foreign pension scheme."
"This should not be unlimited in my view."
"In this case, the national requirements and conditions still apply for now."
"However, precisely in order to grow towards an integrated pensions market, I would call for this process of open coordination."
"Since the criteria for fiscal incentives have everything to do with these quality requirements in terms of content, it seems right to link this process with what is about to be launched in Laeken."
"I would therefore like to give this thought to Mr Bolkestein and the Belgian Presidency to take with them to this Summit in Laeken."
"As far as I am concerned, you can also plug into the time schedule that was chosen there and take the 2003 spring summit as a point of reference instead of that of Barcelona, because the topic will not feature on the agenda there."
"Finally, I think I can make a brief reference to the recommendations of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment and the Committee on Petitions."
"I would also like to thank the rapporteurs in these committees for their contributions, and I hope that this report can help stem the flow of complaints and petitions, to which the Committee on Petitions, in fact, makes explicit reference, for that is, after all, the reason why we do all this, of course, namely the EU citizens who look forward to a truly border-free and obstacle-free Europe in terms of the movement of capital and labour, and in terms of encouraging the effective accumulation of pensions and fair taxation at retirement age."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur warmly, not only in general, but also because she has indeed adopted significant sections of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"Member States apply different fiscal systems to occupational pensions in terms of taxation or tax exemption from contributions, investment income and capital gains of the pension institution and from pension payments."
"Eleven Member States use the EET system, three Member States an ETT system and two Member States a TEE system."
"If you read these abbreviations out in Dutch, it seems as if eleven Member States are constantly eating, two Member States are drinking tea non-stop, while three Member States are served a strange kind of intermediate course, and I have to say that, in my view, this strange intermediate course is sometimes rather underrated in the discussion."
"In my opinion, this is actually the most negative of the systems we have in Europe, because the tax office eats into it during the accumulation of a pension."
"This is, in fact, a true form of eating, and is possibly underestimated."
"People are too fixated on the differences between the two other systems. These differences in fiscal treatment may well lead to problems in labour mobility and mobility for the retired."
"Indeed, these differences could lead to the double taxation of migrant workers."
"Conversely, these differences could also lead to no taxation at all."
"Let it be clear that this contravenes the philosophy of the internal market."
"In addition, this situation adversely affects the flexibility of the labour market and undermines an important condition for the success of the monetary union."
"Something will therefore be done about this situation, and that is why we are also pleased with the communication."
"The rapporteur is right in noting that, due to unanimity requirements for decisions where taxation is concerned, we wait forever before anything changes."
"I would therefore urge the Commission to do something via the Court of Justice, so that Member States are forced to adapt to the realities of the internal market in one way or another and will no longer discriminate against those entitled to pensions."
"Mr President, I really regret that the representatives of the presidency are not present as we discuss this very important issue."
"Our ageing European society calls for clear strategies to ensure the adequacy of pension systems."
"Several measures, such as increasing the retirement age of an ever healthier population and thus increasing the size of the active workforce, are a crucial step in improving the ratio between the active working population and retired persons."
"But it is evident that other measures have to be implemented as well."
"The importance of occupational pensions schemes will rise in many Member States."
"The European citizen would benefit from single market occupational pension schemes."
"The variety of occupational pension schemes and providers would be improved."
"The citizen and his employer could thus choose the most successful and best suited scheme, bringing the best interest rates, while offering full security of investment."
"More and more Europeans work for relatively short periods of time in another Member State."
"They are still disadvantaged when it comes to their occupational pension schemes."
"Tax obstacles stand in the way of a fully functioning single market."
"The Commission communication sets a strategy to resolve these obstacles that are a clear disincentive to individuals who wish to contribute to pension schemes outside their home Member States, as well as pension institutions that wish to provide pensions across borders."
"I welcome the Commission communication as a first step towards a solution of this issue."
"Like Mr Pronk, I wholeheartedly support the so-called EET model, as outlined in the Commission communication and in our committee's report."
"The EET model means that pension inputs are exempted from taxation."
"The pension scheme as well would be exempt and only the output would be taxed."
"This system serves to defer taxation to the moment the pension becomes payable, thus avoiding double taxation without the need to harmonise the level of taxation and without thus interfering in the Member States' taxation practice."
"Tax issues are in the hands of the Member States."
"Like our rapporteur, Mrs van den Burg, who has done an excellent job with this report, I also wholeheartedly support the method of open coordination."
"It is the only way we can achieve the results which our fellow European citizens need."
"I strongly urge the Member States to work quickly to achieve the necessary results for the benefit of our ageing population."
"Although we in the European Parliament may for the time being unfortunately not have the legislative means to decide on these issues, I can assure you that we follow them very closely and will do our best to achieve a common market for occupational pension schemes."
"Mr President, I am speaking this evening as much in my capacity as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Petitions as in my capacity as a Finn with Swedish as my mother tongue and a representative of the Group of the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party."
"I am grateful that the rapporteur referred to the opinion of the Committee on Petitions and the fact that we have taken the problems of citizens seriously."
"I would like to point to the statistics published in the opinion, from which it may be noted that over 500 petitions in the past decade related to this issue, almost 100 during this term of office, and that 14 of these relate to the situation between Finland and Sweden."
"The large proportion of petitions on precisely this issue of the situation between Finland and Sweden is a natural expression of the fact that a free labour market has existed among the Nordic countries since the 1950s and that the Finns who moved to Sweden at that time are now considering moving back."
"According to one set of figures, several thousand of these people are living in the town of Haparanda, on the border with Finland, as they cannot afford to return to Finland."
"This situation shows the problems we shall face."
"The problem is so topical that it was highlighted by Professor Edward Andersson in a message in one of a collection of papers in honour of the sixtieth birthday of the Finnish Judge of the Court of Justice of the EC, Leif Sevón, as well as in the communication from the Commission."
"One of the problems on which still further light could be shed is that we in Europe apply such different variants of double taxation agreements within the framework of the OECD."
"The different variants of agreements in this area are a problem which I believe should also be covered by the open method of coordination."
"It is fascinating that this issue has been taken up by the Commission."
"I congratulate you."
"When a similar enquiry was conducted in the Nordic countries, former Minister for Nordic Cooperation Ole Norrback stated that the authorities did not believe that there was a problem in this area, although citizens thought that there was."
"He also found that he had learned more during the enquiry than he had in his eight years as a minister."
"I therefore hope that quite a few of the measures proposed by the rapporteur will be implemented, for example access to better information on the rules which actually apply."
"I offer my wholehearted support for any courageous action on the part of the Commission, i.e. also taking cases to court when interpretation is at issue, in order to establish correct interpretations with regard both to taxation and to other similar charges with which we have problems."
"I also believe two of the problems to be the crediting of tax allowances and the level of tax deducted at source."
"It is particularly important that we work together to ensure that citizens have good access to information in this area."
"The 'Swiss Life' sentiment, where pensions are concerned, awakens a feeling of unease in me, typified by the call for a wrong kind of solidarity and a lack of cooperation between the Member States."
"The fact that there are Member States where workers accumulate pensions for themselves during their working lives requires full respect for acquired rights, and Member States where the citizens do not accumulate their own pension schemes, should therefore provide for adequate legislation in the short term in order to be able to face the anticipated problems caused by an ageing population."
"The call for solidarity between generations with regard to pensions should in the first instance be accommodated in the Member States themselves."
"International labour mobility should not be hampered by the different ways in which pension schemes are taxed fiscally."
"It is the task of the Member States to remove the existing fiscal obstructions in the short term based on proper consultation, and to better attune the different pension schemes."
"And cooperation among these Member States does not benefit from serving self-interest but from putting the interest of the citizen first."
"If the European Union wants to create an internal market for its citizens in a credible manner, cooperation among Member States will need to lead to the harmonisation of fiscal measures with regard to pensions."
"The EET scheme, in which premium contributions are not taxed but in which the payments are taxed, can then offer a direction for the mutual harmonisation of the fiscal rules concerning pensions."
"We therefore endorse the line adopted by the Commission and the rapporteur, Mrs van den Burg, to reach an internal market in which the structure, management and payments of cross-border occupational pensions are no longer hampered by fiscal measures."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen and our rapporteurs, I would just like to start by warmly thanking our rapporteurs, above all Mrs van den Burg, but also Mrs Kauppi, for their cooperation on this report and also for the help they gave me with the report on cross-border provision of occupational pensions."
"Today's report on taxation expands and continues the report for which the codecision procedure was negotiated as long ago as July this year."
"All of us take the view that occupational pensions - among other areas - will require greater fiscal coordination."
"We propose the EET system of deferred taxation, on the grounds that it is already a reality in the great majority of Member States."
"If we do not achieve this fiscal coordination, we will have distortions of competition within the financial internal market through differing tax systems, which we do not want to have within a single market of which we want to make the best possible use, including in connection with the introduction of euro notes and coins."
"Amendment No 1, proposed by Mrs Kauppi, expressly demands that the Council should make speedy progress towards a proposal for a directive on the activities of institutions providing occupational pensions, which would ensure mutual recognition of occupational pension systems and make a significant contribution to efforts towards effective tax coordination."
"It is regrettable that this amendment should be needed at all, as the ECOFIN council, like the European Council meetings at Lisbon, Feira, Stockholm and wherever else, determines priorities and, despite that, has managed nothing more that the sending-out of a questionnaire."
"I wish therefore to ask the Council why it stresses the urgency of this, whilst its actions do not reflect that urgency."
"What are the Council's problems with last October's proposal from the Commission?"
"What does the Council have to say in response to the van den Burg report and to Parliament's resolution of July?"
"With which individual demands is the Council having difficulty?"
"We want answers. We want them because we want to carry on negotiating in order to be able at last to achieve the aims of the action plan on financial services and implement Parliament's requirements - for the benefit of citizens and of enterprises and in the spirit of the common objectives that are so often invoked."
"Mr President, I should first of all like to take the opportunity, on behalf of the European Commission, of responding to what Mrs van den Burg and her fellow MEPs have put forward here this evening."
"Allow me to start by thanking Parliament for the unanimous support it has given via the van den Burg report to the Commission communication on the fiscal treatment of pensions."
"I have used the word 'unanimous support' , as was also borne out this evening, not only from the words by the rapporteur, Mrs van den Burg, but also from the words by Mrs Thors, Mrs Kauppi, Mr Blokland, Mr Pronk and others."
"This is especially gratifying since this is a very important topic."
"There are three points which I should like to elucidate further, and these points are firstly, the subject of the open coordination, secondly, the pan-European funds and thirdly, the developments in the legal field."
"The resolution is asking us to develop a process of open coordination, and I would like to say that, in principle, the Commission is in favour of more coordination in tax matters."
"An example of this is the working party which is being chaired by the British Minister, Mrs Primarollo."
"This working party is looking into the harmful tax competition, with very active involvement by the Commission."
"However, I should like to say to Mrs van den Burg that there is a subtle, yet important, difference between open coordination and coordination."
"In principle, open coordination is applied to areas of policy which fall within the national scope."
"However, the resolution mentions the need, inter alia, for tackling double taxation and double non-taxation, and this means, by definition, that there is a cross-border element that, by definition, is one of the aspects of the internal market."
"There is, therefore, probably little scope for a formal process of open coordination which, as already mentioned, relates to topics which fall within the decision-making remit of the national states."
"And this is not the case here."
"Having said this, the ECOFIN Council of 16 October expressly approved the Commission proposal to take measures in order to tackle double taxation and double non-taxation."
"There is therefore very much a certain degree of coordination whereby the Commission retains the right, of course, to present further initiatives."
"The second point concerned the pan-European pension funds, also mentioned by Mrs van den Burg and by Mr Pronk, I believe."
"In this field, the ECOFIN Council of 16 October did not subscribe to the proposal for pan-European funds."
"This does not mean in any way that the proposal has lost the Commission' s sympathy."
"On the other hand, I am perhaps slightly less enthusiastic about the suggestion made in the report and mentioned a moment ago by Mrs van den Burg, namely that the Commission would prepare a proposal for a statute of international pension funds."
"As I said just now, the ECOFIN Council was unable to endorse the proposal for pan-European funds, although these could function without new European legislation."
"Under these circumstances, I have strong doubts at to the proposal' s political chances of introducing pan-European funds by means of legislation."
"Thirdly and finally, I should like to say a few words about the legal aspects."
"Last week, 6 December, the Court of Justice heard the Danner case, and this concerns, as I believe the Members are aware, a German citizen who emigrated to Finland and who wanted to continue with his German pension scheme, but unfortunately, the Finnish tax authorities refuse to grant him tax deductions on the contributions already made to the German scheme."
"During the hearing, the Commission supported Mr Danner and made reference to its communication on pensions."
"The verdict in this case can be expected next year."
"Last month, a second case came to light. A Swedish court referred a case concerning the deductibility of contributions paid to a foreign pension insurance company by a permanent resident of Sweden to the Court of Justice, and this means that the correctness of the Commission' s legal analysis will be tested twice in the near future."
"Mr Pronk also emphasised that the Commission should keep its promise that it will take action against Member States that infringe the Treaty freedoms, and I should like to assure Mr Pronk, as well as other Members who have mentioned this, that the Commission is in active dialogue with the Member States."
"The Commission has formally asked the Member States for information about their national rules, and is currently looking into the responses it has received, and I can assure the Members of this Parliament that the Commission will start proceedings against Member States, where necessary."
"As the Commission has indicated in its communication on tax policy of May of this year, a pro-active strategy for infringement procedures forms an important component of its approach aimed at making headway in the field of taxation."
"In a nutshell, with the help of this Parliament and also of the Council, a certain dynamic seems to have come about in the field of tax exemption for pensions."
"I should like to say by way of conclusion: let us try to hold on to this cooperation, and in that framework, I gladly accept Mrs van den Burg' s offer of further consultation."
"Once again, I should like to extend warm thanks to Members for their excellent work and for the support for the Commission, and finally, I could perhaps say to Mr Karas that the Commission too is saddened by the fact that so little progress has been made on the work on the directive proposed by the Commission on pension funds."
"Precious little has happened in this area over the past six months under the presidency that is about to come to an end."
"A circular letter, a questionnaire, has been distributed to the Member States."
"These questions have been received. Of course, work has been done on them, but that is all, really."
"I gather that the Spanish Presidency certainly intends to work on this with greater drive."
"Mr Karas, and the Members too, I believe, will agree with the Commission that such progress is extremely crucial and urgent on account of the demographic time bomb on which we are sitting, and I do not need to go into this topic any further. Everyone is familiar with it."
"Mr President, in this matter of the fiscal treatment of pensions, I should once again like to thank your Parliament and all the speakers for their support they have given the Commission proposal, and I hope that we will be able to continue in the manner indicated as soon as possible."
"Thank you very much, Mr Bolkestein."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"Financial collateral arrangements"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0417/2001) by Mr Pérez Royo, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on financial collateral arrangements (COM(2001) 168 - C5-0131/2001 - 2001/0086(COD))."
"Mr President, the Commission' s proposal on financial collateral arrangements establishes the European legislative framework for this type of arrangement and is an essential proposal in terms of the functioning of the financial market on a European level."
"This proposal is an essential element of the package of legislative proposals intended for this purpose."
"The main objectives of the proposal, in a very summarised form, are to guarantee the existence of efficient and reasonably simple systems for the creation of collateral under either title transfer (including repo) or pledge structures."
"To this end, it is necessary to introduce certain modifications into the legislations of various Member States, especially in the field of the regulation of pledges and also in the field of insolvency law and tendering procedures."
"In summary, it is a question of creating a sound and efficient regime for limiting credit risk and thereby ensuring a reduction in its cost and, at the same time, improving the functioning and stability of the European financial markets."
"From the European Parliament' s point of view, the main problem raised by the proposal was that of the subjective scope of application of the Directive."
"The initial proposal consisted basically of reducing the scope of the Directive to financial institutions and to very large companies other than financial companies, that is, large commercial, industrial or service companies, whose capital base exceeds EUR 100 million or whose gross assets exceed EUR 1000 million."
"The European Parliament, or at least the rapporteur, considered that this proposal raised two problems."
"Firstly, the removal from the scope of the Directive, and consequently from its benefits, of the majority of companies which are not strictly financial; not only small and medium ones, but also large companies which do not reach those very high quantitative thresholds which I have mentioned."
"Secondly, the setting of quantitative thresholds raises the problem of their revision and updating."
"The proposed directive resolved this problem by means of the technique of delegating this updating within the Commission, assisted by the Securities Committee, the so-called 'Lamfalussy Committee' ."
"This is a legislative delegation, a delegation of powers which is unacceptable to Parliament, or at least to part of it, as is well known, since this is not the first time we have dealt with the Lamfalussy Committee, in this field and in others, with Commissioner Bolkestein himself."
"The amendment which Parliament intends to introduce in this field consists, essentially, of the following: removing the reference to quantitative limits and, instead, establishing the requirement that, in these cases of agreements with commercial or industrial companies, the other party to the agreement, normally the taker of the collateral of the creditor, should be a financial entity."
"This solution has the advantage of resolving, at the same time, the two problems I mentioned, that is, the problem of the exclusion of not very large companies and the problem of the delegation of powers - or of the Lamfalussy Committee, shall we say."
"Apart from this amendment, which in turn takes the form of several amendments, there are others relating to the formalisation of agreements and evidence of the provision of collateral, the regulation of the right of use for pledge collateral and to other issues which I will not expand on."
"Mr President, I must end by pointing out - and this is very important - that, from the outset, I have tried to work in close contact with the Commission and with the Belgian Presidency, whose help, in both cases, I am very grateful for at this time."
"The purpose was to achieve a consensus which would make it possible to approve the proposed directive on first reading or at least to reduce the second reading to a mere formality."
"We based our approach on this intention, since most of the actors, both the Member States and the actors within industry, agreed on its importance and on a basic consensus, except on certain points, in relation to this proposal."
"It appeared that this objective had been achieved, since it appeared that the Council' s working group had reached an agreement which also satisfied Parliament' s essential intentions."
"At the last moment the initial agreement in the Council' s working group has been broken and tomorrow, possibly, in Ecofin a different agreement will be approved, which includes other points which Parliament has not been able to consider in detail."
"I therefore fear that the aim I referred to earlier of dispensing with the second reading, or at least reducing it to a mere formality, will not be possible, and we will have to continue working on this directive from next month."
"In this event, for tomorrow' s vote, I would ask you to vote for the amendments which were approved in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with slight modifications and to vote against an amendment which has been introduced in Parliament at the last moment, since the lack of consensus in the Council, that is to say, between the Member States, has also led to a rupture in the consensus which had been expressed in this Parliament' s Committee on Economic Affairs."
", draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please permit me to start by making an observation. We have here another example of how lawmaking in this House is normally dealt with just before midnight, whilst we have during the day been largely occupied with more or less pointless resolutions on one summit or another, which are generally fruitless."
"I see it as desirable that we should in future deal with important legislative matters at a more appropriate time in the course of the part-session."
"Apart from that, I would also like to thank the rapporteur on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee for his very balanced report, which one can also call a proposal by the Commission and a consequence of the directive on settlement finality that was adopted in 1998."
"At that time, I was on the Legal Affairs Committee - which then had principal responsibility for the report - and was rapporteur for this directive. I can only say that the problems we faced, and which this report goes a long way towards solving, were the same as those we are dealing with today."
"We must simply take care that there is a reasonable balance between the interest in having such credit security systems and keeping them stable, and the other interests that of course exist - those, perhaps, of creditors in insolvency cases - to which consideration must also be given, and that these interests are reconciled fairly."
"For there can be no doubt that what is at issue here is not just the protection of these financial systems; there must also be guarantees that others affected by this regulation should not be put at an undue disadvantage."
"I think that we have found a just reconciliation of the two, and it is this point that is decisive."
"The rapporteur has also mentioned a second angle of significance to us in the Legal Affairs Committee, namely the fact that the boundaries as regards preferential creditors have - I would say - been drawn relatively generously."
"We took the view that this category should either in fact be extended to include medium-sized enterprises, or, on the other hand, actually be restricted to banks and direct participants in financial markets."
"I believe that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has achieved a good result, and, in view of the lateness of the hour, I would also like to come to a conclusion."
"I can say on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee that we are in agreement with what the rapporteur has presented, and we will also, for our part, support it."
"Mr President, this is all going more quickly than any of us thought."
"I would like to start by apologising on behalf of Mrs Villiers, who has just, at the end of a vote in our Group's Conservative delegation, been appointed deputy leader of the delegation, on which I warmly congratulate her."
"As a lot has already been said, I would like to enlarge on just a few things."
"Firstly, the speakers on this item and its predecessor have set themselves a great goal."
"We want to do our utmost to ensure that the action plan for financial services - of which this directive is a part - is of high quality and can be adopted and implemented swiftly and in accordance with the timetable."
"We hope that, unlike on other occasions, the Council will not delay in producing its own position in response to the preparatory work done at least on this issue by Parliament and the Commission."
"Mr Lehne, who spoke before me, has already pointed out that it was the 1998 directive on settlement finality that set up the first milestone for Europe-wide financial policy."
"This has to date been the only piece of European legislation governing cross-frontier securities in connection with financial transactions."
"We need standardised regulation in this area in order to make the internal market efficient."
"We need to do away with the uncertainty as regards the law applicable to transactions across borders in negotiable securities."
"We need to do away with the increased administrative costs that stand in the way of an integrated EU market which is more attractive in terms of cost."
"We need to do away with the legal uncertainty that comes with 15 different legal systems, because these differing legal systems lead to risks when securities are utilised abroad."
"We also need to do away with the differing legislation on insolvency."
"There is, then, a need for a standard minimum regulation."
"This directive is the only means by which these objectives can be achieved, and so we welcome it and support the rapporteur's report and that produced by Mr Lehne of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"Many thanks!"
"We hope that it will be possible swiftly to implement this report by Parliament, together with the Commission's proposals, and thus turn them into a reality."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking very much your rapporteur, Mr Pérez Royo, and the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the excellent work and very constructive approach on the collateral proposal."
"This proposal, as was emphasised by Mr Karas just now, is a priority dossier in the Financial Services Action Plan and it is a crucial element for the timely delivery of the FSAP by 2003 for an integrated European Union securities market, and the year 2005 for the FSAP overall."
"Given that the value of outstanding contracts on the European REPO market alone exceeds EUR 1.8 billion, the expected benefits are extremely large."
"These contracts will, when the directive is implemented in the Member States, be governed by one legal regime, instead of 15 different ones."
"Such a uniform pan-EU legal framework for the use of collateral will contribute to the greater integration and cost-efficiency of European financial markets, by encouraging cross-border business and creating a more competitive European financial market."
"Now I come to the tabled amendments."
"The Commission generally supports all the amendments except for Amendment Nos 16 and 21 which deal with extended protection of top-up collateral and the restriction of the scope respectively."
"We fully support Amendments Nos 1, 2, 18 and19 as they stand."
"In addition, and subject to some rewording, which we do not expect will cause any difficulties for Parliament, we can also accept in principle Amendment Nos 3 to 15, 17 and 20."
"But we may need some flexibility in finding a final agreement."
"By supporting Amendment No 1, we are not abolishing protection of credit-related top-up collateral."
"But the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 16 which protects credit risk top-up collateral under the directive, and nor, we believe, can the Council."
"Nonetheless, as provided by Amendment No 1, it would be possible under national law to protect that kind of collateral."
"To be more precise, Amendment No 16 is not acceptable to the Commission because it could strongly conflict with insolvency law policy which generally discourages improvement of a creditor' s position as a result of an insolvency-related event or at least in a context of deteriorating credit-worthiness."
"Amendment No 21 is not acceptable to the Commission because the Commission would like to see as many non-financial companies as possible benefiting from this directive."
"Those companies are already using these techniques in the market."
"In conclusion, I should like once again to thank Members of Parliament for their sterling cooperation."
"I have also been apprised of what has occurred today in Coreper, as the rapporteur, Mr Pérez Royo, mentioned."
"Tomorrow, as he said, there will be an Ecofin meeting at which I myself will be present."
"I do not know what the discussion will lead to tomorrow."
"I regret the need for a second reading for obvious reasons, but I cannot help that."
"The Commission is in the hands of Council on the one hand and Parliament on the other."
"Lastly, I should like to say to Mr Lehne that I quite agree with him on the timing of this debate."
"It is an extremely important debate and yet it takes place at almost 11 p.m. and the public interest is very small."
"I assure you, Mr President, that if this debate could have taken place earlier today I would have been very happy."
"I am sure Members present would also have been very happy."
"Despite the time and the fact that Parliament is not so well represented, the debate has been of high quality and I, as President for the sitting, am very glad to have been able to take part at this hour and in this final nocturnal Strasbourg debate of 2001."
"We thank you on behalf of Parliament."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 10.55 p.m.)"
"Award of Sakharov Prize 2001"
"Mrs Nurit Peled-Elhanan, Mr Izzat Ghazzawi, Archbishop Zacarias Kamwenho, it is with great pleasure that the European Parliament welcomes you today in this Chamber, in order to award you the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought."
"Please allow me to offer a warm welcome not only to yourselves but also to the persons accompanying you, and especially to those of your relatives who are able to be present."
"Since 1988, the Sakharov Prize has been awarded every year by the European Parliament in recognition of individuals or organisations who have left their mark on the struggle for human rights and freedom in their home countries."
"At the centre of their actions has lain a deep-rooted conviction: the right to live in an environment of respect for the dignity of all human beings, whatever their ethnic origins, gender or beliefs."
"This year it has been decided, for the first time, that the Sakharov prize is to be shared between three recipients."
"This is an exceptional decision in response to exceptional circumstances."
"Mrs Nurit Peled-Elhanan, you are an Israeli who has been through profound and personal suffering."
"You once wrote: 'If war is to be ended, it is necessary to realise that blood is the same colour for everyone and that when a single child dies the whole world dies with it' ."
"When your thirteen-year-old daughter Smadar lost her life in a Palestinian suicide bombing, you did not allow the horror to turn your mind towards hatred. Instead, you chose to denounce - and I quote your words - 'a short-sighted policy which refuses to recognise the rights of the other and stirs up hatred and conflicts' ."
"How many of us can be sure that we too would maintain the same courage and dignity in the face of the worst injustice of all, the loss of a child?"
"All of us must feel affected in the depths of our soul by the strength and lucidity which have made you the symbol of all those Israelis who are campaigning for a peace which will take into account the aspirations of two peoples, the people of Israel and the people of Palestine."
"In awarding you the Sakharov Prize, our aim is to show our deep attachment to supporting all those who, through their daily actions, in spite of such difficult historical circumstances and in spite of the pressure of events, are working tirelessly to improve relations between peoples."
"Mr Izzat Ghazzawi, you are a Palestinian whose suffering has also been great."
"In one of your letters from prison, you addressed an Israeli friend and poet, Ya' ir Horowitz, who had recently died. In your letter, you tried to re-establish a dialogue that had been interrupted by death, outlining the dream of peace that you shared and drawing on the resources of hope to fight the despair which threatened to overwhelm you because the dream of peace was fading with time."
"You have tirelessly promoted the cause of peace and encouraged dialogue between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples."
"Your ardour has never slackened, despite imprisonment and censorship and, more importantly, the irreplaceable loss of your sixteen-year-old son Rami, killed by the Israeli army while trying to help a school friend who had been wounded in the school playground."
"You have resolutely pursued that same dialogue, through your writings, your lecturing at Birzeit University, your leading role as chairman of the Association of Palestinian Writers, your contacts with Israeli writers and your joint publications."
"You have endeavoured to make mutual understanding and tolerance prevail among the cultures, religions and peoples of the entire region."
"Mrs Nurit Peled-Elhanan and Mr Izzat Ghazzawi, by honouring you both together, the European Parliament hopes to make a contribution to the advance of the cause of peace over war, to the expression of tolerance and understanding and to the preservation of hope."
"Archbishop Kamwenho, your country has been at war for 25 years."
"Two generations of Angolans have grown up without knowing the meaning of the word 'peace' . The death toll of this interminable war makes frightening reading: one million dead, almost four million displaced individuals, hundreds of thousands of war orphans and war wounded, a starving population, meaning one child in five dies before the age of five, life expectancy is less than 45 years, millions of anti-personnel mines scattered throughout Angola, and extreme poverty despite the existence of natural resources which have, unfortunately, largely been used only for purposes of warfare."
"The European Parliament has always been committed to the promotion of a political solution to the conflict in Angola, and we have repeatedly stressed the urgent need for all parties to embark on a global dialogue with a view to a lasting peace based on the promotion and protection of human rights."
"Our Parliament has repeatedly expressed its support for the efforts made in this direction by the churches and the organisations of civil society."
"As Archbishop of Lubango, as President of the Catholic Episcopal Conference of Angola and São Tomé and of the Ecumenical Committee for Peace in Angola, you have been an apostle in the service of fundamental rights and peace and a symbol of the hopes of the Angolan people, of its desire for peace, liberty and justice."
"We salute your life' s journey as an individual and pay tribute to your ecumenical spirit, your determination and your eloquence."
"We also salute you as a spokesman for the aspirations of all those in Angolan civil society who are working for dialogue and reconciliation."
"Today and for all these reasons, Archbishop Kamwenho, we award you the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought."
"I shall conclude by expressing our wish to honour the memory of the victims of these conflicts, of all those, children, women and men, who have fallen in Israel, in Palestine and in Angola."
"We declare our support for the three winners of the Sakharov Prize for 2001, and we are profoundly moved by their tragic fate, and affirm a common stand against violence in whatever form."
"(Loud applause)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Luisa, my family, Mrs Sartaoui, I wanted to dedicate this speech to the memory of my father and his Palestinian friend, Dr Issam Sartaoui, who both dreamt of peace thirty years ago."
"I am, I feel, obliged, however, to dedicate this speech to the children who were killed yesterday by the Israeli army, simply because they were born Palestinians."
"It is a great honour to be here today with you, as winner of the Sakharov Prize."
"I am well aware that, on such occasions, one should speak of hope and of the human qualities that can lead us to the triumph of compassion and fraternity between people."
"Forgive me, therefore, for not speaking of this today."
"In Jerusalem, where I am from, hope and humanity are fading away."
"Israel is becoming a graveyard for children, which is growing bigger day by day. It is like an underground kingdom, extending beneath our feet and destroying everything in its wake."
"It is the kingdom where my daughter lives, with her Palestinian murderer, whose blood, mixed with hers, flows through Jerusalem, which became hardened to the sight of blood a long time ago."
"They are there with many, many more children, and they have all been let down."
"The murderer of my daughter has been let down, because his act of murder and of suicide achieved nothing."
"It did not put an end to the cruel Israeli occupation, it did not lead him to paradise, and those who promised him that his action would have meaning and value go on as if he had never existed."
"My young daughter was let down because she believed, just as thousands of her new brothers and sisters believed, that she lived in safety, that her parents protected her from evil and that nothing could happen to sweet little girls who cross the road to go to their dancing lesson."
"And all the children who are there with them have been let down, because the world goes on, as if their blood had never been spilled."
"In Jerusalem, where I am from, the men who call themselves our leaders have allowed death to hold sway."
"It appears, however, that these gentlemen know how to live in peace when they have to."
"On Friday 1 December, the editorial of a local newspaper in a Jerusalem in mourning told us that there had been peace in Jericho for two months."
"There are no Israeli soldiers there, no Palestinian policemen, no gun shots."
"Do not believe that the Americans have succeeded in convincing Ariel Sharon to stop sending young eighteen-year-old Israelis to kill innocent Palestinians, nor that they have succeeded in convincing the Palestinians to stop blowing themselves up along with their innocent Israeli victims."
"Far from it."
"Jericho is at peace because the Israeli and Palestinian leaders have together decided to reopen the casino ..."
"When I read this article, I could not stop myself from thinking that my daughter' s life is not even worth a single roulette chip."
"Almost 200 children have been killed since the beginning of the Intifada, of this incessant massacre, and they are worth nothing more than roulette chips."
"And yet, I was not very surprised, since I always knew that our war was not that of the Israeli people against the Palestinian people, but that of people who destroy lives who call themselves our Heads of State against the people from both sides."
"These cunning politicians use God, the wealth of the nation, freedom and democracy, and even our periods of mourning as political tools, and they use our children as if they were figurines in their games of chance."
"For instance, you knock over ten of mine, and I shall knock over 300 of yours, and we will be quits until the next time."
"None of this is new in the history of mankind."
"Leaders have always used God and other sacred values, such as honour and courage, to justify their self-indulgent ambition."
"And the only voice, throughout history, that spoke out to expose them and to oppose this was always the voice of mothers; the voice of those who produced the Jewish people, who disobeyed the Pharaoh' s orders to kill little boys at birth; the voice of Rachel, our biblical mother, weeping for her children and refusing to be consoled; the voice of the women of Troy; the mothers of Argentina, the mothers of Ireland, Israel and Palestine."
"It is the voice of those who give life and who are committed to preserving it."
"It is the only voice that remains after the violence has subsided, and which truly understands the meaning of the end of everything."
"Mothers are the only ones who know that the death of a child, any child, whether from Serbia or Albania, Iraq or Afghanistan, whether Jewish or Palestinian, is the death of the whole world, of its past and its future."
"When Luisa told me that I had been awarded the Sakharov Prize, I told her that I did not deserve it, since I had never saved a child, not even my own."
"But then I thought that the prize had not been awarded to me as a person, but to this voice that I took on through death and which transcends nationalities, religions, and even time."
"This voice that politicians and generals have tried to silence since man first walked this earth and since men have been waging war."
"I have often been asked whether or not I feel the need to exact revenge for the murder of my daughter, who was only killed because she was born an Israeli, by a young man, who had so little hope that he was willing to kill himself and who only killed himself because he was Palestinian."
"I always quote the verse of the great Hebrew poet Bialik. 'Satan has not yet created those who would exact revenge for the death of a small child' ."
"And this is not because Satan does not have the means, but because after a child has died, there is no longer vengeance, death, or life."
"The only feeling that remains, the only desire, the only need, that can never be satisfied, is that of protecting the child."
"The mothers who have lost their children will tell you that their arms hurt due to the constant need to hold the child and keep it from harm."
"No mother would ever think of seeking consolation by killing one child for another."
"If we do not wish our entire planet to become a kingdom of dead children, we must raise our voices as mothers in order to silence all the other voices."
"We must once again listen to the voice of God who said 'Do not harm children' . Otherwise, there will soon be nothing left to say, nothing left to hear, other than this incessant cry of mourning."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I beg you to listen to the voices that are coming from the underground kingdom of children who have been killed."
"That is where justice resides today, that is where true multiculturalism holds sway, that is where we know that there is no difference between blood, between skin, between identity cards or flags."
"Listen to the cries of the dead children and help their mothers to save the children who are still alive."
"(Loud and sustained applause)"
"Madam President, distinguished Members of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends: It is with great emotion and excitement I receive this recognition today."
"This prize is an act of faith in the ability of the world to promote a sustained dialogue of tolerance and understanding."
"It only made my commitment towards a nobler future for the conflict in our region stronger and more persistent than ever."
"There are so many events that I would like to tell you about here, but the time I am given is limited."
"From my prison, for almost three years I wrote a book called 'Letters Underway' where I asked myself during the bleakest moment the following question: could it be possible for me to address in my book an Israeli figure who is an artist, a father, a real human soul, a man or a woman who would abolish the image of a soldier guarding my solitary cell?"
"When the answer was yes, I proceeded with my writing."
"As soon as I was out of prison, I took part in a writers' meeting in Oslo where a few intellectuals from both sides met to discuss how they could contribute to peace."
"During ten days of ebbs and flows, the Israelis talked much about the historic distress that befell the Jewish nation and people."
"The Palestinians talked about their daily suffering under occupation."
"But finally, after ten days, we were able to understand each other's needs."
"I could not forget one comment by an Israeli writer."
"During this meeting, on the tenth day, he said, 'I always thought that man is evil... now I am not sure'."
"In that same year, 1993, my son fell dead to the bullets of the soldiers in his school."
"The event changed the taste of everything in my life, but I knew that a good human being is a living one."
"Suffering, if we so decide, can be used as a power to heal rather than a blind struggle for revenge and hatred."
"The principle of an eye for an eye, makes the whole world blind."
"I knew how to use understatement as a means of compromise in my literature."
"It is true, however, that the conflict of man with his heart is the noblest sort of struggle."
"It is a pity that the conflict of today is between nations and cultures."
"Left to the generals of war and enmity, they will make it a bloody history of terror."
"Left to them, we will accept it for a fact that our world is either bad or mad."
"But those who have read history in a tolerant way, understand that what is needed is a mutual moral commitment towards the facts of existence and the human obligation towards life as the only valuable gift."
"Abnormalities of all kinds do not have a race, or a religion, or a certain home."
"Only civilisation has its own religion and faith and home."
"That is because there has been no unique civilisation as a creation of its own: all through history civilisations borrowed from each other and excelled most when they were able to share their merits and values."
"However, the recent fear of a clash between cultures is not groundless."
"There is an amazing imbalance between the rich and the poor, and there are a great deal of injustices that threaten the very principle of tolerance in our globe."
"Yet, our insistence on dialogue between cultures is at its highest now, because we have to search into the roots of terror."
"As a writer living in an exceptionally troubled area, I must look at this issue of intercultural discourse as a story of attraction and excitement."
"Whatever happens in our region is doomed to affect the whole world."
"That is not because we are the centre of the world. It is only because the spiritual roots sprang from here to transmit their force among every and each one of us."
"Both attraction and excitement arise from this tremendous past."
"It is high time now to see that tremendous spiritual past as a part of a human culture."
"It is important to see it as a part of a human culture and not a divine call for a holy land that eats up its children."
"Man is holy."
"Nothing else is holy if man is humiliated and deprived of his rights to live in dignity."
"There will be no reason for a detailed map with the human heart being broken in our area at the edge of hope and despair."
"We are fed up with the illusion of victory."
"No nation can be defeated if it insists on the meaning of life as a value in itself."
"Our isolation and anxiety is beyond any proportion, but our faith in the future is also great."
"We will always need your support for a sustained peace process, and a support for the peace camps that lit the candles for all those who lost their lives in the ignorant battle."
"Once more, with deep gratitude, I thank you for awarding me, together with my partners, this prestigious prize, but it is also with all the anxiety I have in my heart for the future of Palestine and Israel, and the admiration I express for all the men and women who are there now and who have the dream and the vision."
"(The House rose and accorded the speaker a standing ovation)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my dear friends, I come from a land where the sun beats down and where the horizon is as wide as can be."
"I come from a country whose land is rich and whose people have little hope, where the forest is boundless but hope is not."
"From that land I bring greetings to you, Mrs Fontaine, President of the European Parliament."
"From that land I bring friendly greetings to you, honourable Members of this generous Parliament."
"I bring brotherly greetings to Mrs Nurit Peled-Elhanan and Mr Izzat Ghazzawi, the couple with whom I share this honour. From that country named Angola I bring greetings to the illustrious guests at this Plenary Assembly."
"Nor should we forget the social, written, spoken and televised communication that makes the five continents one huge human village."
"Finally, and this is where I probably should have begun, from Angola I bring greetings to this historic city of Strasbourg, home to the European Parliament, a city that I discovered when I was still young, attracted not only by its cultural climate but mainly by the memory of the many missionaries from Alsace who, together with Portuguese missionaries, brought the gospel to our land."
"So, to all of you, ladies and gentlemen, I bring a warm embrace from Angola."
"Mrs Fontaine, honourable Members of the European Parliament, Mr José Ribeiro e Castro, the party that has accompanied me here, amongst whom I wish to mention the Deputy Minister for Culture and the Ambassador of Angola, the President of the European Parliament, in her kind letter officially announcing the distinction that befell my unworthy person and congratulating me, wrote that peace has always been one of her main objectives and that my commitment to the ecumenical cause had raised her awareness."
"In fact, the Episcopal Conference of Angola and São Tomé, which I have chaired for almost four years, wrote in its pastoral message of March 2000 ""we cannot spread the gospel without promoting peace"" ."
"The Interdenominational Committee for Peace in Angola, also formed last year, seeks to be the voice of believers on the crucial matter of peace."
"In a letter dated 11 January 2001, His Excellency the President of the Republic, José Eduardo dos Santos, in response to a Christmas message of mine, wished me every success in the pastoral action that I am undertaking in the quest for peace and for the happiness of the Angolan people."
"And on the day following the announcement of the Sakharov Prize winners, the chorus of congratulations from everywhere and from all layers of society, including the President of the Republic and from Mr Jonas Savimbi, highlighted the unifying dimension of the prize; Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and its quality of stimulating the pursuit of ideals of peace."
"Unfortunately, in the land of prizewinners, particularly in mine, we have witnessed actions and behaviour which, humanly speaking, could invalidate the precepts put forward by the parliamentarians of the European Union."
"But our sixth sense tells us that this will not happen."
"The message of the 2001 Sakharov Prize is safe, and so I can assure you that there are many things that will not be the same as they were before."
"I believed and that was why I spoke out."
"It is impossible not to speak when faced with the tragedy of the Angolan situation."
"Living side by side with a simple and suffering people qualifies us to speak in their name both in recognising the efforts made by the government and in the quest for improvements that the people themselves are calling for."
"I said a few days ago that in the 14 years of anti-colonial war there was just one year, 1973, that recorded an unheard of rate of financial growth, whereas in the twenty-five years of the civil war, we have only seen a decrease, that has grown worse day by day, particularly since 1998."
"Hunger, nakedness and disease have created images which, if caught and projected onto the screens of the warlords would perhaps also give these people a sleepless night and make them begin to think about Angola."
"Malnutrition affects 47% of the population in some provinces, as attested by the appeal for humanitarian aid launched recently by the United Nations."
"The war in Angola has various causes."
"Thinking about the Lord who brought us here, to Strasbourg today, 12 December, half way between the 10th, the day of the Declaration of Human Rights, and the 14th, the day of His death, I see that I could focus on one of the causes: intolerance."
"It was not by chance that the UN declared 1995 as the United Nations Year of Tolerance."
"Still echoing in our ears and in our conscience are the words spoken by Pope John Paul II on World Peace day this year and those of Federico Mayor Zaragoza, the then director of UNESCO, when he said, and I quote, 'Humanity must be able to dedicate itself to peace, safeguard it, re-establish it and rebuild it by creating a space for dialogue, consultation and reconciliation."
"No more violence!'"
"It has been very difficult to speak of tolerance in my country because the roots of intolerance run deep, being anchored in the political bipolarisation between the two most popular parties: the MPLA and UNITA."
"In this climate, a speech on the subject of tolerance is seen either as a betrayal of these parties, which have great popular support - and are, ironically, at war with one another - or as a reactionary attitude, if expressed by an independent person."
"Given this climate, to speak of change would mean sharing power with rivals; but, for us, the church and civil society, the first change would be to accept tolerance as an issue of survival which is, therefore, necessary, from the foundations to the roof, from the political parties to the government, from civil society and the churches themselves to the national project."
"Tolerance is the key word, as Locke teaches us, if we want to find a human basis for integrating conflict resolution, including our own, for a harmonious development."
"In the case of Angola, tolerance would be given form in the specific aspect of national reconciliation, whose foundations can only be reached through permanent and inclusive dialogue, able to break this never-ending cycle of war."
"Tolerance requires solidarity and fraternity and the lesson that we have learned from Europe is the lesson emerging from this great Assembly, which is meeting here today."
"Human fraternity, pervading all facets of our relationship, also draws our attention to the economic angle and its ambiguities."
"In this 'South' where we live, wealth generates both war and signs of solidarity. Speaking of mining in particular, I would say that it is already time to increase the transparency that would make it more difficult to finance conflicts but which would also encourage social investment ..."
"... affecting the standard of living of Angolans, and this would be achieved by themselves, not by something that looks like charity."
"To conclude, I shall refer to the thought that inspired the campaign that brings me today to this podium to receive the Sakharov Prize: help Angola to live!"
"This was the challenge that the Catholic Church set the Soviet Union and the United States in 1986 in its assessment of the first ten years of national independence."
"After spending another 16 years at war, we launched the same message."
"But to whom, this time?"
"To the MPLA and to UNITA to whom we repeated with a breaking heart: twenty-six years of history have been stained with blood - the blood of brothers killed by brothers, and closing the doors to dialogue would open them to a war without a visible end."
"This can be read in the pastoral message issued by the bishops."
"Today, with the confidence of the European Union, whose parliamentarians have placed the prestigious Sakharov Prize in our hands, I humbly call for a bilateral and simultaneous cease-fire that will open the way to a cessation of hostilities, as we have called for so many times."
"Because we can still make up for lost time."
"Agostinho Neto, Angola' s first President, left us these mysterious verses which I have written down:"
"'I no longer wait"
"I am the man for whom others wait'"
"Every Angolan is the man or woman for whom others wait."
"Help them to live!"
"This is why the financial component of this Prize will be going to the Ecumenical Fund for Peace, in other words, to promote education for peace and for national reconciliation amongst the population."
"So, my friends, help Angola to live!"
"Thank you very much!"
"(Loud, sustained applause)"
"(The President presented the Sakharov Prize to the three laureates)"
"(The House rose and gave sustained applause)(The formal sitting was closed at 12.50 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, I should like to point out, with respect to yesterday's minutes, that Dr Ganzert, the lawyer detained in Nicaragua, has now been allowed to leave, and to thank you for everything you did to bring this about."
"Thank you, Mr Rübig."
"(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved)"
"Order of business"
"At yesterday' s meeting of the Conference of Presidents, it was decided that the sitting of Monday 17 December in Brussels will be extended by one hour."
"The part-session will therefore begin at 3 p.m. and end at 7.30 p.m."
"Madam President, as the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, we are against the extension of the Monday sitting, which will serve only to get the anti-terrorism package approved."
"This package was presented in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs this morning, but we could not proceed to the discussion because of the very tight deadlines, and no report was drawn up."
"I think it is worrying that Parliament should express an opinion without first having drawn up a report on such an important subject."
"We are therefore against this shortening of deadlines, because it simply does not allow us to present a reasoned report on such an important subject."
"Thank you, Mr Di Lello Finuoli."
"It will therefore be recorded in the Minutes that you are not in favour of the decision taken by the Conference of Presidents."
"Decision on urgent procedure"
"I shall now give the floor to Mr Watson, the chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"Watson (ELDR), chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"Madam President, last night two requests were referred to my committee under Rule 112."
"These relate to re-consultation on two framework decisions from the Council, one on combating terrorism, the other on a proposal for a European arrest warrant."
"We were asked to treat these as a matter of urgency."
"My committee met this morning and agreed to propose to the plenary that we agree to urgency for these texts as submitted without report."
"Thank you, Mr Watson."
"We shall therefore act in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, as usual."
"Does any Member wish to speak against the request?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the six years that I have been an MEP, Parliament has constantly asked the European institutions to show it some respect."
"Today, once again, Parliament is being asked not even to respect itself and we have heard the two larger groups, in the 'Citizens' Freedoms' Committee, decide with the Liberals that Parliament must not act with self-respect."
"This is, however, incredible since we are going to vote on the European arrest warrant, which will enter into force in 2004, namely in two years' time, and today they are telling us that there will be a Laeken European Council."
"This European Council will decide on a text on Sunday night."
"This text will be reviewed by lawyers on Monday morning."
"No one will have seen the text before arriving in Brussels on Monday afternoon."
"And Parliament is going to vote on it, and cannot wait until January."
"Can you explain to me why we cannot take a vote in January on a text that will come into force in 2004?"
"It is absurd, it is ridiculous and it shows that Parliament does not take itself seriously, and I urge my fellow Members not to support the leaders of their groups, but to show some dignity and to reject this request, to have a report, to vote in January and show that this Parliament respects parliamentary rules and that we are not at anyone' s beck and call."
"Thank you."
"We shall now hear a Member who is in favour of this request."
"We heard the chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, one speaker in favour and one speaker against."
"We shall now vote on the request for urgent procedure."
"(Parliament approved the request for urgent procedure)"
"Vote"
"Thank you, Mr Costa Neves."
"After the vote on the amendments"
"Mr President, I am advised that the figures that we have just voted on do not make sense unless we vote on the Wynn report which is about the financial perspective."
"We need to vote on that to make sure that we have the figures before we accept that the vote we have just had is complete."
"In other words, Mr Wynn, you would like to vote on your report now and then vote on the report by Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg."
"If that is what you mean, I do not see any problem in doing this."
"Report (A5-0447/2001) by Mr Wynn, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision on the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument (COM(2001) 625 - C5-0557/2001 - 2001/2227(ACI))"

"On Amendment No 1"
"Madam President, a brief parenthesis to remove the spanner from the works: we reached an agreement which, from Parliament's point of view, was perfect as far as development policy output targets are concerned."
"But we do not to spell it out again in the resolution in question, so we are withdrawing Amendment No 1."
"We believe that Parliament has made excellent progress within the budget on this point and Amendment No 1 is therefore no longer necessary."
"Thank you, we shall take note of this."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, you have concluded the second reading of the draft budget."
"I have seen the agreement reached between our two institutions at our consultative meeting on 21 November assume concrete form in your vote today."
"I take note of the fact that there remains some difference of opinion on the division of expenditure."
"On that point the Council reserves all rights."
"Nevertheless the Council is able to agree to the proposed maximum percentage increase that emerged from your second reading."
"Thank you, Mr Vande Lanotte."
"Does the Commission wish to take the floor?"
"(Having invited the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Vande Lanotte, the Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Wynn, and the rapporteurs, Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg to join her, the President signed the budget)"
"I am sorry to interrupt this august House but I rise on a very important point."
"A few minutes ago the ECJ ruled in Luxembourg that the French ban on British beef was illegal."
"(Cheers) Could I have assurances from you, Madam President, that you will do everything you can to make sure that the French fully compensate the poor hard-pressed British farmers as a result of this ruling?"
"Madam President, I suggest - and I hope the House will back me up here - that we add the following at the end of this sentence:"
"'demanding the Palestinian Authority dismantle the terrorist networks including the arrest and prosecution of all suspects'."
"(Parliament agreed to take into consideration the oral amendment) - Before the vote on Amendment No 7"
"Madam President, I propose that we insert ""Israel and the Palestinian Authority"" in lieu of the point ""all countries in the region""."
"(Parliament agreed to take into consideration the oral amendment)"
"(Parliament adopted the recommendation)"

"We have become aware since drafting this report that the last phrase in our paragraph 4 is contrary to the provisions that we cite in recital A, referring to Protocol 6 of the ECHR."
"Therefore, I would like to propose that we replace the last phrase of paragraph 4 with the phrase 'extradition cannot take place where the defendant could be sentenced to capital punishment'."
"If we use those words, we are in conformity with Protocol 6 which we cite at the beginning."

"Before the vote on Paragraph 5"
"Madam President, I am certainly not acquainted with the vital reasons that have led to the choice of today' s timetable."
"I do not, however, understand how we can end the vote at 11 a.m. and debate a very important report on social and economic problems after 5 p.m., when there may not be many Members present in the House."
"If it is more important in this Parliament to talk about Mr Berlusconi than the social policies of the European Union, then please say so and in that way we will know that our work is completely useless."
"Thank you, Mrs Muscardini."
"As you know, the draft agenda has been adopted by this House."
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE"
"Costa Neves and Buitenweg report (A5-0400/2001)"
"Madam President, the Costa Neves/Buitenweg report deals with the general budget of the European Union."
"You can see, Madam President, that right now at least half of the members of the public who are watching Members leave the House when Mr Fatuzzo starts his explanations of vote are elderly and pensioners - but that is just a coincidence."
"Well, I have looked at the European budget and tried to pick out the entries for initiatives that are specifically concerned with, and of interest to, the elderly and pensioners."
"I had to get the magnifying glass which, as you know, on the computer lets you magnify the words written in the various documents, and I looked and looked and looked but could not find any."
"That, then, Madam President, is why I had to vote against this European Parliament budget."
"I hope next year, at the end of 2002, I may instead have the satisfaction of voting for it because at last there will be some substantial, major, visible entries favouring pensioners."
"- (DA) We have voted against Amendment No 7 to the report on the EU' s draft general budget for 2002, tabled by Jens-Peter Bonde on behalf of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities."
"As it stands, the draft is of no use at all in securing a better arrangement for MEPs' travel expenses."
"It is also our view that MEPs' travel expenses are a subject to be dealt with in connection with a reform of the Statute for Members."
"As we reach the end of the budgetary procedure for the financial year 2002, I think that it is important to make a number of comments about agriculture, the Community's border regions and the European Union's external actions, to confine myself to the essential points."
"With regard to agriculture, the fact that several billion euros of the 2001 budget have not been used will mean that significant sums will be returned to the Member States, whilst a strong dollar with regard to the euro will have at least had the effect of automatically creating a favourable situation on the markets."
"Nevertheless, if necessary, the Commission should not hesitate to extend the special purchase scheme for beef - a programme which was set up in the aftermath of the BSE crisis and which expires at the end of the year - by six months, either through an SAB or a transfer of appropriations, even though it is proposed in the Letter of Amendment No 2 to cancel the billion euros initially earmarked for any additional needs related to BSE."
"The border regions, which were generously provided for in the Berlin agreements, will, for their part, benefit from EUR 16 billion over seven years."
"The Nice and Gothenburg summits confirmed this policy, entrusting the Commission with the task of setting up an additional programme worth some EUR 191 million."
"The Committee on Budgets has deemed it appropriate for its part to add a further 50 million under Interreg."
"This is in spite of the fact that in many cases there is clearly no proof that these 22 border regions (from Finland to Greece via Bavaria) are in need of this new money, and that they already receive significant financial support and will be the first to benefit from enlargement."
"In comparison, given the amounts at stake, we cannot but be taken aback by the lack of aid which was available following the devastation wreaked on French forests by the storms, the effects of the floods in Picardy and the immediate damage caused by the Erika."
"Given the urgent nature of the situation, appropriations ought even to have been re-deployed."
"(Intervention shortened pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)"
". During the budget discussions with the Commission on Category 4, broad agreement has been reached as regards the importance of improving the reporting system on development assistance, as well as the need to develop targets and indicators for measuring impact."
"Moreover, agreement has also been reached to have a benchmark that 35% of spending should be allocated in support of social infrastructure."
"It was my intention, as rapporteur for the Development Cooperation Budget, to suggest an oral amendment to the original amendment, submitted by me, emphasising ""... to the social sectors in a given country, reflects the wishes of the beneficiaries and that a degree... the norm. Progress towards meeting the benchmark will be monitored through the Common RELEX Information System""."
"Because of procedural rules and lack of time, however, this oral amendment proved impossible to submit."
"The intention, however, was to emphasise that the benchmark should be seen in the context, not only of total donor spending, but also taking into account recipient country wishes."
"Wynn report (A5-0447/2001)"
". (ES) The Interinstitutional Agreement of 1999, for which I was rapporteur, created the Flexibility Instrument, a 'light' revision of the Financial Perspectives of less inconvenience to the Council."
"In the two previous budgetary years, we rather forced the interpretation of that mechanism, since it was applied by us in order to meet the needs of Kosovo and Serbia, with regard to the fact that the Council refused to keep its word and agree to the revision of the Financial Perspectives which it promised in its Declaration of 6 May 1999."
"This year, the European Commission presented a proposal to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument which, for the first time, respected the letter and the spirit of the Agreement."
"But once again it has not been possible and the responsibility for that falls to Parliament."
"It was a question of providing EUR 197 million of the EUR 281 million it will cost to convert the fleet which previously fished in Moroccan waters, a fleet and an industry which provides employment in the least-favoured regions of the current EU: Galicia, Andalusia and the Algarve."
"All of these are Objective 1 regions."
"On the afternoon of the conciliation of 21 November, the Council and the Commission sounded out formulae which did not represent a reduction for anybody, but it seems it was not enough for some people to obtain resources which were difficult to justify, but that it had to be at the expense of everybody else."
"The result is that the Objective 1 regions of Spain and Portugal will have to pay for 40% of the conversion of their fleet by means of the reprogramming of the FIFG."
"My colleague Barbara Dührkop Dührkop will continue with the explanation of vote."
". (ES) I will continue the explanation of vote started by my colleague Mr Colom i Naval."
"There were people, however, such as Mr Stoiber, in such a prosperous region as Bavaria, who considered that it was in their electoral interest to name a price which might appear in a newspaper headline: a programme - with no legal basis, by the way - for cross-border cooperation with the candidate countries, funded with some of the money intended for fishing conversion."
"Demagoguery is contagious and others followed his example and the conversion programme was taken hostage, despite the fact that there were already appropriations for cross-border cooperation, at least in B5-3003, B5-0510, B2-0141, B3-1010, B3-1021 or B3-0306."
"I would like to stress that we are in favour of the intention to prepare these regions and that they have always had our support."
"What we are not satisfied with is the fact that it is done to the detriment of the regions affected by an unexpected conversion."
"And, although the resolution states that in 1999 it was not envisaged that enlargement could have consequences for the bordering Community regions, this is not the case."
"In Germany, for example, the border States will have Community aid of more than EUR 10.5 billion."
"We have rarely seen such a miserly and nationalistic spectacle in this House!"
"This would be typical of the Council."
"We voted in favour, but without enthusiasm."
"We did so because we do not want to sacrifice those poor regions of the Iberian coast, but also out of solidarity with these regions and also with those bordering the candidate countries, a solidarity which has been sadly lacking in this negotiation."
"Peijs report (A5-0453/2001)"
"At this, the last plenary part-session of the European Parliament of 2001, which is also the last before the introduction of the euro notes and coins, we have to note that the European Parliament has not organised a formal sitting or even a debate of any kind to mark an event which is in principle, for all of the federalists here, who are in the majority, the greatest ever project of European 'integration'."
"Why this silence, which has moreover lasted for several part-sessions and which has been broken only by sovereigntist voices?"
"The answer is simple: the final phase of introducing the single currency - which is to say the physical changeover of notes and coins as of 1 January 2002 - is based on two enormous deceptions."
"First of all, the single currency is totally useless from a technical point of view and serves only to satisfy the extremist desires of certain federalists who absolutely must have uniform monetary signs throughout Europe."
"In fact, we could quite easily have kept the current arrangement: the euro for international purposes, superposed on national currencies."
"We are therefore going to turn people's lives upside down, make their lives more difficult in the coming months, and doubtless further reduce the trust which they have in their national institutions, and all of this for no useful purpose except to pander to federalist passions."
"The second deception is that public opinion has never been properly enlightened and has even been manipulated."
"Neither at Maastricht nor in the ensuing years did the public fully understand the impact of the Treaty, that is to say, that it would bring about the end of the franc."
"Subsequently, every possible effort was made to give the impression that the public supported the project, which was not true."
"Today the harsh reality has dawned: 52% of French people think that the single currency offers more disadvantages than advantages while 33% think the opposite (Le Figaro, 11 December) and 62% would like to continue using the franc compared with 32% who are of the opposite opinion (Wall Street Journal, 11 December)."
"Similar percentages are replicated at European level."
"The deception is so huge that next year, when people's eyes are opened, we will not only have to rethink the euro, but also consider thoroughgoing reforms of the European institutions to prevent public opinion from being manipulated in this way again."
"Motion for a resolution (B5-0747/2001)"
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy unanimously approved my Amendment No 22 regarding a new Paragraph 9 of the resolution with the following wording: 'Calls on the partners to ensure that the State has a monopoly on the use of force and that no parallel military structures can continue their activities' ."
"If it is - ever - to be possible for peace to be achieved between Israelis and Palestinians, or between the State of Israel and the Palestinian Authority, it is crucial that the power of the State should have a monopoly on the use of force and that Islamic terrorist paramilitary groups - such as Islamic Jihad, Hamas and Hizbollah - should not be allowed to be armed and to carry out terrorist attacks against civilians as they at present do with great regularity."
"My amendment was unfortunately rejected by Parliament."
"However, the line of reasoning I put forward has been included in paragraph 3.3 of the resolution in the compromise demand 'for the Palestinian Authority to dismantle terrorist networks, including by arresting and prosecuting all suspects' ."
"I regard this request as progress in itself and as being very clearly worded in the same spirit and along the same lines as my original amendment."
"The voting session that we have just completed is yet another perfect illustration of the frequently hemiplegic behaviour of the European Parliament."
"How is it possible for this House to adopt, by a broad majority, a motion for a resolution in which it declares its 'solid commitment to the common fight against terrorism' alongside the United States whilst refusing, by a broad majority, to ask the Palestinian Authority to condemn terrorism?"
"I am stunned that nearly 320 Members voted against Amendment No 6 which proposed something that seems perfectly obvious, in other words, that the support we are giving to the Palestinian Authority and its institutions must be coupled with a firm condemnation of the violence inflicted by the same Authority and the implementation of effective measures that will put an end to the terrorist attacks."
"What do we gain by using such disingenuous language?"
"By moving away from a balanced policy, we are putting our diplomatic credibility at risk and we make ourselves appear to be biased."
"Do we want the next European mission to be turned away from Israel, just as the mission headed by the Belgian Presidency was?"
"Why send such an ambiguous message to the terrorists, as if there were good and bad terrorists?"
"Our condemnation of terrorism must be global and there should be no exception."
"This will merely enable us to be in a better position to state our desire to see the Palestinian people in a fully-fledged, sovereign State."
"All people aspire to a genuine State, which is the expression of their sovereignty, and the Palestinian people have the same right to this as everyone else."
"However, we shall not assist the leaders of the Palestinian Authority to act with the responsibility of State authorities whilst being complacent towards terrorism."
"Watts report (A5-0440/2001)"
"Madam President, the Conciliation Committee has spoken to us about the living and working conditions on board the ships that arrive in Community ports."
"I voted for the motion, Madam President, because I remember life on board very well, since at a young age I sailed on board passenger liners between New York and the Bahamas."
"There are some seamen who live a good life on board once their shift is finished: for instance, the pursers and deck officers dine in the restaurant with the passengers, drink whisky in the passengers' bar, dance in the ballroom with the female passengers if they are men or male passengers if they are women."
"In contrast, though, there are the cooks, cabin-boys and helmsmen, who unfortunately live in tiny cabins four metres square and enjoy living conditions that are not quite so pleasant."
"I really hope that my vote in favour will be useful so that we can take a real interest in living conditions on board ship, but for all seamen and not just some."
"- Madam President, I warmly welcome this report by my Socialist colleague Mark Watts, which will enable EU Member States to enforce international standards for ship safety, pollution, prevention and onboard living and working conditions."
"This report has the potential positively to affect a broad number of issues: it could enhance the lives of people working on board ships and, moreover, it is in line with the EU's attempts to take a pioneering role in protecting the environment."
"The calls for ""black boxes"" which carry voyage data recorders, are a vital and concrete way to ensure that those ships calling at EU ports all adhere to common standards."
"Ortuondo Larrea report (A5-0441/2001)"
"Madam President, the Ortuondo Larrea report marked the agreement of the Conciliation Committee to inspections and surveys of ships when they enter European Community ports."
"I voted for it, but I would hope, Madam President, that the on-board inspections will be performed by European Union inspectors, and not inspectors from the Member States."
"We know all too well, in fact, that the Member States do not want inspections in the way the European directives are implemented, so much so that, in a conciliation to have inspections on the implementation of environmental directives, all 15 Member States of the Union opposed them."
". (NL) I am pleased that agreement has finally been reached at arbitration on the three major measures contained in the Erika 1 package."
"We have debated and negotiated at length, and it is now time for the implementation and enforcement of the legislation."
"As regards the report on the classification bureaux, the most important subject for the Liberals too was liability."
"In the first and second readings we argued for a ceiling on the liability of classification bureaux, since the latter organisations are only one element in the chain of liability."
"Unlimited liability is in our view only justified where there is gross negligence."
"In addition, a ceiling ensures that eventually the fairly closed markets for classification and statutory tasks will become more open and a more level playing field will be created."
"At present, new classification bureaux can scarcely compete with the existing (national) organisation under a regime of unlimited liability."
"In order to avoid undermining the Erika 1 package and to retain the gain for Parliament brought by the Watts report (voyage data recorders on ships), at third reading, the Liberals accepted with reservations the proposal that Member States should be free in their negotiations with classification bureaux to agree higher, unlimited liability."
"The result of this, however, will have to be evaluated by the European Commission."
"The Liberals are pleased that extra guarantees have been built into the Regulation to prevent any entanglement of interests between a classification bureau and the owner of a vessel being monitored."
"The bureau must now be completely independent, which stands to reason."
"Hatzidakis report (A5-0344/2001)"
"We are still on the subject of ships, Madam President, in the report by Mr Hatzidakis on the results of the Conciliation Committee regarding double hulls for oil tankers."
"I voted for it because it is important to have achieved this agreement."
"Double-hulled tankers sail the seas of the whole world providing a better safeguard against pollution."
"I should be pleased, however, if there were also better safeguards for the crews, who do not have an easy life on board oil tankers, and I should be pleased, above all, if the electronic and navigational appliances were improved."
"Basically, we should try to prevent any disasters at sea by every possible means, either before doubling ships' hulls or, at least, as well as doubling their hulls."
"Surely, in the end, improvements to the electronic steering and control apparatus cost less than doubling the hull."
"Pérez Royo report (A5-0417/2001)"
"The report by my colleague, Fernando Pérez Royo, on financial collateral arrangements is an important step towards standardising the legal regime governing financial instruments in Europe."
"Like my colleague, I attach great importance to the harmonisation of these markets, within a reasonable period of time. This is what Mr Pérez Royo's work seeks to achieve."
"Although, overall, the report is based on the same model of future European financial markets I myself have in mind, the French socialists have not supported the rapporteur on three points."
"Article 2(4) broadens the scope of application of the directive to all market participants and thus modifies the order of preferential creditors in the event of bankruptcy."
"This compromises companies' chances of recovery by transferring ownership of their assets to creditor banks, bypassing preferential creditors (employees, tax and social security bodies)."
"Article 6 provides for the use by the collateral taker of the financial instruments' collateral held under the security financial collateral arrangement; these provisions give rise to difficulties related to ownership rights and traceability of securities and thus threaten the transparency of European financial markets."
"Finally, Article 10(2), as amended by Amendment No 17, deletes the precise localisation criteria, thus making any credible attempt to increase the transparency of our financial markets doomed to failure and pre-empting the conclusions of the Hague Conference on International Private Law."
"Since the vote in the plenary confirmed the rapporteur's choice to broaden the scope of the directive, the French socialists voted against the text as a whole."
"Motion for a resolution (B5-0821/2001)"
"The large groups in this House have just tabled and passed a resolution deploring the Commission's failure to submit its legislative programme for 2002, which they criticise for being insufficiently detailed, in good time, a surprising move coming from them."
"Of course, we could not but endorse this initiative, but neither can we avoid asking ourselves what has prompted this almost universal attitude of spite towards Romano Prodi."
"At every turn a majority of this Parliament seems to be trying to disassociate themselves from him."
"Why?"
"Has he in the end become disliked because his statements are sometimes insufficiently federalist?"
"Is he being reproached for not providing sufficiently vigorous opposition to the Council, which lately has appeared to be even more exasperated than usual by the Commission's customary 'integrationism' and by its defence of a 'Community method' which has been torn to shreds by Europe's evolution, and in particular by enlargement?"
"We should also mention an alternative explanation, which might give us rather more cause for concern: the transitional arrangements for bringing the euro notes and coins into circulation on 1 January 2002 are not going too well, and it seems that there is a danger that the public will not enjoy the experience."
"It may well be that the federalist politicians in this House are starting to distance themselves from an institution which they are readying themselves to accuse in the future of not doing enough to prepare for the changeover."
"The Commission would be a perfect scapegoat - and moreover with some justification - for these politicians' sins."
"In the conclusions of the Commission communication, it is claimed that while the Commission 'is carrying out a radical reform of its working methods at the political, financial and administrative levels... in the meantime there are growing fears that Europe may lose touch with the immediate concerns of its citizens' ."
"I believe these are not just fears."
"The fact that the citizens are not really interested in this radical reform of the Commission' s working methods seems to me to be healthy."
"It would be worrying if they showed much interest in such matters, which do not arouse enthusiasm even among us Members, seeing that we have not really noticed all this revisionist radical behaviour that is being pointed out to us now."
"Instead, we, like the citizens, notice that Europe is getting more and more out of touch with people' s concerns and seems more and more distant."
"Perhaps the introduction of the euro, once the initial difficulties of understanding its value in terms of the old currencies have been overcome, may help more people to see Europe as a common reality, although the feeling is likely to remain, especially among the older generations, that they have been tricked out of their old currency, which will have vanished without anyone having asked them for their views."
"The feeling that Europe is distant is a real feeling and one that is becoming more and more widespread among the citizens."
"At crucial moments in the life of society it does not show itself as such, but emerges as the opinion of this or that government."
"The opinions are legitimate, but they do not convey the idea that we all belong to a common entity whereas, in the past, this idea had always been symbolically expressed by the Commission."
"It was the Commission that called the tune with statements and practical proposals."
"Now, though, partly because it is not the Commission that represents foreign policy, when faced with questions of international politics Europe seems not to exist, and it is not evident in the figure of Mr CFSP."
"Enlargement itself, the subject of so much praise and emphasis, is, on the contrary, seen by the citizens as a weakening rather than a strengthening of Europe."
"If I do not share the enthusiasm about the 'working methods' expressed in the communication, it is not because I consider that the topics dealt with or the declared commitments are not going in the right direction, or because there are not enough legislative initiatives."
"As everyone knows, quality does not depend on numbers."
"It should be understood, rather, that over-regulating gives a distorted image of Europe and makes people identify it with that bureaucratic Moloch that is so feared by industry and the citizens."
"No. The intended work programme must be a political document and not an administrative list."
"It must state the reasons for certain delays and the real obstacles that have prevented certain objectives from being achieved; it must identify some priority goals through which the unification process can be pushed forward."
"Europe fully developing 'an effective role in the management and solution of international crises' will also depend on the Commission' s political will and not just on the possibility of developing on a global scale its function as a proposer of legislation."
"Rather than in the cultivation of regulation peas, the identity of Europe will express itself in foreign policy and the security and defence policy."
"The Commission should aim essentially at this if it does not want to be reduced even more in 2002 to a purely bureaucratic and administrative body."
"Motion for a resolution (B5-0813/2001)"
". I agree in general (while having some reservations about some of the language) with the resolution as posed."
"I believe the European Union should co-operate on an international level in combating terrorism, organised crime and individual criminals, all of whom use the differences in legal systems to avoid standing trial."
"However, my main reservation with regard to this resolution is the absence of any reference to the International Criminal Court, initiated by the Rome Convention."
"This court when established will enable the trial of any and every individual suspected of crime, including war crimes."
"This court, which is being opposed by the USA Government would guarantee a fair trial and would apply even-handedly to everyone."
"In current circumstances this court is needed more than ever."
"Lagendijk report (A5-0394/2001)"
"How wonderful it would be, Madam President, if we could find a solution to prevent conflicts!"
"I voted for this document, Madam President, but I am convinced that we will be able to avoid these conflicts - 99% of which just happen to involve poor, or rather very poor, countries in the world - if we can make these countries a little less poor."
"I therefore think it is appropriate that the European Union should continue its actions of supporting the economies of Third World countries and poor countries, because I am convinced that only by improving the living standards of the citizens of our world who live in poverty - or rather in extreme poverty, not just in poverty, but in the most wretched poverty there could be - will we succeed in preventing conflicts of any kind."
"Gahler report (A5-0418/2001)"
"The report by Mr Gahler, Madam President, concerns the relations between the European Union and the Islamic Republic of Iran."
"I have had the luck to have a town councillor for the Pensioners' Party who was born in Tehran and lived in Iran for thirty years and who had dual Iranian and Italian citizenship."
"He explained the situation in Iran to me very clearly, and so I am very pleased that people there are trying to go back to the democracy that the Shah had installed into the country, even though he was the emperor."
"I shall therefore ask that these talks should continue and that we should have an exchange of members of Parliament between Iran and the European Union, and most of all I propose that you, Madam President, should invite President Khatami to address this House here in Strasbourg."
"I welcome moves to improve relations with Iran."
"But we must always take account of the fact that human rights in Iran are, if anything, getting worse and not better."
"Iran is continuing to fund terrorist groups such as Hizbollah who are active in the Middle East. In particular, Iran funds terrorist groups that are still holding hostage a number of Israeli soldiers who are officially posted as missing in action."
"If Iran is serious about developing better relationships with the West, it ought to put pressure on those groups to release those soldiers."
"In particular, I would draw Parliament's attention to the case of Ron Arad, an Israeli air force officer who, in 1986, was captured by a Shi'ite militia group in Lebanon."
"He was then in 1987 sold to another group which was funded and run by Iran."
"He has not been seen since 1987; his daughter was an infant when he was taken hostage."
"Would it not be an appropriate message for this season of goodwill if she could at long last see her father who disappeared 15 years ago?"
"Please would Iran help these soldiers be released if it is serious about developing peace with the rest of the world."
"Van den Burg report (A5-0388/2001)"
"Madam President, the van den Burg report deals with the Commission report on the regulation of taxation of second-pillar pensions, that is, occupational pensions."
"We know that there is the EET system and so on, that is, tax is paid either on the contributions or on the interest on the invested capital, on what is received for the occupational pension, or tax is paid on the pensions themselves."
"Speaking on behalf of the Pensioners' Party, I propose the EEE system, in other words: exemption from paying tax when the pension contributions are paid; exemption from paying tax when the capital so received is invested; and exemption from paying tax when the occupational pension is redeemed."
"If we really want to improve and enhance the possibility of saving through pensions - occupational, company and voluntary - the Member States should give up levying tax on them."
"When we are young and think about our future, we should think that one day we shall be old and nobody will think about us, except we ourselves with our pensions."
"Occupational pensions will play an increasingly important role in ensuring that pensions provide secure, lasting and effective social protection as well as a decent standard of living for retired people."
"There is an urgent need to create a genuine single market in pension funds, and this means providing for a tax system which will, regardless of the country of residence of the member or retired person, avoid contributions and benefits being taxed twice and discourage pensioners from going into tax exile to avoid taxes."
"I voted against the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the Commission communication on the elimination of tax obstacles to the cross-border provision of occupational pensions because the methods recommended in it run counter to the objective sought."
"This is because the proposals contained in the report submitted to us will generate costly bureaucracy, because of Member States' having to exchange information and work together to collect taxes, and do not in any way constitute a practical and efficient approach towards removing the tax obstacles to the cross-border provision of occupational pensions."
"Instead of starting a process of consultation to identify which of the tax models currently in force in the Member States avoids double taxation of contributions and benefits with the greatest efficiency and the least bureaucracy, the report already comes down in favour of the EET regime, when it is obvious that the TEE tax system - which consists of taxing contributions to the plan and exempting pensions drawn from it - would guarantee uniform fiscal treatment, regardless of the country of residence of the member or retired person, that it would allow the country granting tax concessions for setting up occupational pension plans to safeguard its tax base, and that it would make the issue of sharing tax yields superfluous."
"(Intervention shortened pursuant to Article 137 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"Rights of homosexuals in EU institutions"
"The next item is the oral question (B5-0533/01), presented by 33 Members to the Commission, on the rights of homosexuals in EU Institutions."
"Mr President, you promised when you were appointed, Commissioner Kinnock, that the Commission would become the world' s best administration."
"I have confidence that you are the right person to tackle that task successfully."
"The issue of giving employees equal rights, irrespective of their sexual orientation, is a crucial step on the way."
"In the last twelve years, there has been a very positive trend towards enabling homosexuals to be granted the same rights as heterosexuals."
"In 1989, my own country, Denmark, was the first country in the world to introduce legislation on registered partnerships for homosexuals, corresponding to marriage, and a number of other countries followed suit."
"I would mention the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Germany and Finland."
"Other EU countries have implemented legislation which approximates to marriage to rather more limited degrees."
"Within the framework of the EU too, the trend is now in the right direction."
"Allow me to mention four very important points."
"Non-discrimination against minorities is now written into the objectives of European cooperation."
"On the legal basis of Article 13 of the Treaty, discrimination in the labour market on the grounds of sexual orientation has now been tackled in practical terms."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights expressly states that there must be no discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation."
"Finally, Parliament has recommended on several occasions that same-sex couples be guaranteed the same rights as heterosexual couples and that the Member States recognise registered partnerships."
"There have been very positive developments in recent years."
"Now is the time for the EU' s own institutions to comply with the same standards."
"I would therefore very much welcome your proposal."
"You have the key to nudging things in the right direction, Commissioner Kinnock."
"This proposal would enable homosexuals to be accorded full rights if there were partnership legislation in their own countries."
"I have a couple of questions in that connection."
"Since it is to varying degrees that the Member States' partnership legislation approximates to the marriage laws, I would ask you to explain which countries' citizens will be given full rights."
"Where will the Commission draw the line?"
"Moreover, the Commission is paving the way for cohabiting heterosexuals to be given certain rights, for example the right to health insurance covering their partners."
"That is progress, but I should like to ask whether the arrangement also covers cohabiting homosexuals in all the Member States."
"For example, are cohabiting homosexuals from Britain and Italy entitled to these limited rights?"
"Finally, a question on the timetable: when do you anticipate its being possible for these new staff rules to come into force in the institutions of the EU?"
"Over the years, many Commissioners have promised the earth in this area, and nothing has happened."
"They have, however, set things in motion."
"They deserve full recognition for having done so, and I hope you can give a positive answer to the question we have put to you in this House today."
"One of the proposals the Commission is making for modernising reform will extend access to certain family and social benefits to European Union officials who are currently denied such access because they cannot or do not want to enter into conventional legal marriage under the laws of the Member States."
"I am very grateful to Mr Lund and 32 other Members for initiating this plenary debate which enables me to report to Parliament on the issue of the Commission's intentions and proposals."
"Under the current Staff Regulations, social and family rights are provided only for couples who are married. Whilst that most obviously refers to matrimony between two heterosexual people, it also relates to homosexuals if homosexual marriage is legally recognised in a Member State."
"The House will know that the Kingdom of the Netherlands is at present the only European Union Member State where marriage between two people of the same gender is legally provided for."
"In the Commission's view, it is sensible to use the opportunity of current comprehensive reforms to revise the Staff Regulations in order to reflect the wide-ranging social change that has occurred in the time since the regulations were established in their present form in 1968."
"The Commission therefore proposes to ensure that staff who do not have access to marriage under the current national legislation are not discriminated against and to provide improved treatment for people who, for personal reasons, choose not to be legally married."
"To achieve this, the Commission seeks to provide full statutory recognition and commensurate benefits for all EU staff who are in partnerships that are shown to be stable in nature."
"I would ask the House to note that whilst we recognise that not all Member States' legal schemes for such recognition accord equivalent rights and status, the Commission accords equal recognition to all existing national regimes which make provision for stable partnerships."
"So far as we are concerned, the stable partnerships to be recognised will include homosexual partnerships which will be regarded in the same way as heterosexual partnerships and subject to the following conditions: firstly, the couple must provide a legal document of an EU Member State which acknowledges their status as non-marital partners."
"Secondly, neither partner may be married or in another non-marital partnership."
"Thirdly, there must no blood relationship in the first or second line between partners."
"Fourthly, that the couple must not have access to legal marriage in a Member State."
"People in recognised stable relationships that meet these requirements will be entitled to the family-related benefits that, under present Staff Regulations, are available only to heterosexual married couples and to officials who are homosexuals and of Dutch nationality."
"Those entitlements will include household allowance, health insurance coverage, survivor's pension and annual travel allowance."
"It will be clear to the House that unlike homosexual couples in all Member States other than the Netherlands, cohabiting heterosexual partners who are not married to other people could, if they so wish, get married."
"The Commission does not, however, ignore the reality that many people in modern societies wish to sustain stable partnerships but do not wish to enter into matrimony."
"We consequently recognise that many partners who have not married have family obligations."
"We therefore consider that those who are registered should be covered by provisions that, for instance, will enable a partner to participate in the European Union civil servant's health insurance scheme and will enable an official to use special leave provisions when, for example, a partner is suffering from a serious illness."
"The system envisaged for the staff of the European Union institutions largely replicates the system currently employed in the OECD."
"To obtain access to certain basic social rights under the Staff Regulations, non-married heterosexual partners must, as indicated, have documentary proof that their partnership is recognised in a Member State, they must not be married or in a non-marital partnership with another person and they must have no blood relationship with their partner."
"In addition to these two categories of partnerships, where the partners have chosen to be officially registered, there are also a limited number of cohabiting partnerships that are not recognised by any Member State since the people involved have chosen not to seek the legal recognition open to them."
"In such cases, the Commission proposes that the existing purely administrative recognition of certain partnerships should be maintained."
"This would, however, be of minor importance and the resulting rights would be limited."
"For example, partners would continue to have access to established language courses where places are available."
"In its reform package of 30 October, the Commission approved the principles outlined above."
"We also decided to intensify discussions with other EU institutions and with other international public sector organisations in order to develop these proposals further."
"Finally, we reserved the right to make supplementary proposals after the outcome of the interinstitutional discussions which will commence formally in the early months of next year."
"The issue of recognised partnerships will be discussed at the next meeting of the heads of administration of all EU institutions."
"A working group will then further develop the Commission proposal, taking into account the additional information on the situation in other international organisations which is currently being collected."
"We naturally wish to pursue best practice wherever that is feasible and gains the endorsement of the legislatures, including this House."
"At the end of this process, we will transmit our proposals for amendments to the Staff Regulations to the Council and to this House."
"We hope to be able to do that in the spring of 2002."
"The date of implementation of these new arrangements, and indeed much else, will therefore depend to a very significant extent on the speed at which they are handled in this House and in the Council."
"As for the Council, there is nothing to suggest that Member States will raise problems with this approach, particularly since it gives full recognition to the competence of Member States to regulate of marital law."
"It does not introduce a separate regime for the institutions - indeed, it cannot."
"This does not preclude the possibility, of course, that critical questions may be raised by Member States in the Council."
"We shall simply have to wait to see what views are actually expressed."
"Finally, a word on costs."
"For obvious reasons we do not yet know the exact number of recognised partnerships amongst the staff of the institutions or the numbers involved."
"We can, however, make a reasonable estimate, and on that basis, we can forecast that the budgetary impact of the above measures will be modest."
"Two hundred and fifty fully recognised partnerships and 250 partnerships with a limited range of statutory benefits would, for instance, generate total annual costs of under EUR 3 million."
"When implemented, the measures we propose will recognise and respect certain basic civil liberties."
"They will foster enlightened attitudes and they will improve the morale and living conditions of many of the valued staff who work for the European Union in the different institutions."
"I hope that this House will continue to support these reasonable social innovations and I look forward to further constructive discussions."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for his characteristically full discourse and discussion on this subject, and also for the very comprehensive material he makes available to us on the staff reform issues."
"We will have a chance to return to this subject, as he says, when we get the detailed proposal for the Staff Regulations."
"The issues that he raised were covered very briefly in the report that I prepared for Parliament back in 2000, where we indicated that we were looking for a best-practice approach."
"The summary he has given us certainly indicates the amount of work that has been done on that."
"Given that it is a highly sensitive issue and Member States will certainly be looking at it closely, the sort of balance he has achieved is going to be very much the right one."
"It is very important that we see this in the broad framework of recognising stable partnerships as he described it in the November 2000 discussion paper."
"That is really what we are discussing here."
"We are not talking about any particular type of partnership - that in itself would be discrimination - but recognising stable partnerships."
"One of the points I particularly want to raise with him is the question of children from partnerships."
"There have been well-publicised cases recently in the United Kingdom about the British forces."
"A soldier who very sadly was killed while on active service, had a stable partnership and a child from that partnership, but was not actually covered in the UK situation."
"That is an important point."
"The other point I want to raise is in connection with pension provisions and about the rights and abilities of staff to be able to decide to whom their pension should be paid and what flexibility they have in making that decision or in opting for whom their payment and benefit provision should be made in the event of their death."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for his detailed reply. I would like to encourage him further."
"He is absolutely right that we should look at the best practices available."
"We in this House must remind ourselves that we cannot be selective in the application of principle."
"We look towards enlargement and encourage good practice, yet here in our institutions we still continue to discriminate."
"But I welcome the signs of change."
"I hope that these will have the full support of this House and that we will begin to end the 'ping pong' game that we play with the human rights and civil liberties of ordinary men and women."
"For that is exactly what lesbians and gay men are. They are ordinary men and women made extraordinary by society's preoccupation with their sex lives."
"Let me also say on a personal matter that in my own Member State, my partner of 18 years, cannot possibly inherit my pension."
"That is discrimination."
"We must end it both within and outside the institutions."
"Finally, I should like to raise one very important issue, namely recognition by an EU Member State of a legal document."
"Such a legal document is certainly not available in the United Kingdom."
"I look forward to Commissioner Kinnock's replies."
"Thank you, Mr President. Giving concrete form to the equal rights of homosexual employees of the European institutions appears to be turning into a never-ending story."
"Nevertheless, this House wishes to see European institutions playing an exemplary role in equal treatment, with no distinction made as to the sexual orientation of staff."
"The European Parliament has twice pronounced in favour of establishing the same conditions of employment in the case of lasting relationships between people of the same sex as for married couples. Yet adequate arrangements for this have still not been made."
"My group cannot help feeling that within the hierarchy of the institutions, including those of this House, barriers are still being created against the introduction of equal conditions of employment for lesbians and gay men."
"We therefore eagerly await the wind of change brought by the reorganisation, now entering its final phase, which will need to clear out the old dust traps from this area too."
"My group is glad that, immediately after the Dutch Homosexual Marriage Act came into force, the responsible secretariat in the Commission recognised such marriages where civil servants employed by the Commission are concerned."
"Member States where Dutch officials may be posted who are married under Dutch law to a same-sex partner must not of course obstruct the issue of residence permits, not even if it involves subjects of third countries."
"My fellow MEP Mrs Buitenweg has asked questions on this matter."
"Your Commission should make sure that such obstruction does not occur."
"As yet we have had no answer from you."
"Can you, Commissioner, give us one today?"
"Mr President, I want to thank Commissioner Kinnock for his extremely detailed report."
"Mr Kinnock, I really did try to keep up with what was going on here."
"If I understand the matter correctly, the fact is that the partners of homosexuals who are not Swedish, Finnish or Dutch citizens seeking posts within the institutions of the EU are not recognised by these institutions if, as Mr Cashman says, they do not have documentation."
"Perhaps the latter could in those circumstances go on language courses at some stage."
"Against that background, I personally do not, unlike certain others in this House, think that we have come a particularly long way."
"I appreciate, Commissioner Kinnock, that it is very difficult indeed to make progress in this area because we have a lot of strange prejudices about people of the same sex who love each other in the same way as heterosexuals."
"Nor can I quite understand why the institutions of the EU should in this case treat employees on a national basis."
"If that reasoning were to be followed through, it would mean that people employed within the EU' s institutions could have their wages set on a national basis, but that does not happen."
"I understand, Commissioner Kinnock, that the situation is very difficult in view of the prejudices that exist, but I cannot agree that things are developing particularly quickly in this area."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for his very clear reply to the oral question."
"My point directly follows on from Mrs Eriksson's."
"It is clear that, in many Member States, homosexual couples do not have any rights and there are grave injustices within Member States."
"The only light at the end of the tunnel as regards my own country, Ireland, is that our Law Reform Commission announced yesterday - and I suspect it is because they saw something coming down the line from the Commissioner - that they were going to make that part of their research programme for the next year."
"Hopefully that will result in the justice that is clearly the right of stable couples, whether they be homosexual or heterosexual."
"We have had situations where, because of the lack of rights for homosexual couples, people have been evicted from local authority housing on the death of the other partner who was the named tenant."
"We also see that huge death duties accrue to partners who have bought houses together where, on the death of one partner, the other is faced with a massive tax bill, very often resulting in that person having to sell what was, in the truest sense of the word, a family home."
"I know you will be addressing some of the anomalies that exist in this but, as Mrs Eriksson has rightly said, they exist in a significant number of Member States and it could cause serious problems in terms of discrimination when we come to implement charges."
"I wish you every success and I am extremely glad that we have had an opportunity to raise the issue within this House because there is widespread support for it."
"It is not all that often, Commissioner, that we hear good news and I should like to thank you for it on this occasion; it really is very important to us for you to have answered our question both precisely and positively."
"Why should this be the case?"
"It is because we are at an historic turning point, one where the issue is no longer solely that of combating discrimination against homosexual people but that of asserting the rights of homosexuals."
"At this pivotal point between fighting against and fighting for, I think that you have given us some very positive answers and that we need to continue in this direction."
"But why should I attach so much importance to this?"
"Because I think that in our question we pointed out that some private companies had, after all, resolved the problem more quickly than the public institutions."
"We know how important it is for public institutions to set an example."
"I well remember the huge uproar in France when the French railways (the SNCF) decided to offer their 'couples' fares to homosexual couples."
"I do not think that you have had such good fortune in the United Kingdom, but we in France do, and it is the exemplary conduct of the French railways that I should like to highlight today, because this gives us some idea of what the European Commission can now achieve."
"That is why all of this is along the right lines, and why it is extremely important."
"I would add, however, that for all this the fight against discrimination is not over, and I should like the Commission to also be aware of this struggle, in particular in the light of the fact that it has a Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia."
"Why could we not enlarge this to include other forms of discrimination under Article 13?"
"We must not forget that there are candidate countries for accession, countries which will be included in the enlargement programme - I think you know the countries I am talking about - where homosexuality is still a crime."
"We must therefore be very vigilant; this is the 'fight against'."
"I am quite aware that this was not exactly the question you were asked, but nevertheless it seems to me to be important, if we are making progress on the social rights of homosexuals in the European institutions, for us to ensure that the current policies of all of the European institutions are consistent with this."
"Mr President, I should like to begin with the points made by Mrs Fraisse."
"She is absolutely right that we are at a turning point."
"There has been extensive evidence for this over a considerable period of time."
"Mrs Banotti's speech this morning is further evidence that even in countries where there has been a deep-rooted reluctance to change the social and legal conventions, there is movement in the direction of logic, rationality and civil rights."
"Things are starting to move, but everyone here is impatient for that movement to be much more positive and much more rapid."
"The interesting point raised by Mrs Fraisse about the activity of SNCF permits me to underline a distinction that we still, unfortunately, have to draw about the legal nature, status and powers of the European institutions as employer organisations."
"SNCF is an example of a public corporation with its own statute and considerable internal autonomy."
"Therefore it could make its own decision in relation to the treatment of homosexual couples."
"The same would apply to a private company that is, in this respect, literally a law unto itself."
"Unfortunately, that means that company could show a severe degree of prejudice but it could also show a very positive degree of enlightenment."
"We are not in either of those categories."
"Nor are we in the category of a Member State which has passed a law which is positive about the treatment of stable homosexual relationships."
"Consequently, we are faced with a limitation because we are a public institution."
"Parliament, Council, Commission, Court of Justice, Court of Auditors - the whole panoply of European Union institutions - have a statute that does not permit us to exercise the degree of autonomy which is the basis for many of the arguments correctly put forward this morning. I include the arguments put by Mrs Erikkson for which I have a substantial degree of sympathy."
"I should like to answer very quickly the other questions, starting with Mr Lund."
"I would repeat the point I made earlier."
"Once a partnership is recognised under a Member State's recognition of partnership arrangements, we will give equal rights to everybody regardless of the benefit level applied under national legislation in the national context."
"Once the key is turned, we will accord the best treatment within our power."
"Secondly, on the timetable. Together with the rest of the proposed changes in the Staff Regulations, we will submit a proposal to this House and the Council in spring of next year."
"It will then be in the hands of you legislators and the legislators in the Council to decide the speed of passage and - I hope - the early date of implementation of this and other necessary changes."
"I would also like to make a point that relates to material that people in the House may want to get access to."
"A positive attitude was expressed in the Council towards our undertaking to make a survey of arrangements throughout all 15 Member States."
"We received answers from 13 of the Member States, so it is quite a comprehensive, if informal, survey."
"If Members want, on application, to gain access to that information DG Admin. will happily respond."
"The information we have collected shows that there is considerable diversity of arrangements."
"But - and here is the good news - as I said earlier, there is a gradual but definite tide of change."
"Mr Harbour's question about children of stable partnerships is absolutely vital."
"The only answer I can give is that if a Member State recognises that the children produced by a stable relationship qualify for the variety of benefits, we will fully recognise that."
"Unfortunately, at this juncture we cannot go beyond that undertaking because of the limitations on our legal rights."
"When Mr Cashman asks us to pursue best practice, he knows he is pushing at an open door."
"But Member States determine the practices, and we have to try to encourage adoption of the best practices amongst them."
"We will happily consider, however, any proposal that stable recognised partnerships qualify if home countries recognise or if a country of employment recognises them."
"We do not have that second part of the proposal before us at the moment, but we will happily give consideration to such a proposal and investigate its feasibility."
"If it is feasible to establish practices in the European institutions on the basis of practices in the country in which an EU official is employed, we will try to introduce that change which could extend certain rights of registered couples, whether homosexual or heterosexual."
"I would like to say to Mr de Roo that no barrier is being put in the way of the advancement of gays and lesbians who are officials by the hierarchy of institutions."
"That is not the case."
"It is the Member States who must determine what our treatment of gays and lesbians in relationships must be."
"So far as employment rights are concerned, rights of assessment and promotion, rights of appointment to management, there is no barrier and no hierarchy has expressed any direct or indirect desire to install such a barrier."
"We will not install barriers but we cannot guarantee that existing cultural or legal inhibitions can automatically be dismantled."
"We do not have the power to do it in the Commission."
"I wish we could in many ways, but I would be misleading the House if I suggested that we have, or are likely to get, that kind of massive power for change."
"Finally, to clarify a point that Mrs Eriksson made, the reference I made to very limited rights, such as the right to attend language courses, relates only to people who have the right to marry, or the right to have their partnership recognised but choose, for whatever reason, not to exercise that right."
"The access people have to various nominal social opportunities that exist now under the Staff Regulations will simply continue in those cases."
"Our action, as she was good enough to acknowledge, owes nothing to prejudice."
"Our intention is to try to defeat prejudice because it is irrational and frequently brings brutal consequences."
"What we cannot defeat is not the prejudice but the laws that exist and are exercised in sovereign power by Member States."
"Not until we can secure changes in those laws - and this is gradually occurring - can we take substantial further steps beyond the significant steps that we are seeking to take in the course of this reform and which honourable Members have been good enough to acknowledge."
"Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m."
"Flags of convenience in fisheries"
"The next item is the report (A5-0405/2001) by Mrs McKenna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the role of flags of convenience in the fisheries sector [2000/2302(INI)]."
"This report deals with a serious issue and that is fishing under flags of convenience."
"Vessels that fish under flags of convenience ignore all the rules, they exploit the best fishing grounds and they wreak havoc."
"In recent times, as fleets continue to increase and resource abundance plummets, flags of convenience are increasingly used as a means of avoiding measures taken by countries or regional fisheries organisations to manage fisheries and conserve stocks."
"Pirate fishing can be seen as a undesirable consequence of states at last attempting to improve the management of fisheries."
"The environmental impact of pirate fishing vessels is virtually impossible to evaluate as by definition data on catches are non-existent or, at the very best, unreliable."
"The impact is known to be severe, even if undocumented, as pirate vessels target mainly high-value species such as tuna, shrimp, toothfish etc.."
"There are also serious social problems."
"Ship-owners take advantage of the lack of controls to reduce training safety standards, pay minimal wages, and lower standards of living and working conditions."
"They require long working periods without proper rest and they provide completely inadequate medical attention."
"They are responsible for many other offences."
"Fishing is now a global industry."
"Fleets from the EU cover all the oceans of the world, as do those of several other distant water-nations."
"Markets are also global."
"One-third of the total fish production that entered international trade in 1998 was worth over USD 50 billion."
"Capital is perhaps the most global commodity of all."
"EU fisheries investments can be found in many countries."
"As a result, a concerted international effort is needed to eliminate fishing under flags of convenience."
"This will involve the countries issuing the flags or whose citizens work on the fishing vessels, the ports into which they come for re-supply or off-loading, the markets in which the fish is consumed or the home of the capital which finances this destructive phenomenon."
"As the EU has both one of the largest fishing fleets and one of the largest markets for fish, it can play a particularly important role in regard to flags of convenience fishing."
"Many EU-owned vessels use flags of convenience."
"Some may even have had FIFG money to transfer to those countries and I am pleased to see that the Commission has now proposed regulations to prevent public funding being used to transfer to flags-of-convenience countries."
"I would call upon the Council to adopt them this week."
"In contrast, I should mention Japan and Taiwan, who have recognised the extent to which their longline industries use flags of convenience and they have taken corrective measures by launching programmes to repatriate or to scrap a large number of tuna longliners."
"At least 62 Japanese-built flags-of-convenience longliners will be scrapped by the end of 2002."
"A further 67 FOC longliners built in Taiwan will be repatriated to replace older vessels, with no overall increase in fleet capacity."
"It is expected that this will reduce the FOC tuna longline fleet by about half."
"These programmes are funded by both government and industry."
"I believe these moves should be highly praised and that this is the way we should proceed as well."
"Spain is proposing a law to list certain flags-of-convenience countries and we welcome that."
"Regarding market state responsibility, the EU is a large market and so it must improve control measures."
"For instance, currently it only wants to ensure that fish are caught according to rules of regional fisheries organisations which the EU belongs to."
"This needs to be extended to ensure that fish are caught according to the rules of all regional organisations."
"It must also be made illegal for EU citizens or companies to trade in fish caught by flags-of-convenience vessels."
"This is called for in the FOA plan of action on illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing."
"We should go in that direction also."
"The campaign that must be waged against pirate fishing is a global and multifaceted one."
"All countries with any involvement in the fishing industry - such as catching the fish, owning or crewing vessels, providing harbours, buying the final product - must participate."
"The EU, as one of the most important regions from all these points of view, clearly has a special responsibility."
"I can only hope that the Commission and the Spanish presidency acting together will begin to tackle this very important matter in the months ahead."
"It is in the interests of all EU fishing industries to ensure that this is done."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we should firstly acknowledge how appropriate it was for the Committee on Fisheries to produce an own-initiative report on this subject."
"I believe that the European Parliament is thereby heading in the right direction in terms of unravelling an issue which is complicated but crucial to the future of fishing in the world and to fisheries resources."
"Secondly, I believe it was also appropriate that it should be produced by Mrs McKenna, with whom I disagree on so many fisheries issues, but not on this report, which has been unanimously approved by our committee, despite the difficulty of this issue, and furthermore with no amendments from the House."
"I therefore congratulate the Committee on Fisheries and our rapporteur."
"There is still no doubt much to do, but, in this report, the European Parliament supports the condemnation and prosecution of flags of convenience in fishing and in marketing."
"Certain Member States of the Union - such as my own, Spain, as the rapporteur has mentioned here and in the report - are promoting innovative legislative proposals in this field, which is no easy task, as has been said before."
"We in the Committee on Fisheries are going to closely monitor the objectives and proposals in this report, aimed at dealing with the serious problem of illegal fishing."
"By fighting it, and eventually eradicating it, we will have taken an enormous step towards sustainable worldwide fishing."
"Some regional fisheries organisations, such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), say that 50% of catches of species such as the swordfish originate from illegal fishing under flags of convenience."
"If this percentage of illegal fishing were to be controlled, it would lead to an unquestionable improvement in the fish stock and would therefore clearly benefit legal fishermen, who have so much need for these catches and who behave in a totally controlled, and therefore responsible, manner."
"The marketing of these fish and landings in European Union ports - as has been said here - are key issues in this process, as is the definition of flags of convenience and clearly identifying the countries which permit them and tolerate them."
"All of these issues are in the report."
"I would once again like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs McKenna, and simply point out that I believe the European Parliament has today taken a very important step towards responsible fishing in the world."
"Having congratulated everybody, it only remains for me to ask the Commissioner - whose presence I appreciate - for the Commission' s support for the proposals in this report, because it is a very positive step, and that he take account, of course, of the fact that it has the unanimous approval of the Committee on Fisheries, and I hope that the vote for Mrs McKenna' s report will also be unanimous this afternoon."
"Mr President, I would also like to congratulate Mrs McKenna on behalf of my group, the Socialist Group, on this wonderful report which has allowed us to strengthen the legislation on the practice of fishing under flags of convenience, which in particular harms the professionals in the sector and the image they project."
"The Socialist Group is in total agreement with the conclusions of this report, above all with those which demonstrate the bad treatment received by the workers on these types of ships, in terms of working conditions, wages, safety and hygiene on board."
"We believe that it is necessary to encourage the governments which have not yet done so to sign up to the United Nations agreement on fish stocks, which is directly aimed at combating this kind of fishing."
"The control Regulation must be rigorously applied by all Member States and by the Commission, so that the landing in ports of this type of catch is not permitted."
"We also agree absolutely with the rapporteur when he asks the Commission to seal off the markets of all Member States against the products of illegal fishing, by adopting effective Community commercial and customs legislation."
"We believe that we will have to combat this type of fishing in ports and in terms of the marketing of products obtained from it."
"We believe that we will have to adopt as many measures as possible in order to eradicate illegal fishing."
"Mr President, Commissioner, if I were to ask you which is the odd word out in the following sequence - piracy, poaching, unsafe and fishing - you would no doubt answer that fishing is the word that does not belong."
"Quite right: evading management measures, plundering the riches of the sea and the maltreatment of crew members have no place in fishing."
"Unfortunately, this type of fishing does exist in the shape of fishing vessels sailing under flags of convenience."
"I agree completely with the rapporteur, Mrs McKenna and would like to add the following comment. We must involve the countries that issue those flags of convenience in an effort to put an end to these practices."
"Should these countries comply only by striking ships off their registers without tightening controls, we must consider economic sanctions against them."
"The fishing agreements that the European Union enters into with third countries could also play a part."
"We should exclude countries that allow fishing vessels under flags of convenience and their accompanying transport and refrigeration vessels into their harbours from fishing agreements with the European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, pirate fleets - it is hard not to think of the Hollywood adventure films with piracy depicted as heroism and romance in equal measure or the exciting books one read as a child."
"However, there is nothing heroic or romantic about the background to my thoughts on piracy now, as I speak to you here, and there is quite definitely nothing to get excited about."
"On the contrary, all we have here is a destructive fisheries practice and flags of convenience."
"We should not see these modern pirates who sail the seven seas as tough old characters with wooden legs and eye patches; no, these pirates operate on powerful trawlers, often owned by nationals of Member States of the EU."
"So exactly what havoc do these ships and flags of convenience wreak?"
"This House has always battled for sustainable fisheries and tried to ensure that working conditions meet minimum standards."
"The parlous state of fish stocks and the economic recession tell us that a great deal still needs to be done, and we are addressing these problems in our debate on the Green Paper."
"However, regulations and stock management measures have to be complied with and this compliance can only be achieved with controls which actually work and effective sanctions - including political sanctions. This is the huge attraction of flags of convenience to shipowners, because the countries which generously include them in their registers are not exactly known for their controls and sense of responsibility."
"The consequences are catastrophic, to both fish and man."
"Regional stock management measures are ignored, stocks which are already endangered are depleted without a second thought and conventions to protect employees are simply ignored."
"But there is no point in lamenting what is an obvious situation any further, so my proposal is that we should keep trying to influence flag-of-convenience states and remind them of their international obligations."
"Even in Europe we can and must act."
"The port state controls adopted in the Erika I package must also be applied to pirate activities, and we must close our markets to the catches landed by these fleets."
"Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen. I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs McKenna, and the Committee on Fisheries and its chairman, Mr Varela, for having taken on such an important problem."
"Like the European Parliament, the Commission is also extremely concerned about these international fishing pirates and the use of so-called flags of convenience."
"One thing is clear: anyone fishing under a flag of convenience is flouting maritime law and resolutions and the resolutions of regional fisheries organisations and ruining all our efforts at sustainable stock management in the process."
"Plus, it is not only unfair to honest fishermen, it is outright unfair competition and may indeed, as Mrs McKenna said, cause social problems."
"The Commission has not been sitting on its hands."
"We have proposed an amendment to the FIFG regulation so as to prevent ships from transferring to flag-of-convenience states."
"This proposal is still before the Council, awaiting its decision."
"Taking the FAO's international plan of action to combat pirate fisheries as our starting point, we also intend to work out a Community action plan to deal with these practices during the course of our reform of the Common Fisheries Policy."
"What will this entail?"
"First, we need a definition of the concept of the actual link between ship and flag state and we then need to anchor this definition in international law."
"Secondly, we need to draw up a list of the supervision and control duties incumbent upon each country for every ship berthed in its ports, in order to avoid so-called ports of convenience."
"Thirdly, we need to strengthen the fisheries control regulation in general."
"Now, if I may, I should like to comment briefly on your specific proposals."
"As far as No 6 is concerned, there is already a fleet register at Community level and we therefore feel this paragraph is superfluous."
"I fully share the concerns set out in No 9."
"No new Member State can accede unless it transposes the acquis communautaire into its national legislation."
"We also concur on Nos 15, 19 and 22."
"As you know, we are already in the process of drafting proposals for reforming the Common Fisheries Policy, which we shall submit to Parliament as soon as we receive your opinion on the Green Paper, taking account, needless to say, of the proposals on control policy which you have made in this context."
"As for No 16, we too subscribe to the principle that we need a list of countries which offer flags of convenience."
"Finally, some of your demands on this point were met when we proposed that the FIFG rules be revised."
"Parts of No 17 are already included in the control regulation."
"The Member States are required to keep a tally of imports in order to ensure that the catch quotas of the regional fisheries organisations are not exceeded."
"As for No 18, as I have already said, first we need a legal definition of flag-of-convenience states."
"Finally, as regards No 21, the Commission has already submitted a proposal to the Member States suggesting that GSP status be withdrawn from Belize, Honduras and Equatorial Guinea because they have violated the UN Fish Stocks Agreement."
"So you can see that we too are genuinely concerned."
"I should like to close by reiterating that the guidelines which you have submitted are extremely useful to us and will give us good food for thought when we come to reform the Common Fisheries Policy."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m."
"EC/Islamic Republic of Mauritania fisheries agreement"
"The next item is the report (A5-0426/2001) by Mr Gallagher, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for in the Agreement on cooperation in the sea fisheries sector between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania for the period 1 August 2001 to 31 July 2006 [COM(2001) 590 - C5-0555/2001 - 2001/0246(CNS)]."
"Mr President, the fisheries protocol with the Republic of Mauritania is of vital importance for EU fisheries."
"The previous protocol expired on 31 July 2001."
"This new protocol was initialled by both parties on 31 July 2001, fixing for five years the technical and financial conditions governing the fishing activities of Community vessels in the waters of Mauritania during the period 1 August 2001 to the end of July 2006."
"The provisional application of this protocol will depend on the first payment being made before 31 December this year."
"It is therefore of the utmost importance that Parliament delivers a favourable opinion this afternoon."
"It is interesting to note that in 1995, following the unilateral termination by Morocco of the fisheries agreement concluded in May 1992 for a period of four years and in view of the likely problems of negotiating a new agreement with Morocco, the Commission initiated negotiations with third countries so that vessels prevented from fishing as a result of any loss of fishing opportunities off Morocco could, if necessary, be moved elsewhere."
"As a result, a supplement to the 1993-1996 protocol with Mauritania was adopted which aimed to offset the loss of fishing opportunities for the Community fleet in Morocco by allowing for 18 Spanish vessels to transfer to the waters of Mauritania, a geographical area close to where they operated previously."
"In remarkably similar circumstances, the failure to renew the last agreement with Morocco, which expired at the end of November 1999, has again led to the need to seek increased fishing opportunities elsewhere in order to offset some of the hardship caused by the loss of access to Moroccan waters."
"The protocol before Parliament today reflects this need."
"It allows for increased opportunities for EU vessels, while at the same time providing for greatly improved financial compensation for Mauritania - and I will deal with that later."
"This new protocol with Mauritania is now the Union's most important protocol with a third country."
"Overall, the protocol offers allocated fishing rights for various species, or category of vessel, to Spain, Italy, Portugal and France."
"If licence applications from these Member States do not cover all the fishing opportunities fixed by the protocol, the Commission may take into consideration licence applications from other Member States."
"The table in my report compares the fishing possibilities offered by the protocol under review with those available under previous agreements."
"From this table, you will see that, although there has been an overall increase over previous protocols, there has been a reduction for a number of stocks."
"There will be a 30% increase in the number of vessels, which averaged 42 under the previous protocol, to 55."
"According to the Commission, this measure was possible because opportunities had been created by the departure by a number of Far East vessels which used to target particular species."
"There will be a 17% increase in the number of tuna vessels, from 57 to 67."
"The tonnage for vessels targeting black hake will remain the same at 8 500 GRT."
"For those targeting crustaceans other than crawfish (shrimps and crabs), the tonnage will go up by 9% from 5 500 to 6 000 GRT."
"However, it is important to note that there has been a reduction in the number of pelagic vessels permitted from 22 to 15."
"The total Community financial contribution will be EUR 430 million, broken down into EUR 86 million per year for the period of the application of the protocol."
"The EUR 86 million for the year comprises EUR 82 million in financial compensation and EUR 4 million for the financial contributions to fund the various types of fisheries-related assistance set out in Article 5 of the protocol."
"The government of Mauritania has full discretion regarding the use to which the financial compensation element is put."
"Following the non-renewal of the fisheries agreement with Morocco, this new protocol with Mauritania is obviously of key significance."
"In this regard, it must be stressed that its principal importance does not lie in the scale of fishing possibilities that it offers or indeed in its cost."
"From a Community fisheries and socio-economic point of view, its real interest is the hope which it holds out to people of the fisheries-dependent regions of Spain and Portugal, such as Andalucia, the Canary Islands, Galicia and the Portuguese south."
"These regions, which had so much invested in the Moroccan agreement, must be offered real alternatives as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate on the European Union fisheries agreement with Mauritania, together with yesterday' s vote on the fisheries agreements with Cape Verde and Guinea Bissau, are a good opportunity for a political study on international fishing agreements."
"I would like to make three brief observations in this respect."
"The first one relates to the economic and social importance of these agreements for the European Union."
"As is well known, these fishing agreements with third countries account for 25% of the supply of the Community market and represent around 50 000 jobs. It has been proved, as in the case of the Efremer study, that they are highly advantageous for the European economy."
"The second observation concerns the importance of the agreements for the economy of the developing countries."
"Clearly, the European Union cannot paternalistically and high-handedly impose a decision regarding the sectors to which compensation should be applied but, little by little and with diplomacy, we have reached a situation where part of this financial compensation is applied in the fisheries sector and in important activities."
"Thirdly, it is clear that these fishing agreements are of mutual benefit for the two parties, for both the European Union and the third countries."
"Lastly, I would like to refer to the Gallagher report, since the agreement with Mauritania is the most important one concluded with third countries to date."
"In the light of the non-renewal of the agreement with Morocco, this agreement with Mauritania, as the rapporteur stated, is now of special importance for Portugal and Spain, but also for Italy and France, which are countries that also fish in these waters."
"As you are aware, the Committee on Fisheries adopted an amendment proposing that the quotas be redistributed by the countries in the event that those for whom they are intended do not use them."
"I must say that my group agrees with this principle provided that it is applied from now on, of course, to all fishing agreements and not only the agreements with ACP countries."
"Lastly, I would like to thank Mr Gallagher for the excellent work he has done in this report."
"Mr President, I would like to say that fishing relations between the European Union and Mauritania go back a long way, to 1987, and it is clear that - since the disappearance of the fisheries agreement with Morocco, to whose demise we all contributed - it is now the most important of all the European Union' s agreements in terms of volume of catches and budgetary allocations."
"As previous speakers have said, it is one of the so-called Southern agreements, an agreement under which shipowners contribute to the economic costs by paying for licences."
"As you know, in the Northern agreements, the shipowners do not pay."
"As the rapporteur says in his report, four Southern States (Spain, Italy, Portugal and France) are going to be the beneficiaries of this new five-year protocol, although it is also the case that, if fishing opportunities are not utilised - as the rapporteur says - other European countries can use them, which is also something which happens in Southern agreements, but not in Northern agreements."
"As always, I would like to stress to the Members of this House - and not only those of the Committee on Fisheries - the importance of fisheries agreements with third countries, the importance of continuing to sign up to them and to sign up to new ones."
"I stress their importance for those third countries and for European regions which are highly dependent on fishing such as my own, Galicia, and I stress once again that this agreement is mutually beneficial."
"Mr President, I would like to read a section from the April 2001 report of the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries."
"I have been assured by Commission officials that negotiations for third country fisheries agreements are based on information provided by this committee."
"Regarding the most recent stock assessment of octopus in Mauritania, the report says ""... the assessment conducted in 1998 indicates that the stock was over-exploited..."" and it then goes on to say that ""... the 1998 working group in Nouadhibou recommended a reduction of 25% of the fishing effort exerted by the cephalopod fisheries...""."
"This is a far cry from a scientific endorsement of increasing European fishing of octopus even if certain other fleets have reduced their effort."
"The Commission states that there was a more recent assessment by Spanish scientists."
"However, despite repeated requests, Commission officials have so far failed to provide a copy of this document."
"I believe there is an important principle here in relation to access to information."
"Parliament, which is the budgetary authority, is being frustrated in its attempts to obtain the relevant scientific information on this major third country agreement."
"I cannot understand how the Commission can go for a study by anonymous authors and ignore information provided by its own main committee."
"Parliament has a right to know."
"The other point I wish to make relates to the clause which appears to facilitate the Atlantic Dawn."
"I am curious."
"I congratulate the Commission on taking legal action against the Atlantic Dawn, but I would now like to hear from the Commission the latest on this case."
"This agreement is morally bankrupt."
"It is yet another example of the EU taking money from poor people in rich countries and giving it to rich people in poor countries."
"The bribe of EUR 86 million per annum is taken from many pensioners and many of the lower-paid."
"It is given directly to the ruling elite of Mauritania, who are ethnically different from the bulk of the ordinary people."
"Very little money filters down to the ordinary people who are amongst the poorest in the world in one of the poorest regions of the world."
"Furthermore, it is destroying fish stocks and destroying such infrastructure as exists."
"Worst of all, however, hundreds of local fishermen are being killed each year and, if the excellent Channel 4 documentary on the Mauritanian agreement is any guide, some are being deliberately run down by trawlers engaged in illegal fishing permitted by a deliberately lax, ill-equipped monitoring and enforcement regime."
"This is the reality."
"For all the fine words in the Commission document, this agreement is creating a human and environmental disaster."
"It is set to continue - and why?"
"To satisfy the insatiable greed of the largely Spanish fishing industry, which nobody dares to oppose for fear of reprisals at the Council of Ministers."
"A vote for this report is effectively a vote to subsidise murder and it creates the very conditions in which terrorism is spawned."
"This serious issue needs to be investigated and therefore I challenge this House to support me in the call for a temporary committee of enquiry, the papers of which will be ready for the next Strasbourg session."
"If, as we say, we care about the poor and oppressed, if we believe in the right to life, then this House should support me in attempting to shine a light on this disgraceful situation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fortunately, what we have just heard is absolutely a minority opinion in this House, and I think we are all delighted about that."
"I would like to begin by congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Gallagher, on the diligence and efficiency with which he has done his work."
"He well understood that this was an urgent report, given the situation of the fleet affected by the non-renewal of the fisheries agreement with Morocco."
"A part of that fleet can now be included in the agreement with Mauritania, which will help to relieve the difficult situation which had been created."
"The European Parliament is thereby giving its opinion on the Gallagher report on this agreement, which is essential to the European Union, in record time."
"I also think it is fair to congratulate the Commission on having reached this agreement, which breaks the curse of the failure of the negotiations with Morocco."
"Secondly, I would like to point out - because there has been false and ill-intentioned information on this agreement - that the agreement with Mauritania is very beneficial for both parties. I insist; for both parties, and that is why it has been reached."
"Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge that there is no better defender in the world of cooperation development or of the conservation of resources than the European Union."
"Therefore, neither private agreements nor public agreements with States other than the European Union, above all Asian States, can in any way be compared with the control and rigour applied by the European Union in these international agreements."
"I would also like to take this opportunity, Commissioner, to condemn the recent seizure of a ship, the Lameiro Uno, which, while sailing towards Mauritanian waters, was seized by Morocco, accused of fishing, when this was not the case."
"Commissioner, I hope that this intolerable practice by Morocco will not be repeated in the future, since it would jeopardise the achievements of the fisheries agreement with Mauritania."
"I would ask you to take good note of this, in order to prevent any repetition of these practices, since vessels obviously have to pass through Morocco' s economic zone in order to reach Mauritania."
"Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, Mr Gallagher, for your report on the proposal for a regulation on a new protocol to the fisheries agreement with Mauritania."
"I am delighted that you are in full agreement with the terms of this proposal setting out and safeguarding the facility for our fleet to fish in Mauritanian waters until May 2006."
"As you know, we have a history of good fisheries relations with Mauritania."
"Moreover, this agreement is now the Community's most comprehensive fisheries agreement and hence an important component of the Common Fisheries Policy."
"We signed the new protocol at the end of July after four rounds of intensive and tough negotiations and I think we really have brokered a fair agreement which benefits Mauritanian fishermen and the Mauritanian sector as well as our own fishermen, while guaranteeing sustainable stock management."
"I really must say, Mr Farage, that you would be better advised to base your comments on fact than political posturing."
"So what exactly is the truth?"
"The truth is that we have included a whole series of new measures in this agreement which were absent from earlier agreements."
"For example, some of the money goes directly towards improving scientific knowledge about resources."
"From now on, stocks will be regularly and scientifically monitored, and we have stipulated that, if the size of the stocks changes, then fishing opportunities must be adjusted accordingly, as must the relevant financial compensation."
"So it is quite untrue to say that we simply continue to fish the maximum catches, irrespective of how stocks develop."
"That is the reality."
"Secondly, we have based fishing rights on the data available, which Mauritania provided."
"According to the data which we received, it was possible at the present time to agree on a slight increase in fishing opportunities for cephalopods."
"However, I should like to point out that this is not the lion's share of the agreement."
"The lion's share - around 40% - of catches under this agreement is accounted for by demersal species."
"And, just for the record, they do not mainly benefit Spain, as you maintain, they mainly benefit the Netherlands."
"Thirdly, the agreement contains a series of terms allowing for the sustainable management of Mauritanian fish stocks and the development of the local economy."
"In order to protect local inshore fishing, we have moved the fishing areas for the Community fleet further away from the coast than was previously the case."
"In order to help the local economy and create jobs in the country itself, we have agreed that demersal fish trawlers must now land a larger proportion of their catches in Mauritania."
"In addition, more Mauritanian seamen will be taken on board EU ships in future."
"Catch monitoring and controls have been strengthened and we have also increased the amount for so-called targeted actions significantly, by a total of EUR 20 million for the term of the agreement."
"These flanking measures will help alleviate the concerns expressed by the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"As to the proposed amendments, we have absolutely no objection to Amendment Nos 1, 3 and 5."
"In any case, these demands are already met under the interinstitutional agreements and, more importantly, under the framework agreement between Parliament and the Commission of 5 July 2000, making these amendments superfluous."
"We have a problem with Amendment Nos 2, 4 and 6 and cannot therefore agree to them."
"As far as Amendment No 2 is concerned, the principle of non-discrimination is already laid down in the founding treaty of the European Union and there is therefore no sense in including this sort of clause."
"As far as Amendment No 4 is concerned, I should point out that our standard practice is that no new mandate is required for a protocol extending a fisheries agreement."
"As for Amendment No 6, mixed funding for negotiated fishing opportunities is part and parcel of our external fisheries policy."
"In the case of agreements with third countries, the cost of compensation is footed by the Community budget, with shipowners paying for the licences."
"May I also take this opportunity of pointing out that the sum quoted in the amendments is incorrect and that, from a purely formal point of view, the amendment should refer to the protocol."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m."
"Production and marketing of honey"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. This Parliament first raised the alarm about the threat to European beekeeping in 1985."
"The resolutions which we passed in 1992, 1995 and 1997 - mainly unanimously - contain specific, reasonable, affordable and legally tenable proposals for direct aid to save the European beekeeping industry which, the rosy Commission statistics notwithstanding, is in a state of real crisis."
"Our primary concern is not to increase the self-supply rate for quality honey from our beekeepers, which is currently just below 50%. No."
"What we are concerned with is guaranteeing that the 80 000 wild and cultivated plants across the European Union will be pollinated."
"This is currently under threat as a result of the worrying decline in the number of beekeepers, more than half of whom are over 60 years old, and really has reached crisis point in certain regions."
"It is truly amazing that, despite the patience and determination of the spokesmen of all the groups in this Chamber since 1985, we have not managed to bring the Commission to its senses and make it realise that its half-hearted policy based on the wishy-washy 1997 regulation urgently needs to be improved if we are to avert the threat to the balance of the European ecosystem from the beekeeping crisis."
"It is incomprehensible, nay irritating in the extreme, that the Commission persists in doing nothing, despite its report on the unsatisfactory implementation of the inadequate measures based on the half-hearted 1997 regulation and despite its acknowledgement that European beekeeping has to contend with increasing difficulties."
"With all due respect, Commissioner, we can no longer accept this absurd obduracy."
"The Commission needs to come to its senses."
"Errare humanum est, perseverare diabolicum."
"You understand that, Mr Fischler."
"The bases needed in order to introduce the direct aid now which we have lobbied for since 1992 are there for us in the Treaty."
"In my report we have again made specific, affordable short- and medium-term proposals, which there is too little time to go into, but the Commission can read."
"So what we want to hear today is that it is prepared to get moving on the basis of our proposals, which are supported by all beekeepers in the Community, from north to south, and we mean in the right direction."
"Mr Fischler saw for himself on Tuesday, when beekeepers from the majority of Member States visited the House with their produce, which attracted a great deal of interest, that some stands were cleaned out before the beekeepers had time to offer their products to the invited guests."
"I should also like to thank the honourable Members who attended the meeting with over 60 beekeepers and who, like my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, fully support the demands contained in my report."
"We need more generous Community cofinancing than the current 50%, because many Member States are too mean to raise the 50% for programmes to improve the conditions under which honey is produced and marketed on the basis of the 1997 regulation, depriving their beekeepers of even the few hungry euros earmarked for their country."
"We need both the immediate measures called for in the report and medium-term direct aid pending the mid-term view of Agenda 2000, especially premiums to compensate for loss of income because there is no Community preference in this sector."
"I am almost proud of having managed, together with my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Budgets, to get appropriations for programmes to improve the conditions under which honey is produced and marketed raised from EUR 14 to 16.5 million for 2002."
"That is the only compulsory expense in the agricultural budget to which this has happened."
"But that cannot distract us from the fact that the Commission's bee policy is still underdeveloped."
"All it needs is the political will on the part of the Commission and the Council to give us a sum which the EU takes less than five hours a year to spend, not to mention the EUR 2 billion embezzled from the budget. This political will is all that is needed to allow us, together with the beekeepers, to protect beekeeping in Europe and to prevent us from running blindly into the wall of an ecological catastrophe in the medium term."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the bee is a symbol of hard work and, in this respect, Mrs Lulling is the queen bee of the European Parliament in the truest sense of the word, because it is she who, for over a decade, has forced us not with carrots and sticks, but with honey and bee stings, by which I mean with sound arguments, to keep on debating this question, a question which many people tend to underestimate because, unlike me, they were not fortunate enough, back at the beginning of the 1980s, to meet the biggest group of visitors ever to visit this House in Strasbourg - a group of Bavarian beekeepers invited by the late Heinrich Aigner, who also fought long and hard for this cause. Several hundred Bavarian beekeepers came to the European Parliament, which just goes to show how committed these people are to their cause, which is also our cause."
"Beekeepers are not a large group of voters, they are people who look after bees which, as Mrs Lulling has already said, ensure that a balance is constantly restored to our ecosystem, at least to a certain extent."
"A cold winter is just beginning, but when it is over we know that spring will arrive, that the bees will again fly off to provide their pollination services and we shall again enjoy a blooming landscape."
"But there is a danger that one day winter will come and no such spring will follow because there will be no bees or too few bees to provide this ecological function."
"Many people believe that the EU is a country which flows with milk and honey."
"With milk we have tried to get the quotas into order."
"With bees, we have a self-supply rate of just below 50% in the European Union. Anyone who really wants to see a country which flows with milk and honey should fly to Argentina, as I did this summer."
"Argentina could supply the European Union with most or many of the products that we need, but in these times of global political crisis, we are aware of two new elements."
"First, we are aware of the need for quality following the BSE crisis and, secondly, we are aware of the need to be able to obtain healthy food from our own soil following the crisis on 11 September."
"I think that a functioning European farming industry and a functioning European ecosystem need suitable support for our beekeepers, which is why I ask the House to throw its full weight behind the Lulling report."
"Mr President, on the basis of the assessment and the application of Regulation (EC) No 1221/97, two clear conclusions should be drawn: firstly, that it is necessary to increase the amount of aid in each of the lines and the percentage of subsidy; secondly, that we must prevent, as was the case in the period 1998-2000, inequalities between sectors."
"With regard to the corrections which should be introduced, we must achieve a reasonable balance in the cost-benefit for each of the action lines and a profound modification which transforms the current degree of co-funding, so that funding is entirely covered by the EAGGF Guarantee."
"With regard to future needs, we should make two recommendations."
"Firstly, we must establish a direct aid system which compensates for the loss of income suffered by European professional beekeepers."
"Furthermore, we should create a COM for honey."
"Secondly, we must recognise the importance of the role played by professional beekeepers by maintaining their status in the face of large bee-keeping operations, since they thereby allow the existence of a fully sustainable stock-breeding activity, which favours rural development and which, furthermore, produces healthy and high-quality products, and which is socially very beneficial, given its important contribution to environmental quality and its active role in conserving bio-diversity by means of the pollination carried out by bees."
"I will end by saying, Mr President, that this task of pollination, which is safeguarded by beekeepers, must be compensated for through a line for specific aid which supplements the current Regulation."
"I congratulate Mrs Lulling on her magnificent work."
"Mr President, today the future of bee-keeping in Europe is in the balance."
"This is about nothing less than saving a sector of production."
"This is a matter of urgency because, while we are consuming more honey, production is falling to dangerously low levels."
"Today we consume more than twice as much honey as we produce."
"And if we are producing less it is essentially because of the devastating effect - now scientifically proven - which a certain number of systemic insecticides used to treat arable seeds have had on bee populations, which have been really decimated."
"This situation is not unique or unusual; today nearly all European bee-keepers are affected."
"Faced with a situation of this nature, the Commission's proposal, which is extremely weak, confines itself, as part of its new regulatory framework, to statistical work and a handful of promotion measures."
"These proposals are obviously not sufficient to tackle the problems affecting the sector."
"No one is denying that there is a need to refine the statistics, but this work is no substitute for what is most urgent, which is rebuilding bee populations so that our bee-keepers can save honey production in Europe."
"Product promotion is a good thing, provided that the product concerned is available."
"Furthermore, you have to be particularly careful with promotion when the products concerned are ones of which we have a considerable shortfall, which is the case with honey."
"It is necessary to promote the link between the product and the land."
"I do not believe that it is the European Union's job to fund the promotion of Chinese, Argentinean or Mexican honey: these are honeys which do not guarantee traceability in any shape or form, which are not subject to quality control, which do not comply with our standards and which are often nothing but flavoured glucose syrups."
"We cannot claim that we wish to encourage European agriculture to develop in a way which is more respectful of the environment while at the same time letting our bee-keepers sink into indifference, and it is true that they do not constitute a powerful lobby."
"They are all the more deserving of our attention."
"Any product, including honey, can, admittedly, be purchased from outside, but the pollination of our plants is not something that can be imported."
"We are dealing here with an area which is essential for preserving our environment and our bio-diversity."
"That is why I welcome the work done by our excellent rapporteur, Mrs Lulling, and by all of the Members of the Committee on Agriculture who unanimously adopted the amendments which we tabled together."
"These open the door to the possibility of Community funding being made available to help European bee-keepers to rebuild their hive populations in response to this urgent situation; we state this in Paragraph 10."
"Veterinary costs related to bee-keeping should also be treated in the same way as for other animals; we state this in Paragraph 5."
"And to safeguard the future of this industry in the long term, it is essential that, in the future, procedures for the approval of plant protection products take account of their effects on bees in terms of death or alteration in behaviour; this is our Paragraph 17."
"It is essential that the precautionary principle be applied here."
"Commissioner, the Commission needs to wake up; the Council needs to wake up."
"This is a matter of great urgency."
"We Members must sound the alarm."
"The European Union would bear a huge responsibility if it hastened the disappearance of our bee-keepers."
"I hope that all Members will support the wise, necessary and urgent proposals which we adopted unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture."
"Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen. First, may I congratulate you, Mrs Lulling, on being crowned queen bee of the European Parliament here today."
"I should also like to congratulate you on the report which you have submitted."
"However I hope, with reference to the sting which was also mentioned, that you do not share the fate of the bee which, as you know, can only sting once."
"That would be a real pity."
"Programmes to improve the conditions under which honey is produced and marketed are regularly submitted by all Member States for approval and, with only 80% of available funds being taken up, the satisfactory application of Regulation 1221/97 would clearly appear to be guaranteed."
"For the rest, the Council has approved the European Parliament's motion for the funds earmarked for the application of the regulation to be increased by EUR 2.5 million."
"The Commission would therefore be delighted if the Member States and the enterprises in question were to take up all these funds in order to implement as many measures as possible within the current legal framework, in order to help the sector and allow it to develop in line with the rapporteur's considerations."
"When the report on the first three years' application of this regulation was submitted to the Council, the representatives of the Member States raised no objections whatsoever and approved the Commission's conclusions unanimously."
"In discussions with the Commission, the enterprises in the sector welcomed the fact that the aid regulation in favour of European beekeeping was to be maintained."
"The economy in the honey sector is stable, production and imports have remained steady and the self-supply rate has fluctuated between 48 and 50% for several years and is therefore nothing new."
"Bearing these facts in mind and bearing in mind the heterogeneity of the sector and the widely differing bee economies in the European Union, we feel that neither a new common organisation of the market in the honey sector nor a direct aid regulation in the form of direct income support for beekeepers is warranted at the present time."
"Other suggestions in the report, such as specific aid to improve the bee population through rearing apiaries, can already be implemented under the current regulation, without the need for any new legal provisions."
"We also have all the facilities of the structural policy and the policy to promote agricultural products at our disposal. They too need to be implemented accordingly, although the initiative here lies mainly with the Member States."
"Having said which, the Member States and the enterprises in question need to work more closely together in applying and implementing the programmes in order to ensure there is coherent political and financial support for this sector across the EU."
"Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity, as Mr Fischler is still here but will surely not be able to stay for this evening's vote, to say that I am somewhat disappointed."
"You cannot say that these paltry funds of between EUR 10 and 14 million - granted, we shall get a bit more next year - are satisfactory because 80% are being taken up."
"I realise that we are making demands on the Member States and that a bit more will be done within the existing legal framework, but we also want a more flexible approach than is possible at present."
"But I must say that I really am appalled to hear that not one representative in the Council - i.e. not one Member State - had any objection whatsoever; do they really think we need do nothing at all?"
"I think it is quite something that the Member States apparently feel no need to react to what the European Parliament has to say about your report."
"But we and the beekeepers shall make sure that the Member States at least acknowledge what we have to say about the report, just in case they think there is no need to act."
"As you know, we have not called for any all-powerful order, but we still take the view that we need direct aid regulations in the medium term."
"You say they are not warranted at the present time."
"You have heard the beekeepers, they take quite a different view and you must be fully aware of what is happening in this sector."
"We shall also ensure that beekeepers are better informed about the facilities available under structural policy and measures to promote agricultural produce, but here too we have very limited funds for numerous quality products."
"Mr President, I just wanted to say this to Mr Fischler because I already know what he has told us. I had hoped for something more, rather than being hung out to dry!"
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m."
"Mr President, I shall be very brief."
"My colleagues in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms have told me that at 8.57 a.m. they received an e-mail convening the Committee for 9.30 a.m.."
"This way of doing things seems rather odd to me."
"I should therefore like this not only noted in the minutes but also brought to your attention, Mr President, so that, since we shall be making a formal protest, the Bureau is kept informed of the fact that committees are meeting after being convened with only 33 minutes' notice - something I find rather odd, not to say strange, not to say inappropriate."
"Mr President, I do not want to prolong the debate unnecessarily."
"I would, however like to say that I am the deputy chairman of this committee and I was treated in exactly the same manner."
"It is a sorry state of affairs when a deputy chairman is not even given proper notice of an extraordinary meeting."
"This sort of treatment is quite simply unacceptable."
"Thank you for your observations."
"At this point, however, I cannot do anything."
"Amongst other things, as you know, this House has expressed its wish that the urgent procedure should be voted on during the next sitting of Parliament, next Monday."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Topical and urgent debate"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"Zimbabwe"
"The next item is the debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0759/2001 by Andrews, on behalf of the UEN Group,"
"B5-0774/2001 by Sjöstedt, Marset Campos and Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group,"
"B5-0787/2001 by Maes, Lucas and Lannoye, on behalf of the Greens/European Free Alliance Group,"
"B5-0788/2001 by Mulder, van den Bos and Malmström, on behalf of the ELDR Group,"
"B5-0799/2001 by Kinnock, on behalf of the PSE Group,"
"B5-0801/2001 by Van Orden, Deva, Parish, Foster, Banotti, Corrie, Gahler, Korhola, Lehne, Maij-Weggen, Sacrédeus and Belder, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group"
"on Zimbabwe"
"Mr President, I believe that the resolution on Zimbabwe that we have formulated together is quite rightly a tough one, intended as a warning to Mr Mugabe."
"At a time when democratic elections should be in preparation, Mugabe' s only response has been to encourage and establish an atmosphere of terror in his country - everywhere, in the countryside and in the towns."
"This makes it crucial that the elections are able proceed in a normal way, and that the international community continues to insist that they are."
"But nothing suggests that Mr Mugabe is receptive to this justified democratic demand from within his own country, where even in the previous elections it was clear that the virtual majority wanted a change of government."
"Mr Mugabe is clinging to power and to that end regards all possible legitimate and especially illegitimate means as justified."
"For example, journalists must now apply for a work permit before they are allowed to write."
"This of course runs counter to freedom of expression."
"The printing works of the few still more or less independent papers are smashed up."
"In this way opinion forming is hampered."
"Today I received the manifesto of the women' s organisations, which complain that women obliged to sell the fruits of their labour on the land to a state institution are either not paid at all or else far too late, in a country where inflation is running at 86%."
"We shall therefore vote in favour of this motion with great determination for this and many other reasons mentioned in the text."
"Mr President, Zimbabwe really had all the qualifications for becoming a prosperous and successful country in southern Africa."
"That is why it is so incredibly tragic to see it heading straight for the abyss."
"Zimbabwe has been discussed by us many times in this House, as I know it has also been in the other institutions."
"We have often thought we have seen some small glimpse of hope or gleam of light."
"We have been wrong every time."
"There are no such glimmers."
"The situation is alarming."
"Zimbabwe is a lawless, economically impoverished country governed by a dictatorial old ruler who has completely lost contact with reality and with his own people."
"Robert Mugabe breaks promise after promise made to surrounding countries."
"He has not succeeded in stopping the illegal land occupations or in bringing about fair land reform."
"Human rights are infringed on a daily basis, and the opposition is harassed and persecuted in an unacceptable way."
"The regime is thoroughly corrupt and, in terms of democracy, the impending elections, in which election workers are threatened, harassed and imprisoned, cannot be called anything other than a joke."
"Freedom of expression is totally restricted."
"We must immediately break off all communication with, and suspend all assistance to, the Zimbabwean regime."
"All Mugabe' s foreign assets and all those of his family should be frozen."
"I really want to appeal to both the Commission and the Council to be crystal-clear in their condemnation of Mugabe' s regime and to state that our and the world community' s patience is at an end."
"We must establish a broad, international coalition and form of cooperation with the SADC states so as to put pressure on the regime and take measures against it."
"At the same time, it is of course important to find ways of supporting the opposition."
"There is a small number of courageous people who, at risk to their own lives, are fighting for democracy and human dignity."
"Mr President, this is the second urgent resolution on Zimbabwe that we have put forward in just over three months."
"The reason for this is our enormous concern at the continued deterioration of the situation in that country with such a short time to go before the presidential elections."
"At the beginning of September there were some indications that Mugabe might be prepared to respond to international pressure."
"Sadly, it is now very obvious that the commitments given at Abuja were a sham."
"It would seem that Mugabe thinks he can make a few promises, buy a little more time and then carry on with his repressive policies while the economy of a once prosperous Zimbabwe collapses."
"Half a million Zimbabweans are now on the verge of starvation."
"Opposition politicians go in fear of their lives."
"Mugabe's absolute contempt for international opinion was further demonstrated by his defiance towards the EU troika which visited Harare at the end of November."
"We now have to show that we are serious in our threats to take action."
"At the moment Mugabe thinks he is untouchable and even flies to Spain for medical treatment."
"We are not proposing the blunt instrument of economic sanctions."
"We know that this would impact on the population at large and in any case we are only too aware how such measures can be evaded."
"We are calling for smart sanctions that would directly hit Mugabe, his family and his cronies."
"Steps should be taken immediately to freeze their overseas assets and to impose a travel ban."
"The decision to move in this direction should be taken by ministers at Laeken this weekend."
"Our resolve should be made absolutely clear in the meeting scheduled to take place next week between the European Union and Zimbabwean representatives under the terms of Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement."
"If Mugabe does not take immediate and verifiable action in the way that the international community is demanding, the European Union must be ready at once to impose the smart sanctions."
"Our resolution today sets out clearly what has to be done."
"Let us not dilute the message in any way."
"The resolution is a basis for action now."
"Mr President, this is the sixth and most sharply worded motion since the crisis broke in Zimbabwe."
"We have the Council to thank for finally getting Article 96 of the Cotonou agreement moving since the last resolution."
"We hope that contacts with Zimbabwe in this context will bear fruit, although we do not really expect this man to show the slightest interest in our measures."
"On the contrary, he will get his own party to elect him as a presidential candidate in Victoria Falls this weekend and he is already preparing to make a farce of these elections."
"For a start, he is now demanding proof of residency as well as identity cards as proof of electoral status."
"A great many people find it very hard to provide such proof."
"And now he wants to hold the elections in constituencies, rather than as nationwide elections throughout the country."
"People who are not registered in the large towns where they work will have to travel home."
"Most will not be able to afford to do so."
"The aim is to ensure that as many people as possible are excluded de facto from the elections, because he knows that this will stop the majority of his opponents from voting."
"There are 200 000 people currently starving in the Masningo province because Governor Hungwe has stopped food from being distributed by NGOs."
"The Governor has demanded that the food be delivered to him first so that he can arrange for it to be distributed."
"Then, of course, he will only feed his own people."
"We must not let this man get away with it."
"We must ensure that we take targeted measures to stop Mr Mugabe in time, and I call on us all to do so."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is painful to have to stand by as a stubborn president, who has also earned a great deal of credit, uses unscrupulous party activists to help him systematically ruin a country, with no scruples about using deadly force in the process, because he cannot come to terms with the threat of losing power."
"Like Mr Gahler, I was one of the parliamentary election observers at the time and saw for myself how Mugabe and his rent-a-mob were driving the country straight towards catastrophe."
"Despite massive attempts to intimidate the electors - and we shall no doubt see an action replay of that now - and despite massive support for the opposition candidates, which has ended in death in a multitude of cases, the MDC achieved a remarkable result, clearly signalling to Mugabe that political change was on the horizon."
"Now, with presidential elections imminent, Mugabe is again tightening the screw of force and terror."
"There is no sign of the return to the rule of law promised in the Abuja agreement; on the contrary."
"By using more and more legislative repression, massively restricting the freedom of the press, threatening the opposition, continuing to occupy farms and permanently undermining the rule of law, Mugabe is isolating himself more and more, including from his traditional allies in southern Africa."
"This was blatantly obvious at the last meeting of the ACP/EU joint parliamentary assembly in Brussels in October."
"These countries are being sucked into free fall by the humanitarian and economic disaster in Zimbabwe and further pressure is needed to make Robert Mugabe change direction and hold the presidential elections in accordance with the standards of free and fair elections, and this is where we also need the support of the institutions of the European Community."
"Mr President, the regime of President Mugabe of Zimbabwe is having a very bad press internationally, and with good reasons."
"Mugabe is sacrificing countless human lives, literally and figuratively, to his utterly ruthless aim of retaining power."
"The shocking Dutch newspaper headline of less than a week ago 'Zimbabwe stinks of blood lust' sadly completely sums up the content of the article by the paper' s correspondent in Harare."
"The accompanying vulgar cartoon from the Zimbabwean state paper The Herald underlines this ominous message."
"The cartoon turns Mugabe' s major challenger in next year' s presidential elections, Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change, into a downright caricature."
"He is depicted as the yes-man of rich white farmers in his own country and of Western powers."
"However, Zimbabwean political reality looks completely different."
"Naked state terror against white farmers, their black managers and agricultural labourers as well as against political opponents of Mugabe' s party, ZANU-PF."
"State terror manifests itself in ten or so methods of repression: undermining the judicial system, politicisation of the army and police, attacks on press freedom, occupation of the estates of white farmers, slander against independent institutions like the Red Cross, purportedly acting as cover organisations for the opposition, electoral fraud, tapping the opposition' s telephone traffic, detention of and slurs on members of the opposition MDC party, violence and intimidation against supposed supporters of the opposition and, finally, murder of political opponents."
"In this context, I should like to ask the Commission urgently, in its meeting with Zimbabwean Government representatives at the beginning of next week, to speak up above all for those domestic organisations that help the victims of political violence in Zimbabwe, who now total hundreds of thousands."
"When Mr Mugabe became the first President of Zimbabwe some 40 years ago, that land-locked country in Africa was a rich nation that could feed its population and export food to neighbouring countries."
"About 1000 white farmers, owning most of the land, produced the food and the surplus."
"After independence in Zimbabwe, the Lancaster House Agreement between Britain, as the colonial power, and Zimbabwe allowed for land redistribution to black families and appropriate compensation to white farmers without any loss of production."
"Mugabe has failed in implementing these reforms."
"He has failed to settle the poor black families."
"Since independence, Mugabe has had much time to establish real democracy, rule of law and prosperity for all."
"Instead, he has enriched himself, his friends and destroyed his country's economy."
"He has made the poor even poorer."
"He has intimidated, looted and deprived the white farmers who produced so much wealth for his nation."
"Zimbabwe needs a free and fair election now."
"Mugabe should not fear."
"He will be judged on his record."
"If he is a statesman, like Mandela, then he should step down with dignity and let someone else from Zanu-PF contest the election."
"If he is still a Catholic, then he should listen to Archbishop Ncube of Zimbabwe who has also condemned him regularly without fear."
"Mr Mugabe cannot and will not be remembered in Africa unless he gives his countrymen a chance to breathe, walk without fear and seek opportunities to enhance their quality of life."
"I have a simple message for Mr Mugabe - be an African elder and retire gracefully to your village."
"Mr President, Article 96 consultations will not be easy but we should give them a chance."
"Zimbabwe confirmed its participation, but the original date of 19 December for the start of these consultations was yesterday postponed."
"We do not have an indication of another date."
"The idea is to hold them next month."
"It has been indicated that SADC, ACP and the OAU will be invited to and included in these consultations."
"This is good because it broadens out the scope by anchoring in Africa the kind of discussion we have to go through with Zimbabwe."
"The consultations will focus on the issues which matter to us - human rights, democracy, the rule of law, good governance and the escalation of violence."
"The consultations will provide an opportunity to seek the government's views and their firm commitment in the following areas: politically motivated violence, elections, freedom of the media, the judiciary and illegal occupation of properties."
"I would like to reassure Parliament that these consultations cover practically the totality of the issues raised in their draft resolutions."
"I would like to stress that there will also be a clear EU position on the points Zimbabwe is bound to raise, such as land reform, interference in its internal affairs, alleged support for the opposition and the imposition of what they call ""white values""."
"Finally, not pre-judging the outcome of the consultations and handling them in the spirit of the Cotonou agreement is not only necessary to address the situation with Zimbabwe, it is also necessary to maintain mutual trust and confidence between the EU and ACP countries."
"But respecting the rules and the spirit of these consultations is not the same as carrying them out in a vague and weak manner."
"This is not how the piano is going to be played!"
"As regards electoral monitoring, the Commission is getting prepared for this."
"The Government of Zimbabwe has announced that it will not accept monitors; it will only invite friends to observe the presidential elections."
"The auguries for an EU presence are not too good, but we will be able to mount an EU mission should this be feasible."
"We are maintaining flexibility to react to developments and possibilities."
"A key requirement will be that no international observation mission - whether multilateral or bilateral - is manipulated by Mugabe into sending short-term observers only for polling day."
"We have to keep in mind that last year polling day itself was relatively calm."
"It is clear that the campaigning period in the run-up to the poll is crucial for determining the fairness of the electoral process itself."
"The Commission considers that a minimum length of observation time - that is, one month - is necessary and we are discouraging others from sending short-term observers only."
"The Commission has suggested that the EU focus its approach on the SADC Parliamentary Forum's norms and standards, which comply with the UN standards and have been endorsed by Zimbabwe's ruling ZANU-PF Party."
"There are indications that other international partners, such as the Commonwealth and the United States, will agree to use those standards, which would then allow the international community to judge the openness and fairness of the elections."
"In parallel, the SADC Electoral Forum and the Electoral Commissions Forum of SADC countries are being encouraged to open a dialogue with the Zimbabwe authorities and the political parties, on the preparations for the presidential election."
"We see close collaboration with SADC in this election-related activity as a way of creating some sort of base-line case so that we will be able to do something if we cannot participate directly."
"But this is the preferred option, and Zimbabwe should welcome the EU observers."
"The Commission has remained engaged in the country in order, on the one hand, not to pre-judge the outcome of the consultations and at the same time to up the stakes for Zimbabwe of an eventual failure - thus increasing the pressure on them to cooperate."
"This is the rationale of what we are doing at this moment."
"We have therefore taken the following actions: the Commission has currently a mission on the ground to assess humanitarian needs and food security issues."
"This we will do in any case, whatever the political outcome."
"Preliminary results show that, remarkably, the deterioration of the situation is much slower than could have been expected."
"The Commission has also participated in the UNDP land mission."
"Successful or not, it is worth exerting a positive pressure on Zimbabwe by doing anything possible to move forward the dossier of land reform."
"The Commission has maintained, as I mentioned before, its offer to support the electoral process."
"We continue preparing our cooperation under the new five-year funding cycle, not least to demonstrate to the Government of Zimbabwe what it has to lose."
"We will not take any decisions on whether or not to proceed with signing and implementing the Country Strategy for Zimbabwe until after the consultations have been concluded."
"To sign or not to sign is a very important question in many cases and here it is quite clear that we want the consultations concluded before we move on."
"But not to prepare would also imply lack of respect of the whole process of planning in the Cotonou framework."
"The regional dimension is important."
"It appears that Zimbabwe's neighbours are becoming increasingly concerned with the deterioration of the situation and the potentially very dramatic consequences for the country and the whole region."
"This is why we have taken the initiative to maintain close contact with SADC and Nigeria in view of Article 96 consultations."
"It is, in fact, the first time ever that the opening of these consultations has included a reference to the use of our partners in the region."
"The General Affairs Council accepted this approach, ensuring close coordination and complementarity with SADC and the Abuja process."
"The Commission and presidency have proceeded with a series of informal exchanges with SADC and Nigeria against this background."
"We note that these African partners are already exerting effective peer pressure on Mugabe so that a solution to the crisis may be found."
"The emerging African ownership approach has to be welcomed, particularly in view of the negative effect that the continuing crisis in Zimbabwe is having on its neighbours."
"I must confess that the outlook is not optimistic."
"Things look very bad as we move into these consultations."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m."
"Cluster bombs"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0765/2001 by Sakellariou, Wiersma and van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group,"
"B5-0775/2001 by Brie, Frahm, Eriksson, Korakas, Figueiredo, Marset Campos, Papayannakis, Boudjenah and Seppänen, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group,"
"B5-0782/2001 by McKenna, Maes, Schroedter, Lucas and Isler Béguin, on behalf of the Greens/European Free Alliance Group,"
"B5-0789/2001 by van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group,"
"on cluster bombs."
"Mr President, I wanted to begin my speech by expressing my horror at this war in Afghanistan and any other war."
"We have always spoken out very clearly against the Taliban government and the measures it took against its own population, against women' s rights in particular."
"But we are also against the deaths of - I believe - thousands of innocent civilians in Afghanistan."
"Today we are talking about a weapon which is being used in Afghanistan, a weapon which the United Nations Convention of 1980 called into question, a weapon which is today also the subject of discussion in the Conference taking place in Geneva."
"A weapon which, together with anti-personnel mines, makes enormous areas of our planet uninhabitable."
"Mr President, I believe it should be banned. As simple as that."
"I even find the fourth paragraph of this resolution, which says that we must provide them with more reliable mechanisms, repellent."
"I believe that nobody in this House has expressed the horror of any war better than our recent winner of the Sakharov Prize, the Israeli Nurit Peled-Elhanan, who spoke here yesterday."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. Cluster bombs, as we all know, are one of the most treacherous conventional weapons ever devised by man."
"Civilians and aid workers fall victim to these bombs years after the conflict has ended."
"The peace process often grinds to a halt because unexploded bomblets close off whole areas."
"Refugees cannot return, because the area is no longer inhabitable."
"These are the reasons why our group agrees with the statement made by the President of our Parliament and condemns outright the use of cluster bombs by the US army in Afghanistan."
"This bombardment will set the peace process and economic development in Afghanistan back years."
"I think it is irresponsible to continue this bombardment and I call on the USA to put a stop to it at long last."
"I also call from this platform on all countries, especially those who have signed the UN Convention on Conventional Weapons, to apply an immediate moratorium at their next conference and pronounce a definitive ban on the use, production and supply of these weapons."
"And I call on the Commission and the Council in its negotiations with the USA to urge them to subscribe to a ban on cluster bombs."
"Could I just briefly refer to the statement made by the Commissioner on Zimbabwe, which I very much welcome."
"We have put off these Cotonou negotiations and we really need to have a deadline by which they must take place."
"Otherwise I can see Mugabe will just keep on deferring it until nothing happens at all."
"I would suggest that we ought to set a date, such as January 12, by which, if nothing has happened, we proceed with the sort of strong measures that we have suggested."
"Turning to the cluster bomb issue, I have to say that I have been one of the foremost activists in support of the campaign to ban antipersonnel landmines because our armed forces recognise that their limited military utility is outweighed by the danger that they so often pose to civilians, often many years after a conflict is over."
"There are other weapon systems that could be used instead of antipersonnel landmines to equal effect, but without the negative dangers."
"There are those engaged in mine clearance actions who will testify to the fact that a large proportion of the hazardous material they come across is unexploded ordnance of various sorts rather than antipersonnel mines Sometimes this ordnance includes unexploded bomblets from cluster bomb units."
"I have to say that cluster bombs are not antipersonnel landmines and it is bogus to try and confuse these two issues."
"While I would support the need for such remotely delivered munitions to contain self-destruct or neutralising mechanisms, it would be most unwise to insist on a ban until our armed forces are satisfied that their operations would not be impaired or that they have substitute weapons of equal effectiveness."
"We have to be very careful and beware of what I might call 'banning creep'."
"Otherwise we are going to blur the focus of our actions against systems such as antipersonnel landmines and the wide support which that sort of campaign attracts."
"There are some elements in the resolution that I can support, but I am suspicious of some of its driving elements."
"Therefore, I am inclined to abstain on the resolution."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one international agreement to protect the victims of international armed conflicts states that it is forbidden to use weapons, projectiles or materials and methods of war which may inflict unnecessary injury or suffering."
"So much for the theory."
"In practice, things are very different."
"Unfortunately, there are malicious people in today's world who are unscrupulous in their decision to use force and who are unscrupulous as to which weapons they use."
"But there are also people who have good reason - in order to limit and prevent force and terror - for having recourse to weapons, who have to have recourse to weapons on grounds which are perfectly in keeping with human rights."
"Our call is to these people. If you have to have recourse to weapons, even with good intentions, then those weapons should not, as this text states, be weapons which inflict unnecessary or avoidable injury and unnecessary suffering."
"In this respect, there is indeed a connection with our lasting and extremely - not completely but extremely - successful fight against landmines, which are weapons in all but name."
"I think that we should state our views in no uncertain terms in this case too."
"Perhaps there are technical features which can be incorporated in order to prevent this sort of injury and unnecessary suffering."
"But at least until there are, there must be a moratorium and that is what we are saying today."
"We are sorry that these weapons are being used, including in Afghanistan."
"But what is more important is for us to look to the future and for the European Union to come out quite clearly and unequivocally in favour of a moratorium in order - I repeat - to prevent avoidable injury and unnecessary suffering."
"Europe must support such a moratorium unequivocally."
"Mr President, my group has given the go-ahead for the vote on this resolution, and I am one of those who support the resolution and am vehemently in favour of a moratorium."
"We must tread very carefully in this particular war."
"We are fighting a terrorist regime but we run the risk of not preparing for peace and of becoming embroiled in this conflict with no clear peace programme or prospects."
"We oppose the death penalty which the Taliban have applied and yet we import it club class in huge American transporters."
"We abhor Taliban misogyny but say nothing about the rapes carried out by the so-called Northern Alliance - a highly dubious alliance - on a massive scale."
"The same applies here: obviously we have to use weapons systems in order to bring this war in Afghanistan to a successful close."
"But, on the other hand, we need to ensure that as many civilians as possible are spared in order to prevent this war from escalating around the world and in order to prevent further escalation in weapons systems, especially now that more and more politicians and former pacifists are suddenly beginning to think in terms of the admissibility of war and to accept war as a policy instrument."
"Sometimes it has to be the last resort, but what worries me is how comfortable we have become with the idea of war."
"It is precisely at such times that we need to ban this sort of weapons system and, more importantly, to strengthen international law."
"We have an international coalition against terrorism, but unless we can cash in on it by strengthening the international law of the United Nations, we shall be prey to other constellations which we absolutely do not want."
"Hence, as I said, we need to fight terrorism but the ultimate aim must be to strengthen international law and ban - and this too is a topical issue - atomic as well as biological and chemical weapons."
"Which is where the USA comes in and of course, most importantly, a ban on these cluster bombs which, in our view, are a means of war which endanger civilians to an unreasonable extent."
"Those who know what damage was caused in the Balkans or Kosovo, mainly because of the mines laid by the Yugoslav army - that too needs to be said - they will understand why, at all events, we need to take a moderate line here."
"The Commission shares Parliament' s concern about the humanitarian, economic and social problems caused by a variety of unexploded ordnance such as cluster bombs and the particular difficulties of clearing contaminated areas."
"A number of studies on cluster bombs show that no less than 10% of delivered cluster bomblets fail to explode on impact and that the remaining unexploded ones tend to have effects similar to anti-personnel landmines."
"They also are victim-activated and provoke fatal or disabling injuries as serious as those caused by landmines."
"The Commission has taken due note of the proposal submitted by the International Committee of the Red Cross to address the problems caused by cluster bombs and other 'explosive remnants of war' at the review conference of the UN Convention on the Prohibition or Restriction on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons."
"This approach is broadly shared by the EU."
"At the review conference, which is being held in Geneva from 11 to 21 December 2001, the EU will present a common position on the issue of the unexploded remnants of war, requesting concrete steps to address this issue under the CCW framework."
"With this in mind, we have carried out diplomatic démarches to prepare the ground for a successful outcome of the Geneva meeting."
"Parliament's initiative is therefore particularly timely and welcome."
"The Commission will closely follow developments at the CCW review conference."
"On an operational level, the Commission is already providing an indirect but tangible contribution to the reduction of the threat posed by cluster bombs and other unexploded ordnance through the legal and budgetary instrument of the anti-personnel landmines regulation."
"Mine clearance carried out under this regulation encompasses de facto clearance of other unexploded ordnance."
"We are already engaged in such broader clearance activities in countries such as Laos and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Kosovo, where the anti-personnel landmine problem is very clearly connected to unexploded ordnance pollution."
"Mine clearance is also supported as part of ECHO-funded humanitarian aid in many countries and as part of development activities when we are carrying out ECHO-financed reconstruction work or building roads, etc. in a number of countries."
"A week ago, in Kabul, I saw de-mining activities funded by ECHO."
"Through two organisations we have employed something like 1 500 to 2 000 local Afghan staff who are continually working on de-mining."
"We walked on marked paths in areas where I counted 30 to 40 recent non-exploded cluster bombs."
"They do not necessarily stay on the surface of the ground."
"If a neighbouring cluster bomblet explodes it may bury a few others and functionally they become anti-personnel landmines."
"They have three functions: armour penetration capability, spraying shards of shrapnel from the casing, and starting a fire."
"It was a very morbid experience but it gives me real satisfaction that we are funding this kind of activity on a large scale."
"Certainly this is a main priority in the present situation where we are working to make it possible for the refugees to return home safely."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m."
"Human rights"
"Mr President, Commissioner, unless women are involved, there will be no lasting peace in Afghanistan."
"That was the most important message to come out of the Afghan women's summit convened in Brussels on 5 and 6 December with the support of the EU."
"Around 50 leading representatives from every social group in the country attended the conference, in a bid to make the voice of Afghan women heard in the current international political debate."
"We are delighted that the UN-Afghanistan conference held in parallel in Bonn decided to appoint at least two women, including one as deputy prime minister, to the transitional government."
"Our summit in Brussels certainly helped here."
"They can count on our support, but more needs to happen."
"We insist that women be given a good chance and be selected as candidates in future elections at all political levels."
"That means they need support and practical help now in a special democracy programme."
"Care must be taken in any future negotiations to ensure that Afghan women are fully integrated in efforts to resolve conflicts and in ongoing peace talks."
"The whole world and the media are watching at present and this must be used to build up new structures and ensure that the voice of Afghan women is heard."
"My group will use International Women's Day in 2002, just as it did in 1998, to maintain the wave of support in favour of averting a humanitarian disaster."
"The new watchword of the Social Democrats, who have been highlighting the plight of women under the Taliban regime for years, is this: no project for the future of Afghanistan and no form of political agreement will be accepted unless women are fully involved."
"We are calling for a group of leading Afghan women to be set up to coordinate international support, with a corresponding contact for assistance from the EU."
"The women and girls of Afghanistan have had to withstand 20 years of war and constant infringement of their human rights."
"But that does not mean they were condemned to silence."
"Afghan organisations such as the RAWA have worked hard to resist the Taliban regime."
"There is no reason to believe that things will be much better under the Northern Alliance, which is why we must support the courage and determination of the RAWA today."
"This morning we put budgetary arrangements in place to support NGOs such as the RAWA."
"But we need staying power and committed women to ensure that women get peace, freedom and equality in Afghanistan."
"We must not let up until women's rights are fully respected as human rights under the future constitution."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we live in the same world as the women of Afghanistan."
"I should like to recall their Declaration of the Essential Rights of Afghan Women, which they adopted in Dushanbe on 28 June 2000."
"These were women issuing a call to action and not only victims."
"I should also like to recall, as Mrs Gröner has just done, the Afghan Women's Summit, which concluded on 6 December 2001, last week, and which issued a proclamation which it is important to be familiar with."
"This proclamation says: Afghan women want their rights now, not tomorrow, not later on."
"All these rights have been returned to them; we therefore need to restore these rights now."
"That is why I have tabled an amendment which I would ask you to support, calling for these rights to be re-established as quickly as possible."
"We need to give them the means to travel and to receive education and healthcare because ultimately we, the women of the same world as them, are a little anxious."
"We are a little anxious and we call on the European institutions and the UN institutions to be vigilant."
"Paragraph 5 of the resolution calls for the UN to focus particularly on establishing equality between men and women in Afghanistan, because these women have really been the symbols of many things."
"They have been the symbols of their own oppression, but they have also been the symbols of famine."
"Six months ago, when we were debating the situation in Afghanistan, they were the symbols of the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddha statues, and even of their own oppression."
"It is not therefore a question of discarding the symbol once it has served its purpose."
"It is a question of acting in such a way that the women are able to rediscover their rights and, for those who feel able to fight actively as representatives of all of the people, to participate in the government."
"These women are active participants in this process and we live in the same world as they do."
"They are demanding the freedom to travel and the recognition of habeas corpus; I believe that these freedoms are the same as those enjoyed by Westerners and that we should not seek to draw a distinction between them."
"That is why there is no secondary issue here, just one thing which I am asking you and that is, if possible, as an institution, to work to ensure that these freedoms are respected, because we are not sure that tomorrow will be any better than yesterday for these women."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to add to what my fellow MEPs have already said by stating how gratifying it is to see the delight shown by Afghan women."
"However, we are also concerned about the fear that prevails at the same time."
"Afghan women have good reasons to be afraid, for we know that the Northern Alliance too has perpetrated crimes such as forced marriage."
"It is important that women and children should survive the winter."
"At the same time, it is important to proceed with the measures referred to in this House: full access to education and healthcare for women and young girls."
"We must immediately proceed on the basis of a rights-based approach."
"Afghan women should not have to beg for the right to education as a favour. Instead, this must be a right."
"In that way, they will achieve the dignity and receive the education that they require."
"We also need to earmark funds but, in this area, equality between the different ethnic groups is required."
"We are delighted about the outcome of the Bonn Conference, but the work must go on."
"I should also like to draw Mr Nielson' s attention to the special report prepared by my predecessor, Mrs Rehn, on the UN' s peacekeeping activities and ask him to note that there is a lot to do when it comes to the treatment of women by the peacekeeping forces."
"Women are needed in the peacekeeping forces, and an understanding is required of how to treat women who have suffered violence."
"I hope that the UN will support the proposal tabled by Mrs Rehn in her report to Kofi Annan."
"The issue of guilt also needs to be examined, that is to say who bears responsibility for what."
"It is the only way in which to bring about healing."
"I believe there is a lot of international experience in this area that we can draw upon."
"Last but not least, quite a serious issue, Commissioner Nielson."
"Mine dogs, which are extremely important in clearing away all this devastation, are also needed."
"I hope that the EU can offer support in this area, too."
"Mr President, the international Afghanistan conference at Petersberg in Bonn led to excellent results last Wednesday."
"The 29-strong transitional government will include two women."
"This is a fundamentally important message and a first step towards social recognition."
"With the end of the Taliban's reign of terror and its mediaeval regime in sight, the brutal suppression of women's rights will also come to an end."
"They have been the main ones to suffer under the caste of self-appointed warriors of God."
"They have been denied an education, training, career and the right to any say-so whatsoever."
"They were banned from public life."
"The painful result: only 5% of women and girls can read or write."
"From now on, women will acquire equal opportunities in access to jobs, medical care and the right to vote on a par with men."
"In Parliament and the government they need seats and a voice."
"I am convinced that they will succeed in building up their own organisations so that they too can influence the economic and social decision-making processes."
"They will be unstoppable in finding their new identity, but they need staying power and our support."
"I hope that the women whom we honoured on 8 March 1998 in our campaign ""A flower for Kabul"" will be able to return to their professions as doctors, teachers, professors and managers."
"On behalf of the PPE and as a member of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, I support the proposal to make the 8 March next year Afghan Women's Day."
"The European Union has supported Afghanistan alone to the tune of EUR 400 million over the last 10 years."
"In future, we must invest more in programmes and projects for women."
"As far as reconstruction is concerned, we call on Afghanistan's neighbours to take an active part in this process."
"Mr President, as a co-author of this resolution I am proud that I spoke out in June of this year in this Chamber against the brutality and medieval obscurantist policies of the Taliban government, when they chose to destroy the beautiful Buddhist statutes in Bamiyan."
"This was well before they, and their tragic country, became the focus of the world on 11 September, as the Taliban's link with the perpetrators of the attack on the USA became clear to everybody."
"Afghanistan is now at an historical crossroad."
"I, as a British MEP, am proud of the role played by the courageous troops from my country in helping America rid Afghanistan of its oppressive masters and end their harbouring of international terrorists bent on the destruction of western values, including women's rights."
"I salute particularly those who have been wounded in the campaign and hope, as the UK is about to become a major component of the UN peacekeeping force, that no further casualties will ensue."
"Two weeks ago I was invited to meet a representative from the Revolutionary Association of Afghan Women and I, as a Conservative, baulked initially at the title ""revolutionary""."
"However, after my meeting I decided that, in Afghanistan, my western views on social and political rights for women would no doubt, in the eyes of the old mujaheddin guard, such as President Rabbani, classify me, too, as a revolutionary."
"I welcome the participation of two women in the interim government and I am hopeful that the new generation of younger, progressive and modern political leaders will see the way to establish a new order based on equality of the sexes and on full political and social rights enshrined in their international treaty obligations, and cease to regard women and their role as a purely economic one and a procreative one and banish them to invisibility in their burkas."
"Women were once, in the 1960s and 1970s, welcomed by the government of King Mohammed Zahir Shah as full participating members of society in their professions, in higher education and in politics."
"I hope that Afghanistan can return to this form of moderate secular government again, and make use of the huge pool of talent residing in more than 50% of its population."
"Mr President, Saudi Arabia has no credibility and offers no guarantees in terms of defending Afghan women."
"Saudi Arabia is one of just three countries which officially supported the Taliban regime."
"It has been promoting and financially aiding Islamic fundamentalism and it seriously violates the human rights of women."
"Mr President, given Saudi Arabia' s anti-women pedigree, is it coherent that at the meeting in Washington on 20 November, that country should be named as part of the group that will lead the reconstruction of Afghanistan?"
"Mr President, Afghanistan is now entering a hopeful stage and they must begin to change the harsh living conditions for women."
"We need a plan containing urgent measures in order that Afghanistan may embark on reconstruction and the road to peace and progress."
"The European Union must concern itself as directly as possible with imposing order in the distribution of humanitarian aid and establishing speedy measures and structures so that girls and women may receive education and healthcare."
"My final recommendation, Mr President, is that we remember those women' s organisations which resisted the Taliban - such as RAWA - and it is those organisations which must now play a decisive role so that women are fully involved in the reconstruction."
"'I keep on seeing dead bodies: our country is a cemetery."
"We keep on resisting to free ourselves from terrorism and the war lords, and also from the USA, which created Osama Bin Laden and the Taliban and which, in order to fight and kill them, also bomb us.'"
"Fatima was talking to me on the telephone from Kabul: she is not a refugee but a RAWA leader."
"She says the streets in Kabul are once again crowded and the markets are full but there is no money and widows still live on charity and children scavenge on rubbish heaps."
"Everyone is still afraid."
"A few women have removed or raised their burka, some men have had a shave, music has started to be played again, but there is fear of punishment and vendettas."
"That is why, said Fatima - and I agree with her - there should be a United Nations force there, without Russians, Americans or the British but with contingents from other countries: a multi-ethnic and multi-religious force working at disarming the military groups."
"Everybody is talking about the rights of Afghan women."
"That is excellent, provided women are not used yet again to justify acts of war."
"For years, Afghan and also European women have been denouncing the oppression and violence of the Taliban regime to deaf ears in the West."
"The war is not over; we cannot pretend it is and talk just of the future and reconstruction."
"Important steps have been taken for women to be included in the formation of the government, but that is not enough and the process is not finished."
"We must support those democratic women who have a secular view of the Constitution and who rise above ethnic and tribal divisions, but without denying their own identities."
"Many of us have met them; together - as other Members have mentioned - we have drawn up demands, but we have also put our own responsibilities on the table."
"The mines that maim were produced in western factories; the cluster bombs, dropped in their thousands in recent days and lying unexploded, are products of our factories; ours are the perverse patents allowing mines to be designed in the shape of butterflies or dolls; ours are the pretty yellow cluster bombs, the same colour as the packets of food dropped from aircraft."
"A shared road links us to the Afghan women, the road to freedom and justice for everyone, men and women."
"The resolution we are voting for today and the Fraisse amendment must not remain lifeless words on paper, but must be given practical effect."
"Even before the rise to power of the Taliban in Afghanistan during 1995-1996 the EU was conscious of the poor position and status of women in Afghan society."
"This was recognised in the nature of the aid programmes which we financed at that time and which had a strong focus on the provision of health care, education and employment creation for women."
"With the arrival in power of the Taliban in Kabul in 1996, the EU agreed a Common Position on Afghanistan."
"The Common Position is renewed annually and clearly sets out among its objectives the promotion of respect for international law and human rights, including the rights of women and children."
"In addition, the EU undertakes in the Common Position to support aid programmes which integrate gender concerns and actively attempt to promote the equitable participation of both men and women and promote peace and human rights."
"As a result, the Commission, through its ECHO-financed programmes and through its budget for aid to uprooted people, continued, even during the Taliban period, to finance actions which provided health care and education for women and girls and provided employment opportunities and training for women."
"I met many of these women and men in Kabul last week."
"It made me start talking about what I call the 'other Afghanistan'."
"We all know the Afghanistan of the warlords."
"But there is an alternative Afghanistan."
"We also have heroes and heroines of peace and compassion."
"Many of them work in projects that we are funding, did so during the Taliban regime and have continued doing so since September 11."
"In an ECHO-funded project for vulnerable children, I met the girls sitting there learning to read and write and asked how many wanted to become housewives when they grew up."
"Only a few hands were somewhat hesitantly raised."
"Then I asked how many wanted to become schoolteachers or doctors."
"Everyone put their hand up - they all wanted to do something."
"A very nice moment I would say, and their lady teacher was proud."
"Another project involved a woman producing quilts which we use for refugee projects."
"She was alone, her husband had died in the conflict, and when the Taliban came to power, she had to stop working as a crane operator in the construction industry."
"She has 10 children and her home was being used."
"They sat on the floor sewing these quilts and that was a very nice experience."
"At the end, when we left, I could not resist giving her a hug to express my feelings - clearly not politically correct when the neighbours could see or, indeed, at all."
"But it was well received, and I was quite happy to be part of a civilised and nice meeting of cultures in the centre of Kabul."
"Now we are fortunately in the post-Taliban era."
"Changes are now possible and we hope that what was achieved in Bonn on December 5 will pave the way for a big improvement in the situation of women and girls in the country."
"Women were included in the delegations in Bonn; women will hold office in the Interim Administration."
"The Provisional Agreement makes a number of specific references to the guaranteed participation of women in the next phases of the political process - the Loya Jirga and the Transitional Administration."
"All of this will be overseen by the UN which has a constitutional role, recognised in the Provisional Agreement, to monitor the conduct of the Interim Authority and the emergency Loya Jirga, as well as providing for the development and implementation of a programme of human rights education to promote respect for and understanding of human rights in Afghanistan."
"The Commission is currently processing new, additional aid programmes worth EUR 28.5 million, which will start being implemented in the coming weeks, for emergency aid and aid to uprooted people."
"Gender will, of course, be either a specific or horizontal issue in all of these programmes."
"ECHO is already present in Kabul and we will formally inaugurate the ECHO office there in the middle of January."
"Commission officials plan to start being there permanently from 1 February 2002."
"It is therefore important to ensure follow-up also in view of what we are discussing here."
"Progress will provide crucial indicators to allow the EU and the rest of the international community to judge the commitment of the new Afghan administration to the engagement that they now have entered into."
"I must warn you not to expect miracles."
"It is a very traditional society, especially outside Kabul."
"The reality on the ground does not reflect the elite in Kabul that we easily get in touch with. There are many deep-seated differences."
"We must take a very broad-based approach and make sure that we deliberately include women in the many decentralised activities that we carry out across the country."
"Indonesia"
"Mr President, so it is true after all: Bin Laden' s Al Qaeda network is definitely operating in Indonesia."
"It has training camps in, among other places, Sulawesi, the island to which I shall confine myself to referring in this speech."
"Using the Islamic terror group Laskar Jihad as a front, thousands of these fighters, some of them foreign, recently arrived on the island of Sulawesi."
"The thirty-nine-year-old Ya'far Umar Thalib from Yogyakarta, Pakistan-trained leader of this terrorist organisation set up in the late 1990s, denies the presence of Bin Laden' s followers."
"The opposite turns out to be true."
"Only yesterday did the head of the Indonesian national security service, ex-general Hendro Pliono, after a meeting with President Megawati Sukarnoputri, confirm that Al Qaeda is operating on Indonesian territory."
"I hope that the Indonesian authorities will not content themselves with making these statements."
"I call on them urgently to act decisively against Laskar Jihad and this offshoot of Al Qaeda, as there is no time to lose."
"Since the conflict first erupted on Amboina on 19 January 1999, one day before the Islamic festival of Idul Fitr, Laskar Jihad has murdered at least 10 000 Christians and has put many times that number to flight in terror of their lives."
"I am extremely concerned that after the Moluccas this anti-Christian force should have found its way to Sulawesi too."
"I still have a vivid recollection of the story documented this autumn of the eight-year-old Christian boy."
"The boy was sitting on the bus with his mother."
"En route, some 50 Muslim terrorists forced the vehicle to stop."
"The attackers checked the passengers' religious identity."
"Two turned out to be Christians, the woman and her son."
"They dragged the boy off the bus with brute force, leaving the mother behind utterly distraught."
"The young victim' s terrified screams were to no avail."
"The terrorists dragged him over the asphalt into the jungle, and nothing more was heard of him."
"Just one of the countless documented attacks on buses by Laskar Jihad in Sulawesi."
"I ask both the Council and the Commission to do their utmost to contribute to the combating of terrorism in Indonesia, to explore in what way they could support a process of conciliation on the ground, and to examine what measures they can take to promote economic development in this region."
"As a Parliament we have passed a number of important motions on Indonesia, Timor and the Moluccas."
"When we talk of Indonesia, we are talking of an empire in which, under dictatorship, whole sections of the population were forcibly transported to other parts of the empire, the transmigration."
"That still underlies many complex conflicts."
"At the same time the transition from dictatorship to democracy is an enormous step."
"Since 1999 there has been some democratisation, but that is proceeding terribly slowly: on the one hand attempts are being made to strengthen democracy, on the other hand fierce ethnic conflicts are raging in many areas."
"The Jihad, which was previously active in the Moluccas, is now operating in Sulawesi."
"And every time one sees that the army has difficulty in really detaching itself and accepting the rule of law and democracy."
"This is clear in Papua."
"The island is still further from the capital and although legislation on autonomy is in prospect, as well as a special court for investigating certain events, it is still clear how much effort it requires to take this step."
"Therefore we must strongly condemn the murder committed and do all we can to facilitate that process of reconciliation."
"The same applies to Sulawesi."
"Let us therefore distance ourselves completely from the terrorists, the Jihad, and at the same time support the Indonesian authorities."
"The fact is that the vast majority of the population want reconciliation, want to live and build a society together."
"Ordinary citizens, whether Christian or Muslim, are not interested in the Jihad."
"For this reason, given all our experience, and with due modesty, we have an important part to play there."
"We all have to condemn the assassinations that took place in Papua on 10 November."
"There is a real danger that more assassinations are being planned."
"There is an onus on the Indonesian Government to investigate thoroughly and to bring in the international investigation teams if necessary."
"It is essential that those responsible are brought to justice."
"It is also essential that the Indonesian Government protects witnesses from intimidation and murder and it should also protect organisations, NGOs and others from the same threat."
"It is also important that the Indonesian Government should replace its Kopassus units because they are seen daily as a threat to the Papuan people."
"We also believe that the Indonesian Government should call a halt to the army's commercial activities in Papua."
"Thousands have died on Sulawesi alone, where there has been two years of fighting."
"The Indonesian Government needs to make an effort to ensure coexistence between the Muslim and the Christian populations, which had been possible for many years."
"Mr President, since November, after a relatively peaceful period in Indonesia, we have again been alarmed by serious outbreaks of violence in, for example, Sulawesi and Celebes and by the murder of Theys Hiyo Eluay, the leader of the Papuas in Irian Jaya."
"I should like first to say a few words about the murder of Theys Hiyo Eluay, which took place on 10 November after he had had discussions on behalf of the Papuan community with the senior command of the Indonesian military forces in West Papua."
"Theys Hiyo Eluay was not only a charismatic leader of the Papuas, but was also a moderate man, who did not seek complete independence for his province, but whose aim was autonomy within the Indonesian state and who had succeeded in achieving this autonomy via the Indonesian parliament."
"In October autonomy was ratified in the Indonesian parliament and after a dinner with the regional military staff he was murdered on the evening of 10 November."
"It is typical of relations in Indonesia that military units are able to frustrate a constructive process of peace and reconciliation in this way and that this kind of murder can take place."
"Many people believe that it was an act of revenge, because an autonomous Irian Jaya would never have given the military the power and financial rewards that they had previously enjoyed."
"My request to the Commission and the Council is that they should ask the Indonesian Government to investigate the murder thoroughly and punish the culprit, so that justice is done in a country where injustice prevails."
"In addition I should like to request help for the regional government of Irian Jaya, for example for the setting up of a civil service academy, so that people have a real chance of administering the region."
"And then there is the situation in Sulawesi and Celebes."
"These are the same Laskar Jihad groups that previously caused such misery in the Moluccas and were responsible for thousands of deaths and hundreds of thousands of refugees."
"In this case too we would request that the Commission and the Council ask the Indonesian government to protect the Christian community in Indonesia and keep better control of the fundamentalist Muslim groups."
"If Indonesia wishes to retain its respectable and important position, the present government really must call a halt to this violence and the European Union must make it clear to Indonesia that political murders and violence are not acceptable; otherwise the relationship between the European Union and Indonesia will in my view be put under strain."
"Mr President, the Commission fully shares with honourable Members their condemnation of the kidnapping and murder of Theys Eluay, Chairman of the Papuan Presidium Council, and adds its voice to the call for the Government of Indonesia to ensure a full investigation of this dreadful incident and to bring its perpetrators to justice."
"We are informed that this is now being investigated as a murder case, which may not be sufficient to give us full confidence but at least they are taking this approach."
"Further action is also needed to restore calm and to develop confidence in the democratic process."
"In this context, the Commission warmly welcomes the adoption last month by the Indonesian national parliament of the special autonomy law for Papua and encourages the Government of Indonesia to proceed to full implementation of the new law with determination and with due speed."
"The Commission also shares the deep concern of honourable Members concerning the recent deterioration of the situation in Sulawesi."
"Since December 1998, there have been several instances of violence between Muslims and Christians."
"The two communities are increasingly segregated - and both are armed."
"While reports from the area are sometimes unclear, the situation is certainly serious."
"Intercommunal violence has flared up recently around the town of Poso."
"A report by a local humanitarian fact-finding mission, which visited the area (including Poso and Tentena) last week, suggests that the situation is now relatively calm, but that it remains very tense."
"While the TNI and police are making efforts to maintain security, to collect weapons and arrest those responsible for violence, the presence of a large and vociferous group of Laskar Jihad gives rise to continued fears of escalating violence."
"The Commission' s Delegation in Jakarta, together with the diplomatic missions of the EU Member States, will continue to make every effort to monitor developments in these areas and to draw our concerns to the attention of the Indonesian authorities in EU démarches and other contacts."
"The Commission fully shares the stated position of the European Union, which firmly supports the territorial integrity of Indonesia, while encouraging the government to make urgent efforts to address and resolve peacefully Indonesia' s internal conflicts, whether separatist or sectarian in character."
"Colleagues, as you know, eight immigrants, including three children died last weekend in a freight container which had been shipped to Ireland."
"Therefore, before opening the debate on the subject, I would ask you all to rise and observe a minute's silence in memory of those victims of the tragedy."
"(Parliament rose and observed one minute's silence)"
"Immigration in Ireland"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I believe that this new tragedy illustrates yet again what we might call the fate of immigrants."
"A year ago, it was 58 foreigners who were found dead in Dover; the year before, Yaguine and Fodé, two young Guineans, were found dead in the undercarriage of a Sabena plane."
"It seems to me that this keeps happening and that, faced with these tragedies, we actually only have one policy, which is to lock the door and throw away the key."
"And, as Bernard-Henri Lévy would say, it seems to me that increasingly people are losing interest in what we might call the suburbs of the world."
"It would appear, Mr President, that there are two ways of tackling immigration issues today."
"The first, which is increasingly common, is to want to keep our borders wide open so as to have a source of cheap labour, liable to be ruthlessly exploited; and the other is not to want any immigration at all, which is neither preferable nor desirable."
"I believe that it is high time, Mr President, that we had some effective legislation, which is rigorous, of course, but simple in terms of form and common to all European countries, which takes account of the needs of both the southern and northern countries."
"We cannot continue to strip the countries of the south of their intellectual assets whenever we need them, cynically importing brainpower as if it were just another commodity which we need, as it were, to safeguard our pensions, while at the same time speaking the language of repression."
"This is not about repression or charity; it is dignity which is at stake here."
"I believe that this is how we should tackle the issue of immigration."
"On the other hand - and we have seen illustrations of this throughout the afternoon - if we do not take into consideration the fact that today three quarters of the earth's population is living in the most absolute poverty; if today we do not cancel the debt of developing countries and if we do not discipline ourselves to invest in health, education and infrastructure, I am convinced that, once again, we will have failed to learn the lessons of history, as recent as it is."
"Today, these destitute men and women, who are totally neglected, form a breeding ground for terrorism, a place where terrorism thrives."
"Fighting terrorism today also means fighting this poverty."
"Mr President, I have been so bold as to intervene without taking notes because I really do not think that we can continue to treat these people with such great inhumanity."
"Mr President, I should like to thank you for the one minute's silence for those who died."
"There may well be further deaths unless we change our approach to this whole issue of immigration and refugee status."
"I would like to convey my deepest sympathy to the survivors of this tragedy for the loss of their spouses and their children."
"The discovery of eight bodies, plus the five people who are seriously ill, in a container in Wexford in Ireland was an appalling tragedy which has shocked people, not just in Ireland, but all across Europe."
"Regrettably it is not the first time that this has happened."
"The suffering and terror endured by the injured and those who died - including four children - during the several days they spent in this sealed metal container is barely conceivable."
"They spent 53 hours at sea in a Force 10 gale in a container surrounded by furniture."
"The deaths all occurred as a result of lack of oxygen."
"The very thought of little children being put through that kind of terror is inconceivable."
"I urge the Irish Government to enable the survivors to remain in Ireland, to help them rebuild their lives, and to provide them with refugee status if that is appropriate."
"It may be that under law they do not qualify for refugee status, but if this is so they should get it, and they should still be allowed to remain in Ireland in any case."
"The tragedy demonstrates once again the desperate lengths to which people are prepared to go to try to improve circumstances for themselves and their families."
"We hear much about the privileged treatment given to asylum seekers and I hope we will hear no more of this."
"The reality of the terrible experience facing many immigration and asylum seekers is revealed in eight people dead and others who are seriously ill."
"Lessons have to be learnt from this tragedy."
"There is clearly a need for more thorough checking of containers at the point of departure and arrival and for closer cooperation between the authorities in different countries."
"But, given that it will not be possible to check every single container, given that inevitably others will try this desperate journey, we should look seriously at the question of obliging those who own these containers to put air vents in them."
"Otherwise we are going to face this kind of horror yet again."
"Ireland and Europe have to adopt immigration policies based on full respect for human rights as set out in international conventions, such as the Geneva Convention."
"Our policies have to address in a much more forceful way the political, economic and social reasons why people are fleeing their homelands."
"We must also relax immigration laws to prevent people from being driven to take these desperate remedies."
"I very much regret this but I must condemn a statement made by Ireland's Minister for Justice last Monday, where he accused those who argue for a more rational and open immigration policy of simply proposing an open door policy on immigration."
"I am quite happy to engage in debate with the minister but the problem is that, in adopting that attitude and in adopting that frame of reference for this debate, he is feeding the paranoia which is at the root of much of the abuse that immigrants and refugees face in their host country."
"I would like to thank you, Mr President and colleagues, for the moment's silence for the awful tragedy which took place only this week in my own home county of Wexford in Ireland."
"The tragic death of these eight people, including four children, found in the freight container just highlights the daily plight of many asylum-seekers and refugees throughout the European Union."
"Witnessing it last Saturday will remain with me forever."
"I would like to join personally with colleagues in this House in expressing my condolences to all those associated with this tragedy."
"Since that awful incident, the bodies of four dead Romanians have been found inside a container bound for Canada in the Italian port of Livorno."
"The scale and European-wide nature of this problem have been tragically highlighted by these episodes and it is up to us as a European Community to respond far better than we have done heretofore."
"Since its inception the European Union has always been based upon the values of solidarity and community."
"If the EU Council Summit at Laeken this weekend only addresses the issue of the strengthening of borders as a response to this modern day slave trade, it will have failed not only to respect these values but also to fulfil its leadership role."
"These appalling incidents highlight dramatically the contradictory attitudes to migration and refugee policies in the EU."
"Europe and Ireland increasingly need immigrant workers to do the jobs left vacant by greater prosperity and shrinking populations."
"But sadly, at the moment more political effort is being put into erecting stronger border controls to keeping migrants out than to developing policies for structured flows of immigration."
"Tragedies such as that in Wexford will continue to take place until this contradiction is seriously addressed by all Member State governments of the EU."
"I welcome efforts this week to finalise an EU-wide arrest warrant to deal with these criminal 'people smugglers' who benefit financially from the misery and desperation of others."
"The single market has brought many benefits to our citizens, but it has also provided the criminals with just that - a single market for their activities."
"Today, more than ever, we need Eurojust and Europol to deal effectively with the individuals who prey on the misery and desperation of others."
"In conclusion, the historical legacy of Irish economic migration throughout the world in the past two centuries, particularly during and after our Irish potato famine of 1845-1849 is one which we as Irish Europeans should not ignore."
"We should now be generous enough to take our share of those fleeing persecution and those seeking to make a better life for themselves."
"If the deaths of migrants in freight containers, on the undercarriages of trains or in ship holds in recent months demonstrates anything, it is that responses to economic migration based solely on the monitoring of the illegal movement of people will not prevent people from resorting to desperate measures to travel to Europe."
"It is imperative that we also address the underlying problems within the countries from which these desperate people flee."
"Perhaps then the tragedy last week in Wexford of the Turkish, Algerian and Albanian economic migrants will not have not been in vain."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution which we are about to adopt includes a series of statements on measures needed on the part of the European Union, measures which clearly need to be implemented following this incident."
"Mr Sylla pointed out that this is not a one-off incident and that problems such as this occur year in year out, which is why I do not intend to go through all these measures again on behalf of our group."
"We know what the problem is and we have already voted in numerous resolutions on what needs to be done and what needs to be implemented, some of which is already being implemented."
"I should like to address a different aspect, an aspect which I should like to link to your one minute's silence, Mr President."
"We honour victims with one minute's silence."
"These victims deserve not just the honour of our one minute's silence; they also deserve the following consideration: the people who turn to the criminal elements who take money from them to get them to what they see as paradise, are people with hopes."
"Generally, it should be said, they have hopes for a better life not for themselves but for their children."
"They give everything away, all their worldly goods, their property and their hopes."
"There is a German proverb which says, ""Hope is the last to die""."
"The people in this container still hoped they would reach their destination until they drew their dying breath."
"That brings me to another aspect of my thoughts on the subject."
"The people who gamble on these hopes, the people who take money for these hopes, the corrupt border officials who allowed these people, who were from Kurdistan, to cross our external borders, the criminals who want to capitalise on people's desperation, have also earned one minute of the deepest contempt of which we as a civilised society are capable."
"I should like to follow on from your one minute's silence by dedicating this contempt to their victims."
"Their children should know that the perpetrators have the full contempt of the civilised world."
"Mr President, eight people, half of them children, have died under horrific and incomprehensible circumstances."
"The same thing happened in Dover a year ago."
"Then as now, it was said that this must not happen again."
"Everyone is shocked, but the truth is that thousands of people die every year under similar circumstances."
"We talk about illegal immigration to Europe and about people who try to make their way here without valid travel documents."
"It is, however, we who make their status illegal by constantly making the visa requirements more stringent, by constantly sending out the signal that they are not welcome, by forcing the airlines to accept their liability as transporters and by giving shipowners the task of assessing who shall be allowed to seek asylum."
"This situation cannot continue."
"We must agree upon a common, humane and generous refugee policy and a migration strategy for the whole of Europe."
"I hope we do not again have to sit here in this House in two weeks' time following a similar event and express regret about the deaths of more people."
"We must look forward."
"We must see if we cannot find a solution to this problem other than repressive measures."
"Mr President, for clarification, my group was also an author of this resolution but somehow we got dropped off the list."
"This is something that we are going to see happening again if we do not look at our whole policy - this fortress Europe mentality - the fact that we are building the barricades and the walls higher and higher."
"We are trying to prevent people from coming in and we need to implement measures which will prevent asylum-seekers resorting to traffickers in their effort to reach a country where they can seek asylum, as they are entitled to do under the Geneva Convention."
"There is quite a lot of hypocrisy concerning this issue, and I would like to refer to my own Minister for Justice in Ireland, John O'Donoghue."
"He was crying crocodile tears at the weekend over this event yet he has tightened the laws in Ireland in every possible way to ensure that asylum-seekers do not come to Ireland to file an application for refugee status, which I would like to reiterate is something that they are entitled to do under the Geneva Convention."
"To highlight this minister's hypocrisy further: yesterday, for the first time in the history of the Geneva Convention, there was a meeting of the 141 countries that signed that Convention in 1951."
"Our minister, who was crying over what had happened at the weekend and saying that it was one of his worst fears, did not think this meeting was important enough to attend."
"We really need to change our policy on how we treat asylum-seekers and refugees and we have to stop building the barricades higher and higher to keep them out."
"We have to realise that there are people who are desperate to get out of their countries and that there are reasons why they want to leave."
"They are human beings, they are not the so-called undesirables that some people would like to think."
"They are exactly the same as the Irish who were desperate to get out of Ireland at one stage going to America and other places - where they were well treated."
"We have a duty and an obligation to treat everyone in this world equally."
"Mr President, the Commission too is deeply concerned by the repetition of such a dramatic event."
"Everyone has in mind the tragic deaths of 58 Chinese stowaways in Dover last year, but unfortunate people die almost every week trying to reach what they consider to be a unique area of peace and prosperity."
"Smuggling and trafficking of human beings are nowadays increasingly carried out by criminal organisations which profit from the distress of women, men and children in search of a better life or in need of international protection."
"Although many measures have already been taken at national level and under Schengen cooperation to tackle this horrendous form of crime, the Commission can understand the frustration expressed by Parliament when confronted with the apparent failure of existing instruments."
"There is definitely a need for enhanced action and cooperation at national, European and international level."
"This is why the Commission put forward in November a communication on a common policy on illegal immigration, aiming at creating synergy of national efforts by adding a European dimension."
"One of the main messages flowing from this communication is that preventing and fighting illegal immigration is part and parcel of a comprehensive migration policy."
"It is crucial in building up support for a common asylum regime based on the highest humanitarian standards, as well as genuine immigration policy in line with our tradition of hospitality and solidarity."
"More efficient controls at the external borders, improved consular cooperation and reinforced police and judicial cooperation, are key elements."
"Nevertheless, there is more to it than that: partnership with countries of origin and transit, a policy of sustainable return for illegal immigrants and the fight against undeclared work are all essential in this regard."
"All this must be achieved in full compliance with international obligations and human rights."
"The framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings, the directive on carriers' liability and the directive and the framework decision on the liability of smugglers, already approved by the Council, are only first steps."
"In a broader framework, it is crucial to ensure a swift ratification and a coordinated implementation of the UN Palermo Convention against transnational organised crime and its two protocols on trafficking and smuggling, which now form the basis for a global recognition of the problem and a stronger approach to tackle it."
"The Laeken Summit is now only a couple of days away."
"This will be the occasion for a mid-term review of the implementation of the Tampere conclusions."
"This should provide a unique opportunity to give a new impetus to a much needed common immigration and asylum policy."
"The Union is indeed behind schedule in these areas."
"A major political effort to fill these gaps as soon as possible would be our best tribute to the memory of the victims of Wexford."
"But rather than looking at the global perspective, the rich world has some soul-searching and wallet-searching to do."
"The general level of development assistance flowing from north to south is an unsatisfactory 0.22% of the GNP of the rich countries."
"There is a link between this and what we are discussing here and this also defines the challenge we have to face."
"Togo"
"Mr President, Togo is still in a state of political paralysis."
"The regular condemnations issued by the European Parliament, the most recent of which dates back to September, have had no effect."
"Human rights are constantly disregarded and democracy remains an elusive utopia."
"The leader of the students' union, Hounjo Mawudzuro, has been imprisoned."
"Last August, the chairman of the main opposition party, Yawovi Agboyibo, was sentenced to six months in prison on fallacious grounds."
"New threats of legal action are hanging over him and President Eyadema will not release him unless he applies for a pardon."
"In fact only someone who is guilty can apply for a pardon and Yawovi Agboyibo is not guilty."
"His only crime is to have criticised the regime."
"He should be released unconditionally and be able to stand as a candidate in the parliamentary elections which are to be held next March."
"Democracy does not consist solely of holding elections."
"These are dependent on what happens upstream, and in particular on the rules stating who can vote and who can stand as a candidate, just as we saw in the past in Côte d'Ivoire and as we see today in Congo-Brazzaville."
"The European Parliament should strongly condemn these new developments and see to it that the elections run smoothly."
"Only if human rights are respected and the rule of law upheld will it be possible for normal cooperation relations between Togo and the European Union to be resumed."
"It is necessary to establish a dialogue with the regime and the opposition."
"This is why the Joint Parliamentary Assembly should send a mission to Togo to report on respect for human rights and the smooth running of the electoral process."
"Mr President, Commissioner Nielson, ladies and gentlemen, West Africa is in the process of structuring its cooperation in the form of a common market."
"It is creating common regional, economic and political structures."
"If everything goes according to plan, we shall be able to talk and hold discussions with parliamentarians from the new West African regional assembly of the regional parliament at next year's ACP assembly."
"We shall be able to organise our practical cooperation."
"But there are a few serious constraints, one of the most serious being the authoritarian regime of President Eyadéma in Togo."
"We are calling for the immediate release and restoration of the democratic rights of Yawowi Agboyibo, who was arbitrarily arrested and is now serving a six-month sentence which he has done nothing to deserve."
"Having served over five months of his sentence, the president should release him without further ado."
"We are not calling for a pardon."
"He did nothing wrong, he merely highlighted abuse in the system and he should be released from prison as quickly as possible."
"We are devastated that the attempt by our President, Nicole Fontaine, to meet President Eyadéma in Paris last week and ask him, as a favour, to arrange for this release, proved fruitless."
"Eyadéma is playing cat and mouse with us."
"We can no longer allow provision to be made for more development aid here."
"We support the Commission in suspending development aid."
"But we hope that we shall soon be able to provide further humanitarian aid for the people of Togo and we also hope that democratisation will continue next year, despite all the obstacles, and that it will be possible to hold parliamentary elections and then presidential elections a year later."
"We call on Eyadéma to put an end to this farce once and for all."
"The European Commission is concerned by the political climate in Togo."
"Though Mr Messan, a local journalist, and Mr Olympio, leader of an opposition party, have recently been released, Mr Agboyibo remains in prison."
"Recent reports suggest that more journalists have been arrested."
"The European Union has several times conveyed its concern about the political climate to the government of Togo."
"It made representations to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 17 August."
"On that occasion, the Union emphasised its desire that political parties and the media be able to operate freely."
"On 18 October, the Union issued a declaration reiterating its concerns, emphasising the importance it attaches to the freedom, openness and transparency of the electoral process and calling on President Eyadema to have Mr Agboyibo released."
"The Commission has taken note of the government's decision to schedule parliamentary elections for 10 and 24 March next year."
"The Commission has earmarked about EUR 1.56 million to help prepare the elections."
"The funding will pay for electoral equipment and the printing of ballot papers."
"The financing agreement has been signed, the first contracts concluded and the first deliveries received."
"The European Union has also accepted the invitation of Togo's Minister for Foreign Affairs to take part in the election observer mission."
"That participation could be coordinated by the United Nations, should it decide to take on that role."
"The conditions for organising and conducting the observer mission have yet to be established."
"The European Parliament is obviously very welcome to take part in the election observer mission."
"The Commission is, however, disappointed that the government has still not signed the memorandum of understanding required for the deployment of EU observers, and it is continuing to urge the government to sign promptly."
"The Commission continues to monitor political developments and respect for human rights closely, especially in view of the early parliamentary elections."
"It is ready to provide assistance for the preparation and conduct of the elections."
"The main objective of such assistance is to help the government establish the conditions for transparent, free and democratic elections that would enable the European Union to resume cooperation with Togo."
"We have still to note that cooperation with Togo, save of course for operations directly benefiting the vulnerable and weak part of the population, has been officially suspended since fruitless consultations with that country ended in the latter half of 1998."
"We hope change is possible, but this is a very difficult case."
"Winners of the Sakharov Prize: Aung San Suu Kyi and Leyla Zana"
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Aung San Suu Kyi and Leyla Zana are two Sakharov prize-winners who have never been able to come and receive their awards."
"We are all aware of this."
"They are also both female politicians."
"I wish - if you do not mind - to stress first of all the word female, because these two women are politicians in countries where it is very difficult to attain this rank and to break into this field."
"Gender equality amongst politicians is not either Turkey' s or Burma's strong point, as you know."
"If I say two female politicians, however, then I must also say that these are two women who have been elected."
"They have therefore been elected democratically and are the representatives of a nation, of a section of a nation, of a political movement in one case and a Kurdish minority in the other."
"In both cases, these are, at any rate, women who represent people other than themselves."
"I have to say that this is already a considerable achievement: they are women, they are politicians and they are elected."
"I must also add that these are two women who are courageous."
"This is not a moral judgement; it is a political judgement that I am making when I say that these two women are courageous."
"Why?"
"Because one of them renounced exile precisely because she was a representative of her people, and the other does not want to be released on health grounds because she is not the only one in prison and she represents a Kurdish minority; other militants are in prison too and she does not want the freedom which her captors are prepared to give her, or which she is said to have been offered because of her health."
"That is why it is important to stress that these two Sakharov prize-winners obviously ought to be received by our Parliament but also have their fundamental freedom restored to them."
"We should also recognise, however, not only that Articles 10 and 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights should apply to them, of course, but also that it is real-life democracy that is at stake here, and that in one case we are dealing with Turkey, a candidate country for accession to the European Union."
"I ask you: can we accept that the violation of fundamental rights is as important as this while at the same time agreeing to this country's cooperating with the European Union?"
"Mr President, this week we awarded the annual Sakharov Prize to three very worthy recipients who fight for peace and tolerance in an environment which is anything but peaceful and tolerant."
"The awarding of the Sakharov Prize is not only a grand ceremony but also an important demonstration, with echoes around the world. Hopefully, it also gives further courage to brave people coping with oppression and slavery."
"The prize is an expression of the basic values characterising EU foreign policy: respect for democracy and human rights throughout the world."
"Those who were awarded the prize last year live under difficult circumstances, but they live in peace."
"That is not so in the cases of two former recipients of the prize: Aung San Suu Kyi, who received the prize in 1990, and Leyla Zana, who received it in 1995."
"These two courageous women, both parliamentarians, have been kept locked up by their respective governments year after year, despite international pressure."
"Aung San Suu Kyi has been kept in solitary confinement and under house arrest for an unimaginably long time."
"It is eleven years since she was elected as her people' s legitimate leader."
"We have seen some softening of attitudes on the part of the Burmese regime."
"A small number of political prisoners have been released recently."
"That is not enough, however."
"Together with the other political prisoners in the country, Aung San Suu Kyi must be released immediately."
"Leyla Zana is held prisoner by a country that is applying for membership of the EU."
"I hope that Turkey will be able to play its part in this House one day."
"However, radical and genuine improvements are required in terms of human rights before we can even begin negotiating about membership."
"Leyla Zana and all the other political prisoners in Turkey must also be released."
"In this House, there is firm cross-party resolve to keep on reminding the world, including Burma and Turkey, of the fate of these two women and of the struggle for human rights, democracy and freedom of expression that they represent."
"I hope that the Commission can also talk about what it intends to do to ensure that next year is a year in which we help secure the release of these two women."
"Mr President, it is over ten years since Aung San Suu Kyi, the President of Burma elected by 80% of the population, received both the Nobel Prize and the Sakharov Prize for her peaceful protest against the military coup and the military dictatorship in her country."
"For ten years she has lived permanently either in prison or under house arrest, while her homeland has turned into one of the most violent countries on earth."
"Over half the members of parliament have fled, are in prison, have been driven into exile or have been killed, and several million Burmese have fled to India, Bangladesh, Thailand, Malaysia, the United States and Europe."
"In Burma wholesale repression is being carried out against the members of Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi' s party and members of minority groups."
"There is also use of forced labour in the construction of infrastructure, and meanwhile Burma has become the world' s second largest drugs exporting country after Bolivia."
"This military dictatorship is kept afloat by drugs, forced and cheap labour, terror and that situation has persisted for over ten years."
"Our question is again: European Commission, institute an investment embargo or an economic boycott against this country, as the United States has now done."
"It is perhaps the best punishment for this violent dictatorship and the best gift that you could give the elected president of Burma, Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi."
"My sympathy also goes out to Leyla Zana."
"It is not good for a country seeking to join the European Union to allow such an affair to drag on for so long."
"Let Turkey show that it wishes to be a country governed by the rule of law and that it wants to grant Leyla Zana as soon as possible a full place in its society and in the parliament to which she has been elected."
"Mr President, at a dinner in honour of this year' s Sakharov prizes the possibility of bringing all these prize winners together was once again spoken of."
"The two female winners face the same barrier: they are still without their freedom - Leyla Zana is in a Turkish prison and Aung San Suu Kyi is under house arrest in Burma."
"This is an intolerable situation and, at the same time, a reminder to us that human rights work needs not only to be celebrated but requires us to persevere and remain vigilant."
"Furthermore, as both women - in the eyes of their governments - are dangerous criminals, I cannot help asking myself whether Sakharov prize winner Nelson Mandela and the ANC led by him at the time would not seem to fit the definition of terrorism now being put together by the EU."
"Now, on hindsight, we opponents of apartheid are also being exposed as supporters of terrorism."
"We are in danger of forgetting that without conflict and social controversy, however heated and powerful, there can be no democracy."
"The right to different political views and their expression, as well as the legal protection of those suspected of crimes - even with just cause, perhaps - must be guaranteed to a far greater extent than is now the case at Laeken."
"Mr President, I have the floor for one minute."
"As you are the vice-president responsible for reforming Parliament's work, I shall try and give you an example of what one can sensibly say in one minute."
"All the groups are agreed."
"A famous Bavarian cabaret artist once said after visiting the Bavarian regional parliament, that now he knew what parliamentarianism was: 'Everything has already been said, but not yet by everybody' ."
"Which is why I do not intend to repeat what all the previous speakers have rightly and quite correctly said."
"All I wish to say is that I endorse the statements made by the previous speakers."
"They are right, it is an outrage that Mrs Sana and Mrs Zana and Mrs Suu Kyi cannot come and collect their prizes from us."
"That they are still being kept in unlawful detention, including by a country with aspirations to membership of the European Union, is unacceptable."
"Thank you for listening."
"I might just add to your comment that I was brought up to know that if you cannot say something in two minutes it is not worth saying."
"Mr President, it may sometimes be necessary to take more time to say less."
"Still, I must say what I had planned to say."
"We attach great importance to this."
"I would add that the activities of Parliament on matters such as this are important in themselves and also important to the way in which Europe is perceived both by Europeans and globally."
"The General Affairs Council, in the conclusions of its October meeting, called for the release of all remaining political prisoners in Burma including Aung San Suu Kyi."
"The Commission strongly supported - and continues to support - that call."
"It was ten years ago last Saturday that Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize."
"She is a past winner, of course, of the Sakharov Prize."
"She remains, today, a formidably powerful symbol of the principles those prizes represent, as she did before - an inspiration to her own people and to the world at large."
"I know how much support she enjoys in this House, support with which I want strongly to associate myself."
"It is a measure of both her courage and her commitment to non-violent action that Aung San Suu Kyi has decided to remain in her country under detention and to engage in discussions with the authorities responsible for that detention in order to pursue her goal of establishing democracy in her country."
"Her persistence, her passion and her wisdom have been instrumental in the positive developments that have occurred in Burma over the last year, even though it must be recalled that these developments are only the beginning of a process which needs to be further deepened and to evolve into a constructive and more concrete dialogue based on respect for internationally accepted standards of human rights."
"Therefore, while we salute Aung San Suu Kyi and assure her of our continued admiration and support, we also encourage the government to pursue this groundbreaking dialogue actively."
"We have already underlined the readiness of the European Union to consider positive measures in response to concrete results from the present talks."
"But we need to see these results, not least the early release of the many hundreds of political prisoners still held in Burmese jails."
"The case of Leyla Zana is very well known to the Commission, as stated in several Regular Reports on Turkey."
"The case has been a cause for concern raised with the Turkish authorities on many occasions."
"The Commission is aware that the case of Mrs Zana has been discussed many times at the European Parliament and has recently received renewed attention in the framework of the EP report on Turkey as well as during the EC-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee recently held in November."
"The Commission welcomes the renewed attention of the European Parliament to this case."
"In this context, as stated in the Regular Report for Turkey 2001, the Commission expects that Turkey will observe the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights of 17 July 2001 on the absence of a fair trial in this case."
"This would be a significant step by Turkey with respect to the actual implementation of the recent constitutional amendments whereby the right to a fair trial was explicitly guaranteed."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken today at 6.30 p.m."
"Nepal"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"(B5-0761/2001) by Collins, on behalf of the UEN Group;"
"(B5-0772/2001) by van den Berg and others, on behalf of the PSE Group;"
"(B5-0780/2001) by Vinci and Herman Schmid, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group;"
"(B5-0794/2001) by Malmström, on behalf of the ELDR Group;"
"(B5-0807/2001) by Thomas Mann, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;"
"(B5-0810/2001) by Messner and McKenna, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group;"
"on the situation in Nepal."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the developments in Nepal are worrying."
"I myself, who had planned to go there in the course of the next few months, have, for example, been advised against travelling."
"Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world, with only USD 220 in GDP per person per year."
"Children' s development in Nepal is extremely problematic."
"Fifty-four per cent of children under five are said to be too short of stature and to be affected by stunted growth because of poor nutrition."
"Illiteracy is another major problem."
"Sixty-three per cent of men can read, but only 28% of women."
"This trend continues where access to basic and higher education is concerned."
"That is why the Finnish section of UNICEF has launched one of its biggest projects, aimed at improving girls' schooling in Nepal, as well as at promoting village development."
"One other problem is the fact that education is extremely politicised."
"In spite of the unrest in the country, the project is nonetheless continuing both in Katmandu and outside the city."
"Those with whom I have talked say that the rebellion that has just taken place cannot be characterised simply as Maoist, but is a general trend."
"Certain people in this House believe that Nepal is in great danger of being partitioned in the same way as Tibet."
"Those I spoke to did not agree."
"We are also conscious that the unrest in the country has been caused by the fact that the population really does not have any confidence in the person who took over following the tragic events within the royal family last summer."
"This lack of confidence is partly due to the fact that senior members of the royal family are suspected of also having been guilty of murders other than those which occurred last summer."
"Our view is that there are serious threats to human rights, freedom of the press and other traditional freedoms, and this is something to which we must be alert."
"Other developments in the country must, however, continue."
"Mr President, the Maoist rebels in Nepal have unilaterally revoked the ceasefire and there have been 250 deaths within a few days as a result."
"This is the latest painful chapter in the history of this young democracy."
"The escalation in violence has claimed over 2 500 lives in less than six months."
"Policemen have been killed indiscriminately, bombs have been set off in the centre of Katmandu and innocent people have forfeited their lives."
"The Maoist rebellion evokes the risk of civil war, which would obviously be supported by the Communists in China."
"The economic damage is huge; the number of tourists to Nepal, who alone represent the main source of income, dwindled to 24 000 last month, about 40% fewer than last year."
"So far, the international community has looked on passively."
"With the proclamation of a state of emergency and the deployment of the military for the first time, all that has suddenly changed."
"India has said it will support Nepal with helicopters and night-vision equipment and the United States is considering sending in troops."
"However, political measures must take precedence."
"We call on the rebels to lay down their arms and return to the negotiating table."
"In any case, they will not achieve one of their aims, which is to overthrow the constitutional monarchy."
"I have visited this country regularly for the last seven years and I know full well that the overwhelming majority are in favour of these government reforms, irrespective of their religious or other affiliations."
"King Gyanendra deserves our full support."
"He has recognised the Nepalese constitution and is continuing in his brother's footsteps on the path towards democracy and the rule of law."
"But we call on the government and the parties to get on with economic and structural reform at long last and to fight corruption consistently."
"The people deserve proper measures to fight poverty."
"Commissioner, the European Union has supported Nepal to the tune of EUR 120 million over the last ten years."
"I have seen many of these projects with my own eyes."
"They are excellent."
"We are one of Nepal's most important partners and can therefore bring our full influence to bear as an honest broker."
"To put things in a less black-and-white way, Mr President, a state of emergency has been decreed, and it is correct that the Maoists have sabotaged the negotiations, but the rule of law is meanwhile being undermined."
"We do not know how many victims are being claimed."
"The helicopters shoot from the air and the press has been muzzled, In Nepal there is both terror and counter-terror."
"Child soldiers are being recruited, and I wonder whether this will provide a solution in a country that wishes to avoid civil war but where 12% of the population owns 95% of the property and holds 70% of the power and where, furthermore, corruption reigns supreme."
"The Maoists have meanwhile occupied part of the country."
"Real political, yet peaceful, change is required, and that end requires the consent not only of the rebels, but also of hard-liners in the regime."
"On behalf our group we should like to ask the Commission to address itself to its paper on conflict prevention together with the Lagendijk report that we have approved only today."
"We must be able to bring about peace negotiations and to that end exert pressure on all parties at home and abroad."
"The Commission shares Parliament's concern on the deterioration of the situation in Nepal."
"We also had placed great hopes in the negotiations started three months ago by the Deuba government."
"From their contacts with the Royal Nepalese Government, EU representatives in Kathmandu had drawn the conclusion that Mr Deuba was genuinely committed to finding a lasting peace with the Maoist guerrillas in order to be able to focus action on the country's considerable development needs."
"The reasons why the negotiations collapsed are not entirely clear, but the Maoist factions first broke the cease-fire."
"The Commission agrees that there is a risk that the country is drifting towards civil war."
"It also fears that the current state of emergency may jeopardise a fragile democracy already undermined by years of political instability and corruption."
"The EU has promptly condemned the new wave of violence and launched an appeal in favour of restoration of peace and law and order."
"The Commission is currently preparing its cooperation strategy for the next five years."
"Under the current circumstances, consolidation of democracy, conflict prevention and poverty eradication will be the primary objectives of its new strategy for Nepal."
"The EU-Nepal political dialogue should be continued and further strengthened while cooperation targets should include promotion of development initiatives in the most deprived areas of the country, to counteract the frustrations and resentment of local people."
"In all its present and future cooperation activities the EU will constantly and carefully monitor the situation, including security aspects that might jeopardise its development cooperation."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m."
"The Congo"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"(B5-0773/2001) by van den Berg and Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, on behalf of the PSE Group;"
"(B5-0781/2001) by Sylla and Miranda, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group;"
"(B5-0785/2001) by Maes and Rod, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group;"
"(B5-0795/2001) by van den Bos and Dybkjær, on behalf of the ELDR Group;"
"(B5-0808/2001) by Johan Van Hecke and Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;"
"on the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo."
"A minute' s speaking time is not much to deal with 52 million people and three million dead, Mr President, but I shall try."
"The riches of the country are being plundered by friend and foe alike. For example, the coltran that we use in our mobile phones and military equipment is being mined and exploited by the Rwandans in the Kivu, to their own advantage."
"That means hundreds of thousands of dollars of profit for the Rwandan war chest, and what do we do with our policy of double standards?"
"We support the Lusaka peace process and we demand the withdrawal of foreign troops and the promotion of inter-Congolese dialogue."
"But why should Rwanda abandon these spoils of war and withdraw to the borders in order to guard the security of those borders if that should be necessary?"
"Rwanda continues to occupy the Kivu and profit from its occupation and we support Rwanda with many hundreds of thousands of euros."
"We want an inter-Congolese dialogue, but do we really expect that the representatives coming to that dialogue from occupied territory will speak as Congolese, or as Rwandans?"
"In Kinshasa they think the latter."
"Meanwhile we are supporting Rwanda and should like to ask: why do we not support the DRC?"
"Must the people of Congo really all die of hunger before we come up with a structural programme?"
"Mrs Maes, it is up to your political group to decide which issues it spends its time on."
"It is not up to us."
"Mr President, the Democratic Republic of Congo is neither democratic nor a republic."
"It is a country with fertile land, vast mineral wealth, populated by people who are poor, sick and starving."
"These people have been plundered by cruel and corrupt dictators who continue to enrich themselves."
"Soldiers from neighbouring countries such as Rwanda and Congo continue to loot, rape and kill civilians at random."
"Villages and towns are destroyed."
"Over 2 million people have been killed and 1 million people live in fear in refugee camps."
"The UN passed resolution 1376 on 7 November 2001. It advocates disarmament and demobilisation, repatriation, resettlement and reintegration of armed groups."
"These measures are essential."
"How are they going to be implemented?"
"Who will lead this action?"
"The EU, the USA or the UN?"
"Or will this be yet another UN resolution for filing in some dusty cabinet."
"Last month I attended in Ghana a conference of African politicians."
"A veteran politician from DRC was there."
"He had had great difficulty in leaving the DRC, and this is what he asked me: how can African countries like the DRC be free from governments run by crooked dictators?"
"I could not answer."
"He asked a second question. Do we need to breed terrorists who will attack Europe and the USA to precipitate effective action like in Afghanistan?"
"I could not answer that either."
"Let us make sure that we take action before poor people become so desperate."
"Let me first of all remind Members of Parliament of the fact that we are the biggest provider of humanitarian aid in the DRC this year - EUR 35 million in ECHO funded activities and some EUR 10 million from other sources."
"The EUR 10 million are going to basic healthcare in the government-controlled part and the EUR 35 million to the eastern part where no-one else is doing anything like this."
"Actually disbursing EUR 45 million for these purposes in the circumstances there is quite an achievement, and I am very proud of it on behalf of the many people working there, many of them still in very dangerous circumstances."
"However, we have spared no effort over the last years to support the peace processes at work in the Great Lakes region."
"We have been active in the region throughout its disastrous recent history."
"Whenever we could, we have used our different cooperation instruments to help ease the suffering of the people there."
"We have also used all our influence to push for a durable peace in the region."
"I would now like to go into more detail on the Lusaka peace process."
"We support it not only politically - the Commission has already funded the Lusaka negotiations by a grant of EUR 2.65 million from the SADC regional programme."
"The logistic of the Joint Military Commission surveying the cease-fire was financed by CFSP budget-line to the amount of EUR 1.2 million."
"The facilitation of the Inter-Congolese Dialogue has been financed by a grant of EUR 2.34 million from EDF monies, and we are considering EUR 1 million further financing from Rapid Reaction Mechanism budget line, which would provide for the implementation of the meeting of the Inter-Congolese Dialogue in January in South Africa."
"We are making a meaningful contribution to all these endeavours."
"Nevertheless the Commission is concerned about the lack of concrete results following the talks in the framework of the Inter-Congolese Dialogue that took place in Addis Ababa on 15-19 October."
"The most difficult issues for the country' s future are still to be addressed."
"The Commission welcomes the announcement made by facilitator Masire concerning the resumption of the dialogue in South Africa at the end of January/beginning of February 2002."
"The Commission has always been supportive of the Congo."
"We are the largest, as I mentioned before, supplier of humanitarian aid as well as one of the few donors that have remained active in the country throughout recent years."
"However, the Commission considers that the DRC' s stability and sustainable development will not be ensured until all parties to the Dialogue have clearly committed themselves to the establishment of and participation in one political system."
"This is the core of it."
"Do they see themselves as participants and players in one political system?"
"Without a clear yes to this, it is very difficult to help the country from the outside."
"There are the other issues of external forces at play."
"These are real problems, but if we do not see a credible answer to this question emerging, nothing else will ever work."
"So all these things have to be addressed in some sort of balanced overall approach."
"When this political commitment is made, of course, we will have a much better basis for getting an effective cooperation programme up and running."
"What I want to do is to be able to sign - and this is what we are planning - the National Indicative Programme in January in the context of the resumption of the Inter-Congolese Dialogue."
"This is the line we have defined in the Commission."
"The other activities linked to peace process implementation, i.e. demobilisation and the creation of a new basis for the life of ex-combatants, will be implemented following progress in the field."
"I would like to stress that the Commission' s action in the Great Lakes is only part of a wide and sustained effort to enhance the EU's overall political presence as a partner in Africa."
"With the Cotonou Agreement, the Union has confirmed that it had no intention of reducing our long-standing cooperation in Africa and the EUR 15 billion envelope that we have outlined and will commit over the next five years clearly demonstrates this determination."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m."
"New European Labour Markets, Open to All, with Access for All"
"The next item is the report (A5-0375/2001) by Mauro Nobilia, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission communication on New European Labour Markets, Open to All, with Access for All (COM(2001) 116 - C5-0188/2001 - 2001/2084(COS)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is rather strange not to have the rapporteur here but I should like to congratulate him, nonetheless, because the PSE supports his report and will accept it as it stands."
"We also support the Commission communication, although we take the view that listing current obstacles and postponing legislative proposals is not good enough."
"We hope that the relevant proposals and an efficient action plan will be submitted to us at the spring summit."
"One criticism we have is that the skills shortages proposed or, rather, identified in the high-tech sector are of course not good enough."
"As Socialists, we want to give all employees the chance to benefit from mobility and to increase mobility on the European labour markets."
"But we have to offer them these chances."
"The new labour market should not be open just to small, special groups; it must be open to every employee in Europe."
"Hence we need creative ideas and solutions from the Commission, not just a list of the problems."
"We also need a detailed investigation of possible malfunctions on the labour market in border regions or in specific sectors, such as the building and transport industries."
"Last but not least, we also need an analysis and a debate of the results of the school system in Europe because, unfortunately, not every country in Europe has done as well as it should."
"Mrs Weiler, I propose writing to Mr Nobilia saying that it really is a great rudeness to the House and to the committee that he represents, for him to not be here."
"Mr President, I welcome Parliament's report on the Commission's communication on new European labour markets."
"It is a very useful input to the preparation of the action plan on skills and mobility announced in that communication."
"I would also like to thank the rapporteur, maybe in writing, for his efforts and for the overview reflecting the contributions made by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, as well as the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee."
"In its communication the Commission proposes three strands of action to further improve operation of the labour markets: firstly removing skills barriers and tackling skills gaps, secondly removing barriers to mobility, and thirdly improving information and transparency."
"The High-Level Task Force on Skills and Mobility, which was set up on a proposal from the Commission following the Stockholm European Council, will soon recommend a set of additional policy initiatives at EU and national levels to open the new European labour markets to all by 2005."
"Its report will be submitted to the Commission in December this year, on the basis of which the Commission will present an action plan to the Barcelona Council in spring 2002."
"The rapporteur met the chairman and members of the task force at their most recent meeting, when Parliament's draft opinion had already been forwarded to the task force."
"It provided a timely opportunity for the task force to take account of your draft report in its deliberations."
"The action plan will propose a set of policy initiatives, taking the form of a framework for action, to be transposed into more concrete legal texts, programmes or initiatives, in which not only the Member States, but also the social partners, regional and local authorities and other relevant organisations will be involved."
"Let me now react more specifically to a number of the main points made by the rapporteur in his explanatory statement."
"First of all, he suggests the effective involvement of the social partners in the representative bodies."
"I agree that this is a positive feature of improving industrial relations, which would help the operation of the labour markets."
"But we also have to bear in mind that the dynamics of the labour market should not reduce access to these for people who have until now been excluded from these new developments."
"I share the objective of involving social partners more in the national action plans."
"Secondly, he recommends the establishment of an agreement on the fiscal package to reduce disparities between Member States."
"There are still important differences in the tax treatment of individuals and enterprises between the Member States, but it would go beyond the scope of the Commission's action plan to present specific proposals in this area."
"Thirdly, he also proposes greater regional and local participation in drafting the national action plans."
"This proposal is to be welcomed, particularly since the employment guidelines specifically encourage this."
"Fourthly, he recommends better access by local and regional bodies to research opportunities in the Sixth Framework Programme."
"I recognise that improving the situation of disadvantaged regions and areas through research investment is part of the process of building up skills and human capital, which will help bring jobs to such regions."
"Finally, he proposes the creation of a common legal base for the third - the non-profit - sector."
"It seems to me that this requires more analysis and careful thought, in order to avoid putting unnecessary constraints on a sector which has an important potential for job creation."
"To conclude, l should like to thank Parliament once again for this report, for its input into the Commission's Action Plan, and for its support for further opening up of the European labour markets."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m."
"Language diversity"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions to the Commission:"
"(B5-0537/01) by Eluned Morgan and Barbara O'Toole, on behalf of the PSE Group, on minority languages."
"(B5-0753/01) by Eurig Wyn and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group on language diversity."
"Mr President, I am pleased to see that you have changed the title of this debate: it is about regional and lesser-used languages."
"I welcome the fact that we are discussing this at all."
"This is the first time in eight years that lesser-used languages have been discussed in this House."
"It is appropriate that we discuss it now at the end of the European Year of Languages."
"The fact that we have not discussed this reflects the problems that are faced by lesser-used language communities in terms of their relationship with the EU."
"The legal base of the budget line is being challenged by the Council."
"We have put money on this line this year and we expect the Commission to spend that money."
"We do not want any legal wranglings about that."
"I hope that Members will vote on the amendments we have also put forward to the joint resolution."
"We are asking for a programme to follow up the European Year of Languages where we would also hope to see earmarking for lesser-used languages."
"We also want to see earmarking money for lesser-used languages within relevant existing programmes."
"This would formalise the procedure which already exists for example in the structural funds where structural funds are used to prop up lesser-used languages in some areas."
"It would simply formalise that procedure."
"We also want to see culture on a majority voting basis within the Council so that the Commission can present a programme specifically on lesser-used languages which I know the Commission has already."
"These are not radical proposals."
"I do not know why some Groups are resisting this and not supporting the 40 million people within the EU who speak lesser-used languages."
"But I hope this will be a first step and we will see an own-initiative report on this in future."
"I wish you: Nadolig Llawen a Blwyddyn Newydd Dda - a Happy Christmas and a Happy New Year."
"Mr President, as my colleague Mrs Morgan has stressed, more than 40 million European citizens speak autochthonous languages, other than the main official language of the state in which they live."
"Languages are an integral part of Europe's linguistic and cultural diversity."
"They lie at the heart of the fundamental rights of its citizens and are a key factor in the creation of a peaceful and democratic Europe."
"I welcome this long-awaited resolution and urge colleagues to support it as it will be an excellent platform for the future."
"The European Year of Languages has been a successful year and it included many projects for Europe's regional and lesser-used languages, contrary to the expectations of many of us."
"The recent Council decision emphasises that, 'all European languages are equal in value and dignity from the cultural point of view'."
"Although the Council's decision does not refer specifically to regional and lesser-used languages, it does not exclude them either."
"This is why I particularly support the amendments referring to the mainstreaming of programmes and I am calling for support for a multiannual programme by 2003."
"This is a golden opportunity to direct this agenda for the future and in preparation for enlargement."
"We must ensure that Article 22 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights is on the agenda of the next Intergovernmental Conference and that we also push for qualified majority voting in Council."
"Let us work together to ensure that regional and lesser-used languages are here to stay and remain part of the culturally diverse Europe of the future."
"Europe's unique richness is its diversity."
"Let us ensure that we all protect this."
"Just a personal comment at the outset."
"My spokesman does not speak Danish."
"I do not have the option of having Danish as the working language in my cabinet."
"The flow of work would simply choke."
"I am not speaking Danish here today - that is not an option really."
"I would have to do the translation on my way to the Chamber, having got the material the same day."
"I could, but honestly, in my personal opinion, if we are serious about European integration, we have to be prepared to swallow our pride occasionally in order to do things in an effective manner."
"The theme of this discussion, in my view, is different."
"It has to do with stimulating the diversity that exists out there, and that is, in fact, another discussion."
"Here, the Year of Languages is drawing to a close, but it is not quite over yet and many activities are still in progress."
"Of the 200-odd projects that are co-financed by the Commission, most are still running and many events will take place throughout Europe in the remaining weeks of the year."
"The evaluation of the Year will get under way this month."
"The Commission considers that the end of 2001 should not be the end of the European Year of Languages initiative."
"A report will be presented to the other European Institutions by 31 December 2002 at the latest, in accordance with the provisions of Article 11 of Decision No 1934/2000/EC establishing the European Year of Languages 2001."
"Furthermore, on 29 November of this year, the Council adopted an important resolution on the promotion of linguistic diversity and language learning."
"It invites the Commission to present proposals for actions to promote linguistic diversity and language learning by early 2003."
"Linguistic diversity is a defining characteristic of the European Union, and regional and minority languages, alongside the many other languages used in Europe are a key feature of it."
"Regional and minority languages will therefore be taken into account both in the report that the Commission will present to the other institutions in the course of 2002 and in the proposals for actions to be presented in 2003."
"However, it is still too early to say what specific actions will be taken in this domain."
"As stated in Article 22 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Union respects cultural, religious and linguistic diversity in its various programmes and activities."
"Many, like Socrates, Leonardo da Vinci, Culture 2000, Media Plus, e-Content or the European Regional Development Fund, are already providing funding opportunities for regional and minority languages and cultures."
"We support these efforts which have to have a very broad aim in order to have the effect we intended."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome today's debate."
"I am delighted that we are holding it at the end of the European Year of Languages, because we have tried several times during the course of this year to persuade the Commission to do something about lesser-used languages."
"The Commission's standard response has been that it was not doing anything because it wanted to devise a special programme next year."
"Now we hear that the Commission does not intend to do anything about lesser-used languages."
"In this respect I am glad that this question is on today's agenda."
"I am sorry that some joker has taken the liberty of changing the title of the resolution."
"We are not talking about language diversity, we are talking about the lesser-used languages, which is why I am also rather sorry, Commissioner Nielson, that you chose not to honour a lesser-used language by speaking Danish."
"It is not a question of pride, it is a question of respect for the diversity of European languages, of which Danish is one."
"I am all for talking about it, I am all for talking more about it, I am all for the Commission's doing something about it."
"But I must say to you in all honesty that the text before us today has been thrown together, it is slapdash and flippant and I, for one, am not proud of it."
"I am sorry, but it has to be said."
"We could have done a much better job if we had had more time, which is why our group does not support all the proposed amendments."
"I think that Article 3 is better than Amendment No 4."
"Why should I agree to your proposed amendment when our article in the resolution is better than your proposed amendment?"
"We mean the same thing."
"We just need less flippancy here."
"On another question, all of us here in the House - including me personally - are in favour of qualified majority voting on cultural affairs."
"But we should walk before we insist on running."
"We can only run once we have learned to walk, which is why we must keep a sense of reason and hope that Laeken prompts something in the convention to bring this about."
"Finally, I should like to say that we in the European People's Party are ready to suggest an own initiative report on lesser-used languages at the next meeting of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport."
"This will allow all those who have spoken so fulsomely in favour today to put their money where their mouth is."
"I for one would be delighted if we dumped this resolution today because it is not as good as an own initiative report could be."
"I assume that the Socialists will want no part of it, so we shall see how it all turns out."
"But I should like to inform the House that we shall be putting in for a report."
"Please tell your fellow members to vote with us then next year."
"Mr President, the approval of the resolution on regional and minority languages will provide a fitting end to the European Year of Languages."
"It is satisfying for me and for other Catalan Members: Obiols i Germà, Terrón i Cusí, Colom i Naval, Jové, Mayol, Gasòliba i Böhm and Ferrer."
"It is very positive that a resolution is recognising the equal value and dignity of all European languages and urging the Commission and Council to act decisively in this field and to find a permanent legal basis."
"We regret that our initial proposal, which called for full recognition, has not been accepted."
"This resolution demonstrates an unacceptable situation: the fact that the European Union, which derives its wealth from its diversity, should have so many European languages seeking a legal basis in order to be supported is - I repeat - regrettable."
"Yesterday, a report requested by the Research Directorate-General and presented to the Intergroup on minority languages reflected these difficulties."
"My language, Catalan, is one of these languages."
"It is the seventh language when compared to the eleven official languages and the ninth when compared to the 22 languages following enlargement."
"A recent conversation I had with my friend and fellow MEP, Mr Sakellariou will demonstrate the situation."
"I said to him: Jannis, the language you speak with your parents - Greek - can be spoken in this House; the language you use with your countrymen - German - can be used in this House; the one you use with your wife - Spanish - can be used in this House."
"The language I use with my parents, in my work and my life and which I use with my wife not only cannot be used in this House, but we are seeking a legal basis so that it can be supported."
"You will understand that my only objective here is the recognition of Catalan as an official language of the European Union."
"This hope is better expressed by my friend, the poet Jordi Gabarró."
"He says in Catalan: ""Demà, en un futur de convivència, la raó ha de guanyar""."
"Mr President, Commissioner, when this House debated language diversity and lesser-used languages for the first time at the beginning of the 1980s, your predecessor, Commissioner Nielson, said a few sentences in Welsh and, although we did not understand a word, we rejoiced in this declaration of the cultural diversity of Europe."
"In this respect, I should like to say to you that our vision of Europe is not a technocratic, bureaucratic or economic project; for us, Europe is, first and foremost, a cultural project, the language diversity of which deserves to be safeguarded."
"That includes your mother tongue, Mr President, the English language, because we need to guard against a standard global language which, if it were to be called English, would be an insult to Shakespeare."
"Even the main languages of the European Union, such as French, which is also one of the UN official languages, Spanish, which is one of the up-and-coming world languages and was officially used for the first time in the American electoral campaign and will soon become the second language of the USA, and German, which is the mother tongue of the majority of the inhabitants of the EU, are now minority languages."
"Our former fellow member Siegbert Alber once said that in Europe we are all minorities."
"But our main concern is - of course - to safeguard the lesser-used languages which are official languages but, more to the point, to safeguard the languages which are the subject of today's debate, namely the lesser-used languages which are not official languages of the EU, but which need our massive support."
"Unfortunately, we cannot even introduce them as official languages in our committees."
"That would probably be asking too much."
"But we must do all we can to safeguard the regional and lesser-used languages of the European Union."
"Because, taken together, the people who make up national minorities are already the second largest nationality in today's European Union - never mind tomorrow's - after the Germans and before the French."
"That gives you an idea of the quantitative dimension of this issue, and if you then look at the qualitative dimension of the nationality problems in the Balkans and elsewhere, then minorities are obviously set to become either the mortar or the explosive in the foundations of Europe."
"We are fighting for them to become the mortar of Europe, which is why we support the lesser-used languages."
"Mr President, thank you for the debate, to which I listened with great interest."
"I do not, however, think I need add anything else, irrespective of which language I might wish to use."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 5.50 p.m. and resumed at 6.30 p.m.)"
"Vote"
"We will now proceed to the vote."
"The next item is the vote on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"During the vote on Amendment No 2 to the joint resolution on Immigration in Ireland:"
"Mr President, I want to remove the second part of the amendment because apparently a lot of people would support the first part, but not the second part."
"To make it easier for people to support it we have removed the second part."
"Mr President, I fully support our friend's request, given that if we put the amendment to the vote as it stands some Members may well abstain, and this is after all a very important matter."
"If then it is necessary actually to delete the second part we will do so."
"It is a pity, but that is the way it is."
"In any case, I should like to thank you for your proposal."
"Report (A5-0426/2001) by Pat the Cope Gallagher, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for in the Agreement on cooperation in the sea fisheries sector between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania for the period 1 August 2001 to 31 July 2006 (COM(2001) 590 - C5-0555/2001 - 2001/0246(CNS))."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Report (A5-0405/2001) by Patricia McKenna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the role of flags of convenience in the fisheries sector (2000/2302(INI))."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0381/2001) by Mrs Lulling, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the Commission report on the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1221/97 laying down general rules for the application of measures to improve the production and marketing of honey (COM(2001) 70 - C5-0398/2001 - 2001/2156(COS))."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0375/2001) by Mauro Nobilia, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission communication on New European Labour Markets, Open to All, with Access for All (COM(2001) 116 - C5-0188/2001 - 2001/2084(COS)."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"President."
"We now come to the vote on the joint resolution on linguistic diversity."
"The title is not correct."
"It should be a resolution on regional and lesser-used languages and I hope that this will be corrected."
"If the title is going to be changed, then let us do it properly."
"It should read ""the lesser-used languages in the European Union"". European languages, not any old languages!"
"I do not agree."
"There are languages which are not spoken by many people but which are nevertheless national languages, such as Luxemburgish."
"This is not a minority language; it may become one as a result of immigration, but it is not a minority language."
"Admittedly it is not widely spoken, but this proposal is unacceptable."
"Colleagues, we appear to have a difficulty."
"The wording in the joint resolution, which was agreed by everybody who was party to the joint resolution, is regional and lesser-used languages. That is what is used throughout the document."
"Mr President, lesser-used European languages is correct."
"Is that acceptable to the House?"
"Regional and lesser-used languages of the European Union."
"Colleagues, the proposal now is ""regional and lesser-used languages in the European Union""."
"Mr President, forgive me but, initially, in the meetings aimed at reaching a consensus, the title we agreed on was 'regional and lesser-used' ."
"But furthermore, Mrs Pack, there is another problem with your proposal: if we only talk about the 'lesser-used' , my language would simply not be included since it is not 'lesser-used' , but regional."
"Therefore, firstly, that is what we agreed on, and secondly, to be precise, we must say 'regional and least-used' because that is what we are talking about."
"There is no other option."
"Mr Esteven, we do have the word ""regional"" right at the beginning."
"I want the original version with 'European' in between - regional and lesser-used European languages."
"'Regional and lesser-used European languages' ."
"Is that acceptable?"
"Mr President, I should like to put another oral amendment to the vote, which needs to be voted on first."
"Recital C in the German version reads: ""Whereas 14 million Union citizens regularly use a regional or lesser-used language and whereas there are more than 60 linguistic communities in Europe."""
"This should read ""in the Union"", not ""in Europe"". In Europe there are about 300."
"(Parliament adopted the joint resolution) President."
"That concludes the vote."
"- McKenna report (A5-0405/2001)"
"Mr President, perhaps Mrs McKenna will be worried if I say that as my name is Fatuzzo I cannot help mentioning the austromerluzzo, the toothfish, which is the victim of illegal fishing under flags of convenience in the seas of Patagonia."
"To save her from worrying I shall say that I voted in favour."
"I think, however, it is time the Galileo project was approved, through which it will be possible to see from satellites where the illegal fishing vessels are, when they increase in weight from their cargo, and therefore when and where they carried out the illegal fishing."
"In this way it really will be possible to control the phenomenon."
"Gallagher report (A5-0426/2001)"
"Mr President, on page 15 of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets we read that appropriations of EUR 86 million are being devoted to assistance for Mauritania: assistance for research, for fisheries, for developing statistics, for rescue services at sea, for fishing licences, for the costs of organising seminars and meetings, for the development of regional fishing; but I do not, Mr President, see any entry with the title 'assistance to the pensioners of Mauritania, assistance for speeding up the payment of contributions and for having occupational pensions for fishermen' ."
"I did vote for this document, but I hope that when we next vote on provisions for Mauritania, there will also be assistance provided for the pensioners of that country."
"- (PT) I would like to express my support for the new fisheries protocol concluded between the European Community and Mauritania for the period 1 August 2001 to 31 July 2006, which I deem of vital importance to the European Community, not only because of the fishing opportunities it offers and the sums involved, but mainly for socio-economic reasons, since it enables a large number of vessels operating in Moroccan waters to move to new fishing grounds."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Gallagher, the rapporteur, on his work. I support the conclusions set out in the report in the explanatory statement."
"Lastly, with regard to Amendment No 4 (Article 3b), I would like to point out that the Council only grants a negotiating mandate to the Commission for the purpose of concluding new fisheries agreements and not for the renewal of implementation protocols, since the latter do not alter the substance of the framework agreement."
"I also advocate the redrafting of the rapporteur' s proposal in order to make it consistent with Community law in force on this subject."
"Nobilia report (A5-0375/2001)"
"Mr President, I voted for the report by Mr Nobilia, which is concerned with increasing employment in Europe."
"How could I not have done so?"
"I must stress, however, that to achieve this result it would be important to set up a single European Internet site that gathered together all job requests and offers from all 15 States in the Union."
"It would be essential to have a single European second language, because one cannot move about in the European Union without knowing at least one language in common with all other Europeans, in addition to one' s own language, and lastly one cannot move freely if there is not a single European pension."
"You cannot have 15 different pension contributions, paid by 15 different European countries if you have worked in all 15 Member States."
"We must have a single European pension."
"- UK Conservatives welcome the principle of labour markets being open to all, with access to all, as central to the Single Market."
"However, we have voted against paragraph 15 of the Nobilia report, as the idea of setting up a European framework of incomes policy and social security cuts directly into Member States' competences."
"We have encouraged colleagues from other parties and groups to follow our lead in rejecting this particular suggestion while supporting the report overall."
"Lulling report (A5-0381/2001)"
"Mrs Lulling, what can be sweeter than honey?"
"What can be more nutritious than honey?"
"There must be a reason for saying 'honeymoon' !"
"Mrs Lulling, honey is also the nectar of the gods."
"When climbing Mount Olympus I stopped to taste the Olympian honey, the honey of the gods of Greece."
"How, then, could anyone vote against this document, which seeks to improve the production of honey in Europe and help beekeepers produce larger and more profitable quantities of this nectar of the gods?"
"I hope that next year, before we come back to this House, all of we Members will be supplied with just the right amount to keep our brains fresher and our bodies in better condition for the long hours of voting and also Mr Fatuzzo' s further explanations of vote."
"Finally, a merry Christmas and a happy New Year to the interpreters, to all those who work longer hours because of my explanations of vote, and to you, Mr President, in particular."
"Resolution on linguistic diversity"
"Mr President, I just wanted to say that, like my fellow Member Bernd Posselt, I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution out of conviction."
"We also took the view that this motion for a resolution and this resolution could have been formulated in rounder, more comprehensive terms, with a broader platform, and we are sorry that this was not the case."
"Nonetheless, it is a step in the right direction and we hope that the plenary sittings and the committee responsible will not just discuss the issue of lesser-used languages, regional languages and minority languages in the Year of Languages, but will take a specific, targeted and positive approach to this problem in general, so that the problems which have arisen in the past from majorities or minorities remain a thing of the past and positive solutions to these problems can be found."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament and wish you all a happy Christmas."
"(The sitting was closed at 6.55 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of the sitting of Thursday 13 December 2001 have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, I have a question concerning the complete report of the meetings: last Wednesday evening Vice-President Onesta announced that a vote would be held on Thursday morning on an urgent debate on the European arrest warrant."
"However, on Thursday morning, Mr Watson, chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, asked the plenary meeting to vote on an urgent debate on - I quote now from the complete report - ""two framework decisions from the Council, one on combating terrorism, the other on a proposal for a European arrest warrant"" ."
"Confusion abounds."
"It proves in particular that last Thursday' s decision was taken too hastily and carelessly."
"Can you explain to me, on the basis of the complete report of the meetings, on which topics precisely we are to hold an urgent debate?"
"And since we are on the subject of clarification, can you also assure me that the text on the European arrest warrant on which we could submit amendments up to 4 p.m. last Thursday is still the same text and was not changed last weekend?"
"If that were the case, we would again be making incredible fools of ourselves today."
"In answer to your question, Mrs Buitenweg, the subject is solely the European arrest warrant."
"(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved)"
"Announcement by the President"
"As you know, this is practically the last time that I will have the honour of presiding over this House."
"I am pleased to be able to do so on the occasion of this Conference of Presidents, where Mr Verhofstadt, the President-in-Office of the Council, will give us his account of the Laeken Summit and of a Belgian Presidency that has been particularly outstanding."
"I am not going to make a speech."
"I would just like to say a few words to once again sincerely thank you for the confidence you placed in me when, on 20 July 1999, you elected me President of the European Parliament."
"I took on this role with determination, with passion and with an overriding desire to accurately reflect the beliefs and the positions of the majority in this House to the greatest extent possible."
"In this regard, I would like to tell you that I have always been able to feel proud of the European Parliament."
"If I may, I would like to thank in particular the Secretary-General, Mr Julian Priestley, and all those working here who have helped me with their extraordinary degree of motivation and friendship."
"I thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for the unfaltering support you have given me, and I would hope that my successor can enjoy a Presidency that is as active and happy as that I have had the fortune to experience myself."
"(Loud applause) Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you, from the bottom of my heart."
"(The House gave the President a standing ovation)"
"Madam President, allow me first and foremost, in my role as President-in-Office of the European Council, to show my gratitude, and also my admiration, for your Presidency."
"Under your guidance, the European Parliament has accomplished an impressive political and legislative career."
"You yourself have carried out the work of a pioneer, both externally and in the EU itself."
"Well before the start of the crisis in Afghanistan, you drew our attention to this issue, and you had already embarked upon the fight for the improvement of the situation of women in this country."
"Your role in the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights should not be underestimated, and this is an issue of relevance to all European citizens."
"At Laeken, we once again used the model for a Convention of which you, personally, were one of the architects."
"In many respects, you have prepared the European Parliament for the new phase that is opening up in inter-institutional relations."
"Lastly, I would also like thank you most warmly for the excellent degree of cooperation that has been apparent between Parliament and the Council during both our Presidencies."
"Thank you very much."
"Madam President, I too would like to express my deepest admiration for your work and my sincerest appreciation of the results achieved during your term as President of the European Parliament."
"These have been extremely important years which have seen the launching of the key debates for the future of the Union."
"You have played an extremely active, diligent and committed part in all this, constantly remaining open to the demands of the European public and the needs of us all."
"Both Parliament, therefore, as we have just seen, and the Commission too are grateful to you for your constant, effective endeavours."
"At this time, I would like to make particular mention of your great sensitivity, evident in your constant rejection of any form of violence, especially terrorist violence."
"Your speeches, Madam President, have been moderate in tone but clear and incisive in substance, and they have encouraged and sustained all the democratic Europeans in their fight for peaceful coexistence amongst their citizens."
"I wish you every success in the future, which I am sure you will spend in the service of the European cause for which you have done so much in the past two and a half years."
"Thank you, Madam President."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, today is the day for saying some very, very warm words of thanks to our President, Nicole Fontaine, who is from our group, for discharging her duties over the last two and a half years - as she herself has just said - with such passion."
"Madam President, you are one of a distinguished line which includes Louise Weiss and Simone Veil."
"Louise Weiss, Simone Veil and Nicole Fontaine: these are three great Presidents of our European Parliament."
"Today we ask ourselves the following question: what were the outstanding qualities of your Presidency?"
"The first is that you have always put the concept of the Community, action by the European institutions, at the centre of your policy, and indeed you continue to do so; this means first and foremost the European Parliament, which you - and this is my second comment - have consistently represented with great dignity, both in public and at the summits."
"The fact that the Laeken photograph shows you between the King of Belgium and the President of the French Republic is testimony to your powers of persuasion."
"Thirdly - and here you were an example amongst so few - you spoke out against any form of terrorism, obviously in particular against the terrorism in Spain, but also throughout the world."
"Extending an invitation to Commander Massoud was one of your great decisions and in so doing you, as it were, anticipated subsequent events in Afghanistan."
"That is why we have every reason to thank you so warmly today!"
"You were of course always a full Member of our group, even as President, but now, when you stand down as President in January, you will be coming back into the fold of our group and you will then take your seat alongside another former President of the European Parliament - whom we hold in equally high esteem - José María Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado."
"We will be delighted to have you, as well as Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, working alongside us on a day-to-day basis."
"We welcome you very warmly back into our group and we thank you most sincerely for your convincing work, our dear President, Nicole Fontaine."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first and foremost, I would like to say, dear Nicole, that I understand how you must be feeling today."
"It is obvious that our political group, the Socialists, did not elect you to your post."
"But today, in the name of this very political group, I would like to thank you for your Presidency..."
"... and say that you are very welcome in our midst, for, at the end of the day, each and every one of us here is a European politician working for a noble cause which, today, is at an historical turning point."
"I believe that, during your Presidency, you have, more than anything, shown a commitment to the cause of freedom and democracy, not only outside the EU but within the Union, and for this reason I would like to thank you."
"On the other hand, this has already been said but it cannot be stressed enough, you have played a part in the fight for freedom and democracy versus terrorism, which at this present time is the global scourge."
"And you have also fought to ensure the EU moves forward, and it is increasingly accepted that it should be equipped with the constituent process used in each of our countries, that is to say, a debate that is open and democratic."
"I think we should also praise your support of the Convention as a method where the two pillars of democratic legitimacy are combined. Thank you for this."
"Regarding the issues on which our opinions differ, Madam President, you have always had the courage of your convictions."
"We, on the other hand, have had the courage of ours."
"But in any case, I think that this has also helped in advancing the cause which unites us in this House, the fight for democracy, for a European Union that is democratic, that represents not only our peoples but also our citizens."
"Thank you very much, Madam President."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, dear Nicole, my Group supported you at the outset."
"We were proud to do so then and I am proud today after your record in office of two and a half years."
"You have been an outstanding representative of this House who has earned the thanks and support of everyone here."
"You took over at a very difficult period when relations had been fractured between the two key institutions of the Union, the Commission and the Parliament."
"I believe you have succeeded in restoring an effective and substantial working relationship which is so necessary at the heart of a proper functioning Community method."
"I thank you for doing that."
"It was a strategic act of considerable European importance, not just European Parliamentary importance."
"There have been impressive improvements under your Presidency in our work rate with regard to co-legislation and that is due to good management of our agenda."
"You have been an impressive defender and promoter of the Charter on Fundamental Rights and we salute you for that."
"You have brought a very special conviction to the fight against terrorism and in doing so you have brought dignity to the democratic purpose of this House."
"You strongly promoted the case for a Convention."
"One year ago, 11 months ago, 10 months ago - yours was an isolated voice."
"Today your voice is the common currency and we salute you for that."
"There have been controversies during your Presidency and I agree with Enrique Barón Crespo that you indeed had the courage of your convictions."
"For my part I have always believed that you acted in those controversies without fear or favour."
"That for me is a measure of the enormous personal integrity and strength which you have brought to your task."
"Of course as a woman you have brought not just the quality of being female but also femininity to this task."
"You represented that large section of our community in Europe which is so inadequately represented, not just in electoral politics, but in so many spheres of public administration and public life."
"Thank you for what you have done for this Parliament."
"Thank you for the strength and for the élan feminin which you have brought to your High Office and we wish you good luck and good fortune in the future."
"Madam President, dear Nicole, I would also like to thank you on behalf of my Group for the work you have done over the last two and a half years."
"In particular, I would very much like to say that our Group has been truly proud of you every time you have stood up for human rights in the world."
"You always immediately took a stance in situations in which people' s lives were under threat."
"I remember that case in which Ghanaian children died in the hold of an aircraft."
"They sent a message to Europe which said how difficult the situation in Ghana was."
"You showed no hesitation in promptly adopting a position on the matter."
"You also invited Commander Massoud to Parliament last spring, just as if you had foreseen what was coming, and you boldly appeared in public beside him."
"I am quite sure you also jeopardised your own personal safety on many an occasion in this way, and it is for this kind of courage that I wish to express my sincerest thanks."
"The European Parliament, which has always been keen to act as the European Union' s moral conscience, has actually managed to acquire a human face during your term of office, and that face has been yours, for which I thank you."
"You have also bravely reflected the majority view in this Parliament in situations in which that has not been very easy."
"I remember when we were discussing here Austria' s new government: you put in words what the majority in this Parliament felt, that our hearts were not entirely in it."
"That cannot have been easy for you either."
"But now things are changing, there are going to be new faces, and I want to wish you all the very best for the future."
"Perhaps, as someone in my Group has already called out, you would have been a sparkling presence in the newly set up Convention."
"You are just the sort of person I would have liked to see leading it."
"At present I am not sure if I am happy about what has been done, but I wish you well in any case."
"Madam President, it is no secret that neither my group, on the whole, nor myself, played a part in electing you two and a half years ago."
"The reason for this is that, as far as we are concerned, for democracy to function properly, the pluralism characterising our societies must be properly expressed."
"I am, however, speaking completely from the heart when I say that both my group and myself truly appreciate and have a great deal of respect for your Presidency."
"You have given us proof of your impartiality, your respect for all political sensibilities, even minority opinions, and your ability to avoid political discrimination."
"This has not always been the case in this Parliament."
"Your attitude in this regard is worthy of a special mention."
"You have also been able to adopt difficult positions, for which you deserve credit, when the fundamental values upon which the European Union is founded have been called into question."
"A great deal of courage was required to adopt such positions, which you proved to have."
"Although, generally speaking, we have not always supported your public statements, because they put forward the majority view of Parliament, which, unfortunately, on too many occasions is so different from our own, you have nevertheless been able to give a dignified image of Parliament."
"One of the highlights of your Presidency has to be the outstanding Sakharov prize ceremony that you so wanted and that you were able to expand on through your wise words in your speech at the Laeken European Council."
"For all of this, and for the excellent degree of cooperation between us, thank you very much!"
"Madam President, I too would very much like, on behalf of my Group, to thank you for the very great work you have put in on behalf of the European Parliament over the last two and half years, which have coincided with major political developments, particularly since September last."
"I totally agree with all the very many well-deserved, fine compliments which have been paid to you by the leaders of the other Groups here today."
"The Presidency of the European Parliament has to reflect the views of all its Members and I am more than satisfied that you, Mrs Fontaine, have worked exceptionally hard during your term of office to ensure that all our views were represented on the many occasions on which you had to fulfil this responsibility."
"I would like to wish you well for the future."
"You have represented us all with very great dignity and at all times showed great respect for all the Members of this Parliament."
"You have spoken out clearly on our behalf when clear statements were needed on the fight against terrorism and the protection of human rights."
"This is an area of major importance for this Parliament and an area in which we are gaining international respect."
"It was a pleasure and a privilege having you as our President for the last two and half years and for me personally, as someone who supported you unequivocally on the important day at the beginning of your term of Presidency, I am very happy to say that you have succeeded beyond all my hopes and expectations."
"Madam President, the majority of my group were involved in securing your election in 1999."
"I recommended you and also voted personally for you, because I thought it important to break with ten years of cartel agreements between the two largest groups."
"Previously, the post alternated between the two large groups, and within the large groups it alternated between the largest sub-groups."
"If there were a qualified candidate from a smaller group - from the independents or from the smaller sub-groups in one of the large groups - the person concerned would have no chance of being elected."
"It was also an outstanding Vice-President who could conduct the very difficult votes to the satisfaction of all MEPs."
"In my speech of recommendation, I looked forward to your being a fair representative of us all and, with the open election campaign we now have between Mr Cox and Mr Martin and the three other candidates, the break with the cartels of the past has been confirmed."
"The break with the major coalition has also made for a very good atmosphere in the Conference of Presidents."
"Now, all the chairpersons have the same opportunity to present their arguments."
"Agreement and disagreement cross political divides."
"No one knows the outcome of meetings before they have been held."
"In the past, your predecessors could look at Mrs Martens from the Group of the European People' s Party and Mrs Green from the Group of the Party of European Socialists and, if these people looked down, the proposal was abandoned and, if they looked up, it was adopted."
"The cartel was so far-reaching that, on one particular occasion, it led to the appointment of an official to Parliament in opposition to the consensus reached by the group chairpersons."
"The person concerned was only elected because it was a particular sub-group' s turn to be given a titbit in terms of the administration of Parliament."
"This happened even though Mrs Green was on that occasion opposed to the election of this person and then had nonetheless to vote in favour of it."
"I should like to thank you for your cooperation in the far more open period that has just gone by."
"It is by setting good examples that we can help ensure a Parliament in which the best candidate for each post always has at least a fair chance of being elected or appointed."
"May I also thank you personally, Madam President, for your resolute efforts on behalf of human rights on every occasion on which these have been an issue."
"Thank you, and good luck in your next job."
"Madam President, if pluralism characterises a democracy, the small troupe of Non-attached Members is certainly the quintessential element of this democracy."
"This is a group of variable geometry, composed of strong individuals with strong opinions, which very often are completely different to one another, to the extent that they are often in total opposition."
"I will therefore not be so audacious as to express my opinions other than on my own behalf."
"But I would like to think that my choice of words will be shared and accepted by each of these Members."
"I think that your Presidency has been characterised by a great deal of elegance."
"In my opinion, this is a virtue that is becoming so rare, particularly in political circles, that it deserves special mention."
"Your Presidency has been characterised by elegance, by the dignity that you have managed to maintain at all times, on your personal behalf and for this Parliament that you represent."
"It has also been characterised by an independence of spirit, the concern expressed by you that some would possibly say has not been felt in all areas, but which has in any case, in my opinion, been expressed with a great deal of sincerity. You also have the ability to detach yourself, in your role as President, from any political in-fighting, to detach yourself from the concerns arising from your own personal convictions to respect those of others."
"For these great virtues you have displayed, Madam President, I would like to thank and congratulate you."
"Thank you, Mrs Garaud."
"The very least that I can say is that I am deeply touched and indeed moved by what you have just said."
"I do not want to add anything else."
"Thank you once again from the bottom of my heart for your friendship and for these words of support."
"This Parliament is extraordinary, and I think that it will always have a special place in our hearts."
"European Council/Belgian Presidency"
"The next item is the joint debate on the European Council report and the Commission statement on the European Council meeting of 14 and 15 December in Laeken, and the statement by the President-in-Office of the Council on the Belgian Presidency."
"Mr Verhofstadt, thank you very much for your marvellous speech."
"Madam President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I am particularly honoured to be taking part in this debate, just after the Laeken Summit."
"At Laeken, we took a great step forwards towards the kind of Europe we want: a more democratic, more open Europe with which our citizens are, at last, starting to identify fully."
"I would like to start by paying tribute to the Belgian Presidency of the Council for the way it has managed the work during this second half of the year, particularly the work which led to the Laeken Declaration."
"Laeken launched a new constitutional phase in European integration, one in which this House and the national parliaments will be able to play a key role."
"Indeed, the new process will be open and transparent and will help to give our fellow citizens a better grasp of the key issues being debated in Europe today."
"From the point of view of enlargement and globalisation, the stakes are very high."
"I see the path mapped out at Laeken as the only way of ensuring democratic legitimacy, ensuring that the Union can pursue integration and enlargement without the danger of its citizens subsequently rejecting the solutions adopted by their governments."
"The enlargement of the European Union is an irreversible process that is already well advanced. Indeed, we must not forget that this is one of the main reasons why we need the Convention."
"Without institutional change, the enlarged Union would simply be unable to function."
"Without open discussion, we would be in danger of losing the support of the citizens of the Union and the candidate countries."
"Furthermore, we must not underestimate the importance of the candidate countries being involved for the first time in an institutional process that has constitutional implications."
"It is their future, as well as the future of the existing fifteen Member States, that is being decided here."
"The achievements of the Laeken European Council go beyond launching the Convention, however."
"The events of 11 September were a reminder of what those who want to abuse and destroy freedom can do, and the Council' s endorsement of our activities in the field of home affairs will help us to achieve our aim of building an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union."
"Work on defining a common asylum and immigration policy has received fresh impetus."
"The European Council has called for the Commission' s communication on illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings to serve as the basis for an action plan."
"In this context, as I proposed in my recent speech in Bruges, the European Council has asked the Council and the Commission to explore ways of enabling those that guard the Union' s external borders to cooperate effectively, and to look into the possibility of setting up a common mechanism or border-control service."
"I regret that the Laeken Council was unable to go further in settling the issue of the future European agencies."
"This is not a disaster, let us be clear about that - I too agree with what Prime Minister Verhofstadt has said - but, as we have been on other occasions, we are forced to note that the unanimity rule really is an obstacle to decision-making."
"One thing must be clear from now on."
"The 'Community method' has enabled the Union to become what it is: a union of peoples and a union of States, requiring an innovative decision-making structure with common institutions and a single voice representing all the countries, both large and small."
"The 'Community method' has served to promote efficiency and democratic legitimacy."
"Our task is merely to adapt and strengthen it. This is not just in order to avoid losing public support: it is also ensure that our actions are effective."
"Our fellow citizens have had enough of this sort of horse-trading."
"They are more interested in whether the much-heralded European Food Safety Authority is actually up and running than in where it is located."
"I can therefore confirm that, as of 1 January 2002, the Authority will start work at its temporary - and I stress 'temporary' - headquarters in Brussels."
"Europe' s citizens cannot wait any longer for us to set up a body dedicated to protecting their health."
"In this connection, the Commission will continue to attach great importance to its relations with Parliament."
"We have improved our procedures and our working methods, but recent weeks have shown that this process of building relationships and establishing procedures has not yet allowed us to achieve the aims we all set ourselves."
"We must work together to achieve them speedily and make total synergy between Commission and Parliament the basis of the second half of our term of office."
"The goal we set ourselves at Lisbon in March 2000 was to make the Union the world' s most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy within ten years."
"At the same time, we committed ourselves to making Europe a fairer society which is attentive to the needs of all."
"I am delighted that the Laeken Council agreed to give these objectives priority status."
"Barcelona will therefore have to represent a significant and irreversible step forwards in consolidating and developing the European social model, but we shall return to this subject during the run-up to the Summit."
"The European Council has once again confirmed that the Galileo satellite navigation project is strategically important and a potential catalyst for innovation and competitiveness."
"It could hardly have done otherwise given that, just a month ago, the member States of the European Space Agency - 13 out of 15 of which are also Member States of the European Union - committed EUR 550 million to this project."
"Any other decision would have given a conflicting signal regarding the project, which is vital for our future and our independence."
"The European Council has set out clear dates and objectives for the first half of 2002: now it is time to move ahead without further delay."
"Our credibility and the credibility of the Council and Parliament depend on it."
"The Commission is therefore ready to help ensure that the commitments made are fulfilled and to move on to the practical implementation of the project, taking into account all its technical and financial aspects."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Convention must deliver what is expected of it and bring about a change that will enable us to face a difficult, complex future with confidence."
"Its task will not be to reinvent the Union or call into question the 'acquis communautaire' , but rather to chart a course which will enable the Union, including its new Members after enlargement, to move ahead with political, social and economic integration."
"The Convention approach is a deliberate break with the past."
"Our aim is to have it draw on the ideas and experience of the many, not the few."
"Our aim is for it to conduct its business in the clear light of day rather than behind closed doors."
"Within the Convention, the Commission will act as Guardian of the Treaties and promoter of the Community spirit."
"Equality between all the Member States and a balance between the Union' s institutions are the best guarantee of a fair, efficient Europe Moreover, the latest Eurobarometer indication is actually that the European citizens appear to be drawing closer to Europe and its institutions even more quickly than we might have imagined."
"In 2004 at the latest, but probably before that date, the Convention' s contributions will be put to the test at an Intergovernmental Conference, after which the citizens of old and new Member States will elect representatives to this House."
"We must start to prepare now for these major, important events."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, there is a good atmosphere in today's sitting, which is fitting in this pre-Christmas season."
"We have thanked our President, but we must also warmly thank the Council Presidency, and here first and foremost Mr Verhofstadt, the Prime Minister, for the success which you, which Europe, and all of us, achieved in Laeken with the adoption of the Laeken Declaration."
"Mr President-in-Office, you - and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Michel, whom I should like to include in these words of thanks - have acted in the best Belgian tradition, as your predecessors - Leo Tindemans, who will be 80 years old in just a few months' time, Wilfried Martens, the President of the European People's Party, and Jean-Luc Dehaene - also consistently did: with commitment, conviction and in the European spirit."
"This is also an example of how the government of a so-called smaller country can sometimes operate far more effectively and move Europe much further forward than so-called larger countries always claim to be capable of doing."
"That is why I should like to thank you most sincerely."
"I should like to limit my comments to the Laeken Declaration, because many colleagues from our group will be addressing the other issues. Laeken is a great personal success for you, Prime Minister, and we very much welcome this."
"I should, however, also like to thank the Commission very much."
"After all, from time to time we do also express criticism of the Commission, even if it considers this to be unjustified."
"The President of the Commission, Romano Prodi, with the Member of the Commission responsible for reforming the European Union, Michel Barnier, at his side, have not only constantly monitored our progress along the road to reform, they have also trodden the road with us."
"It was our party, the European People's Party, which proposed at its Congress in Berlin as early as January that a Convention be convened."
"We are glad that this is the position of the European Parliament as a whole and also that of the most important institutions."
"What is most significant, in my view, is our new working method, the fact that the reform of the European Union is being made into a parliamentary process."
"A majority of the Convention are members of parliament, and we hope that this will also mean that the media will contribute to actually making our work public, because it is all very well to hold public meetings, but this is not of course sufficient on its own; it is only effective if the media cover these meetings so that the public has access to them, and this is a request which we wish to make of the media today."
"There has been some debate over this tripartite chairmanship which has been created for the Convention."
"May I say, Mr President-in-Office, that I consider this to be a very wise move."
"Valéry Giscard d'Estaing was of course not only the French President, he was also a Member of the European Parliament, and in the end a Member of our group."
"At one time he was a Member of the Liberal Group but he subsequently came to us, which was of course a step up,..."
"(Laughter)"
"... and above all he did something which does not come at all easily to a former French President; he wrote a report on subsidiarity."
"I say to you: it is better to have a chairman who is a little advanced in age and who has an alert, keen mind and an open European heart, than a young chairman who is a Euro-sceptic!"
"That is why I think that this appointment, complemented by the appointments of Jean-Luc Dehaene, with whom we as a group have excellent relations, and also Giuliano Amato, who is a proven European, is a very sound one."
"There will be nine further members of the praesidium and I would have thought that the two European Parliament representatives would be drawn from the two large groups."
"It is precisely because this will probably be the case that I firmly believe that it would provide a good counterbalance if the next President of the European Parliament were to come from a smaller group, and that is why our group will be giving its full support to Pat Cox, the Chairman of the Liberal Group."
"(Laughter and applause from the right, protests and heckling from the left) Ladies and gentlemen, obviously this is still open for discussion and the final decision remains to be made, but I am fairly optimistic in this regard."
"As far as content goes, Mr President-in-Office, I thought it was very astute of you to pose questions."
"I do not wish to give our answers to these questions now."
"Issues included strengthening Parliament, Parliament's right of codecision, more openness, transparency in the Council of Ministers and obviously a role for the Commission which is based on the will of the electorate. This will all have to be negotiated."
"Another crucial factor is how the work of the Convention is structured, and I think that with our 16 representatives we in the European Parliament have a tremendous opportunity to be, as it were, in the vanguard here."
"I have just proposed to our group that our family of parties - I do not know how the other groups do this - meet together as a group, as befits a parliamentary process, that our Convention members from the EPP/ED Group and the members of the national parliaments meet together to do some preparatory work in an appropriate setting."
"I would call on the fifteen governments to send their best people to the Convention."
"These must not be people who think that they will be taking part in a seminar; the governments need to be represented by personalities who also have the ear of their government."
"If the Chairman, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, is supposed, pursuant to the Laeken Declaration, to report back to the Heads of State and Government at each summit, then it would only be sensible to introduce a similar reporting requirement for the national government representatives."
"They should report back to their respective national governments, thus ensuring that the Convention does not work in isolation and that constant feedback is provided."
"Whether this Laeken Declaration ultimately merits the epithet 'historic' - it is a good start, but unless the working method proves to be effective the result will not be either - whether all of this is ultimately of historic significance will of course only be known once the result is on the table and the Heads of State and Government and their governments have adopted it."
"I hope that their commitment to the process, as expressed through government representatives and parliamentary colleagues, whether from the European Parliament or national parliaments, is so strong that the result can also by and large be accepted."
"If we achieve this together then this European Union, our venerable Europe, which will then be renewed, will be capable of acting both internally and externally; it will be a democratic, convincing Europe which is representative of our values."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I would firstly like to welcome the decision taken at the European summit in Laeken."
"You have decided to cross the Rubicon by acknowledging that we are in the process of creating a constitution and that is a fundamental change which demonstrates that political alternation can generate new ideas and new proposals in Belgium as well."
"I congratulate the Belgian Presidency on the perseverance it has shown in taking this step."
"And furthermore, thanks to the efforts we have all made together, I believe that we have managed to make progress with the Convention, despite the significant reservations we had about it."
"I believe that each and every one of us can take credit for the Convention."
"Mr Poettering pointed out that the Convention was born under the German Presidency, at the Cologne Summit, but he forgot to mention that it was a Social Democrat/Green Presidency."
"I believe that the joint efforts of all the European political forces are characterising this process, and this is reflected in the Lehne/Méndez de Vigo report."
"I would like to acknowledge that our proposals have been heard; firstly, with regard to the membership of the praesidium, or Bureau, there is parliamentary representation which is balanced, in terms of democratic legitimacy, with that of the Council - we must not forget this - and a solution has been found - I would say a Belgian solution - in the triumvirate they have created as well as the praesidium."
"With regard to that praesidium, I must say that I have a high regard for Mr Giscard d'Estaing' s European credentials; he was not our candidate, but, as well as President of France, he was also a good Member of the European Parliament, and I believe that what we must ask at this point, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is that we do not create a body separate from the praesidium, that is to say that we do not create a directorate of three set apart from the praesidium."
"There must be a team of twelve that works together and that is the way to make progress."
"We can all say that things have gone better for our friends, but what I do not understand, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, is why Mr Poettering, who is also my good friend, is determined to say that being liberal is a sort of apprenticeship for becoming a Christian Democrat."
"I do not believe that Mr Cox is very happy with that view."
"In any event, the important thing is that we are all prepared to work together in this process."
"You have done something which I believe to be positive, and that is that with regard to the four issues raised in Nice, in Annex IV, Declaration 23, you have posed 64 questions."
"We have done our calculations and we make it 64."
"Some will be million euro - rather than dollar - questions."
"There are some questions on relations between national and European parliaments which I do not believe are very well worded, but we will help you to correct them and, above all, the important thing is that a constructive momentum is being created for the Convention, which is something my group has been working for for some time."
"We have seen this in the COSAC, and we are doing it as a political family so that there may be increasingly significant coordination between groups in Member States' parliaments, in the parliaments of the candidate countries, which also have the right to express their opinion on what we are doing, and in our Parliament."
"We have a great responsibility."
"Otherwise, please allow me to make certain criticisms in relation to Laeken."
"Progress has been made in terms of making the common foreign and security policy operative, and certain defence elements have even been raised."
"The Minister, Mr Michel, was perhaps rather hasty in announcing it, but I believe that it is better to be hasty with regard to our responsibilities than to do nothing."
"We must be able to take risks."
"With regard to the agencies, the truth is that after a Beethovenesque symphony, in the words of my good friend Giuliano Amato, we have come up against a complete cacophony; and there is another issue on which I agree with him, and that is that we cannot say that the future is going to be wonderful, when as soon as we stop discussing the future and deal with current issues, we end up in a catfight."
"That is not acceptable and I must point out that Parliament, in the Whitehead report, withdrew its amendments because we were told that the problem was going to be resolved at Laeken, and it has not been resolved."
"And I take good note of what was said by a liberal President-in-Office of the Council with regard to the Barcelona Summit: social cohesion, the defence of the European social model, the capacity for adaptation and dialogue with social partners;"
"Finally, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we must state here today that the Laeken declaration, which sets the objective of creating a European constitution, must be the beginning of a process and a momentum to which we must all be committed."
"On behalf of my group, I can say that we are united and determined to cross the Rubicon with you, if we do so seriously and with a view to the future, for the sake of a united Europe."
"Madam President, I should like to begin by thanking the Belgian Presidency and the Belgian Prime Minister for the degree of cooperation with the European Parliament."
"While I have not checked the record, from my own memory I believe Prime Minister that you may have been here on the floor of this House more often than any of your predecessors in any previous Presidency."
"That is a measure of the personal commitment which you have brought to dialogue with this House and democratic issues in Europe."
"I salute and thank you for that."
"There has also been a very dramatic change in the mood of this House between now and twelve months ago."
"Twelve months ago we all approached the Nice event as an important and defining moment and we felt disappointed when it produced something which resulted in more complexity rather than less, was more incomprehensible to the public rather than less, and seemed to reflect more a sense of deal-making than a sense of ideals behind the European process."
"At the end of this Presidency a balance has been restored and we should acknowledge that."
"There has been an extraordinary change in mood."
"The mood now is more upbeat and much of the thanks should go to you, Prime Minister Verhofstadt, and your colleagues in the Presidency."
"One cannot of course confuse mood and substance and so we must now exploit that dynamic for the future through the Laeken Declaration and through the Convention."
"The Laeken Declaration is indeed a defining moment for the Union and will be a durable measure of the quality of this Belgian Presidency."
"The Convention method is a defining method."
"Indeed, so many are so pleased with it that, like all successes, it now has many fathers and we all claim our share."
"But so be it."
"It is in the nature of success that we should all wish to celebrate it."
"With regard to the Convention, we look forward to its inauguration in March 2002 and we take note positively of the Presidency of the Convention in the persons of Mr Giscard d' Estaing and Mr Amato and Mr Dehaene and those others who will join them."
"We have to ensure that this Convention, through its Bureau, works in a single and coherent way."
"It is a vehicle for Europe, for neither more nor less."
"I want to say to my good friend, Hans-Gert Poettering, that about 10 years ago the former President of the Liberal Group was looking for political asylum in this House and I want to thank my colleagues in the Christian Democrats, even before Tampere and the development of justice and home affairs, for offering asylum to that man."
"He is a very capable European and I am sure in his hands that the Convention can make progress."
"It is wonderful to feel, as the Prime Minister has already remarked, that there are no taboos."
"At least with some of the concepts we have crossed an important bridge."
"The willingness to contemplate a constitution for Europe, is necessary not just for reasons of simplicity but for reasons of stating and re-stating ideals, contemporary values, citizens' rights, institutional balances, and creating the proper checks and balances."
"We need this and I am glad that you found the courage and a consensus to build on."
"September 11 was an extraordinary moment in your Presidency, a difficult challenge in terms of our common vulnerability and a recognition that non-Europe, or indeed transatlantic unilateralism, could not work."
"It has been a tremendous success for all the institutions, led by the Belgian Presidency and the European Commission and with the willing contribution of this House, that we seized that moment and that we have understood that our common vulnerability can only be answered by common response."
"All in all this is a Presidency worthy of the challenge of contemporary Europe and it is a Presidency, Mr Verhofstadt, which you and your colleagues can take great pride in."
"We, as your Liberal Democrat colleagues in this House, also feel a great pride in your achievement."
"We wish there were more people like you running states in Europe today."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, I would like to echo the comments made by my fellow Members regarding the wonderful spirit of cooperation that you have fostered between the Council and Parliament over the last six months."
"I shall now turn to the Laeken Declaration."
"We cannot fail to acknowledge that the Laeken Declaration is an important step along the road towards a re-designed, more transparent, more comprehensible and more democratic European Union. I also believe that it will be more efficient and stronger at international level."
"All these positive assessments are justified by the fact that a new dynamic has now been set in motion."
"We have observed the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Treaty of Nice, which were major disappointments."
"We now know that we have an opportunity to make a success of the new Intergovernmental Conference."
"If we work hard at the forthcoming summit - and the spirit of a joint undertaking that you introduced shows great potential in my view - I believe that the Convention, its open mandate, the working method that will be adopted, and the personality of those who will represent us there will enable us to reach an outcome that is extremely positive for the European Union."
"Therefore, do not spoil our fun, even though we could voice some misgivings about the lack of female representation, which I believe is extremely regrettable, in the triumvirate that will guide the Convention' s work,"
"even though it is regrettable that the European Parliament does not have sufficient representation, I think that, overall, we have a good starting point."
"I would also like to thank you for all the effort that you have made in this area."
"You mentioned your six-month Presidency."
"I have, however, been a Member of the European Parliament for a number of years now, and I notice that all the presidencies are disappointed when they reach the end of their mandate, particularly in the second half of the year, because it is much shorter than the first due to holidays, and also because the Presidency does not do everything in the European Union - fortunately, that is."
"The Presidency greatly depends on the good will of the other Member States; it depends on the work of the Commission and Parliament."
"Do not be overly disappointed."
"Personally speaking, I am rather disappointed about some aspects, I have to say, but I think that even if the events of 11 September had not happened, you would not have been able to complete all your projects."
"Having said that, the dramatic events of 11 September did happen."
"And combating terrorism became a fundamental theme."
"In this respect, I think that the prevention of terrorism is an area that we must consider extremely carefully and in which we must take action."
"It is a matter of regret to me that the Council' s final text does not send a message to the United States."
"This is something I want to make very clear."
"There is a positive message stating that 'we re-affirm our solidarity' which is fine."
"Perhaps, though, a more political message should have been added, to express our regret at the attitude of the American Government regarding two important aspects related to world peace and terrorism."
"For example, I think that the withdrawal from the treaty on antiballistic missiles, announced by President Bush, is a serious political error that threatens world peace."
"I also feel that blocking the Convention' s work on banning bacteriological weapons in Geneva in November, because of the United States' refusal to accept controls on their territory, is also a political error, and even a mistake."
"I think that the European Union should send a message to the American Government to ask it to change its mind."
"Lastly, I would like to mention two important meetings, because the day after tomorrow will be better than today, but before the day after tomorrow, we have to deal with tomorrow."
"In particular, there is the Johannesburg conference next September, which will evaluate what has happened in the ten years since the Rio conference."
"Ten years have passed - that we must realise, and all we need to do is to re-read the Commission' s texts to convince ourselves that we - the rich, industrialised countries - have not succeeded in changing the way we produce or consume food so as to promote sustainability for the planet. We have not succeeded."
"This means that strong initiatives must be taken in this area."
"The Gothenburg Summit took place, which was promising, and there were several positive aspects, particularly Kyoto, which was saved thanks to the initiative of the Belgian Presidency and the European Commission, in spite of the negative attitude, once again, of the United States."
"But the Kyoto protocol is no more than one tool of many, and is even a rather disappointing tool in terms of its initial ambitions. I do not think, however, that we will achieve the concrete results in Johannesburg that we will have obtained in the fight against the greenhouse effect, or in the protection of biodiversity."
"There is a whole range of dossiers on which we have even regressed somewhat."
"As for world poverty, you said yourself, Mr President, that the gap between the north and south has not diminished and instead has become even wider."
"I therefore feel that we need to make a considerable effort in this area."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, I have already had the opportunity to say that, in my view, the passion of any European politician should be, in the short term, to narrow the gulf of suspicion, if not distrust, which continues to grow between the citizens and the European institutions."
"My group therefore welcomes anything that can help to open up our respective societies to the debate on the future of Europe."
"This is why we sincerely appreciate the principle of the Convention, which is a departure from the typical intergovernmental behind closed doors meeting, as it involves European and national members of parliament in the preparatory work of the IGC, and allows representatives of candidate countries to participate. It is also open to contributions from social players."
"Rest assured that we will urge our counterparts from civil society to work in a constructive and open manner in the new, European political forum."
"Let us hope that those whose desire is to avoid tackling the disturbing issues that have surfaced in our societies will not be supported by the majority of the Convention."
"A problem cannot be solved by ignoring its root cause."
"That is why I thought the current state of affairs described in the draft declaration that Mr Verhofstadt submitted to the European Council was interesting, because it corresponds exactly with what our fellow citizens are experiencing, but the Fifteen unfortunately decided not to take it on board."
"On the other hand, I regret that the Presidency-in-Office of the Council has not shown the same critical attitude when preparing the questions submitted for discussion."
"Of course, the European Council did not find fault with any of this."
"The two vice-chairs of my group, Mrs Kaufmann and Mrs Frahm, will speak again with regard to the specifically institutional aspects of the Laeken Summit."
"As far as I am concerned, I would like to stress one single idea in relation to this."
"If we genuinely wish, as the Declaration by the Fifteen stated, to use citizens' expectations as the main theme of our imminent reflections, then, in my view, the debate cannot fail to include the institutional questions of the European project, the political guidelines that the institutions are supposed to implement."
"Anyone who has taken part in citizens' debates within the framework of the pre-Laeken consultation, or has taken the trouble to listen to the messages that came to light recently in the large demonstrations that took place in Brussels, will have in mind those urgent demands which are practically absent from the Convention' s agenda as defined by the Laeken Declaration."
"For example, all social issues, in the widest sense of the word, should provoke discussion on the new role that the euro and the European Central Bank will play."
"It should lead us to examine more closely the conflicting ideas on European services of general economic interest."
"It should lead us to question the dogma of rationing public spending, to re-launch the debate on the taxation of movements of capital, to stimulate the will to put an end to fiscal dumping and tax havens."
"The European Union' s economic policy should no longer be limited to competition policy, nor should its monetary policy be aligned with the demands of the financial markets alone."
"In my view, the question of the effective rights of employees facing the might of large corporations, and that of the effective involvement of citizens in drawing up European policies and the assessment of their effects are also an unavoidable topic from this perspective."
"All these questions, which we are bearing in mind, make up an institutional dimension."
"They have a place, therefore, in the debates of the future Convention."
"The same applies to enlargement."
"Can the institutional challenge posed by this historic event be separated from the other critical problems that we should urgently prevent? Two figures are all that are needed to illustrate what is at stake."
"We remain silent about these figures when we should be confronting them head on and with total responsibility."
"By 2004, the European Union' s population will have grown by 30%, but its GNP will only increase by 4.5%."
"What sort of structural reforms, and, in particular, what type of solidarity policy will be needed in order to avoid dangerous tensions, to enable us to become what the Laeken Declaration calls a big European family?"
"Lastly, the few lines that this framework document devotes to the CFSP can be summed up almost exclusively by - and I quote - 'updating the Petersberg tasks' ."
"As if Europe' s ability to wage war was a guarantee of its international authority."
"Having had the opportunity over recent weeks to visit several regions of the globe, I can say that this is not the most important thing we are asked to do."
"What people want from Europe is liberation from oppressive American imperialism, to drive back much more aggressively the rule of unilateralism, to develop a wide-ranging strategy of conflict prevention by meeting the needs of development, equality and dignity of the people of the south."
"In short, they want Europe to give a very different perspective on events, post-11 September, to that of George Bush."
"Let us have the courage to look at life as it is."
"Let us once again give a clear and inspired meaning to Europe, and I think that this will liberate the institutional dynamic."
"This, in any case, is what I believe."
"Madam President, the Belgian Presidency assumed the Presidency of the European Union at an extremely crucial time."
"The tragic terrorist attacks in America last September highlighted the need for European Union Member States and our international partners to bolster cooperation to defeat the evils of international terrorism."
"European Union leaders confronted these new challenges with vigour and determination and we are all collectively intent on tackling the scourge of terrorism."
"The European Union has brought forward proposals to prevent our financial systems being used for money-laundering to fund terrorist activities."
"We must all continue to cooperate more closely in the future to ensure that the twin evils of international terrorism and international criminal activities are defeated."
"The Laeken summit last weekend had to address a whole series of wide-ranging political issues."
"I note with interest that in the final text of the Declaration issued by EU Heads of State, they say ""The European Union is a success story but 50 years on, however, the Union stands at a crossroads, a defining moment in its existence"" ."
"I fully agree with this political sentiment."
"We have to be sure that any changes which are brought about within the European Union in the future command the goodwill and support of the citizens of the Union."
"This is a very tough challenge indeed, not only for European Union governments but also for the European Commission, and indeed for ourselves in the European Parliament."
"As the European Union develops more closely, we must guarantee that the citizens of the EU support these new developments."
"Without the political support and the goodwill of the people of Europe, the EU as a political and economic entity will be badly weakened."
"I hope that this is one of the core issues which will be addressed by the new Convention which has now been set up by the EU leaders."
"There will be broad-ranging representation at this Convention which will afford all participants a time for real reflection as to the direction that the European Union must take in the immediate years ahead."
"How best to sell the message that the European Union is a positive force for the people of Europe will be a central challenge for the participants of this Convention."
"I support the European Union."
"I believe that the European Union has helped to improve living standards within the European Union and it has helped to improve our quality of life."
"But not everyone is convinced of this argument and we must persuade the opponents of the European Union of its benefits."
"The difficulty of this task should not be underestimated."
"The European Council decided to participate in international efforts to restore stability and peace to Afghanistan."
"This was an important decision, affirming the EU' s readiness to provide humanitarian and development assistance to the people of Afghanistan."
"I welcome our political support in this regard but any future actions which are taken on this issue must be strictly dealt with under the auspices of specific United Nations mandates."
"I also welcome the strong support given by EU leaders to Yasser Arafat' s role as ""Israel' s negotiating partner both to eradicate terrorism and to work towards peace."""
"EU leaders have rightly called on the Palestinian authorities to dismantle terrorist networks run by Hamas and Islamic Jihad and to arrest and prosecute all such suspects and end the armed intifada."
"Equally, European Union leaders are right to call on Israel to withdraw its military forces, stop extra-judicial executions, lift closures and restrictions on the Palestinian people, free settlements and end operations directed against Palestinian infrastructure."
"I welcome the fact that European Union is prepared to play an active role in third-party monitoring operations in the Middle East and I believe that the European Union must and should play a stronger role in any future talks that may take place in the Middle East region."
"Madam President, my mother taught me that you should keep quiet if you have nothing worthwhile to say, but how are the elections of Mr Giscard d'Estaing, Mr Amato and Mr Dehaene as leaders of the Convention to be commented upon?"
"We can of course commend the appointment of the three wise men with their splendid careers behind them as a good signal to the Chinese leaders as to how we promote women and young people in the European Union."
"What, however, do our own women and young people say about the fact that the future of the EU is now to be directed by those responsible for the majority of our laws' now being adopted by officials and Ministers behind closed doors?"
"My group expects the leaders of the future to be given places in the Convention, which it also expects to be opened up to that 50 per cent of the electorate who voted 'no' in the referenda in France, Denmark and Ireland and who might have voted 'no' in other countries if the latter had had the courage to ask them."
"The critics of the EU, or Eurorealists, ought at least to have one place in every single national delegation, and I should like to thank Mr Verhofstadt for having supported this demand when SOS Democracy had a meeting with him."
"The Danish Prime Minister has already offered the Danish critics of the EU a place."
"The Convention should draft two texts: a constitution, as desired by the majority, and an agreement between independent nations which cooperate on cross-border matters that we cannot solve ourselves in our own countries' parliaments."
"The two proposals can therefore be subject to consultative referenda in all the Member States so that our politicians can see what people want before they call an official Intergovernmental Conference for the purpose of making changes to existing treaties."
"The two proposals should be prepared as completed drafts that can be adopted if desired."
"The Convention should therefore do some detailed work and employ the necessary experts to help with both the majority and minority approaches."
"There should also be ongoing debates on the two drafts in the national parliaments and at public meetings in the Member States."
"The successor to the Treaty of Amsterdam must not come as a surprise but as the result of a democratic process."
"The democratic process is at least as important as the content of the new treaty, in which it is not only the future of Mr Amato, Mr Dehaene and Mr Giscard d' Estaing that is now at stake, but that of all Europeans."
"Madam President, I would also like to thank, in particular, the Belgian Presidency, Mr Verhofstadt, and Mr Michel especially, because I believe they enabled us to keep the game open in terms of the Convention. I see, in particular, that behind one of the issues, namely, that of the direct election of the Commission President, lies the characteristic and insistent work of the Belgian Presidency."
"I think, however, that we should not forget, and I am also addressing my fellow Members here, the objective, and, with regard to this, the issue of terrorism, an issue that has already been put on the backburner. I disagree with you, Mr Lannoye."
"There was a paragraph which, under the influence of the British members, I believe, was withdrawn, that placed the Americans at a distance. I think that we are already forgetting that terrorism is an international phenomenon."
"We are forgetting that not only was Afghanistan under the Taliban, but the issues of Syria, Iraq, Somalia and North Korea remain. However, we are, above all, forgetting that the events of 11 September revealed that terrorism is born of and feeds on dictatorships, on these dictatorial regimes."
"And we have already forgotten this, since, at the last session, we adopted an association agreement with Egypt, without batting an eyelid, disregarding the warnings and requests for additional information on a number of serious human rights violations, which have also been voiced today. I would also like to thank our President."
"Chairman Poettering reiterated the role played by our President in supporting Commander Massoud. Our own President had invited Mrs Sihem Ben Sedrine here today, who, once again due to despicable, base, mediocre action taken by this dictatorship, which is becoming increasingly dictatorial by the day, will not be able to attend the reception that the President of our Parliament had organised in her honour."
"This is the reality of these dictatorships which are at the root of the growth of terrorism, and we are doing nothing, we have already forgotten the lessons of 11 September."
"I hope at least, that the next President of the European Parliament will re-extend the invitation originally made by our President, Mrs Nicole Fontaine, and I hope that, for Tunisia, for the Tunisian democrats, for the Egyptian democrats, for all democrats, particularly in Arab countries, our Parliament will in time live up to its objectives and its ambitions."
"Madam President, we have all known for a long time that the Intergovernmental Conference on its own is no longer an effective instrument for bringing about a proper treaty amendment."
"It is encouraging to hear that a different working method has been opted for at the Laeken Summit."
"The Convention has been launched, and its agenda is far wider than the four points imposed at Nice."
"That is an achievement on the part of the Belgian Presidency, on which I would warmly congratulate it."
"The quality of the triumvirate which will be heading the Convention and its praesidium is also promising."
"Nobody will reproach me for the fact that my trust in this leadership is mainly based on the presence in this trio of former Prime Minister and party colleague, Mr Dehaene."
"The Laeken Declaration contains more than sixty non-rhetorical questions."
"Although everyone involved in Europe since Amsterdam, and Ioanina in fact, knows what the questions are, nobody had expected adequate and complete answers yet."
"However, many of us were looking forward to receiving some indicators, and I actually miss them a little in this Laeken Declaration."
"There has not been the slightest hint of reaching political agreement between Heads of State and Government about the direction which we need to take with Europe."
"In fact, wearing my Belgian hat, I could also say that Mr Verhofstadt asks the questions, and Mr Dehaene should make sure the answers are found."
"I am left with three questions for the Council Presidency, to which I should like to receive answers."
"First of all, do you believe, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that you can deepen the European Union even further through this Declaration and with the Convention, to coincide at the latest with the imminent round of enlargement?"
"Secondly, do you expect that the national parliaments that have made their ratification of the deeply disappointing Nice Treaty dependent on the contents of the Laeken Declaration will now soon embark upon the ratification process for Nice?"
"Thirdly, I warmly welcome the idea of publishing the Laeken Declaration in dozens of European newspapers, but are you not concerned that people will also want the questions answered and will want to see concrete policy steps taken before they will well and truly feel at home in the ever-expanding Europe?"
"I should like to finish off by saying that, at the start of the Belgian Presidency, I had asked you to convene an NGO summit, preferably a few weeks before Laeken."
"I did not receive a response during that sitting, but you did organise the summit."
"This was therefore a matter of actions speaking louder than words."
"We had not been used to this for a while in Belgium, and it was a nice surprise when it did happen. Thank you for this."
"Mr President, one of the conclusions in the Laeken Declaration is that citizens feel that deals are often cut behind closed doors and away from democratic scrutiny."
"That in fact could be an assessment of summits themselves, which are often conducted out of sight and away from public scrutiny until the very end."
"One easy way of starting to remedy that process would be to ensure that the European Parliament, just like the European Commission, is represented throughout the summit and not asked to leave after the aperitifs."
"I would, however, like to add my congratulations to the President-in-Office of the Council for his management of the summit."
"He was absolutely right not to allow the meeting to degenerate into a fight over the seat of agencies but instead to allow the spotlight to fall on the more significant issues."
"The Laeken Declaration rightly refers to the twin challenges facing the Union."
"My Group has asked me to concentrate on internal matters, and particularly the issue of governance, but I would like to say just a few words about the external challenge."
"The Declaration is of course right to say that there must be no weakening in the fight against those who use terror and violence."
"But for me the real strength of the Declaration lies in its wider recommendation that the European Union takes the fight against poverty and exclusion seriously."
"I wholeheartedly support the aim of the Declaration to ""set globalisation into a moral framework"" ."
"As Tony Blair might have put it - ""Tough on terrorism but also tough on the causes of terrorism""."
"Parliament' s key objective at Laeken was to see a Convention launched with a broad-ranging agenda."
"It is a pity that the leadership of the Convention is not so broad-ranging."
"Three men of a certain age."
"For me that sends the wrong signals."
"They are each very worthy in their own right but collectively they fail to represent Europe' s rich diversity of talent and in particular: how does this demonstrate the Union' s so-called commitment to gender mainstreaming?"
"(Applause) But at least we have the Convention, and it is now up to all of us to play our part in making it work and involving the public of the Union in the debate about the future of Europe."
"However, any fruits of the Convention will not be ripened until well after 2004."
"The Laeken Declaration' s objective of good governance, that is connecting better with citizens, reducing bureaucracy and delivering on our objectives more effectively and efficiently, cannot wait."
"Laeken must not be seen as an excuse for postponing action on governance but instead create a new impetus for reforms that do not require treaty change."
"In particular there are three areas where urgent action is required:"
"Firstly, the continuation of the reform of the staff structures and administrative procedures inside the Commission."
"There is a need for high profile support at a high political level for continuing the work of transforming the Commission into a first-class civil service."
"Secondly, the European Parliament itself must reform its own working methods."
"I believe that we do a good job in terms of our legislative, budgetary and control functions, but no Parliament can work in the dark."
"By reforming our working methods to make ourselves a livelier and more relevant debating chamber, we can shed a little light on our role as the voice of the people in EU decision-making."
"Thirdly, we must make progress on better regulation."
"I note the Presidency' s conclusions which welcome the report of the Mandelkern Group on the quality of regulatory arrangements and the Commission communication on regulatory simplification and their calls for an action plan for the first half of 2002."
"This Parliament, in the report prepared by Sylvia Kaufmann, called for an interinstitutional working group on better regulation."
"Notwithstanding what was agreed at Laeken, I hope the Spanish Presidency will re-visit this issue and set up a working group with a mandate to arrive at draft interinstitutional agreements and an action plan agreed by all three institutions to be presented at the Seville Council next June."
"Let us be clear that the alternative to an agreed plan is a guerilla war where Parliament is left with no alternative but to defend its prerogatives."
"If that happens, we will have a non-stop dogfight where, proposal by proposal, Parliament will defend its rights as a co-legislator."
"The Convention has the potential to reform our institutions, to renew our goals and to reconnect Europe with our people, but none of this should have to wait until 2004, the process needs to begin now."
"Mr President, may I join in the praise of the Presidents of the Commission and Council for having brokered the deal at Laeken."
"To have got a British Prime Minister to have signed up to the prospect of a federal constitution is an extraordinary thing."
"It is certainly unprecedented."
"I fear though that the size of the podium in this chamber will require strengthening and extension so that it can fit in Valerie Giscard d' Estaing and his entourage."
"The European citizen will feel truly privileged that we have such a grand praesidium to service our work."
"Thank you for the 60 questions or so."
"Frankly, I would have wished for more."
"First, there is nothing on strengthening the powers of the Court."
"Secondly, there is nothing on revising the formula of a qualified majority in the Council."
"Thirdly, there is nothing on strengthening the role of the regions within the political system of the Union and, fourthly and finally, we would have appreciated some critical self-assessment of the functioning and performance of the European Council itself."
"But we are blessed with a truly pluralist procedure - an exciting and novel one - and we retain the freedom within the Convention to ask ourselves questions."
"We will exploit that freedom."
"Madam President, allow me to start by using a military analogy in these times of war."
"Mr Verhofstadt, over the past six months, you, together with your colleagues in the federal government and the federal state governments, have been Europe' s Lieutenant-General."
"Unfortunately, however, you have been the Lieutenant-General of an ill-disciplined army, an army in which too often the Member States refuse to bow to your supreme authority, in which all too many Member States act at their own discretion and wish to go their own way and in which the Member States only serve their own interests and too often put narrow state nationalism above the general European interest."
"You may have been aware of this over the past six months, Mr Verhofstadt, but we experience this on a daily basis in our files."
"Credit to you for having succeeded in creating a sense of order in that ill-disciplined army at Laeken."
"However, the Council is not only an ill-disciplined army, they are also a bunch of opportunists: typically, they quickly wanted to resolve the location issue on Saturday evening."
"Credit to you once again, Mr Verhofstadt, for having nipped this in the bud."
"For we want, in fact, to move away from the back-room mentality, we want to move away from closed meetings between officials, between diplomats and between fifteen Heads of Government."
"We are in favour of an open method, we want to give the Convention' s hopeful method a chance, we want to throw open the doors to let a fresh breeze in."
"You posed the right questions at the Convention."
"You rightly stated that the debate should be about the distribution of powers at different policy levels."
"You also rightly questioned whether it would not be better to leave the daily running of the Union' s policy to the regions where the constitution regulates this automatically."
"However, Mr Verhofstadt, could I also level some form of criticism?"
"You did not ask, for example, how constitutional regions, including Flanders, Wallonia, the Basque Country, Catalonia, Scotland and Wales could emphatically be involved in European decision-making."
"In failing to do so, you have ignored the demands of your party colleague, Mr Patrick Dewael, the Prime Minister of Flanders, who, together with some fifty colleagues, had even published a weighty document on this matter in May and in October."
"I should like to make three observations with regard to the composition of the Convention."
"Firstly, I do not believe that a triumvirate without the presence of one single woman genuinely reflects present-day society."
"Secondly, there is an imbalance in the composition of the Convention between the MEPs, on the one hand, and national parliaments, on the other."
"You, the Council, are making a mistake here. In my view, the European Parliament is the institution par excellence where the European idea, where the European general interest, applies, and you are missing an opportunity here."
"And my final comment with regard to the composition of the Convention is that the representatives of the constitutional regions are unable to participate directly in the Convention."
"They need to take the indirect route of the Committee of the Regions as observers, and that is a sad state of affairs in my view."
"Mr Verhofstadt, whatever happens, you can rely on me and my party, with the nine representatives of the European Free Alliance, to make a constructive contribution to this Convention, for Europe must not lead to uniformity. Europe must remain a sparkling diamond with many facets, facets displaying its diversity and its own identity, for only then can the European diamond sparkle in the European firmament."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, in adopting the Laeken Declaration convening the Convention, the summit has made a decision of historical significance for the future of the European Union."
"It is particularly noteworthy that none of the numerous open political questions on the future of the European Union have been declared off-limits and that the Convention mandate can also be seen as marking the beginning of the process of developing a European constitution."
"A further reason why the convening of the Convention is a milestone in European politics is that it will consign the policy of secret diplomacy behind closed doors, of non-transparent decision-making and haggling in marathon night sittings - as happened most recently at the Nice Summit - to the past, hopefully once and for all!"
"In my opinion, it is impossible to overestimate the significance of the fact that a majority of the members of the Convention will be democratically-elected members of the national parliaments and the European Parliament, that it will meet in public and talk to all kinds of organisations from civil society, and that the candidate countries will be involved in drafting proposals for the most far-reaching reform in the European Union's history."
"This provides the opportunity for controversial issues to be discussed in a genuine pan-European context and thus for us to have a broad-based public debate on the future of the EU."
"Since, however, a debate of this kind only comes to life if the pros and cons are discussed openly, I should like to refer once again to a position of this Parliament, namely our call for political plurality to be guaranteed in the composition of the Convention."
"The choice of those who will represent their countries, their national parliaments or the European Parliament is of particular importance in this context, and we must ensure at all costs that the Convention does not consist solely of representatives of the large European families of parties."
"Diversity of opinion must be delivered, because the European Union is actually at a crossroads and the proposals to be drawn up by the Convention must in their final form really reflect a European position on the future of Europe which is supported by all of us."
"If the Convention is to be a success and ultimately if the European Union is to be viable in the future, it will, in my view, be crucial for us to succeed in making the European Union more democratic across the board and in strengthening the rights of individual people."
"It is my hope - indeed I am counting on this - that, through the commitment of all of its members and as an independent forum, the Convention will gather its own political momentum during the course of its consultations, so that the next Intergovernmental Conference will not be able simply to disregard the Convention's proposals."
"Mr President, the past week has been pivotal for the future of the Union."
"Firstly, agreement was reached on the European arrest warrant, a major, sensitive agreement which must be seen as an initial step, to be consolidated by a broader, further-reaching political and institutional project bringing further integration."
"In particular, at Laeken, we started to define that political and constitutional Europe in which we firmly believe."
"The idea that Europe might be condemned to being just a union of agriculture and trade or just a financial and monetary union is waning."
"We are, at last, entering a new phase: an exciting phase, a phase of laying foundations and further integration, in which we must establish European political unity while safeguarding national identities and diversities."
"The diversities unite us; they must not be seen as dividing the European peoples, for they have come to represent precious social and cultural assets."
"Europe' s strength stems, in actual fact, precisely from its ancient culture, from its diversities as well as its common roots."
"In this sense, as a European and an Italian, I can only appreciate the work of the Italian Government at Laeken in enthusiastically upholding Parma' s application to be the site of the Food Authority."
"If we want the Europe we are building to be a Europe of excellence, quality and competitiveness in the area of quality, when it comes to the Food Authority, Parma is the natural, most suitable and most prestigious choice, precisely because of Italy' s longstanding gastronomic traditions: it has a tradition of culture and quality, professionalism and rigour, and a history of consolidated scientific excellence which is recognised the world over."
"In promoting Parma' s application - energetically, moreover, as Italy did at Laeken - we are not trying to impose unnecessary vetoes or advancing nationalistic claims; rather, this is an attempt to allow the quality, capacity, skills and natural, genuine vocation of a territory to prevail over bureaucracy, sterile bureaucratic agreements and pre-established lists, rather than allowing the latter to prevail as has happened on countless occasions."
"The citizens do not want the site of the Food Authority to be purely administrative but to have proven experience and capacity in the field of food safety."
"I feel that Parma has that proven experience and capacity."
"Finally, my heartfelt thanks go to the President, Mrs Fontaine, who, with great authority and courtesy, has steered the work of this House during this first part of our parliamentary term."
"Mr President, some believe that the debate on the future of Europe can be summarised in the development of the Community method, where the Commission has the monopoly on initiative, the Court of Justice has political power and interpretation, and the right to impose European law on one or more Member States is achieved by increasing majority decisions."
"This centralised vision of Europe in even more areas runs counter to the will of the people, who want to benefit from each other' s experience."
"The people of Ireland, which was the only nation to be consulted by referendum, were not mistaken in rejecting the Treaty of Nice."
"The Convention will be nothing more than a sham if it pursues the same objective without acknowledging that the Treaty of Nice is dead and buried."
"Unfortunately, the objectives appear to remain fixed."
"The conclusions of the Laeken Summit welcome the progress made and the agreements reached on the liberalisation of the postal services, which will bring about a weakening of the social and territorial cohesion of our Member States."
"It is unacceptable to impose on everyone the choice made by some Member States to privatise and open up their public services to competition."
"This proposal is not likely to bring the people of Europe closer, nor is it a condition for peace on the continent."
"We must adopt the opposite approach; in other words, bring Europe closer to the people."
"In order to do this, we must listen to them and, once genuinely common concerns have been expressed, debate an appropriate common response."
"In my view, the European Summit and the Laeken Declaration proved, in fact, to be a fitting sequel to the Belgian Presidency."
"It became a catalogue of hollow phrases, of nothingness, of unanswered questions."
"It is very characteristic of the state of affairs in today' s Europe that, actually, only someone like former Commissioner, Mr Van Miert, dared to put his finger on the wound."
"What Mr Michel ventured to call the 'Grand Cru Verhofstadt' ultimately turned out to be a cheap table wine."
"So there will soon be a Convention which is supposed to give a democratic face to an enforced federal Europe."
"But surely this Convention cannot cover up the fact that our institutions are systematically riding roughshod over the subsidiarity principle, that extremely drastic measures are taken without prior referendums, and even that the European Union is once again flouting the sovereignty of the Member States at this summit, for example by again callously ignoring the results of the Irish referendum."
"Apparently, European democracy suggests that citizens preferably have no say, and if they do, they have to carry on voting until they agree with what the eurocracy has decided, as was the case in Denmark and is also required from Ireland."
"The President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Verhofstadt, may well go down in history, albeit as the man who took things to such extremes that even Commission President, Mr Prodi, refused to hold any more press conferences with him, as the once pro-Flemish politician who refused to protect the Dutch language, as the man who abandoned all his principles, who was once known as the advocate of slimmed-down government and of deregulation but who became the partisan of European centralism exercised by a superstate and who turned inventing little rules into a kind of Olympic discipline."
"Mr President, the Laeken Council will sadly rank amongst the less impressive meetings of its kind."
"It was a missed opportunity and a serious disappointment, like the Belgian Presidency which preceded it."
"Why?"
"Not just because of the consistency of the Foreign Minister, Louis Michel, who for us emerges as an endearing Harry Worth-type figure on the European political stage."
"We seem to have passed over his proclamation that the British-led UN peacekeeping force in Afghanistan was to become an EU body."
"The key problem is that for this Presidency these last months have been a painful learning curve."
"The excessive aspirations of July, often misguided like ideas for a new Euro-tax on all EU citizens or a Tobin tax on capital movements, found themselves on a collision course with reality."
"At Laeken the EU's new rapid reaction force was declared operational even though, critically, its access to NATO assets is currently blocked."
"Indeed, the precise relationship between the force and NATO remains ambiguous."
"The European arrest warrant enjoyed a particularly painful birth with some uncertainty about when, or if ever, it will apply in Italy."
"The attempt to assign sites for various new EU bodies also descended into farce."
"Little progress was made at Laeken, or indeed, throughout the Belgian Presidency, on the competitiveness agenda in Europe."
"The Lisbon strategy, which has been grounded since Stockholm, now faces a moment of truth in Barcelona if we are truly to become the dynamic knowledge-based economy that is sought."
"Finally let me turn to the Declaration itself."
"The text acknowledges the EU's failings in terms of democracy, transparency and closeness to people but seems to come up yet again with solutions on federal lines."
"These options represent the wrong route for Europe."
"The Convention should learn the lessons of the last decade, reject ambitions for a European super-state, and focus on modest and intelligent reforms which can really deliver a Europe that works."
"Christmas aside, much is said in the text, but there is also much that is not said."
"The Community patent, GALILEO, immigration and asylum are all absent from the chapter on decisions and Mr Lannoye has mentioned other examples."
"What is perhaps more dangerous is the persistent silence on the overall budgetary implications of transforming 'community' Europe, which herald difficult meetings with the people."
"And in spite of this, the atmosphere that surrounds the Laeken Declaration is, indisputably, a positive atmosphere."
"This tells you how important the positive aspects are compared to those that do not figure in the results."
"Other Members, in addition to myself, have reiterated, and will once again reiterate, that the Belgian Presidency, which had ambitious objectives and was tenacious in its action, remained focused - somewhat more than the euro anyhow - both before 11 September and after."
"For those who are familiar with international relations, this is incredibly significant, not only for Belgium but for the Union as a whole."
"Prime Minister, we appreciate the role that you personally played in the solution found to the almost scandalous problem of the arrest warrant. It was not acceptable for the Prime Ministers and Heads of State of the Council Presidency to be exempt from this issue."
"Furthermore, it is obvious that the Socialists attach particular importance to the progress made in social matters: the confirmation of the role of structural indicators in employment, the support for the European social model, particularly through cooperation in the area of pensions, the improved understanding of social exclusion and social involvement are important achievements for the people of Europe."
"Lastly, let me turn to the Convention, which has already been the focus of attention of so many Members. I would simply like to say this: the statements made today illustrate the formidable task facing the Convention."
"Therefore, its composition is most crucial and, except on one point, the decisions taken, and especially the innovative measures, are important achievements."
"The same goes for the representation of the candidate countries."
"Full participation, without the right to vote, is more in keeping with the dignity of a State, and this question has, wisely, been linked, in the texts in any case, to that of the regions with legislative power. Contrary to what was said earlier, we also recognise that these regions have the status that they deserve."
"Parliament also attaches importance to the role you grant civil society."
"And I wish to stress the value of the presidential troika system that you have chosen, which, in my view, meets the current needs much better, and goes far beyond the issues linked to the individuals chosen, individuals that I do not intend to discuss right now."
"All three are men deserve a great deal of admiration, but the problem, Prime Minister, arises from the fact that they are all men."
"And therefore, as many previous speakers have during this festive season, I would like to express the wish that the European summit will one day learn, in as many languages as you like, to understand, appreciate, state, perhaps even conjugate much better, on the threshold of the 21st Century, one little word which is no longer established in poetry alone but in politics as well. That word is 'woman' ."
"Mr President, Mr Verhofstadt, at the end of your Presidency, the situation is now very different from one year ago: the atmosphere has changed completely."
"We can roll up our sleeves, and you have indeed put three men in charge."
"I am interested to see how many members the delegation of the European Parliament will have in the Convention."
"We will count them when the time has come."
"You have tabled the questions, a great many questions and the right ones, in my view."
"Maybe we could add the odd question here and there. Why not?"
"In my opinion, the Convention should have that flexibility."
"You outlined a dream a moment ago."
"In my view, it was a very fitting account, a very attractive prospect of what we ought to do, not only we Western Europeans, the Fifteen, but also Eastern Europe and the rest of the world."
"However, I would like to ask one more thing, Mr President-in-Office."
"You have now held the Council Presidency for six months."
"We now face seven years in which the Belgian Government will not be President again. I would ask you to convince all your Ministers of the fact that, during those seven years, European work is of extreme importance, that the government should not only occupy itself with European issues during the Presidency but also mainly outside of that time, for that period is longer and, most of all, certainly as important."
"Mr President, the Laeken European Council has dragged us from the dreadful quagmire which Nice had led us into."
"Not only from the point of view of the concrete results achieved, but also from the psychological and morale points of view."
"Of course, there were frankly discouraging moments at Laeken."
"I am convinced that neither Mr Chirac nor Mr Berlusconi have learnt a thing from the experience of Nice."
"Furthermore, they were not the only ones who were prepared to risk the solidarity of Community cohesion for the sake of agencies, several of which have neither a legal basis nor any real purpose."
"And what a striking contrast we have seen between the stimulating content of the Laeken declaration and the haggling over agencies."
"But in reality the European Union is still vacillating between these two poles: on the one hand, the lack of progress resulting from the thinking and the interests of the national States, and on the other the zeal and enthusiasm arising from the desire to complete the construction of the European Union."
"The challenge represented by the Laeken declaration, and which must be taken up by the Convention, is precisely to tip the balance in favour of strengthening democracy, efficiency and cohesion on a European level."
"The questions posed are good, and it is very good not to have any taboos."
"It is a good thing that the Constitution was discussed in the Laeken declaration."
"But it is the responses which count and we have not yet won."
"Personally, I see at least two elements of concern during these days following Laeken."
"The first concerns the Convention."
"It is not only through corporatism that I profoundly regret that the balance between the national and European dimensions is being broken and that for 28 governments there are just 16 European parliamentarians."
"I do not believe that we will be able to distinguish between the Convention and the IGC unless we manage to change national thinking."
"Secondly, the membership of the praesidium."
"Why continue with this system whereby only former Heads of State and Government, normally men, and some older than others, can dictate the destiny of Europe?"
"I would have preferred a parliamentary way of thinking, and we would have preferred the Convention to have chosen its own President, or - better still - its own woman President."
"The second element of concern is represented by the episodes of street violence and expulsions, which, though in a different way to Nice or Genoa, also took place in and around Laeken."
"I am not sure whether, if there had been more consistent demonstrations in terms of the demonstrators, we would really have prevented serious problems."
"The European Parliament has the task of ensuring, in a coherent and untiring fashion, that the strengthening of cooperation in the fields of terrorism and crime does not lead to a weakening of the rights of citizens."
"It has to be said that the message and practice stemming from Laeken are contradictory."
"However, the future will tell whether the seed sown at Laeken will bear fruit."
"For the moment, we must thank the Belgian Presidency for its work and hope that subsequent presidencies will show the same commitment and coherence."
"Mr President, I should first like to offer the praise I think is due."
"I am extremely pleased that the Presidency has stood by enlargement and the whole programme of enlargement, that there is a continued commitment to concrete negotiations' beginning as from 2002 and that we are aiming to admit the first new Member States in 2004."
"That praise, I think, is due."
"However, I do not understand the way in which the leadership of the Convention has been put together."
"The composition is incredibly one-sided, and we have a huge need for bridge-building in this project."
"Where are the critics?"
"We have had a 'no' vote in Ireland; we have had a 'no' vote in Denmark, admittedly a number of years ago; and we know that there is dissatisfaction among the peoples of Europe."
"Where are the critics?"
"What has become of young people and, especially, women where this issue is concerned?"
"When Mr Prodi was asked by Danish television what had become of women and young people, he called for honesty and said that, if the EU was to talk with government leaders, it needed men over the age of 30."
"If that is the attitude towards how we are to make contact with the people of Europe, then 'thank you for nothing' is what I say."
"With regard to the anti-terrorism package, I do not understand why the aim is not to adopt an independent European stance on this issue. I do not understand why there is once again the desire to be the puppy of the United States."
"I do not understand why we do not concentrate much more on preventing future terrorism instead of taking the line adopted by the United States."
"Mr President, the Laeken Declaration is punctuated by question marks: a sign of the ambiguity which currently exists in relation to the future of the European Union."
"Needless to say, the new Convention cannot provide answers to all those questions."
"That is why, in my view, priority should be given to improving transparency and a clear demarcation of powers between the European Union and the Member States."
"I was pleasantly surprised by the content of the questions concerning this latter point."
"It seems that there are no taboo subjects, if even the creeping transfer of powers in the direction of Brussels can be questioned."
"I was also surprised, but not pleasantly, by the composition of the Convention' s praesidium: no fewer than twelve people are supposed to make up the total."
"I wonder, then, what the role of an ordinary Convention member is."
"Not a significant one, I fear."
"However, this jeopardises the quality of the proposals which this body makes."
"The Convention will be relying on quality. Otherwise, its ideas will simply be put away in a drawer and forgotten about."
"Mr President, in defining the agenda for the Convention on the future of the Union, the Laeken Council has deviated from the conclusions of the Nice Council with regard to two points which concern us."
"Firstly, whereas Nice declaration No 23 had included in the agenda a point entitled 'The role of national parliaments in the architecture of Europe' , the Laeken Council has watered down that idea under a much vaguer title: 'More democracy, transparency and efficiency in the European Union' ."
"Under this title, it first of all asks how we can increase the democratic legitimacy of the current institutions and, only in second place, whether the role of the national parliaments needs to be modified."
"It is a largely biased approach, since in reality the two questions are just one: recognising a prominent role for national parliaments within the architecture of Europe is the best way to reconcile the Union with its citizens."
"Second modification: whereas Nice mentioned the status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in a purely neutral way, Laeken includes another idea in the agenda, the idea of a European constitution, that is, a clearly supranational fundamental text rather than a treaty."
"It therefore appears, Mr President, that between Nice and Laeken, the federalist pressure groups have taken charge."
"They have managed to have modifications adopted, very significantly, which are both aimed at minimising the role of national democracies."
"This approach does not correspond with the wishes of our citizens and it will have to be corrected in the years to come."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even considered rather dispassionately, it is possible that the Laeken Summit will one day appear to be a waypoint at which the Europeans stopped stumbling along, found their feet again and set out to find a way out of the blind alley of Nice."
"If this proves to be the case - we are just at the beginning of this process - then this would certainly be associated with the Belgian Presidency and your name, Mr Verhofstadt, and I am quite happy to congratulate you on this now in advance, just in case!"
"There are two reasons for this development, and it is useful to run over them once more."
"What caused this to happen?"
"Certainly the strong, even damning, criticism of the outcome of Nice was a factor."
"The European Parliament played a vital role here; this House was the source of the vast majority of the criticism directed towards Nice, although we recognise and acknowledge the fact that the formal conditions for enlargement were agreed on there."
"My second point is that the events of 11 September and everything which happened in their wake have made it more than clear that Europe will only be taken seriously in the future if it acts as a community and that we need to get back on track and work towards developing as a community."
"These are the two reasons."
"Now we have the Convention which we wanted, and we are therefore also responsible for what emerges from it."
"We must not overlook this."
"The outcome of the Convention will only carry political weight if it is supported by as broad a consensus as possible."
"That is why we need to make our contribution in the Convention to producing a draft treaty which has broad support."
"Only then will it afterwards stand a chance of also uniting the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Parliament wanted this Convention, and now we have got it."
"We share in this success, and have you to thank for it having been possible."
"The Convention's flaws have been alluded to here several times, but we can and will take care that these blemishes are insignificant and will be forgotten by the time the work is done."
"My second remark follows on from what Mr Nassauer said: the Convention puts Parliament, too, in a new position of responsibility."
"The reform of the institutions is, for the first time, in our hands too."
"We bear responsibility no longer only for the demands and visions that we develop here, but also for the compromises and results."
"That is something new and we will have to get used to it."
"My third point is that the Convention has been given the broad mandate we wanted it to have."
"That is an opportunity and a danger in equal measure."
"The Convention must not turn itself into an expanded Intergovernmental Conference, but likewise it must not reduce itself to the level of being just a forum for discussion."
"It must work towards broad consensus and must concentrate its attention on those strategic proposals for reform that point the way ahead to future developments and open up the road that leads to them."
"Fourthly, the word 'constitution' is now to be found for the first time in an official Council document, which is quite something."
"It is not certain whether a draft constitution will be the final result, but what we can be sure of is that the Convention must direct all its efforts at what we - borrowing the expression of that great European, the German philosopher Immanuel Kant - might call the Convention's categorical imperative, that every one of its proposals must also be capable of becoming a basic component of a European constitution."
"It is towards that goal that it must work."
"Fifthly, Europe is becoming ever more important, yet of decreasing interest to its own citizens."
"They are, admittedly, not yet opposed to the European Union, but they are no longer so sure why they are meant to be in favour of it."
"We want Europe's citizens to regain the knowledge of why we are uniting Europe."
"The European Union must stand for a European model of society and for a European world vision."
"What we are about is Europe's self-assertion - economic, political and, not least, cultural - and the preservation of a European way of life!"
"This has acquired an added dimension since 11 September."
"The EU could be sunk by this new challenge, but it could grow through it - indeed, I am quite sure that it will."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, first of all, I would like to apologise to the Members of the European Parliament since I must shortly leave for Canada."
"There is another European Union-Canada Summit."
"In order to get there on time, I must leave for the airport at 7.00 p.m."
"It is for this reason that myself and Romano Prodi, since we are leaving for Canada together, must apologise for not being able to participate in the debate until the end."
"I apologise to all the Members, especially those MEPs with whom I have had very intense contacts over recent weeks and months: Mr Brok, Mr Méndez de Vigo, the chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Mr Napolitano."
"I am sorry that I will not be able to hear them speak, but in any event I hope to continue the contacts we have established in order to prepare this Convention properly."
"At the beginning of the debate - and I should like to thank various group leaders for their support and their words of praise for the Belgian Presidency - there were a few jokey comments to the effect that the Convention and its praesidium consist of nothing but Socialists and Christian Democrats, and that the only Liberal among them, namely Mr Giscard d'Estaing, has, in fact, transferred to the Christian-Democrats."
"I, for my part, am quite happy for the Socialists and Christian Democrats to dominate the Convention. It may not be strictly my place to say this, but perhaps I am allowed this leeway at the end of the Presidency."
"Mr Poettering, there are currently two Liberals in the Council, as opposed to none before. Maybe, with your help, the President of the European Parliament and the President of the Commission will also be Liberals."
"So, in fact, we as Liberals are not too badly represented in the European institutions."
"Some speakers have questioned the link between the Laeken Declaration and the Nice process."
"There should not be a common link. Nice is to be adopted;"
"Nice is to be ratified. This is necessary to allow enlargement to work at a practical level as from 2004."
"It would be a big mistake if we did not do this and if Nice were to be once again mixed up with the Laeken Declaration and the future of Europe."
"We would then once again talk about the Nice leftovers instead of the future of Europe."
"The great advantage of the Convention is that it breaks with traditional methods precisely at this moment."
"The old method entailed establishing, after each treaty amendment, that agreement had not been reached on two or three points, and these two or three points would then be transferred to the next Intergovernmental Conference, which would add a few fresh points and which would try to change the Treaty in the same way."
"If agreement was not reached at that stage, fresh leftovers would be created."
"The past decade of the European Union has been marked by a history of constantly moving from leftover to leftover, the swill becoming lighter and lighter each time, and the fundamental questions losing weight all the time."
"This mechanism is now being discontinued. This time round, fundamental questions will be put forward."
"Mrs Thyssen has stated that these are merely questions that I am posing and for which Mr Dehaene will need to provide the answers."
"It is actually quite simple."
"Mr Dehaene has helped me draft the questions, and I will now return the favour and help him give the answers in the coming months."
"This is also what will actually happen."
"The Laeken group is a group of which Mr Dehaene and Mr Amato form a part."
"This group will always continue to work as a group of friends and, on that basis, a number of additional incentives can be given, involving Mr Delors, Mr Geremek, Mr Miliband and the other members."
"(FR) I would also like to say to the President that it was not desire which was lacking when it came to responding immediately to the questions posed."
"My colleagues have often said to me, 'no, it is not a question you can ask' ."
"I would say, 'why?'"
"'Because the answer is implied in the question' ."
"Nevertheless, Mrs Thyssen and all the other Members who have spoken can rest assured that I am going to do my best in the Intergovernmental Conference, in the regular contacts I will have with the various members of the praesidium and the Convention, to help to find the answers to the questions posed in the declaration."
"With regard to the membership of the praesidium, there has been mention of the absence of women."
"I completely agree and I propose that three men and nine women now be designated by the national parliaments and the European Parliament."
"All is not lost yet, since only three of the twelve places have been allocated."
"I also truly hope that the European Parliament, the national parliaments and the various representatives will be able to do this."
"I would like to end by saying something about the relationship between the European Parliament and the national parliaments."
"I believe that what is very important is that a praesidium has been created, that that praesidium consists of twelve people and that amongst those twelve people, two will be representatives of the European Parliament."
"The same number will represent the national parliaments."
"I believe that these two people are going to have to play an important role, because it will be this group of twelve which prepares things, which prepares the agendas."
"Not all the decisions can be taken by a Convention of 113 people."
"It must be prepared."
"The praesidium is going to play a dominating role in this respect and in that praesidium there will naturally be two representatives of the European Parliament."
"Finally, I would like to stress that I believe it is very important that for the first time there will also be representation in the Convention from the so-called constitutional regions, but the more exact term is 'regions with legislative powers' ."
"I am the Prime Minister of a country with a federal structure."
"It is the same in Germany, in Austria and in other countries."
"Little by little, many other countries are beginning to adopt federalism within their institutional system."
"And it is working well, because federalism is the only way we have to allow different communities, different cultures and populations who speak different languages to live together, without giving rise to what happens in other parts of the world, where there is conflict."
"I would therefore like to stress that we should not use the word 'federalism' in a negative sense."
"I sometimes hear people say that federalism spells disaster."
"Quite the opposite."
"Throughout the world, federalism demonstrates that it is the only way for communities to live together without conflict, without turning to violence, as is the case in many parts of the world."
"(Applause) And it is for that reason that I personally believe it is important and an enormous step forward that the regions with legislative powers can be represented."
"I have achieved this because I have also been helped by the President of the Committee of the Regions."
"I do not need to tell you that around the Council table there were certain people who found it difficult to include the words 'regions with legislative powers' in the declaration and difficult to recognise, as the European Council, that those regions may have a place and a say."
"It has finally been accepted and that is thanks to the President of the Committee of the Regions, Mr Chabert, whom I had asked to send me a letter."
"The letter which he had sent me said: the Committee of the Regions must be represented and we must demand that the different members of the Committee of the Regions be represented."
"The regions and cities, but also the regions with administrative powers."
"I have therefore been able to use the authority of the Committee of the Regions to include these regions in the text for the first time."
"I wanted to stress this here this afternoon, since I feel that they have an important role to play."
"There will be discussion of the distribution of competences, the new instruments, institutions and the future European constitution."
"I personally believe that we must do this together, excluding nobody, and allowing every section of our European Union to express its view."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be very brief, firstly because I do not want Mr Verhofstadt to go without me and I have no desire to swim to Canada, and secondly because I can say with satisfaction that this debate was a debate of great unity, a moment of satisfaction, given that, a few months ago, none of us imagined that a Convention was possible."
"I also welcome the fact that the issue of reaching agreement on the agencies, although certainly a negative point, was not blown out of all proportion as it was in the mass media."
"I have also noted the suggestions you have made on the subject of the Convention;"
"I have noted the proposals to strengthen the role of the Court of Justice: I will bear them all in mind in the future and I therefore feel that we can now genuinely get down to working hard, all together, to prepare for the forthcoming Convention."
"Given that we are working in this atmosphere of cooperation, I would just like to make one request - or rather, reiterate a call that I have already made to the Council - to my friend Mr Verhofstadt, for genuine cooperation in the forthcoming months so that we can reform the institutions without amending the Treaties."
"Our proposal on governance is the fruit of many months of cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, work which, in my opinion, has produced sound, tangible results."
"We expect similar commitment from the Council, for the preparations for the Convention have to consist of prior work carried out together: our work on governance, which has yielded positive results and certainly cannot progress without equal input from the Council."
"Lastly, I would like to wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!"
"Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Prodi, of course we understand why you are obliged to leave the House at this point."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with Laeken we may have found an antidote to some of the poisons present in the Treaty of Nice."
"The convening of a constituent Convention - constituent because this Convention will give rise to the Constitution for the new Europe - means restoring a political soul to Europe, in other words thinking about what is to be the future home of us all."
"Parliament must therefore welcome the success of the Summit and make sure that the Convention' s work reaches its appropriate conclusion in an Intergovernmental Conference, which will have to draw up the new Constitutional Treaty, to bring about the European federation."
"Genuine, practical federalism, which also respects the regional level, as the Council has rightly said, which respects minority languages and all peoples, great and small, will burst into the history of this new century as part of the process of European integration, and anyone representing the people of the Valle d' Aosta can only rejoice at that."
"We have set a positive process in motion and the enemies of the European Union are already aware of this; we must therefore step up our efforts."
"Mr President, the Laeken declaration is couched in words which satisfy one and all, weighty words."
"The objective and method, the Convention and political negotiation, are indeed cause for satisfaction."
"However, as previous speakers have said, the declaration does not contain any convincing references to the social State, what some people somewhat sheepishly call the social model, sustainable development, viable development, autonomy and hence, if I may put it thus, a viable Union profile."
"Maybe the lack of political unification is to blame for this degree of cowardice."
"But it is interesting that we have said nothing of any import about the war and we have said nothing of any import about enlargement itself."
"I should like to make a comment here, if I may."
"Why does the purely political decision to accept ten new members exclude - politically that is - two from the Balkan peninsula, from the heart and soft underbelly of Europe?"
"We have left a black hole in the Balkans."
"It is unacceptable and I should like an answer."
"Unfortunately, I probably will not get one now or even, I fear, from the Convention."
"Mr President, the conclusions from the Laeken Summit are by no means surprising in terms either of their rhetoric or their content."
"As usual, the rhetoric is high-flown and hollow at one and the same time."
"For the umpteenth time, openness and proximity to the people are promised."
"The words chosen falsify what really is the case in a way that, in terms of cynical demagogy, would put to shame the ideologues both of the Third Reich and of Stalinism."
"The reality has proved to be completely different, for the summit' s declared ambition that the institutions of the EU should be brought closer to the people turns out in reality to mean that the people of the Member States are ever more excluded by the closed institutions of the EU, which have fatally misunderstood the nature of democracy."
"Moreover, the renewed missions are being placed in the hands of three pensioners of an age that makes Chinese statesmanship look like a youth rebellion."
"There is no doubt that these three worthy men will be able to step up the dynamic of EU integration, but there are more and more of us who doubt that the EU and its ambitions to be a great power are any kind of solution. On the contrary, they constitute the very problem."
"Mr President, let me say first of all that I appreciate the way we can talk to each other here in a fairly intimate atmosphere."
"There is no doubt that it is easier to ask important questions than to find the answers to them."
"The President's statement notwithstanding, all of us can only wish these answers to be found, but I want to make allowances all the same for the fact that Laeken saw a very important task performed, that of getting the Convention on track with a president who is not only distinguished but whose appointment also augurs well for the future."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights was our most recent opportunity to learn that the success of such a process largely depends on who presides over it, so let me say that the youthful attire of the President-in-Office led me to fear that the Convention would be given a rather 'young' and 'dynamic' chair."
"Unlike Mrs Frassoni and Mr Bonde, I was therefore rather pleased to learn that we were still going to give preference to the opinions of those older and wiser - something which marks out the higher cultures."
"The inauguration of the Convention was, though, the only outstanding achievement."
"Speaking from an Austrian point of view, I find Point 59 regrettable on the grounds that it has turned out to be very narrow and does not do justice to the need for Europe-wide safety standards."
"Mr President, I would like to focus on two results of Laeken which I believe to be essential."
"The first is the recognition that the consolidation of the third pillar of the European Union, the fight against terrorism in particular, has at last been developed in the way the citizens have been demanding."
"The terrible attacks have led even the least aware amongst us to realise that terrorism is a problem for all of us, and that it involves all of us, not just the victims directly affected."
"And that terror is not only caused by those who pull the trigger or press the detonator, but also by their accomplices, and we should therefore be pleased with the Council' s decision to create a single list of all groups, bodies and people who support terrorism."
"Secondly, the decisions adopted in relation to designing the future of the Union seem to me to be very coherent with the demands of the European Parliament."
"I am convinced that the flexibility with which the agenda has been set will allow us to strengthen the instruments of the CFSP during the Convention, because the globalised world in which we live demands that Europe should play a new role and we have provided it with the necessary means to do this, such as the Community diplomatic service."
"Mr President, I do not believe that the machine has worked properly, but I assume that my speaking time is over."
"Mr President, Minister, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, of the huge number of problems dealt with at Laeken, I would also like to focus on the point which brings us most hope, the declaration on the future of the Union."
"It is a good and strong declaration, which takes up several of the ideas to which the French Socialist delegation is very committed."
"We are happy to see that the praesidium, which will play a determining role, will be reasonably large, twelve people, which is what we wanted, and it will be led by three strong political personalities whose commitment to Europe is beyond question."
"And as a French person, I am delighted to see that in the end an eminent countryman of mine will preside over the group; though an eminent countrywoman would clearly have been better perhaps."
"We also approve of the fact that the Commission is represented, not by one commissioner, but by two, who as it happens are both perfectly qualified for that task."
"Another good piece of news is that the timetable will be flexible, so that the Convention may enjoy greater freedom."
"Finally, we welcome the broad mandate that the Heads of State and Government have granted the Convention."
"And we congratulate the Belgian Prime Minister on the firmness with which he has managed to apply this open mandate to many issues which go beyond the purely mechanical institutional field."
"It is to this end that I would like to request something: the Convention will have to propose institutional reforms aimed at making the mechanisms work better."
"This is all very well, but it can and must also make proposals on content, in response to those questions which the citizens often ask without receiving a clear reply."
"What is Europe for?"
"What are its great missions, within its borders, for its inhabitants, but also in the world?"
"Which policies is it responsible for leading, particularly in the social field?"
"What are its competences?"
"What are its duties in relation to its inhabitants and the rest of the world in terms of solidarity, prosperity and security?"
"Under the guidance of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, the results relating to this declaration are good."
"The Presidency has provided strong impetus, very much helped by Parliament as well, which has given it constant encouragement."
"The Laeken Council has launched this Convention into orbit, and it can play a decisive role for the future of Europe."
"The future will tell whether Laeken has been an historic turning point."
"Mr President, Mr Verhofstadt spoke a lot about the need to improve democratic control."
"But we do not need to change the Treaties to improve democratic control."
"We can do that using the existing Treaties."
"I am not talking about applying Article 42 to bring the third pillar matters into the first pillar, although that would be very desirable."
"I am talking about instances such as that last week where Parliament was consulted for the fourth time in a year on a text of which half was missing."
"We were asked to approve a regulation to freeze the assets of a list of terrorist organisations; the list was not attached."
"The regulation referred to two Council texts, neither of which is available to Parliament."
"We voted on amendments covering the absent documents in view of the urgency, but if that text is not amended and, in view of this practice, Parliament really should consider recourse to the European Court of Justice unless Council is prepared to treat us in a fairer and more adult way."
"Mr President, the writing on the wall states quite clearly that the Laeken Summit has bolstered a European Union in which big business takes precedence over the interests of the workers and the people in general."
"The delegates in Laeken Palace did not hear the stentorian voice of the hundreds of thousands of demonstrators from all over Europe: the voice of the poor, of the unemployed, of the people with no job security and of the victims of soul-destroying exploitation who actually create our wealth."
"They did not and could not hear their fight and their demand for a different Europe, a Europe of peace and friendship between nations, not a Europe of European armies, intervention and war, a Europe in which social rights and democratic freedoms are respected and strengthened, not a Europe of European arrest warrants, Eurojust and the law on terrorism which use 11 September as a pretext for classifying the social and political fight for a better tomorrow as terrorism."
"That is why I believe that the Convention is not the answer; anyway it is an advisory forum and will, I fear, just end up pulling the wool over the people's eyes."
"Continuing and developing the unprecedented wave of protest which surrounded Laeken is our only hope and our only way out."
"Mr President, I am concerned that the European Constitution is going to be drafted by just 60 people, who it is to be hoped will be worthy of the task but are still a small number to represent hundreds of millions of citizens."
"A constituent assembly would have been more appropriate."
"In this regard, it is significant that the vice-president is to be Giuliano Amato, who is a member of the Italian and European left but, most importantly, an advocate of that oligarchic desire to have the institutions run just by a few aristocrats, by a small, unelected elite."
"We hope that, at least, once the Constitution has been drafted, it will be possible for both national parliaments and this House to amend it, where necessary, unlike the situation with the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Mr President, at Laeken, a number of steps forward have, at last, been taken towards the creation of a stronger Europe with wider borders."
"The Convention will have to pave the way for a Constitution which establishes the respective competences of the institutions and includes the founding values underlying our Union as well, but it will also have to represent an essential stage in terms of the harmonisation of the laws of our countries, not least in judicial matters."
"However, we must make haste and decide before the end of 2003 to avoid the elections getting in the way of the process and the Constitution being adopted slap-bang in the middle of the electoral campaign."
"Without the Constitution, without new institutions, it will be difficult to achieve the enlargement which we all, like President Prodi, see as irreversible."
"Moreover, I welcome the fact that the Laeken conclusions reserve a chapter for relations with Russia, a country which deserves increasing attention from the Union."
"At Laeken, Europe, at last, spoke out authoritatively on major issues such as combating terrorism, and the decision to adopt what has been dubbed the first 'Marshall Plan' for Palestine is confirmation of Europe' s intention not just to wipe out terrorism through military force - as is right and proper - but also to resolve the issues by political means."
"The Italian proposal on resolving the Israeli-Palestinian crisis has moved on from declarations of principle to the practical planning stage."
"Moreover, we feel that the decision to establish joint control of external borders is extremely positive."
"Of course, there is still a great deal left to do."
"Not all the issues were resolved at Laeken: I refer to the sites of the agencies, which should be decided on the basis of the specific suitability of the applicant cities and not allocated on the basis of incomprehensible vetoes."
"However, it is our duty to be optimistic: the fate of Europe depends not least on our will, on the will of the European Parliament and the national parliaments which represent the people of the Union."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the European Council's Laeken Declarations express the opinion that the European project derives its legitimacy from its democratic, transparent and efficient institutions."
"The Council having then put the question - which it asked the Convention to discuss - whether Parliament should play an enhanced role, it will probably not surprise you that I, as a parliamentarian, answer that unreservedly in the affirmative, for this Parliament is the only one of the institutions to be directly elected by the people."
"All its sittings are in public and comprehensible - I wish the Council's were - and the speed with which we are capable of reaching decisions - on the European arrest warrant for example - leads me to the conclusion that we are more efficient than the Council and, in many ways, even more so than the Commission."
"So, when the Council at Laeken welcomes the Commission's White Paper on European governance and the so-called Mandelkern report and expects an action plan on the subject from the Commission in the first half of 2002, I hope that, when doing so, the Council has in mind the intention of strengthening Parliament's role ."
"Quite apart from that, we would, as parliamentarians, be happy to discuss new forms of governance with the Commission and the Council."
"So, for example, the Commission has proposed an interinstitutional working party, but I gather that the Council has so far found that unacceptable and has declined to take part in it."
"I hope we can at least manage, before Barcelona and Seville, to have in-depth discussions with the Council and the Commission on new forms of governance, which will not even be conceivable without Parliament's consent."
"I am aware that many governments find us too independent and self-sufficient, and the Commission and the Council are sometimes disturbed by our excessive 'interference' in details."
"As a Parliament, we are also prepared to accept new ways of dividing up the work between ourselves, the Commission and the Council, for we too must prepare ourselves for an enlarged EU."
"We take the view, though, that any delegation of tasks must involve a call-back mechanism, for the search for new forms of European governance and the consideration of new divisions of competences between the EU and the Member States must not be at the expense of European parliamentary life."
"On the contrary, Parliament's role must be solidly entrenched in the European constitution."
"Let me make one last comment on what we call civil society."
"The European Council has decided to set up a forum, something for which Mr Barnier, in his role as Commissioner, has frequently and with verve expressed his open support."
"We welcome the establishment of such a forum, but, just as a forum of this sort supplements the deliberations of the Convention rather than supplanting them, so civil society and discussions within it do not replace Parliament, but add something to it."
"It is in this sense that we very much desire dialogue with civil society and with our citizens, and we hope that the Council and the Commission do not see this as over against Parliament, but as an addition to it."
"Mr President, the Laeken declaration set the scene for a broad public discussion about the future of Europe."
"That is a good thing."
"What is not, however, good enough is that three men are being employed to head up this work."
"Experience all goes to show that the composition of the Convention will also be one-sided."
"The Laeken declaration states, moreover, that deputies may only be allowed to step in if the right member is absent."
"Yet deputising is one of the classic opportunities women have for obtaining any kind of representation when it comes to this type of work."
"I must therefore call upon the Belgian and Spanish Presidencies to arrange matters in such a way that it is permitted to call in deputies and - rather more ambitiously - call upon them to arrange for everyone to be represented by a deputy of the opposite sex."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at this point I would like to respond to certain comments you have made."
"I must also, unfortunately, have to ask you to excuse me, but I did not imagine that we were going to overrun to this extent, and I have another commitment, also relating to this debate on the future of Europe."
"I clearly do not agree with all the views expressed by Mr Krarup on the pompous rhetoric of Laeken."
"On the contrary, I believe that the Convention method completely opens up the game."
"I believe that one of the elements, one of our possible fears in relation to this Laeken declaration, is that it does not commit the members of the Convention to certain closed questions, or in any event does not allow all the issues which are vital to the future of Europe to be dealt with."
"The same speaker spoke of a lack of democracy."
"I would therefore like to reply to him, as well as to Mr Swoboda, who contrasts the representative or democratic characteristics of the Council with those of the European Parliament."
"The European Parliament, Mr Swoboda, is a representative democratic institution, of course, and I respect it fully."
"But to therefore reduce the representative nature of the Council is going too far."
"(Protests from Mr Swoboda)"
"That is what I understood you to say, and, though I have misunderstood, all the same I am going to say that I think the Ministers or Prime Ministers who attend Councils can be questioned in each Member State."
"There are national parliaments for that."
"I can tell you that I am ill-treated in my country, because almost every week, at least when I am there, I am asked what I do in the European institutions."
"I believe that this is not the right debate in which to establish a hierarchy in terms of the representativeness of the institutions."
"Each institution has its place."
"I willingly concede that the important thing is that we establish a balance between the institutions, that one institution does not completely dominate another."
"I am very happy to say, for example, that my current experience of the European Parliament has convinced me that it must undoubtedly have more powers and play a more important specific role in the future than it does at the moment."
"And in particular - and I am straying from the current debate for a second - in terms of what we can expect if the international coalition continues as it is, if it continues to play a role, if we continue to believe that it is necessary, and I believe that it is necessary in order to combat terrorism, the European Parliament must closely monitor the decisions made by European Councils and also by the Member States of the Union, because as I have said previously, and I will continue to repeat, there are several dangers in this respect."
"Firstly there is the danger of corrupting the quality of democracy and of life in our countries."
"The second danger, which I am very sensitive to, is that, for a certain number of political regimes, the fight, and I am not talking about European States here, but it does concern us in terms of our relations with these countries, for a certain number of countries with tough regimes, there is a temptation to confuse the fight against terrorism with a fight against the country' s democratic opponents, against the country' s opposition."
"We must clearly take this into account."
"Thirdly, Mr Lannoye has just mentioned the relationship between the European Union and the United States."
"We must also be careful in this respect."
"I believe that we should not be automatically led along, without debate, without discussion, without even, at times, consultation, in blind solidarity with the United States."
"I believe that the European Union has the right and the duty to express its differences with the United States."
"I have total respect for the United States, I believe that we undoubtedly have a special partnership with the United States, but I believe that in the coalition put together after 11 September, it was good that the European Union was there to express a slightly different approach, to express certain guarantees and assurances, and also to play the role that the European Union has played within the Arab countries, within the Islamic world."
"I do not therefore think that the European Union will ever become a kind of copy of the United States of America."
"I must tell you that I do not want that at all."
"Of course, I respect the American model."
"In many respects, it is extremely positive, but it is not transposable."
"It is not desirable to transpose it."
"And I believe that the European Union must retain its own character."
"Many questions have concerned the Convention."
"I must talk about the regrets concerning the composition of the trio heading the Convention."
"I believe that all three of the personalities involved are very committed to the European project and also have an extremely modern, forward-looking and committed view of the European Union and, something which is perhaps important, enjoy great reputations and a network of relations, academic, political and others, which may ensure that if they defend a point of view, they have a good chance of being heard, even by the European Council."
"This is of no small importance."
"I would like to say that the Convention, which is perhaps the greatest virtue of the Laeken declaration - and I have already had the opportunity to say this in the European Parliament -, will in reality become what the members of the Convention want to make of it."
"You have a praesidium which is not there pro forma, because it is a praesidium which counts."
"The number of people in this praesidium will ensure that it is heard."
"It is very representative of the different components of the Convention and of the European decision-making world."
"I therefore believe that with the trio in question, with this praesidium, the meetings will be well-organised, the meetings and the issues will be well-developed, and above all - and this morning I heard Mr Dehaene voice his opinion on this issue on the radio - I think that what will be important is that the options presented by the Convention to the IGC be clear, that they do not leave room for too many interpretations at the IGC."
"Of course, the IGC can accept them or refuse them."
"But what is certain is that, if these options are well-balanced, if they are specific, if they are well-targeted and if they are strongly supported, there will be little room for the Council to ignore them, otherwise the Council will not be fulfilling its political duty, or in any event it will be taking a risk."
"It will be at that point that the political responsibility of the Council will clearly be called into question."
"I therefore have great confidence in the way the Convention is going to develop."
"I will add another factor, which is that the Laeken declaration offers all of us who believe in a more integrated Europe a fantastic opportunity to engage in a little European pedagogy, in this respect at least."
"I am thinking in particular of young people."
"We must not only talk of perspectives, which is clearly very important, but at the same time we must try to educate young people in relation to Europe, to explain to them how we work, to explain to them that Europe deals much more directly with their concerns than people believe or than the press indicates."
"This is another way to use this Convention."
"I think that I have been clear about the Convention."
"The idea of a more integrated European diplomatic service has been mentioned."
"I believe that the conclusions of the summit contain a passage on consular cooperation."
"This is a start."
"The opening of common consulates will be a first step and I hope that we will go further."
"I share Mrs Lalumière' s view that the Convention should not only examine institutional issues but also the content of policies."
"Opinion polls indicate that our citizens are in favour of more resolute European actions in various fields, such as social policy, foreign and defence policy and environmental protection."
"I believe that the Convention should examine how we should respond to these expectations, by adjusting the competences and tasks of the Union if necessary."
"There has been mention of a social deficit."
"I think I can say - Mr Dehousse quite rightly pointed this out previously - that one of the aspects which has clearly been most successful during this Presidency is precisely the firm innovative progress made, because this is important, on a social level."
"Think for example of the social indicators, of the quality of employment."
"I believe that this is of importance."
"Think also of the European social conciliator."
"There are a whole series of completely new elements here which are genuine tools for supporting a real social policy which is more than just packaging or a facelift."
"The work carried out by Mrs Onckelinks from this point of view, with Mr van den Broek, is absolutely remarkable and they have played a crucial role, in our view at least, in the success of the Belgian Presidency."
"This is a fundamentally important element."
"To a certain extent this relates to what Mrs Lalumière has requested, which is that we clearly concern ourselves with more than the merely institutional issues."
"I said just a moment ago that I fully share that point of view."
"Unfortunately I cannot stay here much longer."
"I still want to say a word about governance and the reform of the Council."
"I agree with Mr Martin on the need to take measures without delay in order to bring the Union closer to its citizens and improve the functioning of the European institutions."
"The Convention will discuss measures which will lead to a modification of the Treaties in 2004."
"However, the Laeken European Council has highlighted measures which may be taken straight away."
"In this context, we have welcomed the White Paper on European Governance, as well as the Secretary-General of the Council' s intention to present proposals to the European Council in Barcelona aimed at improving the functioning of the Council."
"The European Council in Seville will draw operational conclusions from it."
"I think I have responded as fully as possible to the list of interventions which the Prime Minister has not yet been able to reply to."
"I hope that you will forgive me for not being able to stay."
"I am really sorry, especially since I enjoy being amongst you, because I have come to know this Parliament."
"I have heard many pertinent interventions here, which show a certain tendency towards freedom of expression and autonomy, and I have also noted an element which is rarely seen in national parliaments and that is that different kinds of interventions may be heard coming from a single group."
"There is a freedom and a freshness in this which I like very much."
"I hope that one day - as I have already said, but I will repeat it - I will be able to return to this House to refresh my spirit."
"Mr President, the President of the Council, Mr Verhofstadt, stated in his presentation that in Laeken there were no taboos whatsoever."
"However, it is crystal clear that the stateless-nations-taboo is more present today than ever before."
"But as Victor Hugo said, ""nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come"" ."
"Right now, the idea of self-determination is present in the Basque people' s mind."
"The present nation-states were born at a certain moment with an internal trend towards their transformation."
"The peoples and cultures of Europe on the contrary have no known date of birth."
"More importantly, there is no reason for their disappearance unless we condemn them to such a fate."
"As a matter of fact, their disappearance would be not only a loss to humanity but the demolition of the best basis for the political future of Europe."
"Mr President, the Representative of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Laeken European Council which concludes the Belgian Presidency of the Union has been a success."
"I do not say this out of courtesy or convenience but because I profoundly believe that the Heads of State and Government, over recent days, have sent the signal that the Europeans were waiting for, one of clarity and the rejection of pretence."
"The Laeken Summit has achieved its main ambition: to adopt a declaration on the future of Europe, opening the way to the future great reform of the Union."
"As the President-in-Office of the Council has stressed, there was no taboo at Laeken, no issue has been avoided, and I hope that this formula will become a reality, since European construction has too often been opaque, or at least the reserve of the initiated."
"Please allow me, on behalf of the French delegation of the PPE-DE Group, to express our pleasure at the nomination of Mr Valéry Giscard d'Estaing as president of the Convention, as well as Mr Giuliano Amato and Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene as vice-presidents."
"These eminent people are renowned for their experience and their determination to persuade people to favour a Europe which fully and democratically carries out its competences, but only its competences, which would be clearly defined."
"At a time when Europe has a currency, is being enlarged and is trying to provide globalisation with a soul and with values, it is high time that we reviewed our vision of public life and the relations between our citizens and their institutions at all levels."
"A new era was begun at Laeken. We are delighted."
"But there is still a long way to go. We must therefore continue with our efforts."
"Mr President, we are bringing the Belgian Presidency to a close, and that should surely be in the presence of the Council, normally speaking."
"The Belgian Presidency has been congratulated on the fact that the Ministers have attended the sittings so regularly, yet we are now evaluating their Presidency without any of the Council members being present."
"I would question the validity of continuing this debate."
"Whom are we actually addressing?"
"Well, that is for the subsequent speakers to decide."
"Mr President, after 11 September, we succeeded in cutting back on the leeway which terrorists had, by taking numerous and effective European measures."
"At the same time, we have realised that the security which we promote by doing this forms part of a greater security and that we essentially touch a deeper, more fundamental issue, namely the great inequality in this world, which often serves as a breeding ground for conflicts."
"If security is not shared, it has no chance of succeeding."
"One in five people in this world do not have access to basic education or basic health care."
"This requires a multilateral approach."
"At present, we notice how the United States, which has operated more multilaterally over the past few months, has now started to act more unilaterally again over the past few days by withdrawing from the ABM Treaty, and is also taking a far more unilateral course with regard to a number of other treaties."
"It is of the utmost importance for us, as Europe, to try to use this large coalition to exert pressure so that we continue to operate multilaterally: making enormous investments in new technologies and then winding up with too little funding, attention and energy to help fight poverty in the world is, of course, ultimately not the most effective way of achieving shared security."
"Aid is needed for the reconstruction of Afghanistan, once again with Europe at the helm, so that not only the military aspect is highlighted, but that shared security is sought via the route of reconstruction."
"The same applies, in fact, to the Middle East."
"Europe must exert pressure and not be frightened of having a military presence within NATO using its own institutional forms and organisation - the Convention will need to create an institutional form for this - but must at the same time also have the courage to commit itself to this shared security."
"And I wish this fundamental aspect had been slightly more underlined at the Laeken Summit."
"Although reference is made to the unilateral cancellation of the ABM Treaty by the US and to Europe' s leading role as the world' s greatest commercial power, we could, and should, do more about shared security."
"I would call on the Presidency and the Commission to continue to take initiatives in this area, also in the coming weeks, both with regard to the Middle East, the Balkans and Afghanistan."
"We are on the right track."
"There are tendencies towards unilateralism: let us not get drawn into this, let us persuade our allies to adopt a multilateral approach and give Europe a central role in this."
"Mr President, it has not been an easy task for the Belgian Presidency."
"Despite careful planning and many years of preparation, everything was brutally overturned after 11 September 2001."
"The developments in Afghanistan and the fight against terrorism have completely dominated the agenda."
"I had intended to congratulate the Belgians on nonetheless having done a very good job."
"Perhaps someone could pass that message on to the President-in-Office of the Council."
"Where Laeken is concerned, my group is pleased that the declaration was so ambitious."
"It poses the right questions and will enable the Convention to work constructively and with an open mind."
"Many of the questions formulated concerning, for example, the path towards a constitution and a clearer division of competences, coincide well with the agenda of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party."
"Despite their long experience and considerable commitment, there is nonetheless a certain amount of doubt about the three well-known statesmen appointed to the Bureau."
"Will these three gentlemen of quite mature years really be able to enthuse people, especially young people, when it comes to the debate about the future?"
"It would have been good to have had people of rather more mixed ages and, as many in this House have pointed out, a woman in the Bureau, for more than half of the population of the EU does in fact consist of women."
"Mr President, to the outside world, particularly the Netherlands, the Laeken Summit was a meeting of Heads of Government characterised by internal strife."
"Strife about who would become the president of the Convention and strife about which country would house which European agency."
"These two points completely dominated the Dutch media."
"Fortunately, however, something good came out of it as well."
"The European Summit has decided on the Convention and not only on the President and two Vice-Presidents, which I am happy about, but also about the tasks given to the Convention."
"Luckily, these are very broadly based."
"The Convention will need to better distribute and define the Union' s powers and will need to check how the system of treaties and Union legislation can be simplified and in which ways more democracy and transparency can be created in the Union."
"And concerning this transparency, I can already say that I, for one, opt for the European Council of Ministers' having the role of a senate, based on the model of the German Federal Council - a ministerial council which, by law, meets in public."
"The European Summit has also asked the Convention to develop an idea of a constitution for the Union and to incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into it."
"This is a very fine initial package. However, I would say at the same time that, in our view, more is needed."
"The Convention will also need to examine how the Second and Third Pillars can be accommodated within Community policy."
"Migration policy has already more or less been accommodated in this way, and policy on internal security is now the sector which is experiencing rapid growth at Community level since the dramatic events of 11 September."
"However, foreign and security policy is still intergovernmental, and Mr Solana' s role is made almost impossible, given the way the European Union is structured."
"We would also like to embed this policy, and it would be better if Mr Solana became Vice-President of the European Commission."
"Finally, this time round, the Summit has chosen a president and two vice-presidents for the Convention."
"The role could have been even more solid if the Convention itself had been able to choose its president on the recommendation of the Summit."
"There might then perhaps even have been a woman amongst them."
"As far as we are concerned, the Convention might also come up with the idea of choosing the President of the European Commission in future."
"This could be done by the European Parliament."
"The Belgian Presidency has faced a large number of problems, but the fact that it has brought the Convention to a conclusion ultimately makes me think positively about a Presidency that has been dogged by many problems."
"Mr President, great declarations and little progress, summits come and go and they are all the same."
"Apart from the expected launch of the Convention, Laeken has provided few concrete results."
"Happily, at Lisbon, Europe had defined new ambitions in terms of economic growth and employment."
"In relation to that essential objective, Laeken was content to reiterate the Lisbon decisions."
"It is better than nothing but takes us no further."
"In terms of fiscal coordination, Laeken takes us to the end of 2002, but it is becoming clear that at Feira, fiscal Europe met with an impasse."
"The Feira agreement should lead to the exchange of information between Member States."
"The day when each citizen will pay the tax laid down by its own parliament, any desire for fiscal harmonisation, and healthy fiscal competition, will come to nothing."
"Each Member State will redefine its own fiscal policy."
"The others will have to provide the required information so that each person is taxed according to his nationality."
"Certain dependent or associated territories balk at adopting the exchange of information."
"Switzerland and other third countries refuse the system because they regard it as violating banking secrecy."
"Like Austria, Luxembourg and perhaps some others will not implement Feira without an agreement which extends to important financial markets outside the Union."
"Deadlock is still assured."
"I appeal to President Prodi to propose a pay-as-you-earn system on savings revenue as a direct European tax."
"Such a system would be accepted by the public if it is in full discharge, that is to say that it exempts the citizen from any other additional tax."
"A pay-as-you-earn system would prevent the enormous bureaucratic system which an exchange of information would imply, but above all, such a European tax could be payable on European assets in the United States, Switzerland and other countries."
"This would increase the Union' s income and allow us to reduce the current national contributions."
"Mr President, take this idea on board, and you will really bring progress to Europe."
"Mainly thanks to the Belgian Presidency, the discussion on the future of Europe has been broadened to involve MEPs and it is becoming a public discussion."
"This is to be welcomed, but there is also a considerable risk of the Convention acquiring Babel-like features, because it is open to all topics and all opinions."
"In their Laeken Declaration, the Heads of Government have chosen fine words to say ultimately nothing."
"They have presented the many questions which they themselves had not been able to answer for ten years to a Convention which is only being given a few months to come up with the answers."
"It also remains to be seen whether the Convention can narrow the gulf between the EU and the people."
"People are not interested in the redistribution of power between the institutions."
"What people care about is the content of the decisions, rather than the level at which they are adopted."
"Europe is not served by a trench war between federalists and intergovernmentalists."
"More intensive cooperation in gradual steps is what is required."
"It will then transpire that the Community method is the only viable route to take."
"The ideological battle about Europe' s future only has losers."
"As far as I am concerned, Laeken should have stated this."
"Mr President, Laeken has opened the door to the development of a draft constitution on the basis of the Community method."
"The mandate is right for it, the procedure is suited to it, and whether something of the sort is achieved or not is up to the Convention itself."
"Nor can I join in the criticism levelled at the composition of the praesidium, believing as I do that the people at the top will no longer be in thrall to anyone, but will have only their own conceptions of the Europe of the future."
"This represents a great opportunity."
"We should not find fault with a person's age if that is a sign of an independence that can contribute much to the matter in hand."
"Apart from this, I think it extraordinarily important that the right technical conditions be achieved in this matter."
"It is of the essence that the secretariat is appointed by the Council, but with the possibility of consulting the Commission and Parliament."
"I believe it would be generous on the part of the Council to offer the Commission and Parliament truly balanced and equal representation on the secretariat in order to achieve the right working conditions on that basis."
"The technical aspects at the outset are sometimes decisive as regards the content resulting at the end."
"Of all enterprises, the European Council is surely the one most in need of reform, and it is making a start by concentrating on great matters such as the creation of the European Convention, in which it has been successful."
"If, though, it loses itself in detail through the General Affairs Council or Councils of Ministers not getting things straight, it makes itself look ridiculous."
"We again saw this, for example, over the issue of the agencies."
"So we can only recommend to future Presidencies of the Council that the precondition for success on the really big issues is that they should not deal with every triviality at a sitting of the European Council."
"Mr President, I welcome the outcome of the Laeken summit."
"On balance it is a very positive one."
"The decision to establish a European Convention paralleled by a forum for civil society is a historic one in its proportions."
"Never again will the future of Europe be decided behind closed doors, provided we do our work constructively in the Convention."
"I particularly welcome the possibility of a European constitution as a possible outcome."
"As has been said by Mr Verhofstadt, there should be no taboos in our debate and the idea of federalism and a constitution for Europe could guarantee the role of the citizens in small states better than any other form of governance."
"I endorse wholeheartedly the decision of the European summit to give its support to Yasser Arafat as the leader of the Palestinian people and I condemn without reservation the misuse of the Security Council veto in blocking the appointment of international observers to the Middle East conflict."
"These decisions, however, were tarnished by an unseemly squabble among some Member States about the location of European agencies which reflected the worst features of the old way of running Europe."
"I am also disappointed the Council did not give its explicit support for a legal framework for public services in the context of competition regulations, as the European Parliament urged."
"Finally, I also believe it was a serious mistake to back off from a decision to nominate a European Union peace-keeping force for Afghanistan under a UN mandate."
"This unfortunately now leaves this area to the dictates of the interests of the more powerful states on the world stage and fails to provide a political presence and role for European values."
"Could I finally say that we should ease up a little on the ageism in relation to the praesidium."
"I am more interested in the originality or old age of the ideas of these three individuals rather than their chronological age."
"I do think, however, that had we tried, we could have found an older woman who could have also made an important contribution to the praesidium."
"Mr President, apart from the fact that it is only partially present in this House, I believe we must acknowledge that the Belgian Presidency has not disappointed and that it has been up to the job of dealing with these clearly very difficult circumstances."
"I believe that they have thoroughly understood that the task of a Presidency is to bring together wills, to forge consensus, so that the European Union may move ahead."
"The decisions taken in relation to the declaration on the future of Europe, in relation to the Convention method, in relation to making the common security and defence policy operative, the declarations on the Middle East peace process, Afghanistan, etc. and above all, in relation to the fight against terrorism, are going to allow the European Union to move forward and make progress."
"What we have to do now is turn declarations into deeds, so that our actions do not remain merely rhetorical, particularly in relation to the fight against terrorism."
"I believe that the views of the terrorists and their friends, who very much disliked the decisions taken at Laeken, clearly demonstrate that we are moving in the right direction."
"What we now have to do, once we have consolidated the internal aspects of our project, is turn Europe into an international operator capable of comprehensive action with regard to the challenges facing the world, a world in which nations are too big to resolve their small problems and too small to resolve the big problems we are faced with on a global scale."
"A European Union which is able to act with one voice and independently in different scenarios and regions and which is able to employ a wide range of political, economic, commercial, civil and military measures which will allow it to achieve its foreign policy objectives."
"We therefore congratulate the Belgian Presidency, Mr President."
"I believe that we are working in the right direction, and I hope that the declarations of the European Council in Laeken, which has been a good finale to a brilliant Presidency, can quickly be turned into concrete actions which, as I said at the beginning, will allow the European Union to make significant progress in its project of political consolidation."
"Mr President, we can celebrate today a number of victories for the European Parliament on things which, not very long ago, we were told would never possibly be agreed at the Laeken European Council."
"For a start we have a Convention - and I am particularly pleased at this because I think I was the first one to suggest nearly two years ago now, that the Convention method that was used for drafting the Charter of Rights could equally be used to prepare a revision of the Treaties."
"We were told that it would be restricted to just four subjects and now it is clear that the agenda is wide open."
"It will produce a single document with recommendations, not just listing every single option that anybody can think of."
"It will of course come up with options when there is a division, but it will work towards reaching a broad consensus as the basis for the work of the IGC."
"On all that we can be pleased."
"The fly in the ointment is the curious decision on the choice of the troika for the praesidium of this Convention."
"It is no secret that my group would not have chosen Mr Giscard d' Estaing as its preferred candidate, but as you know, Mr President, we have had experiences of constitutional reports from Mr Giscard d' Estaing in this Parliament."
"He produced a report on subsidiarity a number of years ago and from that we can draw some lessons because every single paragraph in his report, if I remember correctly, was amended in committee and then in plenary, by Parliament adopting amendments tabled by yourself."
"That might be a working method we might well need to employ in the Convention and is something we can draw some lessons from."
"I turn now to the less positive result of the European Council - the farce over the agencies."
"That too can be used to learn some lessons."
"It shows us what happens when we move away from the Community method to intergovernmentalism."
"Instead of a Commission proposal we have every country coming up with its own proposal, feeling forced to defend it in an intergovernmental logic and with no result in the end."
"It shows the limits of the European Council which should be setting the strategic objectives for the European Union."
"When it has to deal with detail like that it of course fails."
"Let no government now turn around to the Parliament and criticise us for being incapable of taking decisions, accuse us of being too slow in taking decisions, when the European Council offers us a spectacle like that, which indeed discredits the European Union in the eyes of its citizens."
"Mr President, I shall stop now but not without remarking that I believe this is the last time you will chairing the European Parliament before the presidential election comes and you move on to other higher things and may I wish you all the best of luck for a prosperous and successful New Year in 2002."
"Thank you very much."
"Mr President, if our goal is to establish a federation of States and the constituent process is to involve the Treaties, the Laeken Declaration establishing a Convention that is to propose institutional reform to the Intergovernmental Conference before the European elections and before enlargement, is a success for Parliament and the Belgian Presidency."
"However, the European Parliament must ensure this success does not become an illusion."
"This democratic challenge must be supported by a great debate open to all the citizens of the Union."
"As I see it, the future of Europe is in the hands, in particular, of the great political families which created the European Community and believe in integration, in the European social model, in European democracy and in European reunification."
"However, on certain points of the Laeken agenda, the Community process was slowed down by a cross-fire of vetoes."
"This is the weapon of the sceptics and populists."
"I refer to the deferral of the financing of Galileo, which President Prodi also mentioned, and to the failure to reach agreement on the locations of the European agencies or on the Community patent."
"In any case, as has just been said, these shadows reinforce the need for the Community method and majority decisions;"
"I refer also to the security and defence policy, in which progress has been made, and to foreign policy, which is still poorly defined."
"Europe is standing shoulder to shoulder with the United States in the fight against terrorism, but it is also concentrating on combating the poverty which divides the world, while the situation in the Middle East has reached tragic dimensions."
"What should we do?"
"Is there no way forward?"
"I support Mr Verhofstadt' s call for a Europe whose actions are consistent with the values of freedom and solidarity, which it enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights in order to make globalisation more humane."
"Mr President, when a child is born with just a father, we must not be surprised if it grows up with problems."
"Europe has many fathers and we have just missed the opportunity to give it a mother."
"I would like to talk about the assessment in Laeken on the subject of the application of justice and home affairs policies."
"I agree with the progress made on the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions, both in the criminal field and in the civil field, though to a lesser extent."
"And I must congratulate you in this respect on the content and the form of the agreement on the European arrest warrant, which affects a large number of offences and which I see as greater justice rather than greater repression."
"I believe we should welcome this."
"However, with regard to immigration and asylum, I must say that the Council' s text adopts a tone of renunciation which worries me."
"The analysis of the situation is sincere of course, but I do not believe that it reaches the right conclusions."
"Mr President, we cannot allow fifteen different immigration policies in this borderless Europe for much longer."
"I think that we should draw other conclusions from this situation; the conclusion that these policies require greater impetus, that we should rid ourselves once and for all of the shackles of unanimity and that we should increase this Parliament' s participation in such sensitive issues."
"Mr President, I believe we have demonstrated that it is possible to work with our Parliament in this field and that we must put an end to the restrictions imposed in Amsterdam."
"I hope that the Convention takes note of this and puts it right."
"I would also like to end by congratulating the Presidency on the inclusion of diversity and the idea of federalism in the Treaty and on Mr Verhofstadt' s words to this House in this regard."
"Mr President, on the day after the Laeken Summit, I would like to express a few regrets and one hope."
"I regret that in the field of foreign and defence policy, the Heads of State and Government meeting in Laeken have not been able to show their capacity to act."
"So, while we are living through an unprecedented crisis, the European Union will not be able to decide to send a joint force to Afghanistan."
"Such a decision would have sent a strong signal of the will of the Europeans, by showing that we are ready to carry out our responsibilities fully, both in a military sense and in a humanitarian or political sense."
"Likewise, once again, in the field of common defence, no immediate decision has been taken."
"These statements are largely virtual and the issue of automatic access by the Union to NATO' s resources has yet to be sorted out."
"The Union' s foreign and defence policy exists more in speeches than in actions, and I regret this."
"More than ever, we must build a political and democratic Europe which is capable of carrying weight and influence in the world."
"That is why I would now like to express a hope."
"The Laeken Summit has decided to create the Convention."
"It has provided it with an excellent president and an open agenda."
"I would like to thank the Belgian Presidency for this, since throughout its mandate it has shown courage and vision, as well as the Commissioner responsible for these issues."
"This Convention opens the way to a new future for Europe."
"I wish it success, and I hope that in two years time we may have a constitution which all the citizens of the European Union can read and understand, and that we finally establish the principle of directly electing the President of the European Commission."
"If we do not want to the European Union of tomorrow to be a mere free trade area, if we really want to carry weight in the world, in the new international order, this is the only possible course."
"Mr President, time is short, so my only comment will be on the really historic decision to convene a constituent assembly which has already - albeit inaccurately - been called a Convention."
"Ôhe European Parliament has every right to be proud because the idea of a Convention was mooted here, in this House, and took shape in the reports by the European Parliament, mainly from 1997 onwards."
"Parliament has insisted ever since that institutional development is a waste of time unless someone else is given the job of drafting new Treaties, i.e. unless a political body takes over the role played hitherto by the bureaucrats."
"This is not the time to judge whether or not we have finally achieved our aim; that will depend on the degree to which the proposals tabled by the Convention find their way into the new Treaties, which is why the Convention needs to table specific institutional proposals, assuming of course that it reaches an agreement."
"If the Convention tables a selection of alternatives to the Intergovernmental Conference, rather than specific proposals, then it will have little effect on the shape of the new Treaty."
"Unfortunately, the instructions to come out of Laeken are rather more open-ended on this point than they should have been."
"If you stop to consider that no institutional body in the European Union and no institution in any one Member State has studied or tabled more thoughts on the institutional aspects of the European Union than the European Parliament, then a contingent of 16 delegates is hardly in proportion to its contribution to date."
"However, just so that our fellow citizens know where they stand, the Convention will not table a draft Treaty, it will table a draft Constitutional Treaty."
"The intergovernmental method will be complemented by the Community method, rather than being abolished, which is perfectly reasonable, given that the European Union is a union of nations and a union of states."
"However, the Convention takes the fight for greater democracy and greater rule of law in the European Union to a new level."
"It really is a pity, Mr President, that the chairman of the Convention is appointed by the Council."
"It would have been more fitting to allow a body made up mainly of members of parliament to elect its own chairman."
"Mr President, from the list of speakers it would seem that the rest of you will now have to follow the PPE-DE family' s internal debate, but of course that is perfectly in order."
"In my opinion, the Belgian presidential term was a great success in difficult circumstances."
"In that connection, externally there was Afghanistan, Macedonia, the Middle East and 11 September, and, internally, there were enormous expectations, which mainly focused on the Laeken Summit."
"Seen in this light the results of the Laeken summit were good."
"They will take the Community forward both ideologically and realistically."
"Laeken was a confirmation of the political will that exists with regard to speedy enlargement, with ten new members joining in 2004, provided that these countries themselves are determined to try to bring that about in negotiations."
"The Laeken Declaration is a successful mixture of questions regarding problems to be solved and, on the other hand, faith in being able to solve them."
"The Convention, which - at least as a group - the PPE-DE was the first to propose, will be starting its work soon, and one thing we know for sure is that its praesidium has experience - some 200 man years of experience in all."
"Good luck - the work will not be easy!"
"I think the best decision taken at the Laeken Summit, however, was that by Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, whose personal contribution certainly lies behind Belgium' s success there, as he very quickly put a stop to the row over agencies."
"When the Prime Minister of a large country starts imagining that he is at some European Food of the Year ceremony, or awarding Michelin points to some city, or when the President of another large country begins to fantasise about beautiful Swedish models, then that is really a very good reason to end the discussion before the Europeans witnessing it laugh even louder at us than they are doing at present."
"Mr President, I would like to continue this internal PPE-DE debate by focussing solely on the Laeken Declaration."
"It is right, as the Declaration says, that European institutions should become closer to the citizens, less intrusive, less unwieldy and more efficient and open to democratic scrutiny."
"It is also right that a whole series of questions should be asked in terms of simplifying the process of legislation, on clarifying competencies of the Union and indeed restoring perhaps one or two to Member States, as is mentioned."
"How to involve the national parliamentarians too is a very important aspect and lastly, it is right, as the President of the Council said, that this is a new departure for Europe as a way of amending Treaties rather than having decisions made behind closed doors and smoke-filled rooms early in the morning."
"There is a real doubt, however, that these statements of principle will actually become reality."
"Is the agenda, as some feel, already decided in advance?"
"Will all the voices in the European political spectrum be heard?"
"Will indeed, above all, the views of ordinary European citizens, be taken into account and listened to in the work of the Convention?"
"There were some signs under the previous Presidency but not I am afraid under this one, that they did actually care about European citizens."
"It had a website - 'Europa' or whatever it was, - but we have not heard much about it under this Presidency."
"In the conclusions of the Council relating to the Convention, one paragraph is devoted to the forum and it seems to be more about informing the network of organisations than having their contributions in the work of the Convention."
"I therefore make this one appeal today that in the praesidium, and perhaps helped by the Commission, national parliamentarians and others, we really should have a real European debate in the Member States involving European citizens so that when we end up with a constitutional framework, we really have something that Europeans can support."
"This is the only occasion in history, that I can think of, where citizens can be consulted before a constitution is drawn up rather than afterwards."
"So please, Commissioner, ensure that everything is done to make sure this European debate will actually take place."
"Mr President, Laeken has gone better than Nice did last year, and for that the Belgian Presidency is to be thanked, yet the positive outcome has to do with another matter on which Laeken was to give a decision."
"Nothing had been decided by last weekend on the central topic of ""The future of the Union""; quite rightly, only questions had been asked about it."
"Even a cursory analysis of the questions, though, shows that some of them are not questions at all, such as the rhetorical question as to whether it would contribute to greater transparency if the sessions of the Council - at any rate in its legislative capacity - were to be in public."
"Now, it goes without saying that legislative Council sessions must be thrown open, but why did something so obvious not become legally binding at Maastricht or Amsterdam or, at the latest, at Nice?"
"Another question in the catalogue of Laeken declarations makes me similarly pensive."
"We have to consider whether the Charter of Fundamental Rights should be incorporated into the Basic Treaty and whether the European Community should accede to the European Convention on Human Rights."
"Does this mean that the results of the last Convention are really nothing more than an option?"
"I hope not."
"I take an even more critical view of questions in the Declaration which were not even put at Laeken."
"The question arises for me, as an elected representative from a medium-sized state, how the Convention will ensure that the big states will not dominate in the future."
"There has, unfortunately, been a very definite reason for these questions to be asked in recent weeks, and let nobody believe that there will be any less hankering after top-down management in a future Europe of nineteen small and medium-sized States and a small group of large and very large ones."
"One last point in the Laeken Declaration prompts me to vehement criticism here and now."
"The less than impressive, indeed uncaring, way in which the Council's General Secretariat handled the Convention on Fundamental Rights last time gives little hope for anything good from the Constitutional Convention."
"I can only hope that the Council's bureaucracy will prove us wrong by providing us with a quite outstanding service."
"Mr President, at the Laeken Summit, the heads of government agreed to set up a constitutional Convention on the future of Europe which includes the possible incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, with its costly, social and economic rights, and the direct election of a European Commission President, which I oppose."
"I welcome, however, calls for the EU to become more democratic, transparent and efficient, for an enhanced role for the national parliamentarians and a menu of options to choose from in 2004."
"The EU already possesses its own anthem, flag, citizenship, army, currency etc. and a whole host of quasi-federal institutions."
"To pretend, as the Labour Government in Britain is already doing, that this Convention is simply an opportunity to limit the power of the Union at the expense of the states is ridiculous."
"This Convention is much more reminiscent of the American nation-building exercise in Philadelphia in 1787."
"The political elites of Europe are ever more distanced from their electorates."
"How representative of European opinion are Valéry Giscard D'Estaing, Dehaene and Amato?"
"If this is the court, the jury is a loaded one."
"How representative will the Convention be of the peoples of Europe?"
"We should be preparing urgently for enlargement by solving the Amsterdam leftovers, and reforming the CAP and the structural funds representing 80% of the budget of the EU, not preparing for grand constitutional reform of little relevance to the concerns and aspirations of the electorate."
"How will extending QMV to delicate areas like social security and taxation help?"
"And what has been done to resolve the problems of the much-needed EU patent because of the obsession with multilingualism in the institutions?"
"In the European Union there is idealism born out of a desire to see a Europe of peace and prosperity, an objective we can all share."
"I come from a country with centuries-old, uninterrupted democratic traditions and I want to say two things to the believers in a European super-state."
"Firstly, the EU is not the origin but the expression of peace in post-war Europe, which is underpinned by democracy in the nation-states and respect for the rule of law."
"Secondly, idealistic political changes instituted by the political elites which do not have the broad support of the people will be like structures built on sand."
"Do not run before you can walk."
"When the peoples of Europe want a single European state, that will be the time to call for a European Convention, and not before."
"I wish you a happy Christmas."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Belgian Presidency has without doubt gone to a great deal of effort, yet the lack of a European Community spirit on the part of the fifteen governments in the European Union when it comes to important and urgent decisions is something that cannot be overcome by just one Presidency."
"The brilliant analysis of the situation and the many questions listed could have come from Parliament's reports on Nice, its aftermath, or Laeken, and they give the impression of having been written down on the spot."
"These are questions to which Parliament has for years now been demanding answers for the sake of the future of the European Union."
"Is everything now again being jeopardised by so much questioning?"
"Let us take, for example, common suffrage."
"The Council has, since July 1998, been examining a European draft electoral law on elections to the European Parliament and has still not come to any conclusion by the end of 2001 - all of two and a half years later."
"It is raising the question of whether we want European suffrage."
"Looked at as a whole, there is no doubt that the Convention represents an opportunity, yet Parliament contradicts Laeken by demanding that we should negotiate and reach a decision on the basis of one unitary, coherent proposal."
"It is equally regrettable that the Heads of State and of Government have again put off until Barcelona and Seville resolutions on the adaptation of the Council's structures and work practices."
"Reading the Laeken resolutions reminded me of a saying coined by one of our poets, Hans Magnus Enzensberger: 'He, seated in a common place, / thought up another commonplace.'"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Laeken Declaration on the future of the European Union is a positive step towards a European Union that is more citizen-oriented and more transparent."
"A good declaration, however, must not remain mere empty words."
"For example, the conclusion of the Lisbon Council that the European Union should be made the world' s most competitive area has to an extent met with a surprising degree of reluctance on the part of Member States to do anything about it."
"It is essential from the point of view of the Union' s credibility that words and deeds go hand in hand."
"The Union and its institutions have - with good reason - been criticised for being too distant from the people."
"In order to promote a more citizen-oriented approach, any preparatory work for revision of the Treaties in the future must be carried out in a more transparent manner."
"The European Council must observe the same principles of democracy, efficiency and consistency that we also expect of the other EU institutions."
"The expected - and positive - decision of the European Council at Laeken, was to set up a Convention."
"So, in this respect, I disagree with my good friend, Charles Tannock."
"The problem, however, lies in the fact that three distinguished European statesmen, each with a long life' s work behind them, have now been appointed to lead the Convention."
"No women were even shortlisted for the presidency."
"Experience is obviously invaluable, but in order to guarantee a citizen-oriented approach we ought now to be thinking about the sort of age and gender distribution there should be among the Convention' s other members so that the EU can really be brought closer to its citizens and in particular the shapers of the future, that is to say, the young."
"At Laeken the question of the location of the urgently needed food agency to be set up in the new year was discussed."
"In view of the diseases among animals that have recently occurred in practically all Member States, Europeans have the right to expect Heads of State to do their utmost to ensure there is complete safety with regard to food."
"The way the matter was dealt with by the Council, however, was more reminiscent of a farce, which, according to the German newspaper Die Welt, put even all the soap operas in the shade."
"It is quite indefensible that populist objectives should be able to hamper decision-making in a matter that is crucial to the health and well-being of our citizens."
"Mr President, a positive acceleration is taking place in European political integration."
"The process of enlargement is a reality, just as the convening of the Convention is a reality; countless steps forward have been taken in the field of justice, as they have in the field of foreign and defence policy."
"However, this acceleration in political integration is not being matched by similar acceleration in economic integration, that is, in the creation of the markets on which political integration is based."
"It is strange, but we are witnessing a veritable inversion of the Community method."
"Indeed, from coal to steel, to the single currency, it has all been a succession of steps forward towards the building of a common home, starting with the foundations and working our way towards the roof."
"Now, while we are rushing to build the roof, we are extremely behind in the creation of markets which are crucial for the lives of the Europeans."
"There have been too many delays, too many failures, too much egotism: from electricity to gas, from telecommunications to Galileo to the Community patent."
"This lack of synchronisation between the physical dimension of the markets and the metaphysical political dimension could cost the process of European integration the citizens' support."
"Indeed, the costs of losing political sovereignty are perceived to be too high and the benefits for businesses and consumers are considered to be too low, too limited."
"It would be as well, in order to avoid this danger, for European integration to be resumed according to the method of our founding fathers, free from contemptible egotism and without calculated, unnecessary leaps forward."
"Mr President, the words 'entrepreneur' or 'employer' occur only once in the Laeken final conclusions, and that in connection with the protection of workers when an employer becomes insolvent."
"I believe we have missed an opportunity here."
"At the European level, we are engaged in turning the internal market into a domestic market, and Europe is home, after all, to 18 million small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I am the President of the European SME-Union, and it is therefore a matter of concern to me that I should point out over and over again that our primary goals should include the safeguarding of existing jobs and the creation of new ones."
"At the end of the day, it is the small and medium-sized enterprises that provide two-thirds of all jobs, pay 80% of all taxes and train 85% of young workers."
"My second point takes us away from internal affairs to the international arena."
"How do we envisage the European Union's future representation in international organisations?"
"In Parliament, we have now decided on this Committee on NATO."
"How are we to proceed in matters affecting the World Trade Organisation?"
"There are many other areas; how does Europe intend to take a leadership role in the future?"
"The third point that concerns me is in fact the Council's secretariat."
"I believe we should set up a body composed of the best minds in the secretariat as well."
"It should be possible for the European Council, the European Parliament and the Commission to be equally represented on it."
"Our objective should be for the ideas produced by the best minds to eventually bring us a result at which the citizens of Europe will rejoice."
"The first two sentences of the Laeken Declaration about the debilitating effects of the two World Wars confirm my belief that the European Union is a force for good in the world and Britain, like all other Member States, derives great benefit from the existence of the EU."
"The remains of my grandfather, like many others, lie somewhere in Flanders on the battlefield of the Somme."
"My father fought in Montgomery's army in Flanders for the liberation of Brussels."
"I am still in Flanders, the third generation of my humble family, fighting here for Britain's interests."
"Can there be any doubt as to which generation has got right the way to work out Europe's relations?"
"The simple certainties of the 20th century are less clear in the complexities of the 21st century."
"As I read on in the Laeken Declaration I recall the saying we have in English that, like the curate's egg, it is good in parts."
"I particularly like the reference that we are a continent of liberty and, above all, of diversity."
"Unlike the United States of America, Europe is a voluntary association of sovereign independent states."
"We must never forget that."
"Of course we need European-level institutions but let us also recall the wise words of Jacques Santer: ""Europe must do less better""."
"There needs to be a clearer definition of subsidiarity on ""less""."
"Only go to European level for that which can only be done at European level."
"On ""better"" I urge Commission and Council to look closely at the call of this Parliament for a uniform and compulsory code of good administrative behaviour."
"The response I received to a Parliamentary question last week from the Commission was dismissive of Parliament's call made in September for such a uniform and compulsory code."
"That is not the right attitude, nor is it the way to get the European public on side."
"The case for such a code has been set up by the Ombudsman, Jacob Söderman."
"I am pleased he will be an observer at the Convention but I would say to Commission and Council that you would do well to listen to him as well as to allow him to observe."
"As the final speaker from the floor this year, may I wish all the staff, all the Members and all the people of Europe a very merry Christmas and a happy New Year."
"Mr President, this debate began over four hours ago, and I can understand that great demands have been made on the attention of the European Parliament."
"However, for my part, I have listened carefully to all the speakers, right to the end, and I must say that throughout this debate the dialogue and the speeches in this House have been of a consistently high quality."
"Almost all those who have spoken have expressed their satisfaction at the end, not only of this Laeken Council, but also of six months of Belgian Presidency, and I have no problem - quite the contrary - in joining in with your thanks, not only to Guy Verhofstadt and Louis Michel, but to all the Belgian Ministers and all their colleagues."
"I should also like to thank them, and why not, for the quality of the relations that have been maintained and even strengthened during the Belgian Presidency, whatever the problems or the difficulties between the Council and our colleagues and the members of the European Commission."
"I should just like to say a few words about the Convention and the hopes that it inspires."
"First of all, Mr Swoboda and James Elles, and others too perhaps, have raised the issue of the civil society."
"I believe it is very important that this new framework is being put in place for the first time on institutional issues, after the initial successful experience of the previous Convention on fundamental rights, though that was a restricted, limited exercise, and probably less sensitive than the one that we are about to begin. I believe it is very important that this Convention should be open, and should be able to take note of what is happening outside it."
"One way or another, this forum, this network of non-governmental organisations, regions and associations will have to be able to make its voice heard and, when necessary, heard by the Convention."
"I have taken note of the suggestion that the website should be a two-way affair, so that it cannot only disseminate information but also pass on opinions and criticisms."
"This also reminds me of an idea which I have already mentioned in this House, that this Convention should be a sort of sounding box, both for governments and for the public."
"May I also say that it would be very worthwhile during a period - and I am thinking about the year 2002 - in which six or seven, or maybe more if I am not mistaken, of the countries of the Union will be holding general elections, and therefore we shall have to pay great attention to the quality of the European debate, because we are well aware that, whether national politicians like it or not, the European dimension is bound to form part of the debates in each of our countries."
"That is the first point that I wanted to make."
"My second point concerns the praesidium, which I shall be part of together with my friend and colleague Antonio Vitorino."
"This praesidium, consisting of twelve people, will be led by a trio of the highest quality, three statesmen - and I choose that word advisedly - namely Mr Amato, Mr Dehaene and the President Mr Giscard d' Estaing."
"They are three statesmen by virtue, frankly, of their age, but some would also say by virtue of their experience or their wisdom."
"I know all three of them, and what I can tell you about them, and in particular about the President of the Convention, is that when it comes to their European convictions, they all have a youthful spirit and a dynamism that I would like to see in a certain number of much more eurosceptic politicians who are in some cases twenty or thirty years younger."
"That is what seems important to me, their dynamism and the youthfulness of their convictions, together with their European qualifications and their authority, which is something that we shall need."
"What I would like to say, echoing Louis Michel, is that of course there will be the President and the two Vice-Presidents, but they will have to work as colleagues alongside the praesidium, and by listening to and leading the debates of the Convention as a whole."
"They will not, therefore, be working alone, but rather in solidarity, which is a very different matter indeed."
"The European Council at Laeken - and the Belgian Presidency did very well to achieve such a result - gave this Convention a dynamic mandate, an open mandate, thereby removing the first risk that I had imagined or feared, namely the risk of a closed mandate, a mandate blocked by the four topics of the Treaty of Nice, which would have given rise to great disappointment here, to me personally and also to public opinion, and which would have restricted our work to the legal and the technical, without any political perspective."
"However, that did not happen."
"The Laeken mandate is an open mandate, and it even allows us to raise almost any issue."
"This means, however, that there is another risk, if I may say so. That risk is that, by being based on such a broad mandate, on such great confidence, the Convention will be transformed into a sort of academic forum producing results which are too far out of line with the mandate that has been laid down."
"We must take care not to make this Convention a forum which will cease to be listened to by the European Council."
"This is also why the selection of the three people who will be leading this Convention is so important, because the three people in question have the ear and the respect of the European Council."
"We have to steer a course between these two dangers."
"The first danger has now been removed, but the second one remains."
"What I am trying to say is that we shall have to produce work that is responsible and useful, and that can be used by the European Council, which will then have to go on to make the final decisions."
"Basically, I believe that this Convention, which is a great opportunity for European debate and for future stages of European integration to be carried out in a more open, more democratic and more transparent way, is itself responsible for proving that the right method has been chosen, so that we can avoid going back to the old method, which was strictly intergovernmental."
"Together, we, the European Parliament, the Commission, the Council and the national parliaments, will bear that responsibility, together with the candidate countries, sitting around the same table and on an equal footing with us, plus of course the active representatives of the Committee of the Regions and of organised civil society."
"We shall have the responsibility of ensuring that it works, that it succeeds, because if it does succeed, in a way that is sustainable in the future, then I believe that any future reforms in years to come will no longer be carried out in the old way, but will be carried out using this more transparent and more open method."
"We shall also have a second responsibility, that of putting into perspective the institutional issues, and of putting them into a political perspective. The Convention mandate allows us to do this."
"It allows us, in particular, in the first few months of 2002, to spend a little time, among ourselves and with others, asking ourselves some fundamental questions. What do we want to do together?"
"What is the meaning that we wish to give to the European project? What do you expect - and by you I mean not only the institutions but also the Member States, and the governments of the Member States, the Heads of State and Government, and the national parliaments - what do you expect of the European project?"
"I believe that the President of the Convention intends - and I support him in that intention - to ask each country what it expects of the European project, by using modern technology and perhaps by actually going to the countries in question and visiting each capital city, if the praesidium so wishes."
"For two years now, ever since Joschka Fischer, we have heard all the Heads of State and Government and many Ministers making grandiose declarations and powerful speeches."
"I think that we must go further, and ask them to explain what they want this European project to mean, what they expect of it, in other words we must demand a sort of political verification."
"Only then, after such verification, will it be time to place in that political perspective the institutional work that has been carried out on all the subjects that have been mentioned, including the constitutional process that was adopted at Laeken."
"That is what I wanted to say, namely that we must carry out responsible, useful and usable work, and we must prove that from now on we can ensure that the European Union advances and progresses other than by using methods which, in my opinion, belong to the past."
"Mr President, I should like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak at the end of this debate, and I should also like to thank you for the quality of that debate, and at the same time I too would like to wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year."
"The debate is closed."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 7.45 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 17 December 2001."
"Before discussing the order of business, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take just a minute of your time to add my sincere tribute to those paid by all Parliamentary groups to our outgoing President, Mrs Fontaine, during the sitting of 17 December."
"I was one of those standing against her two years ago, as I am sure you all remember."
"I am, therefore, delighted to acknowledge today and thank her for her dignity, impartiality, efficiency and the exceptional elegance with which she has fulfilled her duties in the service of the European Union, thereby increasing the prestige of our Parliament."
"(Loud applause)"
"Order of business"
"Announcement of candidates for election of President"
"Election of President of Parliament"
"We shall now proceed to the election of the President, pursuant to Rule 14 of the Rules of Procedure:"
"Mr Bonde,"
"Mr Cox,"
"Mr David W. Martin,"
"Mr Onesta and"
"Mr Wurtz."
"Good morning colleagues."
"This Parliament must continue to be multilingual."
"Eleven languages make 110 combinations."
"Twenty-two languages make 462 combinations."
"Thirty-five languages make 1 090 combinations."
"Can you imagine a translation from Finnish, via English and French, to Polish?"
"With direct translation some will vote for budget line 2 while others are still voting on budget line 1."
"With more than one relay our system will not work."
"If we do not go for reform, then most of us will no longer be able to use our own language."
"In two years we might have ten new Member States."
"Our buildings are not prepared for that."
"Soon even more countries - from the Ukraine to the Balkans - will be applicant countries."
"We risk a Babel-like confusion."
"Our next President must dedicate himself to internal reform and successful enlargement."
"Indeed our next President will not have much time to travel around."
"We need a craftsman, a handyman, rather than a statesman."
"All of us will be to blame if we are not prepared for enlargement by 2004."
"How we vote today is part of that responsibility."
"Every vote for me is a clear signal to Mr Cox and Mr Martin: limit your ambitions to enlargement and internal reform."
"Today we lose a lot of time over badly prepared votes."
"If journalists ask how we voted, we do not always know."
"If we knew, we would not have time to serve our people."
"We would then be bad MEPs."
"Leave it to the committees to prepare the votes."
"Let the plenary deal with the important political issues."
"Give us at least one week to consult and consider how we will vote."
"Today many Members are not allowed to speak in debates."
"If you represent a small delegation in a big group, or an alternative view, the group whips will seldom allow you to speak."
"Give every Member the right to speak at least three times a year."
"Leave one-third of the speaking time for real debates."
"Let us corner the commissioner when he or she states that the Commission can accept Amendment No 3 and rejects Amendments Nos 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9."
"Today common decision-making takes place between the Commission and the Council."
"They share the information."
"Even in the conciliation committees our Members have no access to working documents, legal notes or Minutes."
"Does ""common"" really mean ""unilateral""?"
"In the committees the Members discuss draft laws based on outdated drafts."
"Behind us sit young civil servants from the permanent representations."
"The Commission and the Council have all the information we cannot get."
"I have been here for 22 years."
"In that time as an elected Member, I have never received adequate information from the committee."
"To get information I have to find sources like journalists. Our next President must ensure that all information is available to all of us and, if necessary, take the Commission and the Council to court."
"Today, 70% of all laws are passed by junior civil servants in working groups."
"Fifteen percent are settled by the ambassadors."
"Only 15% reach the level of the ministers who then read manuscripts prepared by civil servants."
"Democracy was born in Europe and buried in the Commission and the Council."
"Our next President should re-establish democracy."
"He should inspire us to discuss whether our future Europe should be the federalist vision of a democratic EU or a Europe of democracies."
"Our next President should unite all elected representatives from national parliaments and the European Parliament in moving law-making from behind closed doors into the open, from civil servants to elected Members."
"For what is now needed I offer my skills and energy."
"But all I ask is to borrow your vote in the first round: firstly, because it might be your only chance to vote for me; secondly, because many votes will test the groups behind Mr Cox and Mr Martin."
"This time we need a practical and politically-neutral shop steward to serve all of us."
"Give yourself a better choice."
"Improve on both Cox and Martin by voting Mr Bonde from office number 007."
"By the end of the day we will have a better presidency thanks to those who drafted the ""fair chair platform"" and created the first real electoral battle in our history."
"The next chair will have a real mandate."
"He deserves our full support."
"Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, decision time is now upon us."
"We have had more candidates, we have had more debate, and we have had more openness."
"It represents a change in the method, in the way we have done our business."
"It is a good change and I hope it is a signal of an appetite throughout this House to engage in the years which come and the balance of this mandate in a culture of transformation of how we do our business."
"The campaign reveals many perspectives, not least about the strengths and weaknesses of the candidates - and I have my share of both."
"I read about myself in polite journals that I am loquacious."
"I live in Ireland, where we are all loquacious, near Blarney where there is a stone and a castle."
"When visitors come there and kiss that stone, they say in Hibernian English that they leave with the gift of the gab, meaning loquacious in polite journals."
"I may be that, but the more important part of this campaign is that it has offered the opportunity to listen and to learn."
"I have listened and I have learned that there is an appetite for change, that there is a great feeling in this House that we need to do more politics in the best and visionary sense of that word."
"I have learned that we want less voting and less technicalities and more capacity to be politicians and to bring our influence to bear."
"In other words, we want more vitality in how we manage our affairs."
"We need to bring closure to many of the issues of reform that have been before us for so long."
"The complex Members' statute is difficult and the hard work led by Nicole Fontaine is testament to that."
"But we must continue to try."
"I tell this to Members: I will, in a hands-on way, try to achieve that reform, but never over the heads of the Members of this House."
"It will be done in the fullest, most transparent and open shared consultation."
"I have learned here how good we are at legislating on and talking about equal opportunity and gender equality, but how bad we are sometimes as an institution at putting it into practice."
"I pledge today before this House that, should I have the privilege to lead at the end of the day, I will promote the equality of gender in various ways, but most visibly and at the outset by it being apparent in the construction of the Cabinet."
"Since 1998 I have had the privilege to lead the Liberal Democrat Group and together, I believe, with my colleagues, we have established a capacity for doing politics, which is the business of this institution."
"We are 626 Members, we are a Parliament."
"I am not seeking, Mr Bonde or other colleagues who share your fears, to be the sixteenth president or prime minister of the sixteenth state."
"I am proud to be a parliamentarian and we must bring our parliamentary and democratic vision to bear on the great issues of the day in Europe."
"We must make Europe fit for a future on a continental scale and we must make the democracy in this House fit to offer a real leadership and act as a counterweight and check and balance against the excesses of technocracy or bureaucracy."
"I want to say to Hans-Gert Poettering and to the PPE-DE Group how greatly I appreciate his and their unswerving commitment to be full and faithful partners to an agreement which we made."
"But I want to say this also: I have had the privilege to visit many groups, many committees, many intergroups."
"I want, if I can, to lead a Presidency which is a stakeholder Presidency, open to build on the talents of those who will contribute."
"I ask you for your support."
"Finally, Mr President, smaller groups in this House do not find themselves with the credible possibility that my Liberal Democrat Group finds it has today."
"I do not know what the final result will be, but I know this much: I cannot see how those who say that they value more openness, a change in the system, who would like to see a fairer share for all, can reconcile this with voting for a large-group candidate, not because of any fault with the candidate, but because of the nature of the system we have."
"If you wish to transform the system, today's vote will be the first mark of whether we are dedicated to transformation and change."
"That is my appeal; I ask for your support."
"I should love to have the privilege to lead; but the choice now rests with you."
"Mr President, colleagues, I make no apology for beginning my contribution by thanking the outgoing President, Mrs Fontaine, for the work that she did as President."
"She led the fight against terrorism long before 11 September."
"It is to her credit that she took those initiatives at that time."
"Before a vote is even cast in this election, we already know the winner."
"The winner is the European Parliament because, as Pat Cox has rightly said, we have had an open election, keenly, but fairly contested."
"That can only help to raise the profile and to improve the image of this institution - something which frankly is very necessary."
"The 1999 European elections, Eurobarometer and other opinion polls all demonstrate that this institution has an image problem."
"With the Convention, enlargement and the 2004 European elections, we face enormous challenges."
"Every Member of this Parliament now has the opportunity, in a secret ballot, to vote for the person they believe can best guide us through this vital phase."
"I have been a Member of this Parliament for 17 years. I have had the honour of being its Vice-President for 12 of them."
"In that time I proved my determination to work for Parliament and for all its Members."
"As rapporteur on the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties, I negotiated with heads of government to secure codecision for this Parliament."
"As one of Parliament's representatives on COSAC, I worked to convince national parliaments of the importance of the convention method for the next reform of the Treaties."
"As Vice-President of Parliament I have sought to modernise and improve our working methods."
"I am deeply conscious of the fact that everything I have achieved in this Parliament has been achieved through working with colleagues across the political spectrum."
"I have fought for what I believe to be right, and I have done that, sometimes, against the interests of my own political group and sometimes even against the interests of my own country."
"If elected President, I pledge to fight for what this Parliament needs. That includes: firstly, a stronger role in electing the next President of the European Commission; second, codecision for all legislation; third, an end to the artificial distinction in the budget between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure; fourth, ensuring that we, in this House, are ready for enlargement."
"We all know that the European Union faces many sensitive issues in the coming months and years."
"My task as President would be to ensure that at this vital time Parliament's voice is not only heard but acted upon on these issues."
"This plenary is Parliament's shop window to the world."
"It should be the place where the outside world can identify the real points of controversy between ourselves, and between ourselves, the Commission and the Council."
"Yet, frankly, because we deal with so many items - about 35 every four-day part-session - and because of the structure of our debates and the amount of time we spend voting, the relevance of what we do in this Chamber is sometimes obscured to the outside world."
"We need, as a Parliament, to resolve more issues in committee and reform both the structure of our debates and the way we vote."
"We need to provide our committees and rapporteurs with the necessary technical and legal resources to allow us to become a genuine equal to the Council as a co-legislator."
"In short, I want this Parliament to become a real debating Chamber - a Parliament where the general public can hear lively debates over real political choices and one where every Member feels that they have the opportunity to participate."
"I strongly believe that Members of this Parliament do an excellent job carrying out our legislative, budgetary and control functions."
"But no parliament can work in the dark."
"It is vital that we reconnect with the citizens so that we really can live up to our claim to be the voice of the people in EU decision-making."
"Thirty months is a short time."
"Reform will only be possible if the President has the support of all Members across the whole House."
"We need a President for all of Parliament."
"My record in this House, I hope you will agree, demonstrates that I would be an inclusive President."
"I have already committed myself to having a cabinet that would be balanced in terms of gender, nationality and political party."
"I would want a team of all the talents from right or left, big group or small group, medium-size or no group."
"If elected I pledge to be a President for the whole Parliament and all its Members."
"If you elect me today I would see this as the pinnacle of my political career."
"All my energy, all my commitment and all my enthusiasm would be channelled into ensuring that this is a Parliament of which we can be proud."
"(Loud applause)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we have had a quality exchange of views during this campaign, which rarely happens in this House, and I think that it will now be difficult to backtrack and imagine an election with a pre-determined outcome, with our plenary session serving only to ratify the decision."
"For that reason alone, I believe that this campaign was well worthwhile."
"The most surprising thing is that the five candidates took up the same three themes."
"Perhaps it is not surprising, because if we put our differences aside, we share the same view, namely that Parliament needs to reform its working practices, and that it must ensure pluralism, respect and equality for each Member of this House and be more accountable to our fellow citizens."
"So, we say yes to reforms."
"Let us use the plenary sessions to showcase our work."
"I dream foolishly of having such stimulating sittings that there will be more Members present in the Chamber than interpreters in the booths."
"I believe this dream to be a realistic one."
"But although the reforms are essential, they must not be at the price of our diversity."
"We have enough political experience between us to be able to determine, by consensus, what can technically be achieved in committee and what must necessarily be the subject of political debate in plenary."
"The person with the strongest convictions must never simplify the debate to the point where that person is the only one expressing a point of view."
"It is true that democracy is sometimes complex, but the complexity of debating is better than sterile monologue."
"With regard to reform, I have tried to prove that when you really want something, you can achieve it."
"You will recall the assistants' statute, for which I was responsible."
"After a 23-year long deadlock, 99.5% of Members submitted all the documents on the agreed date to prove that the assistants had a genuine contract and full social security cover."
"So, as far as reforms are concerned, we can discuss them, we can take action, and this is what I have tried to do in a small way."
"Let us now discuss pluralism and equality."
"I remember when I had the honour of chairing our vote on an important issue for my group, which was that of GMOs."
"Voting was suspended because of a formal sitting and, when it resumed, there were not enough Members to pass the legendary milestone of 314 votes."
"Some of my friends in the Group of the Greens said to me 'Gérard, perhaps you could have gone slightly more slowly to give our friends time to get back to their seats.'"
"But, what sort of president would slow down or increase the pace of the votes depending on how this could affect the outcome?"
"It seems that I conduct the votes at a swift, albeit regular pace, and this is the price of the respect that I owe you and the trust that you have placed in me."
"I must also listen when a Member of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left draws my attention to the fact that some of our employees are facing job insecurity or when a Member of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party asks me to intervene because some of our disabled Members need additional assistance."
"And even when Mr Fatuzzo makes one of his wonderful speeches, I try to find an appropriate response, to value his talent as a speaker."
"Being from a small group myself, I understand the great importance of respect owed to each Member."
"As far as pluralism is concerned as well, we can discuss the subject, we can take action, and this is what I have tried to do in a small way."
"I shall now turn to openness."
"You will recall that not long ago our rooms were used exclusively for Parliament work. In other words, they stood empty most of the time, which is ridiculous when we are aware of the need for debates with the citizens in our countries."
"I therefore spearheaded an amendment to our Rules of Procedure, so that, for example, the first world congress on the abolition of the death penalty could be held here."
"Other debates with the citizens are also being prepared in Brussels and Strasbourg in which our committees are involved."
"With regard to openness, once again, we can discuss it, we can take action and this is what I have tried to do in a small way."
"In some ways, I have not been campaigning for two and a half months; I have in fact been trying to carry out reform and introduce more pluralism and openness into our Assembly for two and a half years now."
"When you believe in what you say, you put it into practice, without even knowing whether you will ever have the honour of asking your fellow Members to vote for you."
"Of course, it would be extremely presumptuous for me to say that I have done all this single-handedly."
"As you know, everything here is achieved by working together and through dialogue."
"On the assistants' statute, there was deadlock initially between the groups before we moved towards unanimity within the working group. Then we achieved unanimity at Quaestor level and finally we reached unanimity within the Parliament' s Bureau."
"And I would like to congratulate the person who enabled us to carry out all these reforms and many others."
"Although I did not play a part in electing her, whenever I encountered deadlock, she always gave me the necessary impetus to enable me to move forward."
"Thank you, Mrs Nicole Fontaine."
"Although I utterly devote myself to Parliament - I think that I, like several other Members, have a 100% attendance record - it is due to a constant desire for dialogue, because I am a firm believer in seeking consensus, perhaps because I think that a victory where one' s opponent is crushed is a defeat in the sense that the victory always contains an element of the war in the offing."
"Therefore, we have reform, pluralism, and openness, which is all very well, but I shall make a promise: if we achieve this objective, we will face even more work in the future."
"Ladies and gentlemen, be aware that when we started our work, we were regulated by a Treaty and when we finish, we may be working within a Constitution, meaning this is an historic stage for us."
"I am firmly convinced that, when faced with global instability, we as politicians can help roll back injustice, violence, pollution and poverty."
"Parliament is the beating heart of the whole continent and because hundreds of millions of citizens elected us to fulfil this task, we have unparalleled legitimacy and we must use it well."
"In conclusion, I will say that I found the campaign an incredibly valuable experience and I believe that the whole House found this as well."
"I am sure that whoever becomes our next President will know how to continue to foster this attentive, working atmosphere of democratic debate."
"I can therefore only end by saying one thing in all our working languages."
"In spite of my terrible accent, I hope that you will understand what I say as I mean it sincerely - obrigado, gracias, grazie, tack, åõ÷áñéóôþ, thank you, dank u wel, danke, tak, kiitos, and merci!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my friends and colleagues of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left nominated me as a candidate as this is an extension of my work as the Group's chairman."
"For two and a half years, I have tried, as chairman, to help to bring to life a specific type of politics for Europe."
"It is this approach that my candidacy illustrates."
"One of the main characteristics of my candidacy is its firmly left-wing stance."
"In my view, European leaders are not drawing lessons from the worrying disaffection of the citizens towards the European institutions."
"There is growing concern on the ground surrounding employment, social welfare, public services, and sustainable development, whereas the Council and Commission are focusing more attention on deregulation, commercialisation, and solely market-related issues."
"I think that we must take a clear stand on this contradiction."
"In the same way, one of the salient features of our time is the aspiration of social actors to be involved in the decisions that concern them."
"However, within the institutions, undertaking consultation before drawing up policies and, more importantly, assessing their effects after implementation remain largely formal, even non-existent processes."
"We cannot stand back and do nothing about this discrepancy which many believe manifests itself in the crisis of confidence that we are currently experiencing."
"Lastly, the topical subject of globalisation is mobilising the public on an unprecedented scale."
"We will see this once again in a few days' time at the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre."
"But the Europe of today has neither the ambition nor the resources to meet the global expectations for alternatives."
"We must take action."
"A number of us here, in addition to my own Group, think that if we do not make sweeping changes, Europe will disappoint us greatly."
"If nothing changes, the historic opportunity that enlargement presents could turn out to be a fearsome trap."
"We must make ourselves heard and seize every opportunity to do so."
"This particularly applies to the quintessential political day of reckoning that constitutes the first round of the ballot for the presidency of Parliament."
"Another aspect of the political approach that I have tried to adopt since the beginning of the legislature, and which I hope my candidacy demonstrates, is the will to avoid dividing the progressive MEPs according to their political culture that is often assumed for reasons to do with history and the specific identity of each nation, each political culture being therefore equally worthy of respect."
"Within my group, then, staunch federalist Members sit alongside and cooperate with Members who are deeply attached to the sovereignty of their country."
"Both represent a part of the real Europe."
"We must design and build the European Union of the future by working together and with mutual respect."
"This is a difficult task but it is necessary and, in my experience, ultimately worthwhile."
"That is another characteristic of my candidacy."
"Last but not least, I will mention one last characteristic; namely that there is a specific set of ethics in politics."
"I welcome frankness, transparency and honest relationships, even between opponents and, more importantly, between partners."
"Therefore, I have no hesitation in saying that I value my opponent, Mr Cox, on a personal level, and even that I welcome the courteous relationship I enjoy with a number of fellow MEPs on the right, including their main representative, Mr Poettering."
"Thankfully, there are other things in life apart from politics."
"Nonetheless, I must say, equally clearly, that the candidate common to all these political families cannot, in any circumstances, count on my vote or on my support, direct or indirect, in the following rounds of the ballot."
"I should like to affirm this and I shall do so."
"On this point, I would like to express my surprise and regret at the extremely disappointing attitude of those Members who did not waver in their campaign on progressive issues in the first round, yet, in the second round, offered their vote to the only candidate of the Right, who has been dubbed the candidate from a small group, especially for the occasion."
"Each Member is entitled to his or her own principles and methods; these are most definitely not mine."
"Mr President, the cards are now on the table and it is up to us to shoulder our responsibilities."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I shall now announce the outcome of the vote."
"Voters: 590."
"Blank or spoilt ballots: 7."
"Votes cast: 583."
"Absolute majority: 292."
"I shall now read out the number of votes obtained by each candidate:"
"Mr Bonde: 66 votes"
"Mr Cox: 254 votes"
"Mr David Martin: 184 votes"
"Mr Onesta: 37 votes"
"Mr Wurtz: 42 votes."
"Since no candidate has obtained a majority of the votes cast, we shall proceed to a second round of voting."
"Unless there are any objections, the nominations from the first round shall stand."
"Mr President, as agreed with my group and in line with the approach that I outlined before the first ballot, I am withdrawing my candidacy and I urge all the Members who voted for me, whom I would like to thank, to now vote for Mr David Martin."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as agreed with my group, I am withdrawing my candidacy."
"My group has discussed at length the various qualities of the candidates."
"I believe that, whatever the outcome, we will have a worthy President."
"Mr President, I should like to say thank you for the 66 votes."
"Those who voted for me can meet in room R31 at midday and decide when I am to withdraw."
"The deadline for submitting nominations for the second round of voting is 12.15 p.m."
"Nominations must be submitted to the Oldest Member through the offices of the Deputy Secretary-General."
"Mr President, in accordance with the gentlemen' s agreement made at the Conference of Presidents, I would like to ask for an extra quarter of an hour, that is to say, I would be grateful if we could start at 12.45 p.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.05 p.m. and resumed at 12.45 p.m.)"
"I shall now read out the outcome of the vote that has just taken place."
"Voters: 592."
"Blank or spoilt ballot papers: 13."
"Votes cast: 579."
"Absolute majority: 290."
"The number of votes obtained by the three candidates standing is as follows:"
"Mr Bonde: 76 votes"
"Mr Cox: 277 votes"
"Mr David Martin: 226 votes"
"Since no candidate has obtained an absolute majority, we shall proceed to a third round of voting."
"We now need to know whether all the candidates wish to continue with their nominations."
"Mr Cox wishes to do so."
"So does Mr David Martin."
"Does Mr Bonde wish to continue?"
"Mr President, I should like to request that the meeting be postponed so that the discussion among those who voted for myself can continue."
"It is obvious that we are not asking for a single political concession."
"Those who have voted for myself are independent Members from small and large groups who do not feel that they have had all their wishes met."
"It is a mixed coalition with absolutely nothing political about it, but these people therefore have a need to talk with the two candidates who will be competing in the final round, Mr Martin and Mr Cox."
"We met with them in room R31, and we should like to continue a little longer."
"Otherwise, I shall have to maintain my candidature, although that is not what I wish to do."
"I shall now read out the results of the vote that has just taken place."
"Voters: 586."
"Blank or spoilt ballot papers: 18."
"Votes cast: 568."
"Absolute majority: 285."
"The results are as follows:"
"Mr Bonde: 33 votes"
"Mr Cox: 298 votes"
"Mr David Martin: 237 votes."
"As you will all have realised, Mr Patrick Cox has obtained an absolute majority of votes cast."
"I offer you my sincere congratulations, Mr Cox, on your election and my best wishes for the performance of your duties, for a term of office which is fruitful and beneficial to the European Parliament."
"I call on Mr Cox to take the Chair."
"(Loud applause)"
"It feels very different to be here."
"Colleagues, today has been a good day for parliamentary democracy in the European Parliament."
"I want to thank our colleague, Mr Soares, the doyen d'age, for the manner in which he has conducted our sitting so far today."
"Our House has divided in votes in this election today on three occasions."
"That is politics and democracy."
"Our House has decided, and that now gives legitimacy."
"I am bound to tell you that after the vigour of this democratic contest in these past months and the past hours today, I feel a deeper sense of the legitimacy of the mandate of this presidency."
"I thank you for it."
"I thank Mr David Martin for the manner in which he has conducted his campaign for the issues which he has articulated and brought forward, which are of common concern and on which we must act."
"I thank Mr Bonde for what he has brought to this campaign, in particular an expression of the concerns felt my many in the House who feel more marginal than they ought to."
"I thank Mr Onesta for bringing his typical panache to the reform agenda and I commit myself to that agenda."
"I thank Mr Wurtz for his kind remarks earlier today."
"I know that politics divides us because we have our convictions."
"We owe our conviction to no person or group of persons."
"Conviction, passion and reason are part of what we bring to our politics, but also an appreciation of being able to do business with each other."
"He has brought that too."
"I thank my colleagues in the ELDR Group."
"I feel very proud that this is the first time in more than two decades that a representative of this group that has played an important part in the democratic life of this House."
"Since the very first assembly of the Coal and Steel Community 50 years ago we have done so."
"It is an honour to preside over the House today."
"I say to my Liberal colleagues that this is a very bitter-sweet moment: sweet, as you may imagine for all those reasons and bitter-sweet because I have always done my politics week in, week out, day in, day out, in the bosom of that group."
"I thank you for all the confidence you have shown in me over the years."
"I hope I can repay a debt of gratitude and a debt of honour."
"(Applause)"
"I thank Mr Poettering and the PPE-DE Group for their nomination, in addition to that of the ELDR, and for your unstinting support in terms of delivering on what you said."
"To have a reliable partner in politics is always important."
"It is a foundation on which we can build in an inclusive way in this House."
"I thank all those who voted for me."
"In acknowledging all those who voted for other candidates, now that the matter is settled I hope we can develop a genuine stakeholder presidency committed to building in this Parliament and in the Union a Union and a Parliament fit for Europe's future."
"(FR) On my own behalf and on behalf of all Members, I would like to pay a very sincere tribute to Mrs Nicole Fontaine,"
"(Applause)... for her great courage, her dynamism and the tireless work she has done day in, day out to defend the interests of our Parliament."
"Mrs Fontaine, your presidency of this institution has been outstanding and exceptional."
"Nicole, speaking as your friend, I would like to thank you very deeply."
"I said earlier today when we were all, as candidates, invited to speak for five minutes, that I felt we needed to do more politics in this House."
"We took that very seriously, which is to say, more politics, yes, but I did not expect that we would have three ballots."
"You are so enthusiastic for politics at this stage that we will have to see how to build on this for the future."
"It reminded me, in a certain way, given my provenance as an Irish European, of the shamrock, which has three leaves and which represents so much to us."
"This time it took three occasions before we had a result."
"I should like to share a story with you, which is not classically parliamentary but nonetheless has a connection and meaning for me on this day of all days."
"It is a story written by one of the celebrated architects of our European integration, Robert Schuman."
"He once wrote, outside the political domain, that a certain saint of Irish extraction - Saint Columbanus - ""is the patron saint of those who seek to construct a united Europe""."
"I do not say in Parliament that it is our function to deal with these saintly matters, nor to intrude in that domain."
"But I recall the story because in the sixth and early part of the seventh century this abbot, poet, scholar and preacher - not the only Irish one to so do - co-founded western monasticism in early medieval Europe."
"His remains today lie and are celebrated still in Bobbio in Italy."
"One thousand three hundred years ago this early Irish European wrote that he came ""from the edge of the world""."
"I come from the western seaboard of Europe, from the edge of our European world, and I have a deep pride about where I come from."
"Although today I accept and acknowledge that I was not elected for my Irishness, I thank you nonetheless that I can also celebrate that fact and that nationality."
"You have found at the heart of European democracy the capacity to take someone from one of the smallest groups and smallest states and say that, in contemporary European democracy, there is a place to include all, including those on the geographic or other margins."
"It is a powerful message that you have given to a Europe about to enlarge."
"I thank you and salute you for it."
"(Applause)"
"I shall now speak briefly in Irish."
"Why do I do this?"
"Irish is my native tongue."
"It is an ancient language from an ancient European country."
"It is an official but not a working language of the European Union."
"I do it to underline my conviction that cultural pluralism and cultural diversity are the sine qua non of the Europe to which I am committed and which we seek to build."
"(Applause)"
"Táimid ar imeall na heachtra is tábhachtaí i nua-stair na hEorpa, forleathnú an Aontais Eorpaigh."
"Is é an tosaíocht pholaitiúil is práinní ar fád ná go gcuirfí bailchríoch rathúil ar na caibidlí faoin bhforleathnú."
"As athaontú na hEorpa a leanfaidh sé go dtabharfar Eoraip scoilte le chéile d'fhonn comhluachanna agus rath eacnamaíoch a bheith ag a muintir i bpáirt le chéile."
"(We are on the brink of the most important event in recent European history, the enlargement of the European Union."
"The successful completion of enlargement negotiations is the overarching political priority."
"Reuniting Europe brings together a divided Europe to share common values and economic prosperity.)"
"We are building something by way of common values and future economic and social prosperity and we are doing work of historic dimensions."
"The Convention which starts in March and on which we now need to work is another opportunity to define institutions and treaties fit for our common European future and for the challenges ahead."
"The Barcelona Process of which we will speak tomorrow and in the weeks and months to come will be a message that we too must connect with and bring reform, bring employment and bring social capacity and economic capacity to the Europe in which we believe."
"The common theme to which I would like to dedicate this presidency is a political commitment - through policy leadership, through stressing our public purpose, through insisting on the added value we bring on a continental scale - that we are building the democratic part of Europe's future and that we are the check and the balance and the counterweight and the source of accountability for the European technocracy."
"We are therefore in our public purpose an indispensable tool to an enriched European future."
"It is common, I understand, after an election for the President to claim the privilege to speak to the House on the morning after the vote, when he or she might be better prepared after the rigours of the vote to express a general view."
"I have chosen this moment to say a few words."
"I should like to claim the privilege to speak on our strategic purpose another day, but I would suggest not tomorrow, because tomorrow we will hear the public purpose of the Spanish Presidency."
"If we wish to become a communicating Parliament, we must find our space, we must find our time, we must get our message across, have our story, tell our story, sell our story."
"I want, with all of you, if you will do it with me, to ask you to reflect on this."
"I have sat in the pit of this Chamber since we came here two years ago and before that, from 1989, across on the other side of the canal."
"Right behind the President, you see the image of Europe with the twelve stars."
"We are politicians so, of course, we must be pragmatic and keep our feet on the ground; but nothing says that we cannot look to those stars and dream our dreams about what future we wish to create."
"I invite you for the next two and a half years, through a stakeholder presidency open to those who will contribute and who are willing to develop what we are as a Parliament, to engage with me in an act of European imagination, sometimes to elevate our gaze above introspection and look to the stars for some kind of European imagination and dream."
"Because when we imagine today, we build the capacity for tomorrow."
"My friends, thank you for this extraordinary privilege."
"I am excited by it and I am humbled by it."
"So far as I can give any impulse to motivate or mobilise majorities in this House, I will dedicate my entire energy to doing so."
"I want to work with you on committees; I want to work with you in the Conference of Presidents and in the Bureau to achieve together our full potential."
"Thank you for bestowing on me today the honour to do so."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, 15 January 2002 is an important day in the history of the European Parliament."
"We have elected a new President, and I should like, Mr President, to congratulate you most warmly on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats."
"I shall say something about the candidates in a moment, but I would ask the other groups to understand when I say that there have been many who doubted that it was possible to elect an MEP from a small country or the chairman of one of the smaller groups as President of the European Parliament."
"I should like to say to you, Mr President, and to everyone else too, that I am very grateful for the fact that the opportunity was given - and to our own group, too - to raise the profile of our European culture, and for the fact that a small political group and a small country also have the chance to take over one of the most important tasks in the European Union."
"(Applause)"
"Europe would be a poor continent if the practice were only to give the responsible positions to people from the 'larger' countries."
"When everyone is given an opportunity and when a figure from Ireland, such as yourself, can become President of the European Parliament and our much-respected colleague, Mr Santer, from Luxembourg, can become President of the European Commission, then Europe is a continent that respects the dignity of all people and all Europeans."
"This, I believe, is the message today. We are giving new expression to the fact that Europe is not governed by the few, but that everyone has a voice, an influence and a portion of responsibility."
"In this task of yours, which you are now carrying out on behalf of the whole of the European Parliament, I wish you a lot of luck, Mr President, and much success when it comes to the common future of our ancient European continent that never ceases to renew itself."
"I should like briefly to acknowledge your fellow candidates, Mr Onesta, Mr Wurtz, Mr Bonde and, in particular too, Mr Martin."
"I well remember, Mr Martin, the discussion we had some years ago in Edinburgh, the capital of another small European nation, Scotland."
"That was many years ago and, at a time when I had no special responsibility here in Parliament, I became very aware then of the fact that it is a source of great enrichment, and also very necessary, that the groups in the European Parliament, despite their various political orientations, should be agreed and united on one goal, namely a peaceful and democratic future for our continent, based on the principle of liberty."
"I should therefore like, today too, to convey a sincere word of thanks and acknowledgement to all the candidates, in particular Mr Martin."
"(Applause)"
"Allow me to say a final word."
"Mr President, this continent was divided."
"When many people, in both my own and other groups, were elected to this Parliament in 1979, no one would have dared to dream that, in a few years' time, we should be able to welcome fellow MEPs from Central Europe here in the European Parliament."
"I should like to propose that, on the day that the accession agreements are signed with the first accession countries, we invite observers here to the European Parliament so that they might begin preparing these countries for the democratic elections to be held there in 2004."
"I wish you all the very best on behalf of our group."
"No one will mind my saying this today on behalf of the group of which I have the honour of being chairman, and I am also rather proud that we have kept our word."
"Trust too is important in politics."
"As I would also say to the other groups, our group will always be an ally of yours while the peaceful and democratic future of a strong and progressively more united Europe is at stake."
"I wish you much success in your work and God' s blessing upon it."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, first of all, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to congratulate you most heartily on your election."
"But more than just congratulating you, I would like to wish you the best of luck, because you are taking on the presidency of this Parliament after a hard-fought electoral battle with ourselves."
"Our group did not vote for you, but you are our President and we hope that you will carry out this task in the gentlemanly, impartial and graceful fashion which is typical of you."
"We also believe that we have played an active role in demonstrating the principle of democracy to all European citizens."
"Democracy means opposing each other politically while respecting each other and maintaining our common values, and, in this regard, we are at an absolutely crucial moment."
"Why?"
"Because we have affirmed our common values."
"I hope, Mr President, that you will defend the positions of the European Parliament in the Convention we are now starting on the future of Europe, and, above all, in the affirmation of our Charter of Fundamental Rights as an affirmation of this 'community of values' ."
"It is also true that we are the hosts of the Convention, because it is going to take place right here in this House."
"Fortunately, Parliament can already be seen as an open house for all Europeans, which you can defend strongly."
"And, in addition to supporting the views of the European Parliament, you should make it possible for our colleagues in the national parliaments to actively participate in this process, which is starting almost simultaneously with your presidency."
"I am also thinking of those Europeans who want to share in this common adventure."
"I think that it is important that we treat them as if they were our own from the month of March without waiting for the ratifications to take place."
"They are going to be members of the Convention."
"We have to develop our relationship with them."
"We are now talking about an enlarged Union."
"But this is not the appropriate time to go into details."
"I have a great deal of confidence and hope in your inaugural speech, which will demonstrate to us the contribution your presidency will make to this process."
"If you would also allow me, Mr President, I would like to thank all those who have actively and loyally collaborated in this electoral process."
"Firstly, to my Socialist colleague, David Martin, with whom I have had the opportunity to share responsibilities for quite a few years now, in the Parliamentary Bureau and in the presidency, to Francis Wurtz, who I think has been an open and noble candidate, to Gérard Onesta and Jens-Peter Bonde, who has been able to completely polarise the electoral process and then was, with a great deal of grace, able to offer you a bouquet of flowers."
"I had none prepared, Mr President."
"In any event, I would like to express our congratulations as a group, our intention to offer you our loyal collaboration, in the hope that you will be the President of all Europeans for a Europe that is more progressive, with more social justice, sustainable development and, above all, a Europe in which we are able to lay the foundations for a Constitution for all Europeans."
"Even if there is no bouquet of flowers, the words themselves are bouquet enough."
"Departing from the normal order of precedence and because of the nature of today, I should like to invite my friend and colleague, Mr David Martin, to take the floor."
"Mr President, before turning to congratulate you, I should firstly like to say that the whole House was honoured by having such a distinguished European and unflinching democrat as Mr Soares chairing our presidential elections."
"It was delightful to see him here."
"I offer you my warmest congratulations."
"It is a victory that was well deserved."
"You had to campaign hard for it. You did so."
"You fought your corner robustly and you demonstrated throughout the campaign all the qualities you will need to be a first-class President of this House."
"I look forward to working with you."
"Given what you said, and your whole record in this House, I know you will work to defend every Member's rights and interests; that you will be fair across the political spectrum; that you will be articulate in defending the rights of this Parliament externally and robust with the other institutions, when necessary."
"I offer you my unfailing support and my loyalty over your two-and-a-half years."
"I look forward to working with you."
"I would like to say thank you to my own political group, firstly for allowing me to stand and secondly for giving me so much support during the last three or four months."
"Perhaps even more importantly I would like to thank those who did not vote for me."
"I reckon I have spoken to between 300 and 400 Members."
"I have spoken to every group in this House."
"I have spoken to committees and intergroups."
"Wherever I have gone I have met unfailing courtesy and politeness."
"Even when people disagreed with me they were prepared to give me a hearing."
"That is democracy in action."
"I thank the whole House for behaving in that manner."
"(Applause)"
"Again, in that spirit, I would like to thank Mr Poettering for what he said, which falls into that category."
"This is not the time for long speeches, Mr President, but you deserve your victory."
"I wish you well."
"You said at some point during the campaign that whatever happened, a week or two after the election we would have a bloody good drink."
"I am looking forward to it!"
"(Laughter and sustained applause)"
"With regard to that quote which has now slipped onto the record, and which I cannot deny, when we had a debate on 28 November 2001 in Brussels, I remember at some stage concluding my remarks by saying à propos the suggestion that Mr David Martin has just put on the record, that one half of me, being Irish, wanted to have a drink but the other half, being Scottish, did not wish to pay for it."
"So we still have not worked out the rules of engagement."
"(Laughter)"
"I ask Mr Bonde, Mr Onesta and Mr Wurtz if they could join us."
"Mr President, of course, like all my fellow Members, I can only welcome your victory, which is obviously well deserved, since it has been gained through lengthy consideration and debate."
"I think that the greatest victories are those that are achieved gradually."
"Your victory, given the pace at which it was achieved, is certainly a great one."
"You have told us that your presidency will be neutral but not indifferent."
"Well, from your first remarks, I believe that you are going to keep your word, because I think that neutral is something that you will be - your track record speaks in your favour and I think that you will listen to everyone."
"But your presidency will not be indifferent, because you are a dedicated European."
"You immediately made reference to the flag hanging opposite us and behind you, Mr President, and it is true that this flag unites us in spite of our differences."
"And you emphasised these differences by speaking in a language which is not a working language but is an official language."
"There are so many languages in Europe that could become official languages when Europe is closer to its people."
"I think that you have illustrated this wonderfully."
"I would like to conclude by saying that I hope that your presidency will be conducted in a manner that reflects the tone of your first speech, in other words, determined and pleasant."
"I shall try."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group and on my own behalf, I would like to sincerely congratulate you on your election."
"Everyone knows that we did not support your candidacy but that we respect you as an individual."
"And we are democrats."
"You are now a President for everyone."
"You are inheriting a responsibility successfully borne, during the first half of the legislature, by Mrs Nicole Fontaine, who, throughout her mandate, respected pluralism and cooperated loyally with every Member."
"We hope that this cooperation will continue under your Presidency."
"And, given your character, I have no reason to doubt this. I would therefore like, in this spirit, Mr President, to wish you good luck."
"Mr President, in any election held by secret ballot in an Assembly, there is always an element of risk and there is always an aura of suspense."
"I must say that at the end of a race that has enthralled us all, you have come first, you have crossed the finish line, and you have now been elected President."
"We would like to congratulate you, of course."
"And we think that you are the type of President that we want. I have become familiar, at the Conference of Presidents meetings, with your sense of diplomacy and your witty, but firm, remarks."
"That may be the case but, throughout today' s proceedings, Mr President, I felt your concern, I shared your nerves when faced with the uncertainty of the ballot and the final outcome was a great relief to both of us when it was announced."
"When you were elected, the first thing you said was that you were President of the whole House, that you were President of all Members, of those who voted for you, and of those who had not."
"You are now everyone' s President."
"Of course, if you speak to each Member individually, you would discover that many more Members voted for you than the number credited to your name."
"But that is how things stand at the end of the day."
"The promises that you are making, Mr President, given your Irish nature, must not be directed to any one Member of this House."
"Therefore, when you decide, at the beginning of your presidency, to buy a drink, I can understand the concern of the Irish half of your nature, which has to pay."
"So, if I may, I would say to you that if you want to be honest and keep your promises, you will not buy just one drink for just one person, but you will have to buy 626 drinks - one for each Member who is here."
"Yes, that is what it means, Mr President!"
"I would like to end on a slightly more serious note. The group that I chair, the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, was struck by the first remarks that you made regarding the need to protect the diversity of our cultures, because Europe will become stronger by adding the characteristics of each nation and not by trying to get rid of these differences which is what some are seeking to do."
"We have taken note of this as well."
"We are counting on you to do this."
"You can count on us to support you but you can also count on us, if it is necessary, to keep a close eye on the decisions that are being taken."
"Thank you Mr Pasqua. I will keep you in suspense no longer: tomorrow, at 1 p.m., all the Members are invited to come for a drink with me beyond the confines of Parliament."
"President Cox, you have been elected by a majority."
"There are different voices at the bottom of the ballot box, and I would remind you of something."
"I know that, when a person belongs to a minority group - you belonged to a minority group for a long time, yourself - he gets used to offering advice to all and sundry."
"Well then, I remain faithful to your custom and am going to offer some advice to the President of this House, whose status far surpasses that of the Chairman or Vice-Chairman of a tiny little group."
"Therefore, I would draw your attention to the wisdom of an old rabbi."
"In difficult situations, when he was told that he had two options, he used to reply: 'In that case, I choose the third.'"
"Mr President, today, you must forget who voted for you and who voted against you."
"You represent the institution that must work in the interests of the Community as a whole."
"You represent the European ideal, and it is this ideal that is being attacked by a politician from one of the families of those who voted against you: as chance would have it, coincidentally, Mr Haider, and, quite coincidentally again, of course, Mr Berlusconi."
"Your role is to act not in the interests of those who elected you but in the interests of Europe as a whole, irrespective of who voted for you or why."
"This is what we expected from Mrs Fontaine and she almost always delivered."
"Moreover, I know that no-one will ever totally live up to the institution' s expectations."
"However, Mr Cox, there is a moral challenge before you, and that challenge is to free yourself from the enormous power of those who supported and voted for you."
"It will not be easy, and if you ever need independence or allies to defend the pluralist approach, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, both those Members who voted for you and those who did not, is at your disposal."
"Do not let yourself be pinned down by one or the other: uphold the freedom that comes from pluralism."
"That is your task as President."
"Mr President, you did it!"
"It was wonderful."
"You had a dream and you succeeded."
"Fortunately you have more dreams, more visions."
"I am sure you will succeed again."
"On behalf of the Liberal Group, we congratulate you."
"We are so proud of you."
"We will miss you."
"We will miss your engagement, your visions and your good sense of humour."
"But fortunately you will stay among us."
"We will do the utmost to cooperate with you and to make sure that your dreams, our dreams, will come true."
"All the best."
"I miss you desperately!"
"Mr President, 29 years ago I visited Mário Soares in his exile apartment in Paris."
"At that time I did not know I would be thanking you today for the good leadership of this meeting."
"I have signed the letter of withdrawal and prepared the speech of withdrawal and regret that the last vote started with my name."
"May I thank the 76 colleagues who lent me their votes in the second round to support the fair chair platform."
"It was clear from the beginning that the battle would be between Mr Cox and Mr David Martin."
"We have had good discussions in the groups and a splendid televised debate arranged by European Voice and the Campaign for Parliamentary Reform."
"The final debate before the vote today was the result of a common initiative from the five candidates."
"Our friendships have not been weakened but been strengthened."
"Dear Mr Cox, congratulations on your victory."
"You gained the majority in a secret vote."
"You are no longer the result of a deal."
"You have a clear mandate from the House."
"The election campaign made you aware of the problems we need to solve."
"Voting must be reformed; speaking time should allow for lively debate, all Members should have access to all documents from the legislative process; small groups and independent Members should have their fair share of posts; backbenchers should be able to speak at least three times a year; newcomers should be invited as observers and have their languages accepted."
"The Convention must appropriately represent the different views of both the federalist majority and the minorities."
"A democracy must always be fair in how it treats its minorities and you will be fair in how you serve the many minorities in this House."
"I wish you 30 months of hard work for the equal benefit of all of us."
"Congratulations."
"On behalf of the quite large Non-attached Group of thirty-plus Members, some of them refugees from other places, I congratulate you on taking office."
"This is a wide and diverse group with a lot of political philosophies, which stretch across the whole range, but they have in common the fact that they all have a political mandate, they have all been supported by thousands, indeed often millions of people in various ballot boxes in different countries."
"Winston Churchill once said that democracy can be inconvenient, but it is the best system we know."
"You also, in your introduction, made a point about people who feel marginal."
"Often, people within this group have felt marginal; indeed some of them used to be in a group that was dissolved and they felt very unhappy about the way that was done."
"I do not wish to make any political points because it would be very difficult to find a common political point in this group; but I do want to point out what unites all the members of the Non-attached Group, which is that we look to you for fairness, we look to you for reasonable treatment, we look to you to recognise people in this part of the House when they speak and we look to you to recognise that although many of us may be awkward, we are nonetheless democrats and we nonetheless wish to play a part in the workings of this House."
"You come from a small country and a small group; indeed we know that you come from a very small group because you were a group of one when you came from Ireland."
"I am now a group of one so that gives us something in common."
"So, from one member of a group of one to another member of a group of one, let me say: congratulations."
"We look forward to working with you and I know all my colleagues on these new benches look forward to you treating them fairly and, I hope, giving them the democratic respect which I know they all deserve."
"Mr Balfe, as a group of one, I am sure you are unanimous on that sentiment."
"We have now conducted our parliamentary business but we are joined also by colleagues from the European Commission, whose presence I acknowledge with gratitude because this is an important moment in our democratic life in Parliament."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate you most warmly on your election to the presidency of the European Parliament."
"This appointment represents the pinnacle of the political career of a loyal, convinced Europeanist, and I am therefore looking forward with great enthusiasm to building a relationship of cooperation with you that I hope will be close and fruitful, just as our relationship of cooperation with Mrs Fontaine was close and fruitful and enabled us to develop a relationship between Commission and Parliament that I feel was truly exemplary."
"Indeed, close, constructive cooperation between our institutions is the key to the smooth running of the entire Community system, and I am sure that, with you at the helm, this cooperation will be guaranteed."
"Ladies and gentlemen, your role of monitoring and supervising the Commission' s performance of its executive duties is vital to the smooth running and transparency of the Community system."
"This principle of transparency must underlie the major processes on which our institutions are working at this great, historic time: enlargement and the process of developing a Constitution, the debate on which was opened for the first time just a few weeks ago at Laeken and will continue here in a few months' time."
"This House directly represents the European citizens, and it is clear that it has the primary task of building the new Europe."
"Working together, Parliament and the Commission can and must show that it is possible to build a new relationship between the citizens and the European institutions."
"Once again, Mr President, congratulations on your election."
"I and my fellow Commissioners look forward to working with you towards this goal."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank and congratulate you, although I do not have much to add to what Mr Wurtz has said."
"I have just one comment to make. We are often told that the composition of Parliament does not accurately reflect our societies, our schools or even our football grounds."
"It is true that we still lack women and that there are not enough second-generation immigrants."
"On the other hand, there is a sector, and I would draw your attention to this, where these two categories are more than amply represented, and that is the cleaning staff, the people whose job is to look after our comfort."
"When one thinks about it - and since you are the President of everybody, I would be grateful if you would take some notice of them as well - one realises that many of the cleaning staff are second generation immigrants."
"The second thing I would like to say, and I am not entirely joking, is this: you surprised us all by speaking in your native tongue."
"My own language - I come from Senegal and am a French MEP - is Bambara."
"I can therefore only hope that I will have just one opportunity before the end of this Parliamentary term to express myself in my capacity as a Member of Parliament in my mother tongue, for that is what we mean by diversity and is also a way of giving each person recognition, for, despite all our differences, we have a future to build together."
"Colleagues, I thank everyone for the good wishes and advice and reiterate that tomorrow, at lunchtime, I invite all Members to join me in a moment of brief celebration."
"That brings us to the next order of business."
"We now must elect the Vice-Presidents of Parliament."
"It is 5.30 p.m."
"If there are amendments I will take them, but I propose to set a deadline of 6 p.m. for candidacies."
"They should be lodged with the Deputy Secretary-General in R 00.101 in the Louise Weiss building."
"I hope you are in agreement."
"Mr President, for obvious reasons, we have to choose between one of the two scenarios and we would ask that we respect the agenda as previously set, that is to say, that the deadline for nominations be extended until 6.30 p.m."
"There may be special circumstances in the case of this request."
"If this is agreeable to the House - we have had a long day of voting and people need to be able to connect and consult - and we accept that suggestion, the nominations will have to be in by 6.30 p.m., which means we vote at 7 p.m."
"The sitting is suspended."
"(The sitting was suspended at 5.35 p.m. and resumed at 7.05 p.m.)"
"First, Mr President, warmest congratulations on your election."
"I just want to make a technical announcement before we start voting."
"There has been a general breakdown in the computer network and it lasted five minutes due to defective hardware."
"The problem has been identified and is being solved and the good news is that the system is now working."
"Do not panic: the right people are on the job and hopefully we will have no more problems."
"Election of Vice-Presidents of Parliament"
"The next item is the election of the Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament."
"I wish to inform you of the list of candidates that has been received. I have received the following candidates: Cederschiöld, Colom i Naval, Dimitrakopoulos, Friedrich, Imbeni, Lalumière, David Martin, ..."
"(Loud applause)"
"..."
"Onesta, Pacheco Pereira, Podestà, Provan, Puerta, Gerhard Schmid, Vidal-Quadras Roca."
"The candidates have confirmed to me their consent to their candidacies."
"The number of candidates does not exceed the number of seats to be filled."
"Therefore I propose that they be elected by acclamation, in accordance with Rule 13 (1)."
"(Loud applause)"
"The applause is the acclamation that confirms that the 14 are now elected as Vice-Presidents."
"However, we must now vote to determine the order of precedence."
"I therefore proclaim these candidates elected as Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament."
"I congratulate each and every one of them on their election."
"We shall now vote to decide on the order of precedence."
"As we are voting only to decide on precedence, no qualified majority is necessary."
"The ballot papers to establish this order of precedence will now be distributed."
"The tellers are the same as for the election of the President."
"I would therefore ask the tellers to take up position by the ballot boxes."
"Mr President, I have a question."
"We have up until now been told that we must put crosses against the names of at least seven candidates if the ballot paper is to be valid."
"Does this requirement to put crosses against the names of at least seven candidates now still apply?"
"It is my information, Mr Friedrich, that you may put your mark against any number of candidates, as large or as small as you wish that to be."
"It is your preference."
"There is no rule on the matter."
"Please use only the official ballot papers and mark the boxes corresponding to the candidates you wish to vote for."
"If you want to change your vote, ask the usher for a new ballot paper and surrender the old one."
"We now proceed to the vote."
"The result will be announced tomorrow."
"For the election of Quaestors, the deadline for candidacies is 10 p.m. tonight."
"Candidacies should be lodged with the Deputy Secretary-General in office R00.101 in the Louise Weiss building."
"(The sitting was closed at 7.28 p.m.)"
"Election of Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament"
"I should like to take this opportunity to give you the results of our vote yesterday for the Vice-Presidents."
"As you know, we elected the Vice-Presidents by acclaim and then held a vote to establish the order of precedence."
"The number of Members voting was 554, the number of blank or void votes 9, the votes cast 545."
"The votes were cast as follows:"
"Mr Martin: 300 votes."
"Congratulations, David."
"Mr Dimitrakopoulos: 240 votes."
"(Applause)"
"Mrs Cederschiöld: 230 votes."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Imbeni: 226 votes."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca: 215 votes."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Podestà: 203 votes."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Friedrich: 200 votes."
"(Applause)"
"Mrs Lalumière: 191 votes."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Colom i Naval: 168 votes."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Pacheco Pereira: 164 votes."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Provan: 162 votes."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Schmid, Gerhard: 151 votes."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Onesta: 148 votes."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Puerta: 120 votes."
"I congratulate all those colleagues and, in accordance with Rule 15(2), the Vice-Presidents will take precedence in accordance with the number of votes they have obtained."
"The composition of the new Bureau will be notified to the presidents of the institutions of the European Communities."
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The next item of business is the approval of the Minutes of the sittings of Monday, 17 December 2001, Monday, 14 January 2002 and Tuesday, 15 January 2002."
"The Minutes have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I think there is a translation error in the Danish text in that, under point 7, 'Closure of sitting' , the words 'The oldest Member closed the sitting at 7.30 p.m.' appear."
"I think it was you, Mr President, who closed the sitting, and that is also what the French version states."
"Thank you, Mr Rovsing, for looking after my interests so soon."
"Douze points!"
"We will have that corrected in the Minutes."
"Are there any further comments?"
"(Parliament approved the minutes of the previous sittings)"
"Mr President, there is a matter I should like to raise."
"On 19 December, just before Christmas, I was the victim of a robbery in the immediate vicinity of our Parliament in Brussels."
"I was in my car waiting at the traffic lights when my windscreens were smashed and everything was taken out of the car."
"I will spare you the details, but I have heard that raids of the same kind have occurred several times since then involving other cars, even last week."
"My question is: could the newly elected Quaestors catalogue the type of robberies that have taken place in the last year near the European Parliament building in Brussels and take tough action with the police so that the latter take measures, for I can assure you, to have to endure something like that is no laughing matter."
"Mrs Maij-Weggen, that evidently meets with the approval of the House and we will do that."
"Order of business"
"The final draft agenda drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting on Thursday, 10 January, under Rule 110, has been distributed."
"I have received no proposals to change the agenda for this session."
"(Parliament adopted the agenda for the current part-session)."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"In light of the amendment tabled by Mr Davies and myself at the end of last year to the common foreign and security policy report and adopted by Parliament, calling on the EU to act as an honest broker between India and Pakistan over the dispute in Kashmir, could we have a Council declaration or an oral question on this matter at the next part-session?"
"This dispute dates back more than 50 years;"
"UN resolutions have not been acted upon and, as both countries are now nuclear powers, it is very important that we resolve this dispute."
"I ask the EU to be proactive and to offer its services as a mediator, as no other body seems to be doing so."
"Mrs Lynne, that is a more unusual point of order but I note the point you make."
"I would ask you to have the item raised by the chairman of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party at the next meeting of the Conference of Presidents, which is the appropriate means of seeking to put it on the agenda."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"The House will be aware that last week in Nigeria a young woman was condemned to death for adultery."
"She was to be stoned to death, having been buried in the ground."
"After a letter from Mrs Fontaine, a number of Members of this House and from myself, as ACP Co-President, that death sentence was not carried out, and an appeal can be made within two months."
"However, I am appalled to tell you that a further case has now arisen; an 18-year-old is to be taken to court on Monday for the same offence of adultery and will be condemned to death, again by stoning."
"I sincerely hope that this House, and every Member in it, will support you in writing to Nigeria in the hope that such sentences will be stopped in the future, so that this barbaric method of killing someone under Sharia law is taken up with the Nigerian Government and the latter urged to ensure that it never happens again."
"Mr Corrie, the follow-up required is clear and I shall do so. I shall communicate that to you and to colleagues."
"Mr President, yesterday you showed you have a sense of history, and that prompts me to ask a question about the European School Portal supported by the European Commission."
"Last week, a web site of this kind was opened that refers to a Soviet history book from 1982, according to which Finland supposedly initiated the Winter War."
"We all know that the Winter War began with the 'Mainila shots' staged by Stalin, and it is outrageous that the European School Portal should contain this type of error."
"It offends my national sentiment and feeling for history."
"The Commission has promised to investigate the matter, but I would ask that Parliament' s authorities too look into the issue."
"It is outrageous that European schools should allow such poor quality on its web sites accessible via the School Portal."
"Thank you, Mr Thors."
"We will look into that and we will communicate with you."
"Mr President, I should like to inform both you and the House of the tremendous damage caused by the horrendous weather which hit Greece in December and which has still not subsided in certain areas, where temperatures have plummeted to below -24 degrees Celsius."
"Several million trees have been destroyed, the olive and citrus crops have been ruined; in some cases they have been completely wiped out."
"The chairman of our group, Mr Wurtz, has written to the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi."
"First, may I congratulate you on your appointment; then may I ask you to start your term of office by intervening to obtain compensation for Greek farmers who, as you know, are the worst paid in the European Union; compensation for the damage caused and your help in restoring it."
"The situation is desperate and we must all intervene at once and do something about it."
"Mr President, from his palace in Carthage, President Ben Ali continues to repress and dismiss judges and to subject his Tunisian political opponents to intimidation in a number of ways."
"I think that Parliament must urgently adopt a position and the Council must issue a statement on this matter this week."
"I also think that this situation is absolutely intolerable."
"Parliament' s watchword should be 'Carthago delenda est' or 'Carthage must be destroyed' , as we can no longer tolerate this regime."
"Thank you, Mr Dupuis."
"There is no proposal along those lines on the agenda at the moment and this week we do not have a topical and urgent debate either; but I take note of what you said and we will see what we can do."
"Decision on urgent procedure"
"The next item is the request for urgent procedure on the proposal, on behalf of the Committee of Economic and Monetary Affairs, for a Council Directive amending Directive 92/79/EEC, Directive 92/80/EEC and Directive 95/59/EC as regards the structure and rates of excise duty applied on manufactured tobacco (COM(2001) 133 - C5-0139/2001 - 2001/0063(CNS))."
"I should like to ask Mrs Randzio-Plath if she is in a position to advise us on whether or not we should grant urgency."
"Mr President, I would like to point out, in addition to this, that we want to submit a second report."
"We hope that the Commission is also of the opinion that there should be a compromise with the position taken by Parliament, whose Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is well known to have voted the first proposal down, but which is now prepared to draw up a new proposal in the Katiforis report, one which we are keen to present to the whole House in February."
"In February, the Council of Finance Ministers will still have enough time to come to a decision about it."
"Accordingly, I have also written to the Spanish Presidency of the Council on the Committee's behalf, and have also informed the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Rato of it during last week's meeting of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"That being so, I do not think that the request for urgent procedure should be agreed to."
"If they are offering to take one speaker for, and one speaker against, the advice from the committee is not to grant urgency."
"Do we have a speaker for or against that proposal?"
"Mr von Wogau, it is not necessary but it is possible."
"Mr President, I get the impression that there will be speakers only against the urgent procedure, something I consider a very important step."
"There is the danger that the Council will decide on its position before Parliament's has been produced."
"I consider it a matter of urgent necessity that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs should deliver its opinion first, and that only then should the Council come to a decision."
"It is for that reason that we should reject this request for urgent procedure."
"On the basis of the two contributions we have a consensus."
"(The request for urgency was rejected)"
"Election of Quaestors of Parliament"
"The next item is the election of Quaestors of Parliament."
"I have received notification of the following candidacies: Balfe, Banotti, Maes, Marinho, Poos, Quisthoudt-Rowohl, Smet."
"The candidates have confirmed to me their consent to their candidacies."
"As the number of candidates exceeds the number of seats to be filled, we will hold a secret ballot in accordance with Rule 13(1)."
"In view of all the voting we had yesterday and as the election of Quaestors runs parallel to our normal business today, I propose under Rule 135 that we vote using the electronic voting system."
"Mr President, I would like very quickly to make a genuine point of order."
"Mr President, I do not believe that the procedure you are proposing will fully guarantee the secrecy of the ballot."
"It is obvious that the neighbours of the Member voting, and who belong to the same group as that Member, can see the screen on the voting machine."
"Given the circumstances, I think this is regrettable."
"The procedure is consistent with the Rules of Procedure of the House."
"My impression from the reaction is that colleagues would prefer to proceed on that basis."
"That being so, I will not press the matter of a vote on the procedure but we should then proceed to the vote on the Quaestors."
"We shall first hold a test to ensure that everybody is familiar with the electronic voting system."
"Do not press me too much on this - I learn as I go along."
"This is like multilateral surveillance in stage 1 of Economic and Monetary Union - it is learning by doing."
"Mr President, I am as in favour of progress as you are and I support the Lisbon strategy for joining the computerised era, but I very much fear that this vote, under these circumstances, where the Members have not had the opportunity to take lessons, raises many problems."
"I would recommend..."
"(Mixed reactions)"
"Excuse me, but this is a right of every Member under the Rules of Procedure."
"I would recommend that the vote be carried out by means of secret ballot papers."
"I take note of that."
"Mr President, my machine is not working. Even my neighbouring colleagues who have tried to help me cannot resolve the problem."
"Let us sort out Mr Berthu's machine."
"The Chairman of the Socialist Group has made the point that perhaps we should use the secret ballot system."
"My impression from the test is that colleagues appear to have mastered the intricacies of the system."
"Mr President, that is not the problem."
"If the leader of the second largest grouping deems it necessary to use the other system, we should not discuss the matter and do so."
"If that is their wish and they feel more comfortable doing so, we should give them that possibility."
"You are quite correct that it is not my impression that counts, no more than it is your impression that counts, but I will take you as a speaker in favour of having a secret ballot."
"Do we have a speaker against having a secret ballot of the traditional, rather than the electronic, type?"
"Mr newly-elected President of this Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, are we, then, more stupid than our children?"
"Are we not in a position, in this technological day and age, to press two keys?"
"We have had the OECD's PISA survey, we have had appraisals, we have a new President, we have paid a lot of money for this system, for which we have had criticism for a long time, and now we want to vote as if this were the Stone Age!"
"(Loud applause)"
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European Socialist Party, I formally request that the vote take place in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, which states that we should vote by means of secret ballot papers."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am no expert on the Rules of Procedure."
"It goes without saying that I am always ready to accept the convictions of others when it comes to procedural issues."
"When I hear though, as I do now, our esteemed Chairman of the Socialist group demanding a paper vote and claiming that to be the only correct form of secret ballot, I would like to refer, Mr President, to your initial statement to the effect that an electronic ballot is a secret ballot and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure."
"If we now want to decide whether we are to vote electronically or with ballot papers - and I approach the issue very even-handedly, readily conceding that one can take one view or the other - then you must let us decide by show of hands, a simple Yes or No, on how we are to vote."
"That is the only way to resolve this procedural issue."
"I would recommend that we now decide in that way, and democratically, how we want to cast our votes."
"We know the essential point at issue."
"Under Rule 135, ""The President may at any time decide that the voting operations indicated in Rules 133, 134 and 136 shall be carried out by means of an electronic voting system."""
"So the procedure to vote electronically is perfectly consistent with the Rules."
"However, it is clear that there is a division of opinion in the House as to which is the best method to choose on this occasion."
"Therefore I put to the vote whether we should proceed with an electronic vote."
"(Parliament agreed to vote electronically) President."
"The next item is the election of the Quaestors."
"There are five Quaestors so each Member has a maximum of five votes."
"If you vote for more than five candidates your vote will be void."
"The tellers are the same as those for the election of the President and Vice-Presidents."
"I would ask them to vote first and then come to the President's bench so that they can confirm the results."
"Mr President, you are quite right; the Rules of Procedure do say that you can use electronic voting."
"However, because of the way it works, it is impossible to hold a secret ballot."
"I know how Mrs Ainardi voted, I know how Mrs Frahm voted, I know how this fellow member voted and I know how that fellow member voted."
"Why can we not vote electronically, but without the asterisk?"
"Otherwise we all know how everyone else has voted and it is impossible to hold a secret ballot."
"We are now in the middle of the vote."
"This was precisely the point that was raised in the question of how we should vote."
"We voted on the matter and so we will proceed."
"I take note of what you say but I cannot now reverse that matter."
"(The vote was taken)."
"There were 534 votes."
"There was one blank ballot and 533 valid votes."
"The majority is 267."
"The results for candidates are as follows:"
"Banotti: 369"
"Quisthoudt-Rowohl: 299"
"Balfe: 259"
"Smet: 254"
"Poos: 221"
"Marinho: 189"
"Maes: 125"
"On the basis of the majority required I declare Mrs Banotti and Ms Quisthoudt-Rowohl both elected to the position of Quaestor."
"In accordance with Rule 15(2) and Rule 16, the Quaestors, like the Vice-Presidents, shall take precedence in the order in which they were elected."
"I declare those two candidates elected and congratulate them on that."
"We will continue with the election of the Quaestors at 12.30 p.m., and by the same procedure."
"That is what was foreseen in the agenda."
"If people want to contest that they are perfectly free to do so."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"With all due respect I appreciate the decision the House has taken but this has not been a secret ballot."
"I know how all of my neighbouring colleagues have voted."
"I appreciate that if we want to have an open ballot we can do so, but then we should not pretend that we have been voting secretly."
"We should vote openly by a show of hands."
"That is my first point."
"Secondly, I should like to say to our colleagues in the PPE-DE Group that with all due respect, we could have used ballot papers in the same time as we have taken now."
"Perhaps we can now proceed in a way that is really secret."
"In my view, we have taken a decision on this system and whether right or wrong, it is a decision nonetheless."
"In future, I think that we should properly verify the validity of a secret system that does not guarantee secrecy."
"That said, we have an agenda in which the debate on the Spanish Presidency is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m."
"We still have 20 minutes thanks to the so-called secret ballot."
"We are going quickly, so let us hold a second round immediately."
"I think that this is what everyone wants."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"I do not wish to delay matters."
"What Mr Dell'Alba has said is absolutely right."
"We have proved that 99.9% of Members of the European Parliament are capable of keeping up with the technological skills of their children."
"It would be quite absurd now not to proceed with the concluding votes on the Quaestors."
"As to the last point made by my colleague on the other side of the House about secrecy, I have not a single clue as to how my colleagues on this side of the House voted, because I did not choose to peer over their shoulders."
"Mr President, I have a simple proposal to make to colleagues which is non-technological."
"We should use our time to complete the vote for Quaestors."
"We have spent far too long voting this week."
"Mr Onesta gave us a very useful piece of paper yesterday."
"I do not know whether it is symbolic, but it is blank!"
"This is a non-technological item, so the socialists should not be frightened of it."
"Having voted, Members should put a piece of paper - or Mr Onesta's block - over their screen."
"It is quite simple."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"I agree with those who say we should use the electronic system, as it is much quicker."
"However, I would suggest that the technicians and those responsible for this wonderful piece of equipment should modify it in such a way that would allow us to vote on all the candidates, plus and minus, which means that every single one of them will have a neutral symbol beside it."
"In that way, if people look at the screen to see how we voted, they will not know."
"That would make it much easier, because otherwise it is easy for people to see how each Member voted."
"I am taking two more speakers and then we will conclude this matter."
"Mr President, my request does not concern the electronic voting system."
"Speaking on behalf of my group, what I am, in fact, interested in is being able to vote at 12.30 p.m. and to have the opportunity to reach political agreements later."
"Mr President, you have taken a decision: we must continue with the same method of voting, despite the fact that we do not agree."
"I would now ask, for the purposes of political assessment, that this vote be postponed until 12.30 p.m."
"I want to be clear on this."
"The agenda had foreseen that the second round would be at 12.30 p.m."
"I appreciate that there are political choices to be made and, while in terms of efficiency we could now complete the matter electronically, it is equally clear that there are political considerations."
"We will take the vote at the earliest moment but not before 12.30 p.m."
"In the meanwhile, the groups have the opportunity to consult with each other."
"We should proceed electronically as we began."
"(The sitting was suspended at 9.48 a.m. and resumed at 10 a.m.)"
"Spanish Presidency programme"
"The next item is the statement by the President-in-Office of the Council on the Spanish Presidency programme."
"This is a very important moment in terms of European politics."
"After the launch of the euro, in a difficult economic climate, there is still the need to complete the economic and social reforms and sustainable development as targeted at Lisbon and Stockholm; the need to use the time this year to create the basis for an enlarged Union; the need to launch the Convention to make a Europe fit for the future."
"So I am sure this is a very full and ambitious programme."
"It gives me great pleasure to give the floor to Mr Aznar, President-in-Office of the Council."
"Mr President, honourable Members, distinguished members of the European Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour for me to appear here for the first time as Spanish Prime Minister and President-in-Office of the European Council to explain to you the priorities of the Spanish Presidency."
"The Spanish Presidency coincides with the change of President of this Parliament."
"Yesterday, we attended the election of a new President in this House and the farewell to a President who has carried out her work very effectively."
"Mr Cox' s personality and political and institutional career guarantee that this House and the Presidency will enjoy fruitful political and institutional relations, which will be aimed at strengthening the European Union and creating a more prominent role for the European Parliament."
"The European Parliament has made a considerable contribution to today' s European Union through its work and its proposals, which represent a constant and innovative quest for greater efficiency in the functioning of the European Union."
"This House has also been able to adapt its diverse European parliamentary traditions, and try out new formulas in relations between civil society and its political representatives, increasing democratic control and the legitimacy of the European project."
"Nothing embodies this idea better than the codecision procedure which nevertheless needs to be improved for the sake of transparency and efficiency."
"The Spanish Presidency will therefore work to ensure that the eight conciliations scheduled for this six-month period are completed quickly."
"Spain wishes to increase the Union' s institutional cooperation and democratic control; I would therefore like to guarantee the Presidency' s presence in plenary sessions, as has become customary during the previous Presidency."
"For my part, I am committed to informing the House following the Barcelona European Council, and carrying out a final assessment of this Presidency after the Seville European Council."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the current political landscape obliges the Union to be ambitious in three areas."
"The first consists of producing a response to terrorism, from the point of view of creating an area of freedom, security and justice."
"The second involves creating an area of greater economic prosperity which safeguards the European social model."
"And the third is to make a success of the historic opportunity of enlargement and laying the foundations for the future enlarged Union."
"In order to successfully reach these goals, we need to work for a greater deepening of Europe."
"By creating 'more Europe' we will strengthen the fight against terrorism and ensure that the introduction of the euro is successful and, only if we are ambitious, we will achieve enlargement, we will make progress with the creation of an area of greater prosperity, we will strengthen the Union' s external role and we will carry out the next Intergovernmental Conference successfully."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to acknowledge, and express my gratitude for, the responsibility that this House and the European Commission have demonstrated in the fight against terrorism."
"Days before the tragic events of 11 September, Parliament adopted a resolution which urged the European Commission to present various initiatives aimed at greater effectiveness in the fight against terrorism in the European Union."
"We must continue to work in the direction which you and the European Commission indicated at that time."
"Accordingly, on the basis of the rule of law, we need to press ahead with the Plan of Action against terrorism in the European Union to ensure that there can be no sanctuary for terror within our borders."
"In December 2001 we achieved great progress in this area."
"All the Institutions of the Union, and especially the Presidency and Parliament, now need to work to ensure that the instruments approved on that occasion come into effect as quickly as possible."
"However, those instruments will not prove effective unless we also achieve closer cooperation between the institutions and the security forces of the EU Member States."
"The Presidency therefore considers it a priority that joint investigation teams be set up rapidly, that Europol' s work be made more effective and that action be taken to prevent the funding of terrorists and of those who shelter or support them."
"(Applause)As you well know, terrorist organisations establish cooperative links amongst themselves so that they can operate in a manner which exceeds the limits set by our borders."
"Spain wants the Union to play a more active role in the international sphere in the fight against terrorism."
"A first step towards this will be to develop close cooperation on criminal and legal matters with the United States, in accordance with the principles which underpin the legal system of the European Union, as emphasised by this House."
"The fight against terrorism needs to be waged within the context of the area of freedom, security and justice."
"The Presidency therefore attaches priority to pressing ahead to formulate a common policy on asylum and immigration, improve the management of the Union' s external frontiers, intensify our action against drugs trafficking and establish mutual recognition of court rulings both in civil matters, through the European enforcement order, and in the criminal field."
"These initiatives will require close institutional cooperation if we are to meet the deadlines set for creating the area of freedom, security and justice."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the euro has been introduced, if I may say so, brilliantly, to say the least."
"By the end of the month few people in the Eurozone will still be using the old national currencies."
"This is good proof that Union policies are accepted when they are implemented properly and effectively."
"The solidity of our currency also calls for closer coordination of economic policies."
"This will mean enhancing the role of the Eurogroup, tightening the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and ensuring strict compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact."
"The euro will also raise the profile of the Eurozone, and this will force the Presidency to ensure that the Union' s views are taken into account in international forums."
"We should recall that over the last decade Europe has fallen back six points in its per capita income compared with the United States of America."
"We therefore need to press ahead with modernising our economies in order to achieve stronger growth."
"Accordingly, another focus of the Presidency' s work will be the creation of an area of greater economic and social prosperity."
"It is Spain' s intention that the Barcelona European Council should examine five specific areas with a view to achieving 'More Europe' ."
"Firstly, we will promote the connection and opening up of European transport and communications systems."
"The Presidency will concentrate on the review of the trans-European transport networks, on making the Single European Sky a reality and on pressing ahead with the liberalisation of rail transport."
"The second area of work in Barcelona will be to design a European energy market based on opening-up, liberalisation, competition, transparency and interconnection."
"With these criteria in mind, the Presidency will examine the opening-up of the gas and electricity markets for companies and for consumers, the rules on third-party access to networks and the creation of infrastructure and interconnections between national energy markets."
"The integration of the financial markets is an absolute precondition for the proper functioning of the single currency and a basic prerequisite for European growth."
"Spain will work to meet the deadlines of the Financial Services Action Plan and to see that the new approach based on the Lamfalussy report, which includes the necessary respect for institutional balance, is applied as soon as possible."
"We are all aware that employment is the best way of achieving social integration."
"As a fourth focus therefore, and on the basis of the Luxembourg Process in its current framework, the Barcelona European Council will seek a greater emphasis on the Employment Strategy in the analysis of the structural inflexibilities of our labour markets, in our tax and social protection systems and in the institutions of the labour market."
"To get a good job, you undoubtedly first need access to a sound education which facilitates student mobility."
"Accordingly, the fifth point at Barcelona will be the Work Programme on education systems for the year 2010."
"We need to step up the quality of Europe' s education systems and open them up further to the rest of the world."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in Barcelona, the candidate countries will take part in a working session of the European Council for the first time."
"In my opinion, integrating the candidates into our work on economic and social modernisation will be the best political signal of our support for the enlargement process upon which the Union has embarked."
"There is no doubt that enlargement will turn the page on a bitter episode in our continent' s past. It will bring in countries that belong to the European family, countries which share our values and which have been treated badly by the vicissitudes of history."
"The Spanish Presidency' s political will is to help ensure that all those countries that are ready can conclude their negotiations by the end of this year, 2002."
"On the basis of the current acquis communautaire and the Financial Perspective, we will, during the Spanish Presidency, be negotiating the chapters relating to agriculture, regional policy and social cohesion policy, financial and budgetary provisions and institutional issues."
"Spain will also be seeking the closure of all those chapters that have not yet been concluded."
"For the negotiations to be rounded off definitively, all the Members of the Union will need to demonstrate their ability to compromise, the Commission will need to present its proposals on time and, above all, an effort will be required from each of the candidate countries."
"Progress will be assessed at the Seville European Council in June."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we also know, and it is our wish, that the European Union is destined to fulfil an important and growing political function on the international stage."
"The success of European integration and Europe' s economic and commercial weight are forcing an ever greater and more important external political profile on the Union."
"The current international context requires us to step up the Union' s presence in areas where peace and security are directly threatened."
"The Spanish Presidency therefore hopes to help develop an ambitious comprehensive regional strategy in Central Asia and Afghanistan to prevent the emergence of new areas of conflict."
"But there will be no point in providing a European presence if we lack the capacity for effective crisis management and, specifically, military forces for limited operations requiring a rapid response."
"This objective should be achieved in the near future, when the European Security and Defence Policy effectively comes into operation and when the definitive pattern is established for a relationship of consultation and cooperation with the Atlantic Alliance."
"In this same area, Spain also proposes to launch a discussion on making the fight against terrorism an objective of the European Security and Defence Policy."
"The credibility of the Union' s foreign policy will rest not only on its international presence, but also on effective instruments for implementing that policy and, above all, on a high degree of mutual consultation."
"On this last point, Spain attaches priority to developing the European Union' s relations with North America and with Russia."
"With North America we need to reinforce the trans-Atlantic dialogue, giving it greater and renewed strategic content."
"With Russia, Spain believes the European Union needs to support the strategy that country is currently implementing."
"Accordingly, one of the Presidency' s objectives will be to consolidate EU relations with Russia, relations based on specific points and tangible progress."
"Ladies and gentlemen, next May in Madrid, the European Union will be holding its Second Summit with Latin America and the Caribbean with a view to renewing and promoting the strategic association between the two geographical regions."
"One objective of the Summit will be to work with Chile in order to make progress on the Association and Free Trade Agreement and push forward the Union' s negotiations with Mercosur."
"In addition, the European Union will be holding specific meetings with the Andean Community and Central America."
"At this point, I am bound to refer to our interest in and concern regarding the developing situation in Argentina."
"The European Union will work with the Argentine authorities to find realistic solutions based on dialogue, solutions which will restore confidence and enable the Argentine economy to achieve new growth and competitiveness."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union will also play an important role in achieving stability in the Middle East."
"For this we will need to step up our coordination with the United States and the other sponsors of the Peace Process."
"I hope that the recent European Union Declaration and the contacts established in the last few days on the initiative of the Spanish Presidency will help resolve a situation of instability which is affecting the countries of the region and the Mediterranean in general."
"The Middle East conflict is a major factor influencing the progress of the Barcelona Process, the only forum for dialogue which brings together all those involved in the Peace Process, who are due to meet at the forthcoming Ministerial Summit in Valencia."
"Spain will also push for the conclusion of the outstanding Association Agreements between the European Union and the countries bordering the Mediterranean, and will work for the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean internal market and the development of the regional strategies on infrastructure."
"To help achieve this objective, the Laeken European Council, acting on a Spanish initiative, took up the idea of creating a bank specialising in operations in the Mediterranean countries, an idea we will be working on over the next few months in collaboration with the European Investment Bank and the monetary authorities."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are convinced that it is only by encouraging balanced development that we will be able to tackle illegal immigration effectively."
"Aware of the enormous importance of this phenomenon, Spain, with the backing of China and Vietnam, has been working for some time to ensure the success of the ministerial meeting on immigration to be held between the European Union and the Asian members of ASEM."
"We know that illegal immigration is the result of poverty and underdevelopment."
"This is why the Spanish Presidency attaches particular importance to the Monterrey Summit on Financing Development, which we are preparing in close cooperation with the United States and Mexico."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I think it is safe to say that few people could have imagined that 45 years after the signing of the Treaties of Rome, 300 million Europeans would be using the same currency."
"We need to pursue this successful course, in what is a key period for the Union."
"This will require greater involvement of the people of Europe in shaping the future of the Union."
"The Laeken European Council decided to set up a Convention on the future of Europe."
"That Convention will be holding its first session on 28 February in the European Parliament in Brussels."
"What place could better reflect both the importance of the new phase the European Union is going through and the recognition the Presidency wishes to give to the European Parliament' s work on the future of Europe."
"The Spanish Presidency is firmly set on contributing to the success of the Convention."
"That success will be the key to consolidating the process of gradual constitutionalisation of the Treaties we are currently engaged in, and to ensuring that such Conventions are in future perceived as a good method of preparing intergovernmental conferences."
"I hope that the President of the Convention will be able, as agreed, to present an initial report on the Convention' s work to the Seville European Council in June."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I came here today to set out the priorities of the Spanish Presidency."
"Those priorities should translate into greater de facto solidarity, a solidarity which will enable us, on the basis of balance and of mutual respect for diverse interests, to continue consolidating the greatest period of peace, prosperity and freedom Europe has ever known."
"We know this will be a complex and arduous task, on account both of the number of issues we will need to apply ourselves to and of the ambitious nature of our goals."
"But it is only by virtue of that ambition, and on the basis of close collaboration between the institutions, that we will be able, as I am sure we will, to make this project a reality, a project whose ultimate purpose is to improve the lives of all the people of Europe."
"Thank you very much for your attention."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, this past New Year' s Eve, all of Europe celebrated the launch of the euro with great joy."
"Barely two weeks have gone by since then, but those two weeks have been enough to see us complete almost the entire transition to the new notes and coins."
"In the twelve Euro-zone countries, 90% of payments are now being made in the single currency: the changeover to the euro has been both a huge task and a huge success."
"We can all feel proud of that success because we have all contributed to it: the European Parliament and national parliaments, governments, the European Central Bank and the Member States' central banks, the Commission, commercial banks, post offices, retailers, businesses, the media and every one of our citizens who have helped to bring about this historic changeover."
"For millions of European citizens, the euro notes and coins in their pockets are a tangible sign of the great political project of building a united Europe."
"As a symbol of that unity, the euro is having an even greater psychological impact than the abolition of passport controls at Europe' s internal borders."
"The euro is thus becoming a key element in people' s sense of a shared European identity and a common destiny, just as it is tangible evidence that European integration is now irreversible."
"The changeover to the euro shows that the Europeans are willing to embrace change enthusiastically and resolutely if that change is for the sake of a better future, and if all the issues involved are discussed thoroughly and openly."
"The changeover to the euro shows the scale of what Europe can achieve when it can muster the necessary political will."
"We must take this as a valuable lesson and apply it in the preparations for all the stages in the process of integration."
"Mr President, Prime Minister, Spain has chosen the motto ""More Europe"" for its six-month presidency of the Union."
"I think we can say, just after the launch of the euro, that Spain could not have chosen better."
"Prime Minister, your government has also devised a broad but balanced and ambitious programme, and I am very pleased to see that the priorities it sets out match the priorities that the Commission has set itself for 2002."
"I can therefore assure you that you can count on the Commission' s full support."
"Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the same ambition that has led to the success of the launch of the new European currency must now be shown and exploited again to accomplish the Union' s Economic and Social Agenda."
"We have achieved monetary union. The time has now come to focus on economic union, and to make it a tangible reality."
"We need the economic growth that will generate jobs and a better quality of life."
"Almost two years have passed since the European Council in Lisbon set the goal of making the Union the world' s most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economic area by the end of this decade, an area which would also enjoy full employment and increased economic and social cohesion."
"Since that time, the Spring Councils have provided the opportunity to discuss economic, social and environmental issues as part of a wide-ranging strategy for sustainable development."
"The Barcelona Council will, therefore, be called upon to assess the progress we have made so far and to set priorities for the coming years."
"In preparation for the Council, yesterday, the Commission adopted its Spring Report, which will provide the basis for the Council' s work and which, this year, bears the title 'The Lisbon strategy - making change happen' ."
"Yesterday' s Commission communication has a central message: the time has come to stick to our commitments and to speed up reform."
"We have no choice: the strategy adopted at Lisbon is the key to developing and consolidating our European economic and social model."
"Indeed, we are reforming a society that already has its own shared values, values that distinguish Europe from the rest of the world and on which the European Union is founded."
"It is precisely these values that we have in mind when we speak of the 'European social model' ."
"On this basis, we have to continue to update the kind of model of society we want and can achieve in Europe: the kind of free, fair, democratic society that our fellow-citizens hold so dear."
"This is not about devaluing or getting rid of our social heritage: it is about adapting it and modernising it so as to ensure that it lasts."
"We have a duty to history, a duty to protect future generations and a duty to respond to globalisation, and all the more so at this time of great uncertainty and risk when genuine, practical solidarity - not just superficial, partial solidarity - has become very important for our citizens, especially the weakest among them."
"The Commission' s report looks at the progress made so far in implementing the Lisbon strategy and concludes that all the prerequisites for success are there."
"On the macroeconomic front, the efforts made over the last ten years towards introducing the euro have enabled the Union to achieve economic stability and have protected it from the worst of the international economic and financial crises."
"Even at this time of economic slowdown, the bases of Europe' s economy have remained sound."
"Encouraging progress has also been made in implementing the strategy adopted at Lisbon."
"Significant results have been achieved in a number of areas such as the environment, telecommunications, education, pension reform and research, but progress has not been as good in other areas, with Commission proposals stalled and the deadlines set by the European Council itself in jeopardy."
"Among these areas are some that are essential to the integration of financial, transport and energy services, the Community patent and the Galileo project."
"I am pleased to see, Mr President, that you have made these areas a priority for your action in the coming months."
"We need to catch up, and catch up fast."
"Our credibility and, more importantly, our chances of making real progress depend on it."
"If there is no change, we will end up with less growth and less jobs."
"The Commission report sets three priorities for 2002: employment, reform and knowledge."
"First, employment."
"Europe needs an active employment policy."
"More needs to be done to remove the obstacles that still prevent people from finding employment or which make it difficult for them to keep their jobs."
"Member States must cut the cost of labour by reducing taxation that affects wages and salaries - especially low wages. They must also review those aspects of their unemployment benefit systems that dissuade people from returning to the labour market and they must make it less easy for them to take early retirement."
"We need better childcare, in order to improve women' s presence in the workforce. We need incentives for those who decide to stay in work longer."
"Employment rates can also be maintained by improving skills, education and individuals' mobility within Europe and between production sectors."
"In other words, we need an active, not a passive approach to change."
"Second, reform, and completing the internal market."
"We need to connect Europe and its markets."
"Much greater effort must be made to achieve an interconnection of national markets and to speed up the integration of financial markets, concluding the reforms already underway."
"We need to open up and connect the energy and transport markets and develop Europe' s broadband networks."
"These industries are the backbone of our economy."
"We need greater competition to bring prices down and stimulate growth while maintaining a sufficient standard of basic services for everyone."
"Third, education, training and research."
"Education, training and research really are the keys to economic renewal, sustainable growth and job creation."
"There can be no 'knowledge-based society' without knowledge."
"Therefore, we need to invest much more heavily in these areas."
"We need an integrated strategy for Community-level education and research, based on networking and mobility and giving priority to the technologies of the future, to biotechnology and clean technologies, for example."
"Finally, our report states the need, after Barcelona, to introduce measures to strengthen coordination of our overall economic strategy."
"This means building a consensus on principles and rules of economic policy that take account of economic interdependence within the euro zone."
"Accordingly, we need to synchronise the three current processes - the broad economic policy guidelines, the employment guidelines and the process of economic reform launched at Cardiff - so that, each year, the Spring Council can review economic and social policy as a whole and make sure it is sustainable."
"Only a more coherent approach will enable us to make full, effective use of the various instruments at our disposal."
"It is time to give up the old, sectorally-fragmented methods."
"Prime Minister, the President of the Commission has to play a sometimes rather uncomfortable role at European Councils - that of being the one who reminds those he is working with of the need to honour undertakings made collectively."
"However, I remain confident that you will support me at Barcelona when I urge the Member States to push ahead resolutely with the agenda of reforms agreed at Lisbon, in line with the report' s recommendations."
"We are responsible for making sure that the Barcelona Council achieves total success."
"If the process grinds to a halt, the cost of 'non-reform' would become unbearable both in economic terms and in terms of the Union' s political credibility."
"Ladies and gentlemen, 2002 will be a crucial year for the enlargement process, and we know that - as we have heard - the Spanish Presidency will be making every effort to keep up the momentum, so that we can conclude negotiations this year with those countries that have shown that they meet the criteria for accession."
"Vital though it is to the Union' s future, eastward enlargement is not the only external issue requiring the Union' s attention."
"Relations with the countries of the Mediterranean are, of necessity, a priority for the Union in its external activities."
"I look forward to seeing Euro-Mediterranean dialogue move decisively forwards under the Spanish Presidency - after all, it was in Barcelona that the dialogue was launched."
"To this end, we must adopt a more flexible approach, setting up, together with some groups of countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean, new forms of sub-regional cooperation."
"Secondly, we have to put into practice the idea, formed jointly by the Presidency of the Council and the Commission, of a 'Mediterranean Development Bank' ."
"Irrespective of whether it is an independent bank or part of the European Investment Bank, it is to be a forum dedicated to development, in which European and Southern Mediterranean operators work side by side."
"In addition, it is vital to promote mutual understanding and knowledge between peoples and cultures, through specific actions on various fronts."
"Indeed, I feel that it is precisely by exporting our experience of peacemaking and our commitment to promoting democracy that we will be able to take ""More Europe"" to the rest of the world."
"Prime Minister, you have pointed out that Latin America, though very distant from us geographically, is very close to Europe' s culture and origins, having shared a long period of history with many European countries."
"This is a time when the Union must show particularly strong solidarity with Argentina and all of Mercosur, as they experience serious crisis."
"Argentina needs to return to the path of economic growth, the only way for it to improve its present difficult social situation."
"There is only one recipe for achieving this goal: restoring confidence."
"Our experience of financial reform and economic development driven by trade and integration could be of valuable help to Latin America as it endeavours to recover, with advantages for all involved."
"Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to finish by saying a few words on the Convention that will be beginning its work under the Spanish Presidency."
"The Convention' s great significance will give it the chance to write an exciting chapter in Europe' s history."
"We all have a duty to do all we can to ensure that this does indeed happen."
"I have already assured its Chairman, Mr Giscard d' Estaing, that he will have the full support of the Commission and the Commission' s representatives to the Convention."
"The Commission expects to work just as closely with the European Parliament, as the legitimate representative of the hopes of the people of Europe."
"We must ensure that the debate is full and fruitful and, most importantly, that it delivers a vision for the future with which the majority of our citizens can identify. The Convention and the subsequent Intergovernmental Conference must complete the construction of an open, accountable, democratic and fair Europe."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen: Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have arrived in Parliament at a time when we are engaged in organising our work for the second half of this term."
"Our attainment of the great objectives of which you have spoken is dependent on technical on behalf of Europe."
"Our group warmly welcomes you to Parliament."
"You have yourself observed that you are here for the first time."
"We emphatically welcome the fact that you will be here in Parliament on three occasions as President-in-Office of the Council and as Prime Minister of Spain to give an account of the decisions reached under your Presidency."
"We are grateful to you for that, and we hope that all following Presidencies will learn from your example."
"We also, though, expect greater transparency in the Council of Ministers and ask of you that the report the Council is now drafting should also lead to real results, making an important step forward towards greater transparency in the Council of Ministers possible under your Presidency."
"You have spoken, too, about terrorism, and we stand shoulder to shoulder with you."
"There is no such thing as good and bad terrorism."
"There is only terrorism, and we must say loud and clear that wherever people are deliberately being killed, whether by ETA in Spain, whether on 11 September, whether in the Middle East or anywhere else in the world, it must be countered by decisive protest from us, and we must combat terrorism with the utmost determination and make democracy and the rule of law the foundation of relations between peoples and people."
"I very much welcomed your reference to Russia, Mr President-in-Office."
"Whilst needing good relations with Russia, we are aware that there are at present the gravest abuses of human rights taking place in Chechnya."
"As Christian and European democrats, we declare that the life of a peaceful Muslim in Chechnya or anywhere else in the world is of the same value as the life of a Christian or a non-Christian in the West."
"We must defend human dignity throughout the world."
"(Applause)"
"You have also spoken about the euro, and we support what you have said."
"Let us, in this hour of joy over the euro, which the President of the Commission has described as a gigantic project, let us remember - for the euro has many parents, indeed only too many fathers - that it was people such as Helmut Kohl, the Honorary Citizen of Europe, François Mitterrand and Jacques Delors, who, with the support of others, advanced this great project in those days."
"I would like also to invoke the name of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, the chairman of the Convention, who, with Helmut Schmidt and others in the Seventies, prepared the way for the European Monetary System."
"I congratulate you on your choice of him."
"What now matters is that we pursue a policy of stability, for things are changing."
"I recall how friends in my party looked at Italy before the introduction of the euro, doubted whether Italy should join the common currency and wondered whether policies of stability were really pursued there."
"I do not want to single out any one country, but all of what we hear today from Italy indicates that the countries in which Italy was formerly criticised could rightly have the same criticism levelled at them today, as they have not been doing what is needed for the stability of the European currency."
"So let there be restructuring of the budget!"
"We must consolidate Europe as an economic base, which means that it is the small and medium-sized enterprises that we must promote by means of a sensible and moderate fiscal policy, something we strongly support."
"In order that we might go in the same direction, we need coordination in economic policy and in stability policy - coordination rather than harmonisation."
"Mr President-in-Office, I very much welcome what you had to say about the Convention."
"We will quite happily offer the use of our group's meeting room - another great group has met there before, so they may well agree to the offer - but the spirit of our meeting room is today particularly well suited to working on the European project."
"I have something to ask of you, Mr President-in-Office."
"It is with great joy that we have heard that our colleague, the former Prime Minister of Luxembourg and one-time President of the European Commission, Jacques Santer, has been appointed by the government of Luxembourg, that is, by Luxembourg's Prime Minister, Jean-Claude Juncker, as Luxembourg's representative to the Convention."
"(Applause) We ask you most sincerely to exert your influence as President-in-Office of the Council so that all governments send personalities to this Convention whose words carry weight in the national capitals and governments, so that what is decided in the Convention may also have something of a cohesive effect on the national governments in the countries of the European Union."
"Let me turn to a final aspect, namely enlargement and the Mediterranean dialogue."
"We are right alongside you as far as the timing for 2002 and the conclusion of the first accession treaties is concerned."
"Our Group has decided that observers should be sent as soon as possible to the European Parliament from the countries with which the treaties are to be signed - observers who would pass on information to these countries until the European elections, when representatives from these countries will sit as equals in the European Parliament."
"We strongly support you in the Mediterranean dialogue."
"We must ensure that people in the countries along the Mediterranean that do not belong to the European Union have a chance and prospects in their own country - in Morocco, in Algeria, everywhere, even in the Arab countries - and do not all come to us."
"We must help them in this, and I very much welcome the initiatives of the Spanish Presidency."
"We wish you every success on your way."
"There will always be a warm welcome for you from us in Parliament."
"If you meet with success, then it is a success for us all, for the Council Presidency, for Parliament, for the Commission and for the European Union that we share."
"Great success for you personally, but also for your presidency."
"(Applause)"
"Let me take this opportunity to congratulate Mr Santer on his appointment by Luxembourg to the Convention."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the Spanish Presidency for appearing here so quickly, in accordance with what has now become the custom, and I would point out that we have passed the mid-point of the legislature with a clear conservative shift in the Council, which, Mr President, is confirmed by your position as President of the CDI - the Centre Democratic International for you and the Christian Democratic International for Mr Poettering; in any event, conservative."
"Your presidency' s programme follows the normal tendency for the Council' s six-month approach of aiming for as many successes as possible."
"But, of course, it is not sufficient to reap the harvest, but we must also sow seeds and tend the crop."
"Mr President, please allow me to analyse the six objectives of the Spanish Presidency, which you have summed up in three categories, in the light of this approach."
"I shall mention firstly the area of freedom, justice and security, with the fight against terrorism as a priority."
"You have rightly acknowledged that the European Parliament acted as a pioneer by stating that there was a need for a Community anti-terrorist policy."
"It did so before 11 September."
"We worked very hard on the Commission' s proposals and would have this policy by now were it not for the inefficiency of the Council, which sent us the consultations in December."
"My political family is entirely in favour of this objective."
"It is your family which has the problems, but we intend to help you."
"Secondly, I will mention the euro."
"We owe the success of the euro above all to our fellow citizens."
"We must acknowledge this, because we also criticise the fact that we are distant from the citizens, but on this occasion, ladies and gentlemen, on 1 January, they have moved ahead of us."
"For once we can say that it has also been a success for the Commission, which has been responsible for the operation, for President Prodi, who, when he was President of Ecofin, made it possible for Italy to join the euro together with the current President of the Republic, while the current government of that country partly chose, on I January, to denigrate the single currency."
"It has also been a success for Commissioner Pedro Solbes, who was the Spanish Minister for the Economy in December 1995."
"(Mixed reactions) Because, ladies and gentlemen, both the euro and Economic and Monetary Union were born in Madrid."
"Mr President, I imagine that all this commotion will not be counted as part of my speaking time."
"Let us hope that this Spanish Presidency can match up to previous presidencies."
"The euro is also a success for the European Central Bank, for the financial institutions, for the hundreds of thousands of anonymous citizens who went to work on 1 January, and we must recognise that it has also been a success for Pierre Werner, for Valéry Giscard d' Estaing, for Helmut Schmidt, for François Mitterrand, for Helmut Kohl, for Ruud Lubbers, for Giulio Andreotti, for John Major, for Felipe González and also for Jacques Santer, as President of the Commission."
"I think it is right to acknowledge this."
"The challenge now is to create an Economic Union which matches Monetary Union - as the President of the Commission pointed out - and also develop the Lisbon strategy, which in our opinion means sustainable development, more social cohesion, more full employment, more competitiveness."
"In this regard, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would draw your attention to the European Parliament' s resolution on services of general interest, which is very explicit."
"It is not sufficient to privatise services without liberalising, because that simply means replacing public monopolies with private ones."
"There must be rules to protect citizens and consumers."
"Look what has happened with Enron and what your government had to do about the Christmas power cuts, when it asked for the illuminations to be postponed by two hours."
"With regard to enlargement, it falls to you to make progress on something which you not going to be able harvest, but you have to do it and I welcome the fact that you are taking this on responsibly."
"With regard to the European Union' s international action, I believe that, as well as the need to persevere in the Middle East and relaunch the Euro-Mediterranean process, Latin America, and Argentina in particular, should currently be the focus of attention."
"We share your concern."
"We believe that we should respond in a decisive fashion, led by the Commission."
"We Europeans have historical debts and links with Argentina, with those people who fled hunger or oppression."
"We must tell the Argentinians that they must believe in their country, in their values and that we will be able to help them."
"I would ask the Commission to put forward a practical proposal in this field."
"Lastly, Mr President, I will comment on the debate on the Convention and governance."
"We welcome the historic milestone represented by the establishment of the Convention."
"We have been fighting for it for many years."
"The European Council has accepted the idea of doubling the European and national parliamentary presence."
"Your presence has been increased more, with the troika and the presidential triumvirate, but we have gained in a relative sense."
"You are perfect hosts."
"You have not said what you think about 'more Europe' ."
"Is it a cause for amendment?"
"In any event, Mr President, I believe that the great majority of this House is in favour of constitutionalising the process, of creating a Federation of States and Citizens."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we do not see the Convention as a battle between parties and in this regard I must point out that Mr Berlusconi said in Le Monde on 12 January that we are in favour of centralising everything."
"Centralising what?"
"The media?"
"In this respect we really are willing to jointly defend our project."
"A final word on governance and codecision."
"You applaud the Mandelkern report, but we are not familiar with it and that concerns us very much."
"We have yet to debate the Lamfalussy procedure."
"We do not support the report of a distinguished official of the Council whom we do not know and which may go against the principle of codecision."
"You must speak to us and sow and tend the crop, as well as harvesting it."
"Let me remind group chairmen and colleagues that we have votes scheduled for later this morning."
"I should like to keep on schedule."
"Prime Minister, you have chosen More Europe as the theme for your presidency. Liberal Democrats hope that this will be reflected in your commitment to enlargement of the European Union."
"Just as this House insisted on Iberian enlargement some 15 years ago, despite doubts in certain national capitals, so we will militate for an early and successful eastward enlargement in which 2002 will be crucial."
"We will judge your presidency primarily by your achievements in preparing the reunification of our continent."
"We wish you success, too, in your efforts to guide smoothly the introduction of the euro."
"As one who saw in the New Year in France, I am particularly grateful for Spain's role in lending Chirac and Jospin a little small change."
"Perhaps next time you see Tony Blair you will hand him a few coins as well and ask him whether his indecision is final."
"British entry into the euro would certainly mean the kind of More Europe we would like to see."
"Your vision of the future speaks of new transnational challenges."
"Relations between India and Pakistan are deeply worrying but Afghanistan must be uppermost in our minds."
"Soon the bombing must stop and the building must begin."
"We must respond to the plight of the people through generous giving from our aid budget and more help in patrolling the peace."
"Your programme speaks of a war against terrorism."
"This is no conventional war and it will not be won with conventional weapons."
"Some of us fear that military intelligence, which is leading to bombing and military solutions, may be causing collateral damage and storing up other problems for the future."
"We hope that Europe can offset this collateral damage by adding to our armoury emotional intelligence, recognising that political problems often require political solutions."
"You kindly referred to my report on terrorism, adopted on 6 September last year."
"I would draw your attention, too, to our resolution on cooperation between the United States and the European Union in the fight against terrorism."
"Liberal Democrats view with deep unease the divergence between the US approach of emergency laws and military tribunals and the rights-based approach that we want for the Union."
"We insist that you can be both tough on terrorism and true to our Treaties."
"(Applause)You will take forward the building of the area of freedom, security and justice defined in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Your presidency programme asserts that current exceptional circumstances require putting security first."
"If this is true we will nonetheless push you to make sure that freedom and justice are not far behind."
"In drafting a programme like this any presidency faces a dilemma. We recognise that."
"A list of priorities soon becomes a universal catalogue."
"Each Member State brings something different to the party. While we welcome the input that Spain can make to the Barcelona Process and Euro-Med, we are nonetheless fascinated to read in your programme that the European Union's northern dimension is one of your priorities."
"We will follow development in this matter closely."
"The reform of the Council that you talk about is most welcome."
"We hope that you will ensure that the Council abides by its undertaking to allow public access to documents and that it seeks better relations with this House, which, sadly, does not get a mention in your programme until page 20."
"This House is the true democratic forum of our continent and we want to see its rights respected."
"If for my Group something is missing in this document it is a recognition of Europe's different regions and cultures."
"It reads to me as a rather Castilian programme that does not reflect entirely the Spain which I have visited and the Spain that is represented in my Group."
"What has become of the work of the eminent Director-General in the Commission, Mr Eneko Landaburu?"
"Your second definition of More Europe talks about 'signifying the European nature of Spanish society.'"
"Our second definition of More Europe would be that it signifies the contribution of all Iberian cultures and the flowering thereof among other European cultures in the creation of a Europe whose strength is not that of a monolithic state with deciduous development, but one of unity through diversity."
"In wishing you every success, Prime Minister, I look forward to a vigorous debate with the Spanish Presidency."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, first of all, I would like to welcome you to this House."
"We hope that you enjoy these six months and also that cooperation with the European Parliament continues to be as positive and open as it was during the Belgian Presidency."
"In a constructive spirit, I would just like, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, to express certain doubts and criticisms that we have concerning the focus of the programme you have just presented."
"Setting the objective of 'more Europe' does not necessarily mean wanting a better Europe in the sense of creating a Europe of more democracy, openness and solidarity."
"The Spanish Presidency has decided to focus very strongly on combating terrorism. This is certainly a legitimate reflection of Spain' s national policy of eliminating ETA violence once and for all."
"However, it would appear important to emphasise that it is neither acceptable nor effective to imagine that terrorist violence can be curbed by reducing the significance of some of the most important victories of the European democracies and the Union such as respect for individual freedoms, citizens' equality before the law and parliamentary control at European as well as national level of all decisions on this matter."
"We would certainly have been much happier if you had shown your intention to uphold these concepts more clearly."
"Moreover, it is a matter of no small concern that the Spanish government is concentrating on cooperation with the United States without, at the same time, distancing the Union from those decisions of the US administration which place it outside the rule of law and which could lead to a militarisation of the legal system."
"Similarly, talking about an international anti-terrorism alliance but remaining silent on the way the Russian government is continuing to terrorise and destroy Chechnya does nothing for the European Union' s credibility."
"(Applause) Secondly, Mr President-in-Office, your government' s programme includes a list of themes, but it does not clearly define the political vision for European integration."
"Further evidence of this is the fact that the only task you are entrusting to the Convention, which will start work in two months' time, is the preparation of tangible, realistic options to submit to the 2004 Conference."
"Yet, as you are quite aware, this Convention is the product of the failure of Nice, and its success will be measured in terms of its ability to constitute a break with the intergovernmental method of reforming the Union and to involve representatives of the people and civil society in the process of European integration."
"It is my fervent hope that the Spanish Presidency will support this innovative experiment and accept calmly that we have reached the stage where it is no longer just the States but the citizens and their representatives at European, national and regional levels as well - at regional level too - who can and must be involved in shaping the future of the European Union."
"On the subject of shared values, I would like to ask you not to underestimate the European dimension of what has been happening in my native country, Italy, where the principle of the separation of powers is constantly being challenged and where there is still a problem with the concentration of media power combined with an unresolved conflict of interests."
"Thirdly, we are greatly concerned at the cursory treatment in your programme of the issue of sustainable development and the urgent need to respond with practical, incisive action to the environmental challenges facing us."
"It would appear that this cursory treatment is a direct result of an antiquated idea that the priorities of economic growth and safeguarding the environment and quality of life are still conflicting."
"In fact, the opposite is true."
"However, and I cannot stress this enough, the environmental constraints governing the economic, social and fiscal policies of the Union and its Member States continue to be inadequate."
"In this connection, I would very briefly like to give you two negative examples, which directly concern Spain."
"The first is the national hydrological plan, against which there is strong opposition in your country, Mr Aznar: 400 000 people protesting in Madrid and 10 000 in Brussels, as well as 25 000 individual complaints to the Commission cannot be ignored, and we will make this matter a priority in our work."
"We do not accept the claim that the hydrological plan is purely a Spanish affair, not just because the Spanish government wants EUR 8 billion from the Structural Funds to be spent on financing part of it but because, if it were to be implemented, it would violate European legislation on nature conservation and the safeguarding of water resources and would lead to a distortion of competition in the agricultural sector."
"Also, finally, because the real purpose of the plan is to transfer water resources from poor regions to wealthy regions in order to serve water-intensive farming and tourism development."
"This is a recipe for disaster, which has already caused havoc that we cannot allow to be repeated."
"I have other things to say to you, Mr President-in-Office, regarding the liberalisation of the electricity market, but I will save them for another time."
"In any case, I wish you a successful six month' s work."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Spanish Presidency has come at a time of international difficulty and it must therefore deal with highly topical issues."
"In order to deal with these issues, as you said, Mr Aznar, we will need 'more Europe' ."
"The introduction of the euro has created a new reality."
"The most important task, Mr Aznar, is to supplement the euro in the economic and social fields."
"You have expressed your intention to carry out what you call new economic reforms."
"In the language of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, this means promoting the social aspects of European integration in a decisive manner and strengthening economic and social cohesion."
"We believe that Europe is not going to improve its economic cohesion and development by means of policies of liberalisation and privatisation, by means of employment deregulation which endangers jobs and by reducing levels of social protection and by tax reforms which make fiscal systems less sufficient and less progressive."
"Furthermore, Mr Aznar, the international economic situation demands imagination and flexibility."
"We believe that we should not confront it shackled by a rigorous and excessively restrictive notion of the stability pact."
"The fact that the world economy is now close to recession is beyond question, Mr Aznar."
"The European Union needs political impetus and democratisation of its economic decision-making."
"We need budgets geared towards employment and economic and social cohesion."
"The stability pact must be made more flexible and at least preserve public investment when there are excessive deficits, and this is an expenditure which is an essential element for the future development of the Union and also, in the short term, an element which will increase and stimulate economic activity."
"It is essential to supplement the single currency with a process of harmonisation in the fiscal, employment and social fields, building a genuine economic policy - not just monetary - and making decisive progress towards a social Europe."
"Lastly, Mr Aznar, it worries us that there is no attempt to strengthen public services, which would reflect a social view of European integration."
"Many fashionable reforms in our countries put an end to public monopolies in strategic sectors, only to convert them in many cases into private oligopolies, which makes them difficult to control publicly and which does not lead to any real increase in efficiency."
"I could cite various examples in different countries concerning rail transport, health systems or electrical supplies."
"Therefore, Mr Aznar, in summary, we believe that the Barcelona Summit should reflect this type of concern and adopt a much more dynamic and stronger view of European social integration."
"You will recognise, as I do, that, on this issue, I am obviously expressing the existing differences, as you know, between our different political forces."
"Of course, Mr Aznar, the negotiations on the bases of the enlargement agreement - as the Spanish Presidency has said, and I agree with it - must be concluded during this six-month period."
"Otherwise, enlargement will not be possible in 2004."
"In this regard, Mr Aznar, I would like to make the following comment: a Union of 27 States - with enlargement to a further 10 States - will increase the surface area of the European Union by 34%, it will increase the population by more than 28%, but the Community income will increase by barely 5%."
"Do we really appreciate the political challenge posed by enlargement?"
"Do we really appreciate the degree to which social problems may be exacerbated as a result of enlargement?"
"In the current European Union, 16% of the population have a per capita income which is 90% lower than the Community average, and in the Union of 27 States, for example, this proportion would rise to 34%."
"We therefore believe that for the first time, unlike what happened with the so-called Delors packages, where in successive enlargements of the area of the internal market there were firm commitments in relation to decisive increases in economic and social cohesion, we are now in a situation in which economic and social cohesion - as was expressed in the Delors packages - must be thoroughly strengthened and increased."
"We would therefore like an unequivocal signal in this regard."
"It is possible that the agricultural negotiation will end with the implementation of a transitional period that will go beyond the deadline of 2006."
"The problem will be what to do next."
"Agriculture, like any economic activity, requires prospects and the negotiation should be accompanied by clear signals on the future of the agricultural policy, where we will surely hear requests from some people for the dismantling of common policies for the sake of budgetary savings."
"Others believe that the common policies should not be dismantled, but rather strengthened in certain areas, such as food safety and environmental concerns, which should be incorporated into all our Community policies."
"The question of the structural funds brings into focus - as I said in relation to the Delors packages - the future political shape of the European Union."
"A larger European Union will require greater efforts to increase economic and social cohesion between the regions."
"Mr Aznar, we must construct an area of freedom, justice and security for the citizens, while fully respecting the democratic traditions of our countries and the fundamental human rights embodied in our Charter."
"There is no place for terrorism in this area."
"Terrorism is our enemy, but neither should there be room for repressive laws or measures which bear no relation to this fight and which contribute to reducing the legal and judicial guarantees of our citizens."
"The construction of this area of freedom must also be an opportunity to achieve a very high degree of harmonisation of legal guarantees."
"In the field of foreign, security and defence policy, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am going to make a few very specific comments in order to be brief."
"The Spanish Presidency has the responsibility to ensure that the European Union and the European Parliament, in cooperation with the Spanish Presidency, take a decisive step in terms of seeking a just solution in the Middle East."
"We believe that we should make it very clear that the decisions of the United Nations and of international law should be respected and that Israel' s illegal and military occupation of the Palestinian State should cease."
"We should welcome the intention to continue improving the Barcelona process, which is currently in stalemate."
"A genuine regional integration of the countries on the Southern shores of the Mediterranean is necessary."
"The development of the region cannot be based solely on the aid and commercial concessions provided by the European Union, established individually with each of the Mediterranean countries."
"More Europe means playing our proper role in regional stabilisation and promoting the economic development of our neighbouring areas."
"Accordingly, the initiative of creating the Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank seems to us to be a positive one."
"But, while perhaps complicating the issue, Mr Aznar, the Morocco-Sahara conflict must be resolved through the calling of the referendum on self-determination, as agreed in the United Nations."
"We believe that the position taken by the Spanish Government on this problem, in accordance with Spain' s responsibility towards the Saharan people and international law, is commendable."
"The Spanish Presidency should direct its greatest efforts towards Central America, particularly at this crucial time, with the acute crisis in Colombia and the collapse of the Argentine economy."
"The European Parliament unanimously supported the negotiated solution to the long conflict suffered by Colombia, disassociating itself from the militarisation of the United States' proposal, the Colombia Plan."
"In these tragic times, the authoritative voice of the European Union may be decisive in terms of consolidating talks between the government and the guerrilla movement."
"We hope, Mr Aznar, that you will act accordingly."
"The Belgian Presidency has taken significant steps in normalising relations with Cuba, by beginning to overcome the so-called common position, which is more suited to the Cold War than to present times."
"Mr Aznar, my political group has strongly supported the Convention."
"We would have liked the participation in it to be more pluralist, but in any event, we are convinced of its importance."
"The Spanish Presidency has said that the issues dealt with by the Convention must be very open and that its agreements and conclusions should inform the future decisions of the Intergovernmental Conference and the Treaty of 2004."
"Mr Aznar, you will note that I have described a landscape of positive and negative positions."
"You can count on the cooperation of the humble group I represent within my political group on all those positive issues."
"Mr President, in setting out the presidency's programme with regard to key policy issues, which will be addressed over the next six months by the European Union, the Spanish Prime Minister has stated that his priority of priorities during Spain's six-months' presidency of the EU will be the global fight against terrorism."
"I strongly support this political objective."
"The European Union has certainly adopted a series of measures to combat international terrorism in recent months as an immediate response to the horrific terrorist attacks in the United States last September."
"The prevention of the use of the European financial system as a money-laundering route for terrorism must continue to be a priority for our Union."
"The fifteen governments of the Union should also be in a position to freeze the assets of terrorists and those involved in organised and international crime."
"I very much welcome the Spanish Government's objective of promoting more police cooperation across the borders of the Union."
"This is very important because intelligence agencies within the Union, together with Europol, have to work much more closely together in terms of exchanging and sharing information if the terror networks operating in Europe are to be broken."
"The enlargement negotiations with the applicant countries will be entering a new phase during the Spanish Presidency."
"This presidency is being entrusted with two very difficult chapters in the negotiations on enlargement, namely agricultural policy and regional aid."
"The Union and the applicant countries must sit down and hammer out an agreement on the difficult chapters of the discussions because otherwise enlargement of the Union cannot take place quickly and will not be a success."
"Countries in Eastern and Central Europe are presently receiving EU Structural Funds so as to make their economies more competitive."
"This is an important policy objective because it will ensure that on entry these countries can participate within the Union in a competitive climate."
"If the economies of Eastern and Central Europe are not competitive, then they will not be able to participate within the internal market in any real, effective sense."
"Equally, promoting market economies in Eastern and Central Europe is good news for businesses within the Union, which can also expand their goods and services into new markets."
"The Spanish Government is also going to set up the Convention in March this year to look at the development of the future of EU policies within the Union in the context of the next Intergovernmental Conference in 2004."
"It is important that the terms of reference of this Convention are clear and decisive and that its conclusions in due course do not turn out to be an unattainable wish list."
"Amendments to the Treaties have to be agreed by European Union leaders and any proposals emanating from this Convention must be balanced, progressive and achievable."
"I also welcome the commitment of the Spanish Government to promote the implementation of EU regulations and directives, which should expand the use of new information technologies into all parts of the Union."
"This is exceptionally important if the Union is to remain competitive in the years to come."
"Finally, one of the great disappointments of Laeken was the failure to reach agreement on the siting of up to 12 new important EU agencies."
"I hope that the Spanish Government can reach agreement quickly on the location of these important agencies, in particular the European Food Authority and the European Maritime Safety Agency."
"Mr President, the smallest group in Parliament, the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, also wishes to welcome the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Aznar, and we should like to talk a little about the Convention, which will begin on 1 March. It will have a very unevenly balanced membership of 105 people and a 14-member praesidium which also looks as if it will be very unevenly balanced."
"I would call upon you to ensure that these 14 members also include representatives of the 49% who voted 'no' in the referendum on Maastricht in France and of the near enough 50% who voted 'no' in a couple of referendums in Denmark."
"I think it very inappropriate to put together a praesidium of 14 representatives who think alike and who will produce a result which, after three or four years, then ends up being overturned in a referendum."
"It would be more practical to secure a lasting compromise by entering into dialogue straight away with the different points of view to be found among the various populations."
"The intergroup here in Parliament, which is called 'SOS Democracy' and whose members are in a way the federalists' polar opposites, as well as partners cooperating on issues of transparency and proximity to the people, has had an excellent meeting with Mr Verhofstadt and also wishes to request a corresponding meeting with yourself."
"During the meeting with Mr Verhofstadt, the latter made two interesting pledges."
"Firstly, he called for all the delegations from all the countries to include those we call Eurorealists and urged that, for example, at least one of the three representatives - two from the national parliament and one from the government - from two of the countries should be someone with a Eurorealist approach."
"He pledged that he would work towards these goals and called upon us to campaign for them."
"His second pledge was that he would support a subsequent referendum."
"My question to Mr Aznar is as to whether he too would call for broad representation and ensure that referendums subsequently take place."
"Will he be involved in ensuring that two different drafts are prepared: a constitution for a democratic federal state, and a democratic agreement between independent countries, so that people can see the difference?"
"Will he be a party to holding a consultative referendum on two different proposals?"
"Will be involved in asking people what they think and have an intergovernmental conference called for the purpose of preparing a compromise?"
"We must discuss how the Charter can bind the institutions together without coming into conflict with the constitutions and the European Court of Human Rights; how a division of the Treaty into two parts will not simply make it less likely that there will be referendums in the event of Treaty changes; how more than thirty forms of decision can be reduced to three clear forms of decision; how we are to formulate a right of veto on crucial issues without paralysing the whole process; how the national parliaments are to be associated with the cooperation process and whether they can assume the Commission' s initiative, monopoly and competence catalogue; and how it can be ensured that matters do not just go the same way as did the rule of law."
"In connection with the issue of openness, which Mr Watson also addressed, I should like finally to ask you, Mr Aznar, whether you will change Spain' s position and ensure that Parliament receives the same documentation as the Council of Ministers."
"As a friend of Spain, I particularly welcome you to Parliament, and I hope that you will surprise us by implementing that openness which Sweden did not get anywhere with and which Belgium did not work to bring about."
"Bienvenido."
"Thank you Mr President."
"(The speaker continued in the Basque language) Urte berri on danori eta zuri zorionak Lehendakari Jauna."
"Mr President, Happy New Year to everybody and congratulations to our President."
"Yesterday Mr Poettering mentioned the relevance of you being Irish as the best evidence of political success for the small countries of our continent."
"As a Basque, I was very pleased to hear that, because the Republic of Ireland, which has only existed for a century, can give a European stateless nation like ours a very encouraging example."
"For that reason too, I wish you good luck and all the best."
"During the coming months, however, the Government of the Kingdom of Spain will be at your side watching how faithfully you are following the path marked out by your predecessor."
"Let me recall that in 1999 the refusal of the Spanish Government to move from its nationalist blindness threw away the greatest chance for peace in more than a generation."
"Prime Minister, can you give this Parliament a glimmer of hope by saying that you will be committed to working towards a political settlement of the ongoing conflict in the Basque country?"
"Time is running out."
"At the end of this week you will have 10% less time left in the term of your European Union presidency."
"You must hurry up."
"We are ready for an immediate breakthrough in the present deadlock."
"I will finish by recalling the words of Mr Watson."
"He said that it is necessary to recognise that ""political problems often require political solutions""."
"As we are running behind time, thanks to the capacity of some of the group chairmen to express themselves, I will show a less liberal disposition for the balance of the morning."
"Mr President, I hope that you will not start shortening my speaking time."
"I believe that the debate we are holding today clearly demonstrates that we are at a decisive point in terms of European integration."
"And I therefore believe that the ambitiousness of the Spanish Presidency' s objectives - any one of them could be described as historic - quite rightly reflects this fact."
"The truth is that the decisiveness, or even enthusiasm, with which 300 million European citizens have taken on board the euro, suggests that we can look to the future with optimism."
"The European Parliament, as an expression of popular will, must now demonstrate its ability to play its role of providing the debate with impetus, a role which has particularly been recognised over the last six months of the Belgian Presidency and as the Spanish Prime Minister has stressed this morning."
"We have provided the Commission and the Council with inspiration, for example, in order to provide the justice systems of the Member States with Community instruments which make the defence of freedoms in the face of terrorism more effective."
"Since the beginning of this legislature, it has been made clear in this House, more than in any other place, that terrorism is a problem and a threat to everybody, and not only to the direct victims."
"Therefore, the fact that the Presidency-in-Office of the Council has said that it is necessary to improve the codecision procedure in the next reform of the Union Treaty is an acknowledgement that we should be grateful for."
"We are going to deal with this reform by means of the method which was used to draw up the Charter of Fundamental Rights - which my Group hopes will be incorporated into the new Treaty - that is to say, by means of a Convention which will be inaugurated in March in the headquarters of Parliament, as has been revealed to us this morning."
"We trust that that positive attitude from the Council will be maintained throughout the work of the Convention, so that we can respond to two needs: firstly, to bring the Community institutions closer to the citizens by making them more democratic, more efficient and more transparent; and secondly, by undertaking a profound reform of an institutional framework designed for the six founding States, adapting it to a reality in which there are 25 or more Member States, which we hope to see in 2004."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the negotiations for the enlargement of the European Union - some of the most important chapters of which, as has been said, will be dealt with in the coming months - should not in any way become polluted by domestic debates."
"On the contrary, in the current Member States, government and opposition should leave aside party-political confrontation in the face of this great Union objective."
"Mr Barón, we must bear in mind that the success of a Presidency is not measured in national terms, or much less party-political terms."
"This morning you recognised that you need to take a few classes."
"I fear that you do not only need computing classes."
"You spoke like a Spanish Socialist."
"I trust that you will show the same loyalty that the European Popular Party showed to the two previous Presidencies."
"(Protests from the PSE Group) Mr President, we must use these six months to make the European Union stronger in the world, participating in international debates by means of the common position."
"To this end, it is not just necessary to move ahead with the institutional reforms of the CFSP in order to make it more efficient and visible inside and outside our borders, but we must also improve the instruments which the European Union already has, such as the Community external service."
"There is no doubt that numerous challenges await us over the next six months, which will demand effort and cooperation from all of us: citizens, European institutions, governments and political parties."
"We fully trust that this Presidency will represent a step towards a larger and more united Europe, which is more open to the world and closer to the citizens."
"Mr President, holding a Presidency is always an opportunity for a country to demonstrate its commitment to a common cause which is no less than moving European integration forward in a way that benefits the citizens."
"Mr Aznar, I know that you have a difficult job, that the international context, in political and economic terms, is complicated and furthermore, as has been said, that the Belgian Presidency has set a very high standard."
"But have no doubt, Mr President, that the Spanish Socialists will cooperate unreservedly in making the Presidency a success for Spain and for Europe."
"There will never ever be disloyalty from our side."
"Others may show some."
"We hope that you do it well, because we want this Presidency to give Spain prestige within Europe."
"Therefore, Mr President, your personal effort and that of the members of your government will have to rise to the occasion."
"Mr President, in your communication you have listed Europe' s current priorities."
"Enlargement, the Lisbon process, the international coalition for freedoms and against terrorism, the single area of security and justice, the external policy, relations with the Mediterranean countries, the role of Europe in Latin America: that is your agenda, Mr President."
"But we Socialists would have liked to hear you make some specific commitment, an ambitious initiative relating to some of these issues."
"For example, we would have liked it if, when talking about the Lisbon process, you had stressed the social aspects."
"Because the Lisbon process agreed a strategic objective which, together with the construction of a more prosperous and competitive economic area, included the objectives of full employment and greater cohesion."
"Please commit yourself, Mr President, to making all the coordination methods relating to these social agenda strategies increasingly Community methods."
"Associate the European Parliament, the unions and employers with this process."
"In our view, this would mean more Europe."
"I will give another example: the Mediterranean and Latin America are European priorities, but a good Spanish Presidency, given its special closeness and relations with these two regions, should be able to put the emphasis on them."
"Nevertheless, we do not notice in your programme concrete initiatives to revitalise dialogue and cooperation beyond the creation of the Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank, which by the way was foreseen in 1995 in Barcelona and later in Laeken."
"You do not tell us how or when you are going to conclude the negotiations with Mercosur and with Chile."
"We note the lack of concrete commitments."
"Mr President, we are glad that you have chosen the motto 'More Europe' , and not because it is a classic of the Socialist family."
"I will tell you now that we will not judge you by the number of meetings you hold in six months, but we will judge you on the results."
"So you must move on from words to actions, Mr President."
"What do you mean by more Europe?"
"I imagine that it will not be, as Minister Piqué said, that Europe should speak with a single voice in 2050, because, as country folk would say, 'that is a journey that requires no saddlebags' ."
"I am truly impressed by the ambition of the Minister for External Affairs."
"More Europe means more security, but also more freedom."
"More Europe means more employment but also less inequality."
"More Europe means more democracy and more participation."
"More Europe also means a Europe that is more active in the defence of human rights."
"More Europe, in summary, also means less nationalism, of either the old type or the new type."
"Mr President, if you act in this way, we will be the first to applaud you."
"We want you to be successful and we want to celebrate your success together."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to stress the support of the Liberal Group and of my party, Convergència Democràtica de Catalunya, in order to ensure that this Presidency ends with a positive assessment, with distinction, which will include it in the category of the two previous Spanish Presidencies."
"Of the issues mentioned as priorities for the present Presidency, I would like to stress the following three."
"That the meeting of the Barcelona European Council, in March, provides concrete commitments and results which can be confirmed, in order to ensure the effective implementation of the structural reforms and liberalisation processes necessary for complying with the objectives set in the process initiated at the Lisbon Council."
"That the Euro-Mediterranean Council serves to promote a new stage in the process begun, also under a Spanish Presidency, in Barcelona in 1995, in order to ensure greater and better cooperation between the European Union and the third countries of the Mediterranean."
"We are in favour of the creation of a financial institution which allows the full and effective application of the funds agreed for the Mediterranean programmes."
"We must intensify the Union' s external policy, in which much of its future peace and stability is at stake."
"In your key role as a member of the Praesidium of the Convention, we ask that you ensure the incorporation and participation of the constitutional regions in the institutions of the European Union in the constituent text to be agreed at the Intergovernmental Conference of 2004."
"As the chairman of the Liberal Group stressed in his speech, the European Union cannot be considered complete unless it includes the full participation and integration of the Europe of the Regions."
"It is an issue to which, under the Spanish Presidency, which will begin with the Convention, we attach the greatest importance, as has been stressed."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Spain will endow the Presidency of the European Union with a proposed set of priorities which shows ambition and will."
"European integration today means strengthening freedoms, isolating intolerance and making that integration compatible with the necessary fight against terrorism."
"The priority given by Spain to enlargement is not accompanied by the necessary commitments to guarantee the legitimate objectives of the Objective 1 territories."
"Vital to me, as a supporter of Andalusian autonomy, in order to safeguard the future, are the reform of the common agricultural policy, the debate on rural development, codecision in agriculture and food safety, in order to prevent extremely costly crises and alarm amongst consumers."
"The presence of the autonomous communities in the Council when issues relating to our interests and competences are dealt with will always be positive and enriching."
"Reflect the reality of Spain in Europe."
"Do not try to hide it, Mr Aznar."
"The autonomous communities are also States."
"A plural Spain in a plural Europe, creating more Union."
"Take that political and social reality further."
"Mr Aznar, you have not explicitly mentioned Morocco in your speech."
"Include it in your Presidency."
"Mr Aznar, please do not let the neutrality of the Presidency paralyse our legitimate Europeanist objective of cohesion."
"Let us be firm, but let us also talk."
"Mr President, it is a shame that, yet again, some of the left-wing Members have adopted a presumptuous, party-political position of opposition to Italy, to a people, that is, who elected their government freely and democratically, with regard to the development of the future and present European Union."
"Moreover, such trifling issues do not deserve Parliament' s attention."
"Mr Aznar, the Spanish Presidency' s programme is full of issues to be addressed and objectives, and underlying all the initiatives we can see the commitment to restoring politics to its central place in the debate."
"Time constraints prevent us from mentioning more than just a few points."
"Firstly, the common economic policy that you have tackled, which the President-designate of the Commission has pinpointed as key for the future and which confirms the view we expressed in voting for the euro in Brussels: there can be no monetary policy without a strong common economic policy."
"Secondly, the Mediterranean policy, whose progress must be speeded up because, although cooperation between the intelligence services of the European countries is extremely important to combat terrorism - as we have stressed in the debate on that subject - it is equally true that we need to combat poverty, to restore peace to the Middle East, to re-centre the European Union politically: therefore, we need an incisive Mediterranean policy to be a key part of the forthcoming Barcelona Summit."
"Thirdly, implementing the concept of More Europe, or More Europe of the Citizens practically, which means we need institutions which are less bureaucratic and more democratic, and we need greater respect for traditions, for the identities of the individual countries, for a Europe which is not just a standardisation machine but generates growth for each country, as the President of Parliament, Mr Cox, said yesterday."
"Then we must not forget the Argentinian disaster: the one hundred and twentieth crisis in Argentina since 1975."
"We therefore also need to address the issue of the speculation bubble, the excessive disparity between the actual economy and - indeed - the official economy; we must tackle the Argentinian problem by providing aid immediately, not least because of the ties of friendship and tradition our countries have with Argentina."
"Mr President, it is a matter of some regret that Spain, a great country that France and the French people hold very dear, has chosen the theme of 'More Europe' . This theme does not break any new ground, as it has, after all, been compulsory for almost fifty years, and it cannot fail to cause us concern because 'More Europe' equates to nothing more than the constantly increasing destruction of what makes up the substance of Europe, namely the nations."
"To some extent, however, Spain will not break any new ground."
"You are not breaking new ground, in particular, in the area that you have made your priority as a head of government, Mr Aznar; in other words, the fight against terrorism."
"There is something risible about combating terrorism when you appear to be doing everything possible to encourage its growth, both at a superficial and deeper level, in Europe and everywhere else in the world."
"An obvious example of its superficial growth is the ridiculous and criminal obsession with bringing down borders, which of course does not fail to make police controls increasingly difficult and which, above all, encourages internationalism which has always been the greatest weapon of all forms of terrorism since time immemorial."
"At a deeper level, bringing down borders destroys people' s sense of national belonging, which for centuries has given them a reference point in space and time, and, in other words, a place in history."
"They thus rediscover their ethnic origins and begin to fight against what remains of the nation State, a fight that we also encourage on occasion."
"Thus, what is happening in Spain is what happens everywhere else."
"In our view, we can only combat Basque terrorism by asserting a broad Spanish policy on the international stage, a policy which, fortunately, Spain also has the resources to conduct in Europe, in the Mediterranean and in Latin America."
"However, Europe does not allow us to be self-assertive."
"At a deeper level still, terrorism is both favoured and encouraged by the deep disorder into which the world is plunging under the battering that the nations are suffering as a result of the sacrosanct dogma of capitalism that is trade liberalisation."
"This does not only lead to the destruction of the national sense of belonging, which is also one of the sources of Islamic terrorism, but also to the building, on the misleading pretext of globalisation, of a real wall between the rich world and poor world, which has no future and is therefore in the most dire straits."
"From this point of view, it is fortunately encouraging that the nations are showing signs of rebelling, particularly the nations in Europe. Italy and Germany are giving us some positive signs, Denmark and Ireland have already done so, and I am sure that France will too in the days to come."
"Mr Aznar, this could be your main worry in the coming six months."
"And if you have made a conscious choice to deny what is really happening at national level, I cannot, we cannot, wish you good luck."
"Mr President-in-Office, congratulations and the best of luck for your term of office."
"The programme you have presented for your Presidency is extremely dense."
"I would like, if I may, to put forward a few suggestions which would make it a great, ambitious programme as well."
"I belong to a political family which, unlike many others, has always believed that the only things of any importance are ideas and a vision for the future."
"Well then, under your Presidency, an old idea we extremists have had for many years regarding law and international law can come to fruition."
"During your Presidency, you can complete the establishment, for the sake of humanity, of the permanent international court which will bring to justice those accused of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity."
"It will be an historic moment, a fundamental change, which, together with the Treaties, will introduce an initial element of international jurisdiction."
"Sixty ratifications are needed and over 50 have been obtained."
"Many of our friendly neighbours are far advanced in the process."
"It is possible, if you want it, and we will all help you - Parliament is going to discuss the issue in February - for the Spanish Presidency to obtain the necessary 60 ratifications in the name and on behalf of 200 million European citizens."
"I hope that you will embrace this as a historic opportunity for change."
"Think how different it would be, even where the fight against terrorism is concerned if - as in the case with Slobodan Milosevic, who is a mere war criminal awaiting trial - today, we had the chance to send the Osama Bin Ladens or the Mullah Omars of this world for trial before a permanent international court. Then our American friends would not find themselves having to invent military courts and the like."
"Well then, we and you yourself have the chance to achieve this, and we are certainly determined to do so."
"Of course, Mr Aznar, we fully support the fight against terrorism, but what concerns me is the political response, for clearly, military and judicial responses are not sufficient."
"We continue to follow and implement the principle that the enemy of my enemy is automatically my friend."
"We are in danger of heedlessly accepting the most unlikely regimes as allies because we need them."
"Some of these regimes, Mr President, are close by; they may even lie on the southern shore of the Mediterranean."
"There is another point I would like to make."
"You see, I feel that we are sitting next to a minefield and that a new vision of our relations with the Mediterranean must be the priority for our present and certainly for our immediate future."
"These are just a few suggestions, Mr President, but they would help us to be forward-looking in a practical way, which is precisely what our citizens want us to be."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to wish the Spanish Presidency luck for the ambitious programme they have presented here this morning."
"The speeches by certain Members have reminded me of what Marx said, not Karl but Groucho, about certain literary critics who were so busy writing criticism that they never had five minutes to sit down and read a novel."
"Mr President, I would like to say that the Spanish Presidency has a series of objectives which are being presented straight away, both in terms of the internal dimension of the project and of its external dimension."
"It is clearly a question of uniting wills, forging consensus and identifying the right direction so that the European Union can make progress."
"This will require two things."
"It requires a method, and at Laeken the Convention method was chosen, which is an innovative method: Europe cannot be built on the basis of concentric circles."
"And it requires ambition."
"I do not agree with what my good friend Mr Watson said, though I congratulate him on his appointment as chairman of the Liberal Group, because I believe that Spain is very well placed to contribute to overcoming one of the historic challenges of our times, which is how to reconcile unity with diversity prudently and judiciously."
"How to provide the European Union project with a well-tuned orchestra, well-tempered, as Mozart said, which is guided by democratic impulses and not by a blast of a bugle like a battalion."
"Mr President, when freedom was savagely attacked by the barbarity of 11 September, it immediately became clear that notions of security, defence, cooperation, external policy and development aid are interrelated and must be based on a common awareness that the threats and dangers of terrorism affect all of us alike and that we must therefore respond to them as one."
"Mr President, I would like to say a couple of things about Latin America."
"This Parliament thinks that Latin America does not need gifts, but rather opportunities."
"But we also believe that we sometimes have to move on from beatitudes to accounting books and we have, therefore, significantly increased the quantities proposed by the Commission for cooperation with these regions in 2002 and we have presented an ambitious catalogue of measures aimed at giving content to that strategic objective, which the Heads of State and Government drew up at the Rio de Janeiro Summit, of creating a strategic bi-regional partnership."
"Therefore, as the Presidency-in-Office has stated, we hope that the Madrid Summit will be able to send a clear and well-defined message of the Europe' s new commitment to Latin America."
"I am absolutely convinced that the storey which this Presidency has to add to this Community building will be a match for the ambitious priorities they have presented to us this morning."
"Mr Aznar, twenty years ago, one European market with one currency, the euro, was a dream."
"Today, it is a reality."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists would like to see the same ambitions inform European security and defence policy, and all the events of 11 September have only strengthened this wish."
"It is a prerequisite for peace and progress."
"This is why we support the Spanish Presidency if it wishes to inject this ESDP with more dynamism, greater capacity and, in general, more resources to become more effective."
"In this respect, it is essential for the message of multilateralism to be broadcast."
"The US' s withdrawal from the ABM Treaty is in conflict with this."
"We do not want to relapse into a fresh arms race."
"We would ask the Spanish Presidency to send this European message to our ally, the United States, in particular."
"We can drive this message home and make this appeal to the US with all the more force now that we, as Europe - in the coalition - are prepared vigorously to continue the fight against terrorism, both inside and outside Europe."
"I have a second, serious question for the Spanish Presidency. Are you also prepared to fight for a worldwide coalition against poverty?"
"After all, poverty largely forms the breeding ground for fundamentalist hatred, of whatever origin."
"It must be a coalition against poverty in Asia, in Africa and also in the Euro-Mediterranean process, for security on our planet is not there for the chosen few, but is only stable if it is shared by all, under an international rule of law."
"Does the Spanish Presidency not agree that it would be better to make financial investments in this instead of putting all our money unilaterally into new, Star Wars-like investments?"
"Against this backdrop, would you make every effort to help Messrs Solana and Patten to have a fully operational capacity for the Petersberg tasks by 2003?"
"In the Middle East, we hear Iran' s ex-Prime Minister, Mr Rafsanjani, threaten to destroy Israel by means of an atom bomb."
"His saying that is wholly unacceptable."
"But the policy of Mr Sharon, who has isolated Mr Arafat and has turned innocent Palestinian citizens into victims, has not contributed to security in Israel and Palestine in any way."
"Is the Spanish Presidency, in tandem with the United States and Russia, prepared to launch a new peace initiative in the Middle East as a whole?"
"We would be very grateful if it did."
"Mr President, Mr Aznar, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, as a Member from the Canary Islands, one of the Community' s outermost regions, and a member of the European Liberal and Democratic Reform Group, I warmly welcome the Presidency-in-Office of the Council."
"Do not forget, Mr Aznar, to deal with the outstanding issues facing us in this six-month period to come, during which enlargement and the euro are presenting the European Community with a very special kind of landscape, in which the whole world is more or less affected for various reasons which oblige us to make constant, permanent and joint efforts to achieve peace and prosperity."
"I must remind you that, in our European sphere, in all the pillars of the Community edifice, we have maintenance problems."
"Therefore, Community policies must include something which you have pointed out: 'more Europe' ."
"And this is true, especially when it comes to reviewing the CAP, the Structural Funds, the consolidation of the situation of the outermost regions and creating a genuine European immigration strategy."
"It is also true when it comes to institutional reforms, defining the role and the participation of the regions in the construction of the Europe of the Twenty-first Century and an appropriate environmental policy, without forgetting the fields of social policy, that is, employment and the SMEs."
"Neither must you forget, in your dual capacity as President-in-Office of the Council and Spanish Prime Minister, to export more Europe to the world."
"To this end, we must review the Union' s external relations - such as the Council' s common position on Cuba and the future of the Sahara, by means of a self-determination referendum - without forgetting the dialogue with our Mediterranean neighbours - from Morocco to the Middle East - or with more distant regions, such as Latin America, with the problem of Argentina, or the United States and China."
"Of course you can count on our support, as always, in the joint European political fight against terrorism."
"I wish you luck in this special mandate and I trust that we will all be able to celebrate together following your success in the June exams, because what is good for Europe is good for everybody, especially the outermost regions."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, your priorities for the Presidency do not deal with, or at least place very much in second place, certain policies which, since they are fundamental to the Union and also for Spain and my nation, must be dealt with in 2002: the CAP, the common fisheries policy and the future of the Structural Funds."
"On the contrary, you intend to use your Presidency to indulge your authoritarian obsession against European diversity, denying a presence in the Council to nationalities and regions of the Spanish States, employing a notion of sovereignty which is now anti-historical and anachronistic in the Union."
"If your approach were correct, Mr Aznar, we would have to concluded that you are appearing here today as a President of a foreign institution."
"We do not think like that."
"I represent my nation and I am also a citizen of the Spanish State and of the Union, and there is no contradiction here."
"You are mixed up in an authoritarian manner in something which is resolved in the Treaties and in practice, while ignoring the fact that in the future, if we do not deal with the problem of sovereignty, not to mention separatism, we will ask ourselves not only why Slovakia can chair a Fisheries Council while Galicia, Andalusia or the Canaries cannot attend it, but also why the historic national status of the Malta or Luxembourg is rightly recognised, while that of Galicia, the Basque country, Catalonia, Scotland, Wales or Flanders is not."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, negotiations with the candidates for accession are entering their most difficult stage yet under the Spanish Presidency."
"The chapters on agriculture and regional development therefore demand the utmost sensitivity and particular prudence."
"A discriminating approach is called for, especially as regards direct payments to farmers."
"If we are not to be reproached for stepping up mass production to excessive levels, we must concentrate more on integrated rural policy in the accession countries rather than carrying over the system of direct payments."
"Particular negotiating skill will be required in view of the background of difficulties that are manifesting themselves and the mutually opposing interests with regard to support measures."
"It is indeed a matter of crucial importance that the negotiations should make capacity and sustainability possible for the future, by which I mean beyond 2004 and over and above Agenda 2000."
"Prime Minister Aznar's performance this morning suggests that his presidency promises to be focused and business-like and committed to addressing the big issues."
"The presidency has many tasks on the international front; carrying forward the global war on terrorism is the most difficult and the most important."
"The presidency has promised to resolutely promote solidarity with the United States at this time of crisis, and it is right to do so, but other foreign problems will crowd in."
"In Zimbabwe we have a growing tragedy which requires urgent EU action: smart sanctions need to be introduced immediately and a clear message sent about the dangerous consequences of the criminal path on which Mr Mugabe is currently engaged."
"The presidency faces similar challenges on the economic front."
"If Europe is serious about making itself the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010, then Barcelona promises to be a moment of truth. We simply cannot afford continued failure."
"Europe has to get it right."
"Since Stockholm things have in fact moved backwards."
"The liberalising agenda has become bogged down by new social and environmental targets."
"Since then we have seen at least three new EU directives which directly reduce labour market flexibility, with more in the pipeline, as well as new national laws, as in France, that tie the hands of business."
"This is a job-destroying agenda."
"In the target sectors for greater competition, the picture is frankly unacceptable."
"In financial services - telecoms for instance - liberalisation is proceeding too slowly."
"The freeing up of energy markets and postal services is way behind schedule."
"If Europe really wants to emerge as the global economic leader by the end of this decade, it must show real commitment."
"We need to make it easier to start and run a business and to keep and invest profits."
"That means a lot of vested interests will need to be confronted."
"We look to Prime Minister Aznar to lead the way."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Parliament is engaged in strenuous discussions with the Commission concerning new ways of governing - 'European governance' ."
"As parliamentarians we have raised objections to several proposals in the interests of effective and lively parliamentary government, but we have also found agreement with the Commission on a number of things."
"Something we would both like, Mr President-in-Office, but which the Council has to date refused, is an interinstitutional working party in which we - Parliament, Commission and Council together - could discuss the issues surrounding the new way of governing."
"I would ask you, Mr President-in-Office, to take care that the Council agrees to this way of proceeding together."
"Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, we are of the opinion that we should in any case be treated equally with the Council, including on the issue of secondary legislation."
"It is our opinion that we too should have a call back position should the secondary legislation not work well."
"We take the view, moreover, that framework directives should have a sort of 'sunset clause' , a time limit."
"We agree with the Commission in any case that lawmaking and the decision-making process in the European Union should again and again have their effectiveness monitored."
"This also applies to the area of liberalisation, which we sometimes doubt is being carried out with a careful eye and social awareness."
"Questions to be considered in this area include, for example, whether liberalisation always leads to lower prices in the long term, whether it always results in competition or sometimes also to monopolies and oligopolies, the only difference being that this time they are across Europe."
"What are the chances under liberalisation for the small and medium-sized enterprises about which we are all concerned, especially in the smaller sectors?"
"How about the issue of concentration, especially in the media?"
"Italy has already been mentioned today."
"We often turn a blind eye to this."
"What is the net effect on employment and wages?"
"I mention these things not because either I or my group are opposed to liberalisation."
"We mention these things because we want to carry out liberalisation in the interests of our citizens, with a careful eye and social awareness."
"It may be for this reason, Mr President of the Commission and Mr President-in-Office, that some governments are sceptical about liberalisation and slow to implement it, because they feel that it does not always exactly lead to the good objective that is in mind, and because they feel that their own people do not always perceive the advantages to be found in the detail of this liberalisation strategy."
"So I beg to ask you to consider, within the framework of the Barcelona and Lisbon processes, how liberalisation, which you in your programme want to push and press ahead with, can come about in our people's interest, taking the social dimensions into account as well."
"The continuation of an arbitrary liberalisation strategy cannot be what it is all about."
"Whilst Mr Berlusconi thinks we should strengthen Europe by being more American than the Americans, I do believe we should take our own European road to liberalisation."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have just referred to 'more Europe' and the fight against terrorism as two of your great objectives, and I share them and wish you every success."
"Europe cannot be built solely by the governments of the Member States, excluding the other public institutions."
"I therefore suggest we follow the examples of Germany and the previous Belgian Presidency, in which we have seen the participation of representatives of all their regions and communities."
"The Spanish Government, on the other hand, repeatedly blocks any participation by the autonomous communities in the European bodies, even when the latter are going to decide on the exclusive competences of those regions, as usually happens in relation to Ecofin and financial and fiscal matters, on which the autonomous communities of the Basque Country and Navarre have full sovereignty."
"In order to eradicate violence, I would cite the example of the British and Irish Governments, which sponsored the Good Friday agreements and the peace process in Ulster, and I would ask you and the Popular Party not to continue to insist on maintaining your alliance with Herri Batasuna - protectors of ETA - with the sole objective of imposing a state of political siege on the Basque Government, and instead to promote democratic dialogue with the majority of the Basque people, aimed at resolving the historic political conflict, who wish to live in peace, and to respect their right to decide their future freely."
"Mr President, ""More Europe"" is a watchword we support, but it must be accompanied by 'More freedom' and 'More identity' ."
"As strong supporters of the Europe of the peoples we see as brothers - from the Basques to the Corsicans, the Flemish to the Padanians - and therefore also strong supporters of freedoms and autonomies, we identify with the project of European integration, seeing it, not least, as a response to the serious dangers of globalisation."
"This motto 'More Europe' must embrace more specific commitments and actions to protect the freedoms and identities of the Europeans."
"To achieve 'More Europe' , we first need undertakings to protect the diversities and specific characteristics - linguistic, regional, national and cultural - for which our peoples are fighting, particularly the people of the Po Valley."
"This means taking the opposite direction to that advocated by the standardisation directives produced by the technocratic oligarchy, which has not been legitimised by any form of election, and is currently guiding and directing all the European Union' s politics."
"Similarly, how could one fail to see the link between the fight against terrorism - which we support - and the dangers represented by illegal immigration, which is the breeding ground for terrorism?"
"There is a Council of Europe resolution which calls for immigration to be limited so as to avoid increasing or exacerbating unemployment within the States."
"Why is it not invoked?"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, from the point of view of foreign policy, the Spanish Presidency comes at a time when there is war between two atomic powers to be prevented, peace to be established in the Middle East, and the Barcelona process to be brought to a successful conclusion, because, if we are not successful in these areas, they may have a merciless effect on our immediate interests."
"I believe, Mr President, that we can make progress on the focal points that you have mapped out."
"Internationally, and nationally too, all this is tied in with the fight against terrorism, and I would like to say, in response to a speech by one of the previous speakers, that there can be no political justification for terror, which must be rejected both within the European Union and outside it."
"Mr President-in-Office, I have observed over the last few months how you, astutely preparing for your presidency, have not, on foreign policy issues, fallen victim to the peril of bilateralism, which has been seen to some degree in Berlin, London and Paris."
"I believe this results from the recognition that we can achieve the objectives of combating international and national terrorism and securing peace only by a joint effort and not on the basis of everyone for himself, and that it is for this reason that we must bring about a common foreign and security policy."
"I am thankful that you evidently are able to go down this road."
"There are yet two more reasons why your presidency comes at a decisive moment."
"You will, when the Convention begins, be able to emphasise certain features of what the internal configuration of the European Union will be like in the future."
"We therefore ask you for the support that will give the Convention the working facilities it needs in order to be able to meet these requirements."
"Your presidency will, though, also see the preparatory decisions on enlargement of the European Union taken, that is to say, on the outward configuration of the European Union in the future."
"We hope for very close cooperation with you on these issues over the next six months."
"Mr President, in Laeken, two decisions were taken which are very important to the creation of a European judicial area in the fight against terrorism: a common definition and sanctions in relation to terrorism and the European arrest warrant."
"This Parliament had insisted on these two measures in the Watson report - and I would like to congratulate him on his election and also on his words - and I believe we have done a positive job with the Council and the Commission in implementing it."
"In Laeken, an assessment was also made of the implementation of the Tampere agenda."
"I will return to that in a moment."
"But I would also like to say that on 27 December, COREPER adopted a series of decisions relating to the fight against terrorism."
"The decision allowing for a list of people and organisations active in the European Union is significant."
"Article 4 of the common position stating the need for the police and judicial cooperation laid down in the Treaty and in the international agreements in this field will be applied to them."
"We are delighted with this decision, which is of unquestionable symbolic value."
"We hope that the measures for combating the funding of terrorism in Europe can also be applied soon."
"And I also hope, Mr President, that the Council will maintain the excellent cooperation that it has enjoyed with this Parliament, with the exception of recent times."
"Having adopted the most important instruments for fighting terrorism, we must now see that they are applied."
"You can and must convince the States which have the most doubts."
"I would also like to point out a cause for concern in relation to the question of immigration."
"Your agenda mentions immigration for humanitarian reasons and the fight against illegal immigration."
"You miss out an important package: that of rights and duties and that of the organisation of the legal entry of persons."
"And there are already documents in the Commission in this regard."
"Please promote the whole agenda, so that we do not have to end up regretting unfulfilled decisions, as happened in Laeken with certain decisions taken in Tampere."
"Mr President, on seeing the stars on the European flag, I believe that some people have mistaken our forum and have come here to make narrow-minded statements."
"I am not going to get involved in that debate because this is a place for talking about Europe."
"And we have come here to discuss a programme that combines ambition with vision."
"I am therefore very pleased, Mr President, that we are dealing here with a six-month programme during which, as most Members have pointed out, much is going to be done and many initiatives are going to be taken."
"It is true that the tradition of Parliament is to demand that the Presidency-in-Office get things done."
"But I also believe that, in compensation for the many things that have been demanded today, this Parliament must make a commitment to doing something which seems to me extraordinarily important: the Barcelona process is going to be a key element of the Presidency."
"The Barcelona process is necessary in order to complete the process started in Lisbon and you have said, Mr President, that there is no better means of achieving social integration than creating employment."
"We must send a clear signal, at a time when the European economy is delicate, that the European Union is prepared to make this effort and, therefore, this Parliament and this political group commit ourselves to approving, next week in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, the report by Mr von Wogau so that we may implement the measures contained in the Lamfalussy report, which I believe will send a clear message to the markets that we are willing to reach an agreement - and I am glad that you are here, Mr Prodi, since the Commission has much to say on this issue - a fair agreement, which respects the balance of the institutions, to liberalise that market."
"From this point of view, the European Parliament will add to the good initiatives of a Presidency which has ambition and vision."
"Mr President, I believe I am the only speaker who has not used up his speaking time."
"Mr President, Prime Minister, thank you for your presentation of the Spanish Presidency's priorities."
"I will comment on just one of them, namely your determination to complete the single market in the gas and electricity sectors."
"We have misgivings about your approach."
"You want the EU to be guided by five major principles: openness, liberalisation, competition, transparency and interconnection."
"These are fundamental to an open market."
"Energy, however, is not like other goods or services."
"It has other facets: basic social need and environmental impact."
"A rushed and ill-considered liberalisation would be highly dangerous."
"Your own country, like California, has recently suffered major power cuts following liberalisation."
"Liberalisation leads to a dash for gas, forcing us to import gas from some very fragile regimes."
"We need to ensure that indigenous energy sources can play a major role in energy supply."
"Renewable energies in particular need legal protection and promotion."
"The greatest contribution to security of supply is intelligent use of energy, one of the regulatory requirements of wise liberalisation."
"Please ensure that energy efficiency becomes a key national indicator at Barcelona."
"Uneven opening of the market between countries brings huge resentment."
"We strongly support your efforts to put pressure on certain governments, which keep their markets closed while they take advantage of open markets elsewhere."
"I look forward to your assurance that liberalisation of energy will take place in a very strictly regulated framework which protects the environment and takes heed of social consequences, some of which are very serious."
"Unlike Mr Evans, we think that is important."
"I should like to inform the House that because we are running behind schedule I expect to be in a position to call on the President-in-Office of the Council to respond to the debate at around 12.45 p.m. or 12.50 p.m."
"This means that in all probability the vote will not be taken until 1 p.m."
"This information will be placed on the screens in Parliament so that colleagues who wish to attend the vote can do so."
"But I would like to hear the Prime Minister's response in calm parliamentary conditions, if that is possible."
"Mr President, the Spanish Presidency, which has our full support, will play a crucial role in the integration of a Europe which is not just the Europe of the single currency but the Europe of the common foreign and security policy as well."
"The Union' s joint action will be judged initially on the success of the fight against terrorism, which is not an internal Spanish affair but a fundamental issue in which we must all be involved, just as we are with regard to the European presence in Afghanistan."
"We too will support any undertaking in the Middle East because it is only by resolving the Israeli-Palestinian crisis that we will be able to deliver the final blow to the terrorist organisations."
"Indeed, it is a political effort, above all, as well as military endeavours that can bring Europe success against the instigators of the attack of 11 September."
"The return to the rule of law in the world will contribute to economic growth and thus help to improve the conditions of the European citizens, whom we also have to provide with a system of social and other protection which abolishes longstanding privileges."
"The Convention will also have to decide upon the way to follow to develop the new Charter, and we hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will be able to take place during the second half of 2003 to avoid Europe' s future being debated right in the middle of the electoral campaign."
"However, I cannot close without responding to a number of statements made in this House."
"The strong Europeanism of Italy and of its democratically elected government is indisputable."
"We are always ready to request or provide clarification and would stress that it is absolutely unthinkable that Italy should have anything but an independent, leading role in the development of European unity."
"Rather, let the Socialists explain the agreement signed in Berlin with the GDR, with the former supporters of the Berlin wall: an agreement which goes against the great hopes of freedom not just of the German people but of all Europeans."
"Mr President, I speak for the Socialists from the point of view of Parliament's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"The Barcelona Summit will be a major milestone during the Spanish Presidency and it is essential that we reply to the downward global economic trend by further deepening and strengthening the process laid down at Lisbon and further developed at Stockholm and Göteborg."
"The Lisbon policy mix of mutually supportive economic reform, full employment, social cohesion and sustainable development needs to be reinforced through concrete measures that increase the potential for growth and job creation."
"It would be a grave mistake to concentrate - as some have done in the debate today - on only one aspect of the Lisbon process, that of structural reform."
"At this time, we need to further develop the coherence of the Lisbon process and reinforce it."
"In concrete terms, we want a number of priorities developed at Barcelona, some of which are reflected in the Commission's synthesis report adopted this week."
"The following are purely illustrative in the limited time available."
"We want a strengthening of resolve to achieve the goal of a 70% employment rate by 2010, recognising the good progress we have seen and increasing the participation of unemployed people in active labour measures to at least 20% in nearly all Member States; we want to go further and set a new target of 44%, the level in the three best-performing Member States, to be achieved within a five-year timeframe."
"Within this timeframe we need, among other things, further action for women and older workers able and willing to stay in the labour market; action to improve the availability of affordable and good-quality child care; goals for reductions in youth unemployment and renewed emphasis upon life-long learning, training and improved mobility."
"We also need further action to address demographic change through an integrated approach to safeguard sustainable and universal pensions."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, the Spanish Presidency of the European Union has given itself the theme of 'More Europe' , which is a desire shared by a large majority of Europeans who, as of 1 January 2002, now share the same currency."
"'More Europe' must not mean more of an omnipresent, over-bearing Europe."
"On the contrary, 'More Europe' must mean more of a political Europe where it is necessary to improve our standing on the international stage and to enable our economies to become stronger and to create further jobs."
"Spain is undertaking its third presidency of the Union and therefore has proven experience in this area."
"More importantly, the Spanish government led by Mr José Maria Aznar, whom I welcome, is implementing a successful policy which, if applied to Europe, could turn out to be extremely worthwhile."
"As far as the fight against terrorism is concerned, there is, unfortunately, no need to dwell at length on the tragedies that too often plunge the people of Spain into mourning, as they fall victim to barbaric acts carried out by ETA and its counterparts."
"It is now easy for us to understand, particularly after the events of 11 September, that the primary concern of the Spanish Presidency is, quite clearly, the fight against terrorism within an area of freedom, security and justice."
"However, what citizens really expect from Europe, and from the authorities in general, is for us to put in place the conditions to create a competitive economy that will guarantee the prosperity of as many people as possible."
"Mr Aznar, you know how to do this in Spain; we are sure that you will provide the necessary impetus so that the objective set in Lisbon to achieve full employment by 2010 is consolidated and attained within the framework of a timetable defined at Barcelona in March."
"It will come as no surprise to any of you that, having been elected to represent the island of Reunion, I welcome the will that was clearly expressed by the Spanish Presidency to pursue the implementation of Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam, so that the special characteristics of such regions are taken into account in each of the European Union' s policies."
"Lastly, I would like to point out to the President-in-Office of the Council that the first meeting of the Convention will not be held at the European Parliament' s headquarters in Strasbourg; it will instead take place in one of our working places, namely Brussels."
"Mr President, the Spanish Presidency has rightly named the fight against terrorism as its first priority."
"The Spanish Presidency has also rightly indicated the importance of money laundering to terrorism."
"Because the true driving force of terrorism, at least in Europe, is not ideology, but money."
"We are concerned about whether it will be possible for the Council to overcome the obstacle standing in the way of fighting terrorism resulting from certain governments blocking the Community proposals on the fight against money laundering."
"Secondly, Mr President, the Spanish Presidency insists on the problem of immigration and the need to control it."
"The Presidency' s programme also talks about the outermost regions."
"I wanted to link these two problems by pointing out that the outermost regions, although they are far from the Community' s continental territory, are in fact part of our territory and that it is currently necessary to control illegal immigration into these regions."
"I do not believe that the procedure adopted by certain local authorities is the appropriate one: i.e. providing free tickets so that illegal immigrants in the Canaries can be transported to the mainland of the continent."
"But if we do not adopt measures on a Community level, it is possible that other local authorities will feel obliged to do the same."
"Finally, Mr President, over recent years it seems that both the Council and the Commission have forgotten where Latin America is."
"It is as if the navigation charts have disappeared."
"The Spanish Presidency points to the importance of holding the Ibero-American Summit and, also in the President' s speech, he rightly stresses the importance of helping certain countries such as Argentina and Colombia."
"I believe it is very important that the Spanish Presidency takes the helm once again, places Latin America on the continent' s navigation charts and, like in the Fifteenth Century, supports, in this new era, the link between the European Union and Latin America."
"Mr President, Prime Minister, you have, amongst the six priorities of the Spanish Presidency of the Council, managed to say not one word on the protection of the environment."
"That is, I admit, a respectable achievement, indeed a transparent one."
"I have had to listen too often over the last twelve years to Presidents of the Council who, among their priorities at the outset of their presidency, announce things they cannot bring to pass."
"In this case, you do not even announce anything."
"I find that very frank, very transparent and very clear."
"I am very grateful to Mr Salafranca for bringing Groucho Marx into the discussion earlier on."
"I, too, was reminded of Groucho Marx when I listened to that speech, because I must admit that I found it more than grotesque."
"Groucho Marx represents the grotesque, and I find it more than grotesque that the Spanish Presidency of the Council, ten years after the Rio Summit and in the year of the Johannesburg World Summit, has nothing to say about the protection of the environment."
"Mr Aznar, it is not for your Ministry of the Environment to do that, it is for you to do it."
"Let me remind you that the last summit, the Summit in Gothenburg, called upon you, the European Council, to use your meeting in Barcelona in the first half of the year to check on what was still needed."
"You must, then, say something about emissions trading."
"You must say when you want to ratify the Kyoto protocol."
"You must, for example, say when you intend to implement the Sixth Environmental Action Programme's strategies for the various industry sectors."
"In no way is that a matter for the environmental authorities in your own country; it is a matter for you personally."
"We always consider it important to cooperate closely and well with the Council, and so, Mr Aznar, I offer you assistance should your government have need of it."
"I am perfectly ready to offer you all my group's suggestions - with all respect of course - as may be necessary to enable you to perform your duties at the beginning of the year."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I welcome your presidency."
"The actual introduction of the euro is a red letter day for those of us who want to see European integration and economic development."
"The task for the EU is now to ensure that the euro lives up to the expectations surrounding it."
"That is why it is a matter of such urgency that Spain should give priority to a dynamic and competitive Europe."
"The Socialist leader in this House, who otherwise appears to have no interest at all in this debate, adopted a particularly 'whining' tone in his remarks on this subject."
"The fact is that you as a head of government, Mr Aznar, have made a much more dynamic Spain possible, thanks to modernisation of the administration and of economic life."
"By means of important structural changes and tax reductions, Spain now presents fewer obstacles to new companies' setting up and has created new job opportunities."
"That is why unemployment is falling and prosperity increasing in Spain."
"That may be sad for Mr Barón Crespo, but it is good for Spaniards."
"It is precisely this transformation that the EU must carry out if the Lisbon process is to be taken seriously."
"The Socialists have let two out of ten years simply pass by."
"The Spanish Presidency must now increase the pressure and, instead of just talking, pursue a policy of prosperity, development and opportunities for the people of Europe."
"Enlargement has now entered a crucial phase."
"I trust that Spain, which has experienced dictatorship and has secured democracy and freedom through European cooperation, will now guarantee that the Council does not leave anything undone in the work of enlargement under your leadership and that Spain will show the same solidarity and good will as has been shown to your country for fifteen years."
"Finally, I am also looking forward to a presidency whose relations with the United States are characterised by friendship, respect and independence."
"Good luck in what you intend!"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Secretary of State, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has, since the Cologne Extraordinary Summit in June 1999, possessed a European security and defence identity which, for the first time, is truly worthy of the designation 'common' ."
"We have achieved great steps forward in this area, which will allow us to use the Rapid Reaction Force, which will be ready for action from 2003 onwards, to independently carry out what are termed the Petersberg tasks, at least on our own continent and in any case with an appropriate UN mandate."
"Mr President-in-Office, I would like to add a brief observation to your statements and make a major request of the Spanish Presidency."
"Taking the observation first, you have described the Rapid Reaction Force as being also an instrument against terrorism in the European Union."
"I would say that, in our democratic states, the combating of terrorism is primarily a task for the internal forces of law and order and the justice authorities."
"Should military actions also become necessary, as they did after 11 September, what we call the principle of the rule of law nevertheless remains untouched."
"My request to the Spanish Presidency is that, where military operations are mounted under the sole leadership of the European Union, there must be the possibility of falling back on the material resources of NATO, especially in transport and reconnaissance capacities, and also, to some extent, in the command structures."
"It is truly astonishing that the agreement we need between the EU and NATO has, through Turkey's resistance, not yet come about."
"The proposal that Great Britain and the United States, without the EU's mandate, presented at the Laeken Summit, is unsuitable and unacceptable."
"So I ask that the Spanish Presidency should see to it that we get an agreement with NATO, so that our security and defence policy may be secured."
"Mr President, Spain is assuming the Presidency of the European Union at an historic moment for European integration."
"Two major events have occurred."
"The people of Europe now have the euro in their pockets."
"This is an incredible success and we must rapidly construct the political Europe that they lack."
"The second major event was 11 September, which reminded us, as if this were necessary, of the nature of the new threats hanging over the world."
"The Spanish Presidency is facing these two challenges."
"By placing the fight against terrorism at the forefront of its programme, the Spanish Presidency is thus meeting the expectations of a Europe that must become an area of security and a constitutional State for all European citizens."
"All resources must be properly implemented at European level to strengthen the instruments of the constitutional State, such as the introduction of the European arrest warrant, the freezing of funds, the mutual recognition of judicial decisions and the development of Eurojust."
"However, in order to meet the expectations of our fellow citizens, we have to face another challenge."
"We must bring about a strong, powerful, and therefore democratic, political Europe."
"The Spanish Presidency will be able to use the work of the Convention so that it can go ahead, at last, with the simplification of the treaties, with the task of clearly dividing up the competences between the European Union and Member States, but, above all, with rapidly bringing about the drafting of a European constitution."
"On all of these issues, I know that the Spanish Presidency will press ahead with determination."
"The programme that was proposed to us today meets the challenges facing us."
"We know your vision, we know your determination, and that is why we have confidence in you."
"Mr President, tomorrow this Parliament will approve the resolution on the Commission' s Green Paper on the future of the common fisheries policy, which draws up its future."
"I would like the motto 'more Europe' , chosen by the Spanish Presidency, to be converted this year into the definitive integration of fishing into the single market, and I would like a CFP to be more participatory, a CFP whose definition and application involve the presence not only of central governments but also of the regions, of regions with competences in the field of fishing, and of course economic and social actors."
"Fishing, Mr President, works on an international basis, like the whole of the economy."
"Its reform cannot ignore this reality."
"Nevertheless, it worries us to see that the Community fleet' s access to external waters is being restricted and that our fleet is losing fishing grounds rather than gaining them."
"In six months' time we will be able to judge this Presidency by its results and see whether it has been able to reverse this trend."
"Given the importance of this economic activity to numerous European regions, most of them peripheral and Objective 1, and its role as an element of economic integration and social cohesion, we want you to take it into account as a priority objective when it comes to strategies for safeguarding the European social model, which you mentioned in your speech."
"I would like you to make that explicit commitment here, thereby helping this sector to recover its fighting spirit and confidence."
"Mr President, amongst the priorities of the Spanish Presidency, I have heard no mention of a European policy that shows greater solidarity with the rest of the world."
"As coordinator of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like you to clarify your plans for social development and for the reduction of poverty, which the Commission, Parliament and previous presidencies have set as objectives."
"You mentioned the Monterrey International Conference."
"What position will you be adopting on the policies that need to be funded?"
"Who is to fund them?"
"Are you going to support the objective of 0.7% of GDP, approved at the last Development Council by the majority of Member States?"
"How much cooperation will there be with Latin America and with the countries of the Mediterranean, with an integrated approach between trade relations and the fight against poverty?"
"What will your position be on the commitments given through the United Nations programmes on education and health for all?"
"What will your position be on the current conflicts in Africa?"
"I hope that on all of these issues you will consult the European Parliament and, also, civil society and the NGOs."
"I wish you a Presidency, Mr Aznar, that will be fruitful for Europe."
"Mr President, Mr Aznar has laid down the clear objective of 'More Europe' for the Spanish Presidency and has explained how he intends to carry out the programme."
"Time constraints dictate that we will have to focus on a small number of issues and not waste words."
"The first issue is the Convention, which will have to supplement the Charter of Fundamental Rights, promoting the Community method and the federalist approach as a guarantee of political democracy, economic integration and social cohesion."
"The second issue is the Lisbon reforms, which have now become intertwined with the launch of the euro."
"The single currency consolidates the single market and represents a decisive step towards political Europe and a common economic policy."
"The single currency strengthens Europe' s position in the face of globalisation but means that it is no longer possible for national systems to restore competitiveness by devaluing."
"The Stability Pact must be respected."
"In the interests of economic recovery and employment, therefore, the structural reforms, mentioned specifically by President Prodi, need to be pursued with the necessary determination."
"This strategy must be consistent with the overall goals of integration, cohesion and harmonisation of the series of policies upholding the European social model."
