"The next item is the report (A4-0198/96) by Mr Barón Crespo, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council Regulation (COM(96)0113 - C40253/96-95/0127(CNS)) on financial and technical measures to accompany the reform of economic and social structures in the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership (MEDA)."
"Madam President, I take the floor with great concern because the Union's credibility is at stake."
"This morning Mr Dini, President-in-Office of the Council, said that he too was concerned about it but, at the moment, it would seem that the Council is more concerned with leaving the Chamber than following the debate."
"But, after all, we are used to this kind of shenanigans."
"I am concerned that at this moment the Union's credibility is at stake vis-à-vis the Mediterranean countries because we have approved a Euro-Mediterranean policy and we must honour our commitments."
"The Council, in principle, claimed to refer to the European Parliament and, for the first time, there has had to be a fresh consultation of the European Parliament and we have tried to help to unblock a situation where - I must acknowledge - the Commission has shown sensitivity towards our proposals."
"The issue has been blocked for some months now in Council for two reasons: one concerns the situation of the human rights clause - and I must say that we maintain an amendment referring precisely to the way of assessing developments in the situation, and our proposals is that in cases where a Mediterranean partner fails to meet the obligations set out in Article 3, i.e. there is a situation of massive human rights violation, the measures including the suspension of planned aid, should be determine by qualified majority, on the Commission's proposal and following the prior opinion of the European Parliament, by 30 June 1997."
"Our committee's proposal to refer the issue to the IGC has succeeded in unblocking a situation in which the government of one Member State has vetoed the situation."
"I think that this proposal will meet with the agreement of the Commission because, inter alia, the Commission itself has been proposing it in a general way to the IGC and we think that it is important that, in that case, we should make some progress in turning human rights into an important rallying point and in a democratic way."
"There is the other extreme that we must not forget: the concern with safeguarding and protecting one Member State, namely Greece."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs has been sensitive to the concerns of our Greek fellow Europeans, about what I might call certain territorial disputes which have worsened this year and we have therefore accepted an amendment referring to the territorial integrity of the Member States and their external borders and of the Union."
"The resolution which the European Parliament has approved concerning the Florence summit also mentions this matter and it is also in the Treaties."
"However, with respect to this and the EuroMediterranean Conference, it is worth making it quite clear."
"I should like to launch an appeal although I am not sure if it will be heeded, reiterating the words of Mr Pangalos, when he stayed away from the Council meeting at the end of May, revindicating for Greece the fatherhood of the Euro-Mediterranean policy."
"It is certain that many things were born in Greece, not just the Euro-Mediterranean policy."
"There is no doubt that it was at the Corfu summit that a boost was given to it, when the Commission proposal was accepted despite reservations by the Council and the European Parliament."
"It would therefore be very positive if we could count, having shown our solidarity, on the real and effective support that would enable us to unblock this situation and, above all, enable us - and here I turn full circle - to honour our commitments and keep to our word since, at this moment, this is now the end of June and we must be able to spend effectively nearly 900 million ECU that we have promised for this year."
"The agreements which we have reached, albeit multilaterally, always imply services in return."
"Our Mediterranean partners have taken a step and now we must in turn we able to face up to our responsibilities and keep to our word."
"Therefore I think it is important that this regulation be approved once and for all, through consultation, at this plenary session."
"Madam President, I should like to take the floor very briefly since we already examined this report last November."
"First of all, I think that, although this is a fresh consultation, the opinion of the Committees on Budgets and Budgetary Control should have been sought, and this was not done."
"Secondly, I should like to ask why it is not the Committee on Budgets at this moment in time that is the right one to deal with the fundamentals of this issue, since this is a regulation with an essentially financial content."
"Thirdly, I should like to comment that, as far as the overall chapter is concerned, this is acceptable, with the rider that the Council does not take any decisions that might affect the fragile balance struck in category 4 without first consulting the European Parliament."
"On the other hand, I should also like to comment that six months have gone by, as the rapporteur said, and yet the issue is still being held up in Council."
"Fourthly, the European Parliament - and this too has already been mentioned - has respected for 1996 the sum of 900 million ECU decided at the Cannes summit."
"Yet the execution of the MEDA budgetary line for this year is still at the starting-point."
"Time goes by and we shall reach the end of the year and, Commissioner, you know what we shall be told - ' You will not be able to spend this money in this or that zone...' ."
"We know what the cost of propelling the MEDA programme has been and we know what is at stake in the area."
"Fifth point: I think that reference must be made to the fact that in the past financial protocols with the countries in the Mediterranean zone have been submitted to the European Parliament for the opinion procedure, enabling it to exert some control."
"This regulation, however, only provides for a consultation of the European Parliament."
"This means that the European Parliament must develop effective instruments so that it can exert control over the application of the programme, as well as proper budgetary management."
"I should like to end by thanking once again - because I thanked him in November - Mr Barón for accepting our amendments and I must say that they were purely technical, drawn from the experience of PHARE and TACIS."
"Thanks to them, with the permission of those whose task it is to unblock the procedure and with the speed that must be applied by the Commission, I am sure that we shall be able to keep to our commitments for 1996 and, in accordance with Article 205, obliging the Commission to deal with proposals approved in the European Parliament, I am convinced that we shall finally succeed in implementing the MEDA programme."
"Madam President, the Socialist Group supports the report of our rapporteur, Enrique Barón Crespo."
"My group campaigned for a Mediterranean policy for the EU and insisted on parallelism between our approach to the east and to the south."
"It is the Mediterranean policy and its funding which we are talking about tonight and, in our view, the MEDA programme must be seen in the light of our commitment to the development of democracy, economic advancement and the cause of human rights in the Mediterranean basin."
"The Socialist Group will support the approach to global MEDA funding."
"But it is fair to give warning that we believe that the Government of Turkey has yet to deliver on the promises made to this Parliament before the ratification of the customs union in December last year."
"We know that in the field of democratic reform and human rights abuses the situation has not only stalled but has actually deteriorated since the Turkish general election in December."
"Not one of the constitutional reforms brought in to charm us last year has yet found its way onto the statute book."
"The continuing stream of arrests for freedom of thought and speech continues to give Turkey an internationally bad name and the recent wave of unrest and hunger strikes in Turkish prisons is a demonstration of the violation of natural rights and common decency."
"Nor has Turkey made any effort to deal with the political problems of Cyprus and the Kurdish area."
"In all these ways Turkey is found wanting, and yet it has an exceptionally close relationship with our Union and we have a right to expect more."
"My group will therefore be looking to use our budgetary powers this autumn to keep up the pressure on Turkey."
"We have a substantial right as the co-authority on the Union's budget."
"We intend to use it and to invite other groups to join us."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to compliment Mr Barón Crespo on his work and, also, on the way he handled this delicate matter in the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"The MEDA programme must be implemented quickly - immediately, I would say - even though one country, Turkey, is systematically creating problems, in contravention of the philosophy and principles both of the Barcelona procedure and of the MEDA programme itself, not only for one Member State of the European Union but also for at least one other country in the Mediterranean basin, namely Syria."
"You are all aware of the problems that Turkey is creating for Syria, at least as far as water is concerned."
"Even so, the MEDA programme must be implemented. It is the financial instrument of the Mediterranean policy, and both we and the Mediterranean countries are looking forward to it with some impatience because everyone is of the view that it can bring overall improvement to those countries and turn them into genuine and full members of the new Euro-Mediterranean partnership, which is something that we all want."
"Further to that, I would be failing in my duty if I did not emphasize the special relevance that the implementation of the MEDA programme will have for the Middle East peace process."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the MEDA programme encompasses many important actions covering nearly every sector of civil life: energy, transport infrastructures, regional cooperation, small and medium-sized enterprises, and a whole variety of other activities within that bracket."
"The four amendments that have been tabled are all, I think, very important."
"I will mention just two of them: the amendment concerning the definitive procedure for adopting appropriate measures when such are deemed necessary and the amendment on synergy."
"As regards the first of those two, Commissioner, I hardly need to say how important it is that the decision on the adoption of appropriate measures must be approved by qualified majority."
"In fact, that is what you, and the Commission, recommended in your original proposal."
"As regards the other amendment, I feel that I should draw attention again to the importance of ensuring transparency in this programme, particularly given the undesirable precedents that have occurred in certain other sectors."
"I remind you, Commissioner, that you yourself - and I commend you for it - have on many occasions given verbal assurances to committees of the European Parliament about the safeguarding of transparency."
"To conclude, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I inform you that my group will be voting in favour, will be supporting the regulation, that is."
"Madam President, in addition to congratulating Mr Barón Crespo on his report, I should like to emphasize that the MEDA programme, promoting the development of and closer contacts between countries on the southern flanks of the Mediterranean, can only merit our full support."
"This is a neighbouring area, closely linked to us throughout our history, where the lack of resources and demographic growth are now triggering extremely tricky problems."
"As well as the most important aspect, the fact that the well-being of the area's peoples is in jeopardy, this is also leading to an obvious migratory pressure with people seeking employment in our countries, leading in many cases to serious problems of integration."
"This is the case not only in the southern countries of the Union but also in the North (which is where the highest percentages of immigrants are to be found), and they should be as or more involved in finding a solution that, indeed in the overriding interest of the migrant populations themselves, will encourage them to stay in their countries of origin."
"Given this humanitarian, social, economic and political interest we must all have a broad view when it comes to finding the funds needed, while recognising the existing difficulties."
"The existing rules must be kept to but it is equally necessary to stop using the need to stick to the rules as a pretext for dragging our feet over the basic problem, a problem that instead of being a reason for widespread concern could be turned into a factor of enrichment for both of these neighbouring regions."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this report concerns the Euro-Mediterranean policy which fully illustrates the ultimate wish to communitarize all fields of external policy."
"Everything proposed here could just as well have been regulated by bilateral agreements, with all the flexibility that such agreements between the various countries around the Mediterranean could have given."
"Moreover, bilateral agreements would probably have ensured a much more genuine democratic control than the control exercised in the context of the European Union, that is, the control of national parliaments over the foreign policies of Member States."
"It is true that in this case the main objective is perhaps less legitimate cooperation between the different States than the ultimate creation of a kind of enormous free trade area extending over the whole Mediterranean basin."
"However, in the light of the differing economic structures north and south of the Mediterranean, it is not certain that it has to go in this direction without precautions."
"We have seen the disastrous consequences for Mexico which have followed from the NAFTA agreements in North America, for example."
"As for human rights, I cannot speak about the Mediterranean without recalling at the same time that our Parliament was considerably misled last autumn, or last winter, during the negotiations on a customs union between Europe and Turkey, and I note that the fears of our Greek colleagues were fully justified in this respect."
"To return to the MEDA programme itself, we are not sure that it will not in fact ultimately be economically counterproductive, and in any case we are convinced that it is contrary to the wholehearted application of the principle of subsidiarity."
"There is no need, in this respect, to eliminate the role of Member States in this type of cooperation policy."
"That is why we shall vote against the report in the hope that this kind of policy will henceforth come within the competence of Member States, with all the flexibility which that will allow in comparison with the rigid programmes planned at present."
"Madam President, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Barón for his report and congratulating him and, above all, the European Parliament and its various committees for having agreed to carry out the second reading so quickly."
"There is no doubt that the Commission backed the European Parliament's criterion and I must say that, after some hesitation, the Council has also finally come round to the idea of a further consultation of the European Parliament, because there would undoubtedly have been one or two points that would have had quite obvious political repercussions vis-à-vis the original proposal and, at the same time, a series of new decisions that were the difference between the Council's final decision and what would have been the European Parliament's proposal and report."
"To sum up - as I think that Mr Barón has said this very well - we accept what he pointed out."
"It is true that at the moment, in terms of the MEDA regulation, regardless of the fact that it is - it is true - a strictly financial regulation of great technical complexity, this is a political moment when what Mr Barón said is quite right: what is at stake is the credibility of the Union's capability in terms of foreign relations."
"I share the concerns of the Committee on Budgets and Budgetary Control."
"I should like to respond to those concerns."
"Three agreements have already been finalised."
"In chronological order they are: Tunisia, Israel and Morocco."
"In all cases both parties have agreed upon a free trade zone."
"Each party has stood up for itself."
"One of the main demands of the European Union has been precisely the lifting of trade barriers."
"This stems from the retrospective clause of 1 January 1996 and has already begun but I cannot go on, as Commissioner responsible, receiving more and more visits from the ministers of those countries asking for their share."
"We cannot go on until the end of the year with a situation in which one party - with a far weaker industrial base and economy than us, after all - has done its duty and completed its work and the European Union has not."
"In other words, Mr Barón is right."
"This is a problem that goes beyond the financial aspect or technicalities of the MEDA programme."
"As for the amendments, the Commission thinks that in the case of three of them this is not the right moment to introduce them because that would presuppose changing the proposal and that would take us another three or four months."
"But there is a political amendment which I see no reason for the Commission to refuse since it has already put it forward at the IGC."
"Indeed, in the procedural framework for decision-taking in the new CFSP, as I envisage it, the Commission's position will be that all cases relating to human rights will always be decided on the basis of qualified majority."
"Over this there is no doubt: the Commission is quite against the idea of unanimity."
"It is a problem of time."
"If the MEDA regulation had been approved by qualified majority, it would have been a good precedent for the European Parliament and the Commission, but it would now provoke a negative attitude on the part of certain delegations to the IGC."
"You might say: what is the link between these?"
"Many of the tactical positions of the Member States are interlinked at this moment in time, and it would only need the principle of qualified majority to be applied just now for some of them to block everything."
"We hope that, in the framework of the IGC, the human rights dossier will have its rightful place in terms of possible sanctions and the application of qualified majority and the Commission will stick to its previous position."
"As for what was said earlier, I should like to make a few remarks, which might be bad for my health."
"I hope that the mad cow miracle will take place in Florence and I hope that the MEDA miracle will also take place."
"I hope the IGC will get off the ground in Florence."
"We are expecting so much of Florence that I think we might be disappointed."
"I should like to make this point: the situation for the Committee on Budgets and Budgetary Control has become so schizophrenic that I have to point it out to the European Parliament."
"The Commission and the European Parliament reached agreement over financial programming for the next three years."
"For this year, the Commission and the European Parliament reached agreement over a figure: 600 million ECU."
"It was the Council which increased that amount to 900 million ECU. That is the truth."
"It is true, however, that the Council has denied us, by various blockages, the legal basis since last November, when the Barcelona Conference took place."
"That will last until July. In other words the same institution that increased the financial ceiling has also prevented us from spending a single ecu."
"You will understand that, supposing that an miracle does take place in Florence, the Commission knows what decisions the Committee on Budgetary Control will take in October, and all unspent reserves will be cancelled, making the situation even more schizophrenic because we have been prevented from spending that money for lack of a legal basis."
"Try and explain that to the Mediterranean non-member states - that not only are we not going to honour our commitments under an international agreement but, in October, we are going to lower the financial commitment too."
"That is totally schizophrenic and it highlights how rotten this so-called CFSP instrument is."
"I therefore hope that, on the basis of many concrete cases, there can be some lessons learned among the various institutions as to how to find a compromise solution for something that is clearly difficult to comprehend."
"And understand this: I prefer the political sanction of being prevented from spending that money - although it seems unfair since we have not been allowed to - to a situation in which the Commission spends everything in September in order to escape the regulation's guillotine clause."
"That would be irresponsible of the Commission and so I am not going to propose that the Commission spend all of the 900 million ECU programmed for this year because this would not be possible, it would not be credible, it would not be serious and in the end it would kill of any remnant of credibility remaining in the MEDA programme."
"In other words, the situation is very serious, Mr Barón."
"I am not over-dramatizing."
"We cannot go on working like this and I think that the TACIS and MEDA programmes both demonstrate perfectly, for the benefit of the IGC, that with the Treaty as it stands it is quite impossible to carry out serious and solid work on foreign policy in the European Union."
"Madam President, I should first of all like to thank Commissioner Marín for the frankness and clarity of his answer."
"As for his position on amendments that cannot be approved, I must nonetheless thank him for the Commission's favourable stance vis-à-vis the most important one and I agree that this amendment does not only refer to this programme and this report, but is a fundamental political criterion for the Commission which the European Parliament has always agreed with; decisions must always be taken by majority including those referring to the CFSP."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"Workers' health and safety in explosive atmospheres"
"The next item is the report (A4-0158/96) by Mr Mather, on behalf of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, on the proposal for a Council Directive (COM(95)0310 - C4-0508/95-95/0235(SYN)) on minimum requirements for improving the safety and health protection of workers potentially at risk from explosive atmospheres."
"Madam President, the Commission has put forward a basically sound and progressive proposal on improving the health and safety protection of workers who are potentially at risk from explosive atmospheres."
"The directive is produced in accordance with the Framework Directive No 391/89."
"It places three main obligations on employers."
"Firstly, they must prevent the formation of explosive atmospheres."
"Secondly, they must prevent the ignition of any such atmospheres. Thirdly, they must reduce the effects of explosions to a minimum."
"Our report from the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment insists that employers must treat each of these three obligations as high priorities and observe each of them."
"The Commission's purpose in this report balances the need to protect workers with a balanced approach to regulation."
"This really is an area where preventative measures can help to safeguard human lives."
"In due course this sign - if I may show it to colleagues in the Chamber - will signify the presence of explosive atmospheres."
"This black and yellow warning will help protect workers from unexpected explosive atmospheres and warn them to take care in those environments."
"The directive is also necessary because in some Member States regulation is non-existent or at best rudimentary."
"The Commission's set of minimum standards is an effective one."
"It is important to note that the consultative process on which the Commission embarked was both thorough and exhaustive and this has lent credibility to their conclusions."
"All these points have been kept in mind by the committee when it reviewed the comments and suggestions of various associations and institutions and worker representatives and including the opinion of ECOSOC and other parliamentary committees."
"I am glad to say that the committee voted unanimously for this report."
"There are some important amendments including the one which highlights the triple responsibility of employers."
"It is necessary to ensure that Member States which already meet minimum requirements should not be subject to excessive administrative provisions from such a directive."
"Therefore the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment has suggested that the documentation and classification systems advocated by the Commission could instead be fulfilled in these circumstances by using current documents or practices at the Member State level."
"This, however, does not amount in any way to a lessening of effective control and it is important to note that some of the committee's amendments strengthen the Commission's proposals, in particular the requirement in Amendment No 12 that employers should constantly monitor the protective systems, not just engage in an annual review but maintain constant supervision that protective measures are up to scratch."
"Some amendments concerned the implementation periods which are appropriate for this directive."
"It is clearly enormously important that small and medium-sized enterprises across the Union are given adequate time and information to bring into force effective preventative measures."
"The committee has drawn again on ECOSOC opinions written by the workers' group representative there to strengthen the proposals in the directive."
"These are a few general points about the report and I look forward to hearing the observations of colleagues and of the Commissioner."
"The importance of this directive must be clear to all of us and it rests in the fact that this measure can improve the prospects of health and safety in the workplace with the real possibility of saving lives across the European Union."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I will begin roughly where the rapporteur left off."
"I heartily agree that this regulation substantially augments the armoury of the European Union, of the Member States and of our people in the combating of workplace hazards."
"And that is not the only point on which assent is forthcoming from this side."
"In the case of this report, Commissioner, common points of agreement were found very easily, and we worked through it in the Committee on Social Affairs and, I venture to say, improved it, and finally approved it, unanimously, without any difficulty at all."
"We think that this Commission proposal provides a significant advance in the definition of what is meant by an explosive atmosphere; an advance, that is, which, as well as augmenting the armoury of the European Union and imposing equipment requirements that bring the approach that we have been working on for quite some time to completion, fills the gaps that exist at Member State level."
"And let me remind the rapporteur that the need for a common approach, for common measures at the European Union level, in order to safeguard the safety of workers in what is, by definition, a dangerous environment, was never a source of contention."
"We believe, Commissioner, that the amendments, as finally formulated after exhaustive but quite easy discussion in our committee, from which many compromise positions emerged, genuinely improve the regulation."
"I must stress that the emphasis is placed where we believe it to be necessary; that is to say, not on the officially large corporations, which are pretty obviously not a problem in that monitoring is easy, but on the many instances in which small and medium-sized enterprises have to deal with these phenomena on a daily basis and right alongside us."
"In addition, I believe that the implementation timetable in our proposal strikes a good compromise between the immediate future and the time that undertakings actually need to adjust to the new equipment."
"On behalf of my group I can inform you that we shall be very happy to vote for Mr Mather's report."
"Madam President, Mr Flynn, in businesses and factories in Europe there are often no instructions at all about how to handle explosive atmospheres, or at best they exist only in rudimentary form."
"An explosive atmosphere is a highly inflammable mixture of air and flammable substances, and constitutes a potential danger to workers."
"Therefore there is a need for a European directive."
"Organizational measures and technical specifications should be laid down in order to improve protection for workers' health and to ensure greater safety."
"Graham Mather has done some excellent work here on behalf of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment."
"What are the principles to be observed in order to avoid explosions and provide adequate protection?"
"The formation of explosive atmospheres must be prevented."
"The igniting of explosive atmospheres must be avoided."
"The effects of explosions must be limited so that they no longer constitute a hazard."
"By observing each separate principle, the necessary protection can be achieved."
"Rooms in factories should be divided up into various zones, depending on the level of risk."
"Employers must be aware of their duty to inform and involve their employees and their representatives, and to listen in good time to what they have to say."
"The safety measures must be checked at least once a year, using suitable instruments and modern technology, and must be under the constant supervision of a responsible person, to be appointed on the basis of their professional training and experience."
"In order to provide equality of opportunity for small and medium-sized enterprises, this directive must be implemented within a reasonable time."
"Last but not least, a vade-mecum should be drawn up, in agreement with the Council, in order to explore the options for putting the minimum requirements into practice."
"Our unanimity within the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment certainly sends a positive signal to workers, and also to the Commission and the Council."
"Madam President, the Commission's proposal regarding the minimum requirements for the protection of workers potentially at risk from explosive atmospheres is absolutely vital."
"Far too many workers have been injured in explosions and far too many workers have died in explosions."
"Stringent safety measures are required to prevent explosions."
"Detailed regulations are also required in order to minimize the damages caused, if explosions occur despite safety measures."
"Mr Mather pointed out in committee that regulation is required."
"I am glad to hear that Mr Mather has come to this conclusion after reading the Commission's proposal, considering that the British government formed by the party he represents has systematically opposed the health and safety regulations drawn up by the European Union."
"It has been mentioned that the report was accepted unanimously by the committee."
"I did indeed vote for the report in the final vote, but I could not support all of Mr Mather's proposals, which unfortunately were accepted by the majority of the committee."
"On many issues it would have been better to rely on the Commission's expertise, instead of proposing apparent amendments."
"These amendments do not however change the situation so much that it would be dangerous if they were accepted."
"I cannot however recommend to my group the acceptance of Amendments Nos 1-8, whereas I warmly support Mr Mather's proposal to provide more information for employees, especially those working in small and medium-sized enterprises in particular, on the dangers caused by explosions."
"On the whole I congratulate Mr Mather on this report."
"First of all I should like to express my thanks to you, Mr Mather, for the remarkably good job you have done on this very technical matter."
"The Commission is prepared to accept the majority of the proposed amendments, in total or in part."
"Let me start with the four amendments which we find are not acceptable to the Commission: Amendments Nos 6, 9, 10 and 12."
"Amendment No 6 is unacceptable to the Commission since Article 9 covers requirements on both workplaces and work equipment."
"Concerning Amendment No 9 the Commission considers that it introduces uncertainty regarding the entry into force of the directive."
"However, the Commission supports the concept underlying the amendment and during the interinstitutional negotiations it will bear this in mind and seek to ensure that information is properly provided to all of the parties concerned."
"Indeed the question of good information being supplied has been mentioned by many of those who have contributed."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 10."
"However it would consider modifying its original text by adding the phrase 'and the assessment of the anticipated effects' in order to bring the text more into line with the ISO texts."
"Regarding Amendment No 12, the Commission thinks that this amendment renders the text too restrictive and imposes an unnecessary burden on industry, in particular on small and medium-size enterprises, and therefore it cannot be accepted."
"Secondly, I would like to enumerate the five amendments that are partially acceptable to the Commission."
"Regarding Amendment No 2, the Commission feels that the first part of the amendment clarifies the text of the Commission's proposal and therefore it can be accepted."
"In contrast, the last paragraph runs contrary to the risk assessment philosophy as it imposes the application concurrently and simultaneously of all three basic principles, rendering the text unnecessarily stringent."
"Regarding Amendment No 3, the replacement of 'responsible supervision' by 'appropriate supervision' also reflects the opinion of ECOSOC and is acceptable to the Commission."
"However, including training and education in this context is rather meaningless as far as supervision is concerned."
"So the last paragraph of the amendment cannot be accepted since it adds nothing to what has already been laid down in Article 4(4) of the proposal and Article 6 of Framework Directive 89/391."
"Regarding Amendment No 4, the Commission considers that the amendment can be accepted with a slightly different wording in line with the Commission's original text which specifies that the employer shall ensure that a health and safety plan is drawn up and kept up to date, otherwise the employer will be obliged to draw up the health and safety plan himself or herself, which would impose unacceptable constraints on small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Regarding Amendment No 7 the Commission considers that the deletion of 'work equipment' is a logical consequence of the wording of Article 9, paragraphs 1 and 2, and can be accepted."
"However, workplaces already in use before entry into force of this directive have to comply with the minimum requirements specified in the proposal and not only those of Article 4."
"With respect to Amendment No 8, the Commission is of the view that the deletion of the reference to Article 17 of the framework directive renders the text imprecise since the amendment does not specify who draws up the vademecum."
"As a consequence it should be complemented with the words: ' by the Commission' ."
"Lastly - and this was something that was mentioned both by you, Mr Mather, and by Mr Papakyriazis - I am pleased to inform you that there are five amendments which are totally acceptable to the Commission."
"The Commission's view is that these amendments, namely Amendments Nos 1, 5, 11 and 13, improve the original text by providing a better formulation and that Amendment No 14 in particular, by providing for early information, particularly to small and medium-sized enterprises, facilitates their adaptation to the requirements of that directive."
"Indeed Mr Thomas Mann very rightly draws our attention to the basic principles involved here, which firstly, are, to prevent the formation, in the first instance, of such atmospheres, which requires certain elements of venting."
"Then there is the question of preventing the ignition causing the explosion."
"And we must, of course, always seek to take mitigating action if the explosion occurs."
"These are the fundamentals of what we are seeking to do here."
"Mr Papakyriazis, you are quite right to say that this is a good step forward."
"We have to provide the right kind of information, as Mrs Stenius-Kaukonen said, because this is the way to move forward in the interest of protection of workers."
"Thank you for your attention."
"There are not many here but at the same time this is important legislation and we look forward to its early adoption."
"Madam President, I wish to thank Commissioner Flynn for what he said and, indeed, all my colleagues for their remarks, which have been most helpful."
"As the Commissioner said, this is a very technical measure indeed and the points which have arisen show that."
"The committee, as Mr Papakyriazis said, has spent a great deal of time and paid enormous attention to detail."
"I am most grateful for that and for the comments of my colleague, Thomas Mann."
"I must say a word in response to Mrs Stenius-Kaukonen, who gave me a slightly mixed score on the amendments."
"They are, indeed, stringent and, as my witness, I would call the Commissioner who, in his comments, observed that a number of the measures were slightly too stringent for the Commission's taste."
"So perhaps I am not stringent enough for Mrs Stenius-Kaukonen and a little too stringent for the Commissioner."
"I hope the report is therefore pitched about right."
"I will not abuse the hospitality of the Chamber to defend the honour of the UK Government in response to Mrs Stenius-Kaukonen's comments, other than simply to say that it is the view of my colleagues in London that they assiduously comply with and support what they consider to be genuine health and safety measures, but take quite a firm view when health and safety procedures are used for other measures they do not think properly fall within that boundary."
"Thank you once again for a debate which I hope will be helpful."
"We look forward to taking this very important subject further."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Protection of workers against carcinogens"
"The next item is the report (A4-0103/96) by Mrs Stenuis-Kaukonen, on behalf of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, on the proposal for a Council Directive (COM(95)0425 - C4-0433/95-95/0229(SYN)) amending for the first time Directive 90/394/EEC on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens at work."
"Madam President, in this proposal by the Commission the objective is to set an occupational limit values for exposure to benzene, extend the scope of the directive and clarify the wording of two clauses in the directive."
"This amendment is a clear improvement of the directive."
"Extension of the scope of this directive is particularly important, since it brings medicinal preparations, cosmetics, waste, fertilizers, explosives and foodstuffs into the remit of the directive."
"The choice of benzene as the first substance for which a limit value is proposed is justified, because benzene exposure is extremely widespread and its tolerance risks clearly stated."
"Benzene exposure occurs for example in oil refineries, in connection with petrol transport and distribution, that is at service stations and garages, and in the petrochemical industry."
"Users of power saws may also be exposed to benzene."
"The Committee on Social Affairs proposes 16 amendments."
"The European Parliament has already demanded that limit values be set for all carcinogens."
"This has however not been implemented."
"Although in its report the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment does support the Commission's proposal to set a limit value only for benzene as the first substance, it makes a strong recommendation for the Commission to draw up a proposal as to how the required limit value could be set as soon as possible for all substances classified as carcinogens."
"The Commission has already drawn up a priority list of substances for which limit values should subsequently be set."
"The committee considers it important that limit values are also set for heavy metals without delay, and proposes that arsenic and certain arsenic compounds should top the priority list."
"The committee also proposes that the Commission examines the possibility of simplifying the setting of limit values particularly for substances for which the limit values, based on scientific information and solid research, are purely health-based."
"A considerable weakness in the Commission's proposal is that skin absorption has not sufficiently been taken into account."
"Although the consequences of skin absorption are highlighted in the report, no biological measurements are mentioned in the directive, nor any limit values."
"In its report the committee requests that the concept of biological limit value is defined and that the Commission should present the biological tolerance limits for benzene without delay."
"The definition of limit values in the report is taken from the Commission's proposal for a directive on chemical substances."
"The Committee on Social Affairs and Employment recommends that the definition for limit values as a concept is clarified."
"In the Commission's proposal the spatial measurements area is regulated using the expression 'the employee's breathing area' ."
"Legislation should make a clear distinction between two concepts, the air of the workplace and the breathing air of the employee."
"The committee has consequently made an amendment to the clause in question, in line with a recent recommendation of the European committee on standardization, in which breathing area is defined as an area from which the worker takes his breathing air."
"Exceeding this value would be prohibited."
"The committee's report also recommends that a common measuring practice is created for defining limit values for benzene content."
"If the concept of limit values is defined in the form presented by the committee, there are no grounds for granting provisional exceptions as suggested by the Commission."
"They are not satisfactory as legislation."
"They are also in contravention of the health and safety regulations."
"If the proposal of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment is accepted, that is the exceptions are removed, there is no need for Amendments Nos 18 and 19 proposed by the Committee on the Environment."
"It should be emphasized that benzene is considered to be a substance for which no limit value can be set beneath which there would be no health risks."
"Decrease in exposure however also decreases the risks."
"The limit value of 1 ppm proposed by the Commission may, if exposed to over a working life, cause 0.5-6.6 more cases of leukemia per 1000 workers."
"This involves a too great a risk, and therefore this limit value should be gradually lowered."
"The Committee on the Environment has proposed a limit value of 0.1 ppm by the beginning of year 2001, and I myself put this proposal forward to the Committee on Social Affairs, but it was not accepted."
"I now propose a compromise of 0.5 ppm by the beginning of year 2003, and hope that at least this could be accepted."
"The benzene content can be lowered mainly by reducing the amount of benzene in petrol, and the Commission has today put forward a proposal, but I do not find it adequate."
"I would like to thank the Commission for their willingness to co-operate, and I am happy that Ireland will bring this issue to the Council for consideration as soon as their period of presidency begins."
"Madam President, the opinion of the Committee on the Environment is not very different from that of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment."
"Our task will be easier as a result, but I should like to draw attention to a few aspects of this proposal for a Directive."
"Firstly, we ought to be delighted that the field of application is widened so as to include all carcinogens present in the workplace - this is excellent - and also so that it takes into account all the possible ways in which workers can be exposed."
"Fixing limit values for benzene is also a good thing."
"What is less good is the fixing of the limit value at one part per million, that is, 3.25 mg per m3 on average over eight hours."
"This value in fact corresponds to the present situation in all workplaces where benzene is used, except for certain types of enterprise related to the oil industry, precisely where the proposal aims to grant a derogation with a limit value three times as great."
"When it has been known for a hundred years that benzene is a carcinogen, when it is also known that there is no value below which there is zero risk, in other words, as soon as one is exposed to benzene there is a risk of cancer, I think - along with the Committee on the Environment - that the proposal is completely inadequate."
"The derogation is unacceptable."
"It is entirely possible to limit the working time if, in the short term, it is technically impossible to prevent a worker who works eight hours from getting an exposure of more than one part per million."
"Thus, the short term solution is to reduce his hours of work."
"Another solution would be to reduce the benzene content of fuels."
"We know that the United States tolerates only 1 % of benzene in petrol, while Europe accepts a maximum of 5 %."
"Quite clearly therefore the need would be to make a major effort in that direction rather than to grant derogations which will only confirm an existing situation."
"One last remark: since logically we should like it to be laid down that exposure to benzene should ultimately be reduced as much as possible, it is essential that, after the year 2000 - and this is the proposal from the Committee on the Environment - the limit value for exposure should be reduced by a factor of 10, in other words to 0.1 part per million."
"Mrs Stenius-Kaukonen has produced an insightful and thorough report which has been done practically through hard work in our committee."
"She knows that I accept nearly everything that she has done, and we in the Socialist Group will accept the entire committee's report as it was voted."
"I have a particular direct question to put to the Commissioner on the limit values which have been set by the Commission at 1 ppm."
"We accept them as being those which the industry can attain and can afford."
"I wonder whether the Commissioner could confirm that any further reduction, which I believe is unlikely in the short term, is unrealistic as an objective and possibly too severe a burden on the chemical industry as a whole."
"I do not believe it offers the hope of saving more lives, because I do not think in the short term that this will be achieved, but the possibility of the destruction of many small businesses."
"Millions become ill each year in work-related illnesses and this report will have a direct effect on reducing that industrial carnage and misery."
"That is why we need this report to succeed and we should underline any significant achievements and support them where they occur."
"It is easy perhaps to dismiss it saying that we have not gone all the way down the line but we know that 5 ppm exists at the moment."
"To come down to 1 ppm is a significant achievement."
"I apologize for using the jargon but it is good solid progress."
"I hope that all my colleagues in the House, wherever they might be tonight, will take a pragmatic and sincere approach to this problem in tomorrow's vote."
"No-one should play silly games with health and safety and I should say, without fear of reproach, that this report is one of the most important directives made in health and safety."
"I warn anyone who thinks that he can play fast and loose with this kind of report that the gloves will come off."
"The challenge is here to achieve a limit which has never been achieved before, and it is within our grasp to do it."
"I want the report to be a success."
"Let there be no difference between us and the Commission on this issue."
"We want to return this jointly to the Council and we want the Council to accept our opinion."
"Madam President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Stenius-Kaukonen, the rapporteur, on her report."
"This is a field about which she knows a great deal and which she understands thoroughly."
"I regard the amendments to the Commission's proposal which are proposed in the report and the amendments by the Greens as a necessary tightening up of the Commission proposal."
"It should really be self-evident that we should do all we can to ensure that people's health is protected and that they are not exposed to substances which we know to be highly carcinogenic, such as benzene, either at the workplace or anywhere else."
"Where toxic substances and substances of this kind are concerned the first question should always be whether the substance or product is needed at all; then we can ask whether it can be replaced by anything else. Only thirdly should it be a question of minimising risks."
"It is of course extremely good that the Commission has tabled this proposal and that we are going to have a limit value."
"However, I must at the same time express my regret that limit values have not also been set for all the other substances that have also been found to be highly carcinogenic."
"It would be preferable for as many of these substances as possible to be got rid of and for limit values to be established for all those which we absolutely have to have."
"The limit values should also be binding, with a maximum permissible level which may not be exceeded."
"In this connection the Commission proposal should be formulated in such a way that there can be no ambiguity and no possibility of it being interpreted in different ways."
"In order for limit values not to be merely empty figures, the directive should also indicate what will be required of employers if those values are exceeded or what sanctions or consequences will ensue if the maximum permissible levels are not respected."
"I also believe it would be regrettable if the directive did not at this stage already lay down a considerably lower limit, exactly as the rapporteur has proposed."
"It would be a pity if this compromise were to be reached, that is to say 0.1 ppm by the year 2000."
"After all, there are already countries which have in fact decided to implement it."
"I do not therefore believe that it would be so impossible."
"Nor can the Greens accept that an exception be made of the petrol sector, that is to say its storage and distribution, with a limit value of 3 ppm."
"We will of course support this proposal but only with the amendments which the Greens have also tabled."
"Madam President, cancer is a serious disease among the population."
"It severely affects many people, and claims many human lives."
"Leukaemia is one of the most serious forms of cancer; we know from countless studies that there is a link between exposure to benzene and leukaemia."
"It is therefore extremely welcome that the Commission is now seeking to introduce a higher degree of protection for workers."
"There is a need for a directive on carcinogens, and for the scope of the current directive to be extended to include medicinal preparations, cosmetics and pesticides."
"We should do what is politically and humanly possible to limit cancer and protect workers, and this can only be done by taking preventive measures."
"So I do not think that introducing biological limit values is a good idea."
"We should ensure that the working conditions as a whole are satisfactory, so that there is no reason to take measurements for individuals."
"If we go that far, there is already a risk that people will have become ill."
"We should measure for the workplace, and not for individuals."
"The limit values should not stand alone, and we must take care not to focus exclusively on limit values."
"The other measures in the framework directive should be given higher priority, and there needs to be an overall solution, providing for a safer working environment in general."
"We must not allow any kind of dangerous substances or machinery in an undertaking."
"If a substance is dangerous, it should be replaced by another. I would therefore ask the Commission to step up the work in the Scientific Committee."
"Things are moving far too slowly as regards the study of the various carcinogens."
"There is a disgraceful lack of speed about this work, Mr Flynn."
"It is not enough simply to check that the limit values are respected."
"In some work situations, even the proposed limit value of 0.1 ppm would be too high."
"The workplace should be completely safe and free of risk."
"That should be our starting-point."
"And lastly, I would commend the rapporteur on what is an excellent report."
"Madam President, I should like to thank Mrs Stenius-Kaukonen for her good work on this proposal and for her support of the Commission for some time in the fight against occupational cancers."
"The Commission appreciates it very much as I do personally."
"The objectives of the Commission proposal are quite simple."
"Firstly, we want to extend the scope of the directive to a whole series of preparations which the rapporteur has mentioned, such as medicinal preparations, cosmetics and pesticides."
"Secondly, for the first time we want to set an occupational limit value for a well-known carcinogen, namely benzene."
"Both these measures represent significant new initiatives in the Community's efforts to provide protection for workers from occupational exposure to carcinogens and the Commission is grateful for the support given by Parliament to its proposal."
"I am pleased to say that the majority of the amendments proposed are acceptable to the Commission."
"However, I regret that Amendments Nos 11, 14 and 15 cannot be accepted."
"These call for the deletion of the temporary derogations for selective sectors of activities as far as the limit value for benzene is concerned."
"These derogations, which were agreed by the social partners in the advisory committee, are necessary to ensure a little more time for some industrial sectors to comply with the provisions of the directive."
"The Commission accepts that these derogations are necessary."
"Obviously it would be ideal if all sectors were in a position to meet the revised requirements immediately."
"However, in the case of these sectors it is simply not possible."
"It is important to note that the derogations are restricted both with respect to the number of industrial sectors concerned and in time."
"Thus the derogation will expire two years after the transposition by the Member State."
"The Commission is ready to consider any proposal for a reduction of the time limit for benzene in the future."
"The figures included in the present text, as I have already said, are the result of a comprehensive consultation with the advisory committee for safety, hygiene and health protection at work."
"Any further reduction could be part of a further updating of the directive in the future."
"Mr Skinner is right: this is real progress and he states the position correctly so far as limit values are concerned."
"There are countries with the 5 ppm situation in existence so going down to 1 ppm is considerable progress."
"Mr Skinner was quite right in what he said."
"For this reason, Amendments Nos 17 and 20 cannot be accepted."
"Amendments Nos 18 and 19 which intend to reduce the work-time for workers in the case of higher exposure level, even if scientifically sound, would be very difficult to put into practice in the situations provided for in the derogations."
"For that reason the Commission cannot accept them."
"The Commission considers that Amendment No 10 is not appropriate to the text."
"It is superfluous, given the provisions of the Framework Directive 89/391 from which the current text is derived."
"The Commission can understand the basis for Amendments Nos 3 and 4."
"These require simplification for setting limit values for carcinogens and ask for a plan on how to set up these values as quickly as possible for all carcinogens."
"However, the simplification of the process involved not only included the Commission but also the social partners and the Council."
"As far as Amendment No 4 is concerned, adequate scientific data is not available."
"That is a key point and many of you will understand this, in particular the rapporteur."
"It is not available just now for all carcinogens."
"However, the Commission would like to assure the House that when the data is available it will not hesitate to act."
"In addition, Amendments Nos 3 and 4 which refer to the recitals have no legal follow-up in the text of the decision."
"This applies also to Amendment No 7."
"I consider that it would, therefore, be preferable to take note sympathetically of the ideas in these amendments without commitment at this point as to how we might put the principles into practice."
"Amongst the amendments which are acceptable, I would in particular like to express my agreement with Amendment No 16 which requires a uniform, measuring procedure for benzene."
"The Commission will find the appropriate wording to include that particular idea in the text."
"I should like to thank all those who have contributed and say that we regard it as an extremely important amendment to Directive No 90/394."
"I am happy to say that the matter has been given priority by the Irish presidency and I sincerely hope we can progress it further in the immediate future."
"I should like to thank you in my turn, Commissioner Flynn."
"Mrs Stenuis-Kaukonen, you wish to comment?"
"Madam President, perhaps a few comments would be in order."
"The exceptions are not in my opinion necessary, not even for the two years proposed by the Commission, but the Commission has its own view on this and I hope that Parliament takes a different view."
"Most importantly the benzene content in petrol should be lowered in order to achieve lower benzene contents in the air. I referred earlier today to the package on engine oils for cars accepted by the Commission, but unfortunately the target set for the content of benzene in petrol is 2 %, which is far too high."
"If this target were to be set at 1 %, as many countries have already done, it would be considerably easier to reach the 1 ppm target particularly at service stations, where petrol of course is handled a lot."
"In this connection I would merely like to point out that the scientific information on the dangers of all carcinogens - as we know there is not sufficient information regarding all substances - but clearly the Commission has not understood my intentions behind the proposal of this plan."
"For the substances about which we have sufficient information a detailed proposal should be drawn up regarding when limit values should be set, and for those substances which require more research, this research should be carried out and targets should be set for the schedule of the research."
"This would speed up these issues considerably."
"It was said here today that it had taken too long to set these limit values."
"I would like to remind you of the fact that several years ago now Parliament put forward measures on these issues."
"On the whole, as I said before, I would like to thank the Commission for its co-operation on this issue and hope that we can now move forward."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.35 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, I notice there are a lot of roll-call votes accompanying the Minutes."
"I notice that yesterday you did not tell us who had asked for the roll-call votes."
"It might help if today's Minutes showed the average cost of one of those and possibly, by extension, the amount of trees we consume in a year, often for quite frivolous reasons."
"Annual report of the Ombudsman (Presentation)"
"The next item is the presentation by the European Ombudsman of his annual report for 1995."
"Madam President, distinguished Members of the European Parliament, I should like to begin by thanking you for creating time in a busy parliamentary schedule for the Ombudsman to present his report."
"By establishing the practice that the Ombudsman presents his report in person, the European Parliament is following the best parliamentary traditions of those Member States that have established a classic Ombudsman institution."
"I am convinced that this practice will prove beneficial in terms of our common ideals of an open and democratic European Union."
"I would also like to draw attention to the serious and dedicated attitude that I have observed in the Committee on Petitions and in Parliament as a whole towards the rights of European citizens."
"This is a promising sign for a fruitful and effective cooperation between the Ombudsman and the European Parliament, especially the Committee on Petitions, to the benefit of the European citizens."
"This is the first annual report by the European Ombudsman."
"At this early stage in the development of the office it is very important for me to have the views of you, the Members of the European Parliament, about what I have done so far and about what should be done."
"Furthermore you have the opportunity to make observations on my report as well as on the report of the Committee on Petitions."
"This will be of great value to me in my future work."
"There have been voices saying that the Ombudsman's office has not achieved results."
"My annual report covers only a short period from September 1995, when I took up my duties, to December 1995."
"The report also includes statistics about complaints up to the end of March."
"Since then the situation has changed considerably."
"My office has now been active in producing decisions and solutions."
"As of yesterday my office had received a total of 647 complaints."
"An examination of admissibility had already been completed in 599 cases, that is in over 90 % of the cases."
"In 132 cases a preliminary inquiry has been initiated."
"16 inquiries have been closed, 6 with a favourable solution for the complainant, 1 with a critical remark addressed to the institution."
"In one instance the complainant dropped the case and in 8 cases no instance of maladministration was found."
"My office was only able to start the work with the complainants at full speed from the beginning of this year."
"The institution in question is usually given three months to comment on the complaint."
"This time limit is mentioned in the statute."
"After that the complainant has one month to react to what the institution has said."
"Only last month, therefore, did it become possible to take further action in the first cases."
"There has also been criticism of the high number of inadmissible cases."
"You have to remember that the mandate 'maladministration in Community institutions and bodies' is a limited one."
"Only about 40 % of the complaints are within the mandate."
"The statute of the European Ombudsman contains additional requirements before I can investigate the complaint."
"The limited mandate given by the Treaty and the further restrictions in the statute which Parliament has laid down for me explains why only about 20 % of complaints reach the stage of an inquiry."
"I am bound to act in accordance with these provisions."
"The procedures of work and statistics are presented in the annual report."
"I am sure that the figures will be much more favourable in the next annual report."
"Article 8(d) of the Treaty establishing the European Community creates two important rights for the European citizens, namely the right to petition the European Parliament and the right to complain to the European Ombudsman."
"Citizens enjoy both these rights and it is for them to choose whether to address a petition to Parliament or apply to the Ombudsman."
"However, it may not always be obvious to the citizen which course of action is more appropriate."
"For this reason my office and the Committee on Petitions have cooperated closely to clarify our respective functions and to establish methods of cooperation."
"There is a procedure for the transfer of cases between the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman with the agreement of the petitioner or complainant."
"The Ombudsman does not, as a rule, deal with a matter pending before the Committee on Petitions unless the committee transfers it to the Ombudsman."
"Nor does the Ombudsman deal with cases that have been examined and dealt with by the committee unless there are relevant new elements that justify recourse to the Ombudsman."
"Complaints about decisions of the Committee on Petitions itself are considered inadmissible since its decisions, like those of Parliament, are political matters."
"The right to petition created by the Treaty is a right to petition the European Parliament."
"The Committee on Petitions acts on its behalf."
"It is for Parliament to supervise the work of its own committee and, for example, to make sure that the committee's resources are adequate to perform the tasks entrusted to it."
"The mandate of the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman are different and complementary."
"Together they constitute a unique possibility to promote the rights of the European citizens."
"My experience of cooperation with the Committee on Petitions has been very positive."
"I am ready to monitor the established procedure for cooperation."
"I look for ways to enhance cooperation in favour of the rights of the European citizen."
"The Ombudsman himself should act in as transparent a way as possible so that the European citizens can fully understand what he does and to set a good example to others."
"For this reason it has been decided that the register of complaints is to be open to the public."
"The complaint, the first opinion from the institutional body as well as the decision that finally closes this complaint will also be publicly available."
"The inquiries following the first opinion from an institutional body are carried out in private, however, so as to ensure full cooperation and to promote a friendly solution in the case."
"The complainant's right to privacy must be respected."
"If confidentiality is requested then the complaint and all the documents relating to it are treated as confidential."
"The entry on the register, the decision that finally closes the complaint as well as any report or recommendations to the European Parliament will be made anonymous so that the complainant cannot be identified."
"But the Ombudsman should do more than just seek transparency in his own office."
"Part of his mission is to enhance the relationship between the Community institutions and bodies and European citizens."
"The creation of the office was meant to underline the commitment of the European Union to an open, democratic and accountable administration."
"The need for transparency in the Union is emphasized by Mrs Ahern in her report and by the Committee on Petitions in its motion for a resolution."
"During my first months in office I have received a number of complaints concerning public access to documents held by Community institutions and bodies."
"The Commission and Council have already issued a code of conduct about public access to documents they hold."
"But I have no information that any other Community institutional body has adopted general rules on public access to documents."
"I have therefore launched an initiative by asking the other Community institutions and bodies to inform me about the position in respect of public access to documents."
"The initiative covers all institutions and bodies except the Council and Commission."
"For example, it covers Parliament, the Court of Justice but only in relation to administrative documents, the Court of Auditors, the European Investment Bank and the European Monetary Institute."
"I hope that this initiative will be well received and that it will lead to more transparency in these institutions and bodies."
"Creating a new office takes time."
"So far the establishment of the office of the European Ombudsman has proceeded relatively smoothly."
"That is in large part because of the helpful and cooperative attitude shown by the European Parliament and its administration, by the Commission and the Council and by the other Community institutions and bodies."
"The proportion of inadmissible complaints I have received is relatively high."
"European citizens need time and information to understand what the Ombudsman can and cannot do."
"For this reason, a leaflet about how to complain to the European Ombudsman has been published."
"It includes a standard form on which the complaint can be made."
"The leaflet is being widely distributed through the national offices of Parliament and the Commission, the offices of the national ombudsmen and similar bodies and through a large number of organizations involved in European affairs."
"Since last week the text of the leaflet is also available on the Internet."
"There is nothing unusual about inadmissible complaints."
"Ombudsmen at all levels receive many of them."
"Whenever I am unable to deal with a complaint, I try to advise the complainant to go to another body which can help."
"Very often the advice is to petition the European Parliament."
"In some cases it is appropriate to refer complainants to the Commission as the guardian of the Treaties."
"The Commission's own complaints procedure has great potential to help European citizens to protect their rights under Community law when national authorities are involved."
"I hope that this important activity of the Commission will become better known to the public."
"Finally, I attach great importance to cooperation with national ombudsmen and similar bodies."
"Such cooperation in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity will be of great importance in promoting the full implementation of Community law at all levels of the Union."
"A seminar is being organized next September here in Strasbourg to discuss with them the principles for such cooperation and to agree on common activities in the future."
"The work of the European Ombudsman is only one element in the process for ensuring that European citizens enjoy the benefits of an open, democratic and accountable administration."
"The Ombudsman's office can succeed only if the Community institutions and bodies are firmly committed both to these principles and to the full cooperation with the Ombudsman."
"From my experience so far I believe that this commitment exists."
"I look forward with confidence to continuing to develop a partnership with the other Community institutions and bodies to protect the rights of European citizens."
"Madam President and Members of the European Parliament, thank you for your attention."
"(Loud applause)"
"Annual report of the Ombudsman (Debate)"
"The next item is the report (A4-0176/96) by Mrs Ahern, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the annual activity report (1995) of the Ombudsman of the European Union (C4-0257/96)."
"Madam President, I very much welcome the statement of the European Ombudsman here today and thank him for the serious cooperation we have had in this Parliament, particularly with the committee responsible, the Committee on Petitions, over the last year while he has been establishing his office."
"The Treaty on European Union created this new office of Ombudsman of the European Union and it ensures that the new body can autonomously defend citizens against maladministration in the Union institutions and bodies."
"The Ombudsman is nevertheless a parliamentary Ombudsman and his presence here today is an indication of that."
"He is appointed by Parliament, he reports to Parliament and he cooperates, of course, with Parliament, and we want Parliament very much to cooperate with him."
"In particular, we welcome his powers to investigate: it is a useful protection for the people of Europe against maladministration in the Council, the Commission and Parliament itself."
"People have rightly said that the institutions are closed, elitist and impenetrable to the citizens."
"The challenge now for the Ombudsman is to shake up the Commission, the Council and, indeed, Parliament, so that the closed shop of the European Union institutions can become open for anyone to see."
"The European Union is a complex of opposing tendencies."
"The conflict between the idea of Europe as a collaboration of sovereign states and the ideal of a federal Europe has retarded the development of modern, democratic and citizen-friendly European Union institutions."
"If we are to create such democratic institutions, the next step is to make access to information an explicit commitment of the institutions, along the lines of the code of conduct concerning access to documents."
"In this report before you today we have asked you to endorse this explicit commitment from the institutions and see that it is carried out."
"We already have a commitment by Mrs Gradin, the Commissioner responsible, that she will pursue this very strongly during the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The Committee on Petitions is the parliamentary organ to which the Ombudsman submits his reports and which needs to establish a complementary working relationship in view of their various responsibilities on petitions and complaints of the citizens."
"In practice, this means an additional role for the committee in overseeing the functions of the Ombudsman in relation to Parliament."
"I now wish to comment more on his report."
"The first part of the report is particularly useful since it explains the conditions in which a complaint can be introduced and the procedural decisions taken by the Ombudsman for dealing with complaints."
"Thus the report illustrates who can complain - citizens or residents - against whom - the institutions and bodies of the Community - and here we can note that the Ombudsman himself constitutes a further body of the Community."
"About what?"
"A definition of maladministration is wisely not attempted."
"I am sure that we shall have very interesting reports in due course as to exactly what constitutes maladministration when the Ombudsman reports concretely to us on issues that he has not been able to resolve."
"Of course, his ability to resolve complaints by mediation is an important aspect of his work."
"The procedure followed: complaints declared admissible and prima facie founded are communicated to the institution or body in question, which is asked to give a first opinion."
"Once this has been considered, together with any comments by the complainant, a solution is sought between the two parties."
"If, after appropriate draft recommendations from the Ombudsman, this mediating role fails, then the Ombudsman reports to the European Parliament and Parliament will then take appropriate action and, hopefully, the institution concerned will take appropriate action as well."
"The power of the Ombudsman to conduct own-initiative inquiries is the key to the opening up of the institutions."
"For example, he may look into the files of yourself, Madam President, Mr Santer, President Hänsch, any Member of Parliament or member of the Commission, as he sees fit."
"This form of inquiry may acquire far greater importance in the years to come to the benefit of the democratic functioning of the Union and, therefore, of Parliament and citizens."
"To conclude, we hope that the special cooperation which we have established with the Ombudsman will continue in the years to come."
"Madam President, Mr Ombudsman, Madam Rapporteur, as the Treaty states, the Ombudsman's annual report is made to Parliament."
"Perhaps you will allow me, nevertheless, to tell you, on behalf of the Commission - and in particular of my colleague, Mrs Anita Gradin, whom I am representing - the Commission's view of this institution and of the work it has done."
"It is obvious that with the creation of the office of Ombudsman, the people of Europe and the concept of European citizenship, have been substantially enriched since the sound administration of the European institutions, the transparency and the fairness of their operations correspond to fundamental rights of the people of Europe, and the European Ombudsman can help to guarantee that those rights are effectively exercised in practice."
"The Commission feels sure that with the European citizen able to exercise control through the Ombudsman over how our administration works, we can only be encouraged to work better, to put right our shortcomings and our mistakes and of course to work more transparently."
"The Ombudsman's report quite rightly states that harmonious relations between the Commission and the Ombudsman himself are fundamental, amongst other things because - as is also stated in his report - the great majority of the complaints made to the Ombudsman concern the Commission or its work."
"The Commission has also had an opportunity to reply to the requests for information concerning complaints querying the Commission's administration or its day-to-day running."
"On behalf of the Commission I think I can say that the Commission has replied without holding anything back, in a spirit of transparency and respecting the prerogatives of every institution."
"Although some problems have arisen in a limited number of cases -in particular as regards the length of time it takes to get a reply from the Commission - I can assure you that the Commission has undertaken to overcome those problems without delay."
"I should like to tell you that the Commission, knowing that the Ombudsman, Mr Söderman, is particularly concerned about the problem of delays, has taken the appropriate measures to ensure that the time-limits fixed for replying when a complaint reaches the Ombudsman's office are observed."
"I should like to end by congratulating Mr Södermann, the rapporteur and the European Parliament on behalf of the Commission and of course by wishing Mr Södermann the best of success in his task of protecting citizens' rights and assuring him of the Commission's full collaboration."
"Rest assured that we shall remedy the shortcomings you have pointed out in your report, which we think in fact will be an easy mater."
"Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists I want to congratulate the European Ombudsman, Mr Söderman, on his excellent first report."
"I also want to congratulate the Committee on Petitions' vice-chair and rapporteur, Mrs Ahern, on her excellent report on behalf of the committee."
"The Ombudsman has proved to be a serious, assiduous and determined person committed to protecting the rights of the people of the European Union."
"An excellent working relationship has already developed over the past months between Mr Söderman and myself, who at the moment hold the office of chair of the Committee on Petitions."
"I am sure such a relationship will continue with any future chair as well."
"The Committee on Petitions is, as has been said, the committee responsible both for relations with the European Ombudsman and for monitoring the work of the European Ombudsman."
"The European Ombudsman is independent and so we, as the Petitions Committee, do not interfere in the ongoing investigations of complaints."
"When in future the committee gets reports of maladministration relating to the outcome of individual complaints we will discuss them with interest."
"We welcome his initiative to call for greater access to public documentation of European Union organizations."
"The work of the European Ombudsman and the Petitions Committee is complementary."
"One deals with allegations of maladministration in European Community institutions and bodies, the other, the Committee on Petitions, deals with the general area of European Union fields of activity, particularly non-implementation by Member States of European Union law and proposals to improve European Union policies."
"Turning to the amendments, the Socialist Group will be opposing all the amendments because we think the report is excellent as it stands."
"Mr Pex's amendments in particular are not helpful and were rightly rejected by the Petitions Committee."
"They turn a report on the Ombudsman's report into a report on relations between the Ombudsman and the Petitions Committee."
"In particular Amendment No 4 encourages the Ombudsman to challenge decisions of the Petitions Committee taken on so-called improper grounds."
"How are we to decide if members of the Petitions Committee have taken a decision on improper grounds?"
"Presumably, if a Member disagrees with a majority decision of his colleagues or if he is too busy elsewhere to take part in a decision of the committee with which he disagrees."
"Finally, and more positively, I want to make it clear on behalf of the Socialist Group that we will support the work of the European Union Ombudsman, respecting his independence, with friendly criticism where appropriate, but primarily backing him and assisting him in pressing the European Union institutions and bodies to implement the recommendations in his reports particularly when he has found maladministration."
"He can be assisted by the democratically elected representatives of the people in ensuring that his work in combating maladministration in the European Community is supported strongly."
"Madam President, on behalf of the European People's Party I too am pleased to congratulate Mr Söderman on his first report to Parliament and Mrs Ahern on her report."
"The post of European Ombudsman is one of the most valuable and least controversial fruits of the Treaty of Maastricht."
"Since national posts of ombudsman originated in Scandinavia, we are particularly fortunate in having not just an experienced postholder in Mr Söderman but an ombudsman who brings all the accumulated experience of Finland to the exercise of such a role."
"It is important that the institutions of the Union serve the European citizen and not the other way around."
"That is what makes the post of ombudsman so valuable."
"Citizens need to know there is someone, a real human being, who will take their side if bureaucracy threatens to ignore the rights of the citizen."
"Experienced parliamentarians in this House will have no difficulty in understanding the concept of maladministration and will easily know what is the ombudsman's sphere of responsibility."
"MEPs will appreciate the different responsibilities of national ombudsmen, the European Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions."
"However, these are not easy concepts and that is why a maximum of simple, colourful publicity is required to explain in straightforward terms how the ombudsman can help citizens and how his role differs from the Petitions Committee."
"Mr Söderman referred to his pamphlet, ' How to Complain to the European Ombudsman' ."
"In terms of simplicity and colourfulness, I give this a mark of 2 out of 10."
"I have received tax demands that are more colourful and more inspiring than this document."
"Just compare it for instance with the document I picked up last night at the party celebrating the wines of Provence: that makes me want to drink a glass of Provençal wine, I am not too sure this pamphlet does much for the European Ombudsman."
"Do we not have anybody within the European Community, better graphic artists, who could give the boost that is needed to bring this down to a personal level?"
"To turn to Mrs Ahern's report, I welcome Amendment No 1, which refers to the use of new technology to apply to the ombudsman."
"We need to make use of modern and easy means of communication, but please do not make that an excuse for having dismal paper means for publicising and contacting the ombudsman."
"Cooperation, communication between the ombudsman and the Petitions Committee, is also very important if we are to protect more fully our citizens' rights."
"In that respect I believe Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4 help the report by underlining the complementary role of ombudsman and Petitions Committee."
"I would add that this House, as one of the institutions of the European Community, should certainly not be shy of allowing the ombudsman to investigate our procedures."
"In conclusion, and on reflection, I give the ombudsman 9 out of 10 for his first report, but I have to say I reduce the score for his pamphlet to 1 out of 10 and plead with somebody to make that more attractive so that the citizens know that they have the ombudsman and Parliament on their side."
"Madam President, in my view, this report by Ms Ahern has many merits: the first being the ability to get right to the heart of the Ombudsman's report and to do so with great accuracy; meantime the Ombudsman, for his part, has presented to us a document that is simple and relevant - a document that is accessible to all."
"It is right to stress that, as Ms Ahern said, this report has an educational purpose also: explaining to us what the Ombudsman is and, above all, how he can help all of the citizens of the Union."
"The report given to us by Ms Ahern is also excellent because it is concise."
"I think, however, that the final text could be improved, and that is why my group will be voting for all of the amendments that have been tabled and which have the effect of making the text more transparent and closer to what citizens are demanding, that is above all to be able to understand and participate."
"When it comes to citizens, I should really like to find a rather more up-to-date way of bringing this Institution to their attention, and when I refer to 'citizens' I of course mean not only those born in the Union but also those who have come here to live and work and who may find it more difficult to have access to the Ombudsman."
"I wish you well, Mr Söderman!"
"Madam President, I should also like to express my thanks for the Ombudsman's activity report and the report by Mrs Ahern."
"The former is called an annual report, but in fact it covers three months, since the Ombudsman has not actually been in office that long, although I think he has achieved a good deal in the time he has been working."
"I also think that the Ombudsman has adopted the right approach to his work, namely dealing with citizens' complaints and in particular not making political capital at the expense of the institution - the Union as such - even if that would have been very easy, but in the long term not very likely to improve the understanding of the Union's work."
"Having said that, I would agree with Mr Perry that one might perhaps wish to see a rather more colourful form of publicity for the Ombudsman, but we can try to provide some inspiration for that in the course of the coming year."
"I shall now turn to the amendments, the budget and the question of the office in Brussels."
"We can support Amendments Nos 1, 2, 4 and 5."
"I am not sure if these are particularly necessary, but on the other hand they do no harm."
"As for Amendment No 3, I am sorry that the Conservative group has not made the amendment somewhat clearer."
"In a way, we agree that it should be possible to make use of Article 169, but we do not think that involving the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman is particularly appropriate, and so we shall be abstaining on this amendment."
"When it comes to the budget, the Ombudsman has of course like everyone else had some tough discussions with the Committee on Budgets."
"These will no doubt continue, and I would advise the Ombudsman to explain as well as he possibly can at present the need for an increased staff and also what kind of tasks it will not be possible to carry out unless sufficient budgetary resources are made available."
"As regards the office in Brussels, the discussions will be resumed."
"We understand the Ombudsman's views on the need for an office in Brussels in order to make his work in Strasbourg more effective, and in the course of the coming year we shall therefore be pleased to discuss the scope for setting up such an office, without creating any conflict with the location in Strasbourg, where the Ombudsman himself also wishes to remain."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the annual report of the Ombudsman, Mr Södermann, covering the year 1995, has two features which I think warrant attention, namely that this is the first report of the Ombudsman to the European Parliament and that the period which it covers is very short."
"Those two features give this document a basically pedagogic role, as the Ombudsman was no doubt aware when he was drafting it."
"Therefore, apart from serving as an instrument of information and as a balance sheet, Mr Södermann's report makes an important contribution to our knowledge both of the new European institution and of its objectives and the means of access to it for bringing about its intervention."
"But in spite of the short period covered by the report, Mr Södermann's previous experience as Ombudsman in Finland has enabled him to present us with a remarkable ethical study on actions taken, which rightly lead Mrs Ahern, in the excellent report she presents on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, to congratulate Mr Södermann on his interesting and detailed report."
"Special mention should be made of the considerations put forward by the European Ombudsman with regard to his relations with the Committee on Petitions on the basis of a clear definition of the scope of the powers of each, laying the foundations for a fruitful collaboration which in practice has already begun, as Mr Newman, who speaks with greater authority than I do, has reminded us."
"Everything shows, Madam President, that this new parliamentary institution set up in the Maastricht agreements, has started off in the right direction."
"Now, in the fresh modification of the Treaties expected at the outcome of the present Intergovernmental Conference, we must progress to a more open and democratic operation of all the European institutions, as Mrs Ahern's report states in its conclusions."
"Finally, Madam President, it is appropriate to say that, if Mr Södermann's report is widely publicized, it will not only help to put an effective instrument in the hands of European citizens in the event of possible cases of maladministration in the European field, but it will in addition help to widen and consolidate the identity of European citizenship."
"For all those reasons I think the European Parliament must express its entire agreement with the contents of the European Ombudsman's First Annual Report and must encourage Mr Södermann to keep on working with the same sensitivity and the same meticulousness as he has done so far."
"Madam President, I must extend my congratulations and those of the Green Group to the European Ombudsman, Mr Sönderman, for his report, and also to Ms Ahern for the report she has presented on behalf of the Committee on Petitions."
"This first report by the Ombudsman clarifies, albeit within the limits of the period during which he was in office last year, those problems which citizens might encounter in seeking access to this new body of the European Union."
"I wish also to stress the importance of the interaction between the European Ombudsman and the European Parliament via its Committee on Petitions in guaranteeing those rights of citizens which these two Institutions are required to protect."
"This is an important step towards the concept of European citizenship and also a way of guaranteeing transparency and the proper functioning of the institutions of our European administration."
"The concept of citizenship is, as we know, also being considered by the Intergovernmental Conference that is currently under way, and I think it important for the purpose of giving specific definition to this concept of European citizenship that the Ombudsman's report should be presented to the Intergovernmental Conference which should then take it properly into consideration."
"I therefore think we should make an effort to make all Europe's citizens aware of the possibility they have of approaching both the Ombudsman, by petitioning him, or Parliament, by submitting a petition to the committee set up for that purpose."
"I think it important to explain to Europe's citizens when it is appropriate to approach the Ombudsman and when to approach the Committee on Petitions."
"That is something we should all try to do and that is why the Greens are completely in favour of and will be voting for this report."
"Madam President, I too would like to congratulate the Ombudsman on this first report."
"Admittedly, three months is far too short a period to draw up an initial balance sheet for what is a completely new activity for our institutions."
"Even so, I think it is worth emphasizing a number of points that clearly suggest that the citizens of the Union will have access to an independent, transparent yet discreet institution to which they can turn in the event of a conflict with the European administration and when they feel their rights have been infringed."
"Mrs Ahern, in her excellent report, carefully analyses these three conditions, and I approve her efforts without reservation, especially when she outlines the cooperation that will need to exist between the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman."
"That leaves, Mr Söderman, the massive problem of informing the public, creating public awareness, of this new institution whose work you are pioneering today."
"This seems to me to be the most important factor."
"First, a suggestion."
"Would you not agree that we could make things easier for those who want to apply to you by enabling them to do so through the channels provided by the new technologies?"
"My group has tabled an amendment to that effect, and I hope honourable Members will support it."
"I believe that by enabling citizens and residents of the Union to address the Ombudsman telematically we shall make it easier for them, in practice, to exercise their rights."
"It would be a step forward - an advance."
"In any case, providing information to Europe's citizens on the institution you represent is a major factor and I must admit that I myself would like to have more information on how you are planning to publicize your service to that public."
"I know, Mr Söderman, that you have had some experience of this function in your own country, but it would be unfortunate to see your strengths changed into weaknesses because Europe's citizens have neither the experience nor the knowledge of the institution of mediation that they were able to acquire in their own Member States."
"However, the institution of an Ombudsman and his recognition have a very important part to play in the emergence of that European citizenship which is so close to our hearts."
"And Articles 8(d), 138(d) and (e) of our Treaty will only really justify their existence if European citizens become aware that their institutions - of which, incidentally, they know very little - can also safeguard them against maladministration or injustice."
"Now, you have a leading part to play."
"Remember that you are the first Ombudsman, and that as such it is up to you to give that fine institution its initial image."
"However, Mr Söderman, we have no doubt that you are fully aware of that responsibility."
"Madam President, Mr Söderman, ladies and gentlemen, although the first report by the European Ombudsman covers a period of only three months it does supply us with some very useful indications about this new institution and about the way in which Mr Söderman intends to fulfil his mandate, with the benefit of his experience as a national Ombudsman."
"I am particularly pleased by the close cooperation that is developing between the Ombudsman and Parliament's Committee on Petitions."
"Even so, there is one question I would like to raise which is of the greatest interest to me: where is the Ombudsman going to exercise his function?"
"At the time of his election, Mr Söderman clearly stated his intention of basing his secretariat in Strasbourg, the seat of the European Parliament."
"This decision was in line with the spirit of the Treaties."
"Yet we have now learnt, a few days ago, that the Ombudsman has asked the Committee on Budgets to increase his operating budget by 150 %, virtually doubling his staff from 10 to 17 jobs."
"It would be easy enough to understand this increase, ladies and gentlemen, if it occurred in the course of the normal growth of his activities, but it seems that the real purpose of this request is gradually to transfer the office of the Ombudsman from Strasbourg to Brussels, opening up a second secretariat in the Belgian capital from 1997."
"So, as I know that Mr Söderman is to give a press conference very shortly, I would like to know whether this step really does form part of his intentions and what the reasons for it are."
"If this trend were to become established, ladies and gentlemen, we would once again be seeing an anomaly in the matter of the seat and of the institutions and organs of the European Union, and in that case my group would be firmly opposed to it."
"Madam President, the European ombudsman, Mr Jacob Söderman, states in his concluding remarks to the annual activity report for last year currently under discussion, that the formal duties and the qualifications of the Ombudsman are only one factor in a process whose object is to guarantee that the advantages of an open, democratic and responsible administration are made available to European citizens."
"In his opinion the Ombudsman and his office can succeed in this only if the Community's bodies and institutions are totally committed to these principles and to co-operation with the Ombudsman."
"Having read these documents I conclude that the Ombudsman believes that such a commitment has already been made, even though his term of office is still too short to make a reasoned assessment."
"The European Ombudsman deals particularly with maladministration."
"From this point of view he has the opportunity to bring his influence to bear on the development of sound administration."
"It is the constitutional right of each citizen of the Union to file complaints with the Ombudsman concerning the activities of Community bodies and institutions, if the complainant feels that he has been subject to neglect, carelessness, faulty advice, procedural fault, discrimination, unnecessary delay or unfair action."
"The annual activity report clearly states how the Ombudsman's office works and what citizens should do if they want to take matters to the Ombudsman for consideration."
"The Ombudsman's policy of advising and guiding citizens is positive and especially important during the first stages of a new institution."
"The proposal of the rapporteur concerning widespread distribution of the annual activity report in the Member States should be supported."
"The guidebook written by the Ombudsman serves the same purpose."
"It is excellent news that the guidebook has been published so soon, and its content is in my view good."
"I feel that we should encourage citizens of the European Union and also citizens from outside the Union staying in the area as well as enterprises, associations and communities in the Union to familiarize themselves with the Ombudsman institution and if necessary to use the services it provides."
"I would also like to point out that the activity report reflects the Ombudsman's search for co-operation."
"An absolute precondition for reliability is that the Ombudsman in his activity is independent."
"Despite this, co-operation is also required."
"Parliament should support the Ombudsman in his work."
"I would like to congratulate the committee and thank the Ombudsman for his valuable efforts."
"Madam President, the Ombudsman Mr Jacob Söderman's first annual activity report is, as Mrs Ahern points out in her report, most interesting and informative."
"The annual report should definitely be circulated as widely as possible, since it includes a clear description of the area of authority of the European Ombudsman and thus forms an important source of information for all citizens."
"Since for practical reasons it will probably not be possible to distribute the annual activity report widely, it is much appreciated that the Ombudsman as one of his first tasks has prepared a guidebook on 'How to complain to the European Ombudsman?' to be distributed to all citizens."
"The guidebook has been published in all Community languages, and is available both at the national ombudsmen's offices and at Community offices."
"Increased information will rapidly lead to more complaints."
"This is a fact that should be taken into consideration when resources are allocated."
"From the point of view of legal protection it is essential that the complainant receives a reply within a reasonable time."
"Therefore the Ombudsman's office should have personnel in proportion to the amount of complaints."
"The Ombudsman's office is located in Strasbourg, but the Ombudsman hopes to get an additional office, with staff, in Brussels."
"The statistics concerning complaints from March 1996 shows that of 86 complaints taken up for consideration 78 concerned the European Commission."
"It would therefore seem natural to have the Ombudsman's office in Brussels, even if Parliament's official domicile is Strasbourg."
"The list of tasks to be performed by the Ombudsman states that it is his duty to continue to implement efficiently citizens' rights at all levels of Union administration and a openness of the work carried out by Community bodies and institutions."
"The first annual activity report suggests that good results will be achieved in both areas."
"Madam president, I agree that the Ombudsman's report is important. I think, though, that his initiative to promote transparency is not enough to solve the problems that could compromise the importance of his action vis-à-vis European citizens."
"The first aspect concerns limitations stemming from the Treaty. Indeed, the Ombudsman has no powers to assess those acts of Member States that are tantamount to maladministration of Community law."
"The second aspect concerns the public visibility of the Ombudsman, Mr Söderman, and his linkage with national Ombudsmen and national parliaments."
"The people of our countries must be able to see that there is an Ombudsman and that he can receive their complaints."
"This is vital."
"I think that the fact that the Ombudsman and his department are stranded in Strasbourg, far away from the other Community institutions and their day-today operations, and from the European press specialising in Community affairs, will do nothing to help that visibility."
"Mr Söderman, I wish you all the best in your new job and, in particular, as a Portuguese Member of this Parliament, I hope that you will deal properly with your first Portuguese cases, because the way in which you deal with them will be important for convincing the people of my country that it is worthwhile calling on your services."
"Madam President, I think that democracy in the European Union was improved and its citizens' rights safeguarded when it was decided in the Maastricht Treaty to create the European Ombudsman as an institution."
"The Ombudsman is vital if we are to ensure that our citizens are more closely associated with the Union and that they can present their grievances when they feel they are being wronged."
"With the appointment by the European Parliament of Mr Söderman from Finland, I believe we have chosen very much the right man for the job."
"Mr Söderman has only been in office for a short while."
"He has dealt with 131 of the 298 complaints which he received in 1995."
"On the other hand, I think that it is a matter of some concern that 80 % of these 131 cases had to be dismissed because they did not relate to matters falling within the Ombudsman's terms of reference."
"It is essential for our citizens to be aware of the Ombudsman's existence, and I therefore fully support the rapporteur's proposal for the Ombudsman's report to be distributed widely."
"Finally, I would call on all the EU institutions and others to show respect for the Ombudsman, and to demonstrate all the willingness to cooperate which is needed for his work."
"Madam President, I, too, wish to thank and congratulate Mr Söderman."
"I congratulate him for presenting us, initially in the Committee on Petitions and now here, with a report which is painstaking, comprehensive, analytic and helpful."
"I must not forget also to mention the important contribution of Mrs Ahern, our rapporteur, in presenting us with her report which we approved unanimously in the Committee on Petitions."
"I venture to describe this report, in a word, as historic, because it is the first report submitted to the European Parliament by the first European Ombudsman."
"I believe that the account it provides, together with the actions initiated by the Ombudsman and the presence and influence that he has brought to bear since the post was introduced, vindicate and re-endorse the confidence shown by the European Parliament and give the best possible guarantee of the institution's future."
"The institution is totally consistent with and fundamental to the ideal of the European Union; because, in the final analysis, it is the European Union that concerns us, rather than the individual institutions."
"In my view, the confirmed, fundamental right of the European citizen to submit a petition and the real entitlement to direct participation and influence via the bringing of life's experiences to the European Union's attention for the purpose of achieving change are two hugely important pillars."
"I, also, agree that, for these reasons, the institution must be given publicity and made more widely known."
"Not as a pretext for boosting our prestige, but in order that we can demonstrate convincingly that we are fighting for full democracy in the European Union."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"Traffic in radioactive substances"
"The next item is the report (A4-0066/96) by Mr Schulz, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the illicit traffic in radioactive substances and nuclear materials (COM(94)0383 - C4-0227/94)."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in presenting this report today I have come to the end of a very major undertaking."
"I drew up this report following a communication from the Commission on the illicit traffic in radioactive substances and nuclear materials in the European Union."
"Let me say from the outset that the Commission report is incomplete."
"It is tendentious and does not match up to the real threat posed by illicit traffic in nuclear materials in the European Union."
"For this traffic supposedly and allegedly occurs not just in the European Union but worldwide."
"My job - and I have considered the question in depth - was to establish what the real situation is."
"Is it indeed the case that nuclear material is constantly being stolen in all CIS and Central and Eastern European nuclear facilities?"
"Is it indeed the case that organized crime, terrorists, are those most involved in procuring themselves these nuclear materials?"
"Is it really the case that there is a flourishing traffic in these materials, which allows organized crime to make a great deal of money?"
"The answer is that this may be the case but it is scarcely possible to prove it."
"I am saying that from the outset because we must draw a distinction between fact and fiction when we look at the question of illicit traffic in nuclear materials."
"We must distinguish between fiction, such as science fiction and thrillers, and the description of fact."
"The first area, science fiction, is no doubt more interesting than prosaic fact."
"However it is to the latter that I will devote particular attention today."
"There are real potential threats that must not be ignored but have to be taken seriously."
"Criminal elements appear again and again, there are constant attempts by dubious business people to procure plutonium, uranium or some other nuclear material and to sell it to whoever is interested in order to make themselves money."
"But is this so easy to do?"
"Can a Spanish, German or Italian criminal just take a quick trip to Russia, fill his suitcase full of plutonium, fly off to another country and open his case at some black market and say: ' take a look inside, I've got 400 grammes of plutonium in there, you can have it for DM 2 million' ?"
"That is not possible!"
"Why not?"
"Who in this Chamber, except perhaps Mr Gmelin, is able to tell plutonium from household dust at a glance?"
"What gun-runner, with no scientific knowledge, is in a position to say just like that: ' this is highly enriched, weapons-grade uranium' ?"
"Who is in a position to set up this kind of deal with the necessary equipment and scientific knowledge?"
"The target group we had to investigate, i.e., ordinary organized crime, which attempted to deal in these materials in the European Union, was not in a position to do so, because it had neither the necessary scientific training nor the necessary technical know-how needed for concluding deals of that kind."
"That leads to an important insight."
"Traffic in these materials is only interesting for buyers who really have the necessary technical and scientific know-how for then achieving a certain objective with the material they have bought."
"We have to devote particular attention to them, for these interested buyers do exist."
"There are of course countries that want to by-pass the Non-Proliferation Treaty and carry out nuclear weapons programmes."
"They will of course attempt to procure material for carrying out their illegal nuclear weapons programmes by any means they can."
"They may also procure it in the grey area between legal, state action and illegal criminal activity."
"The secret services normally operate in that grey area."
"Let me say that quite plainly!"
"I only wonder what would induce a country that is setting up an illegal nuclear weapons programme to instruct a bunch of criminals to procure plutonium in the Central and Eastern European countries or the CIS states and then actually to smuggle it through a country like the Federal German Republic which has high-level technical precautions at the airports, the ports and the borders, where there are authorities, where there are institutions that have the necessary technical equipment for checking whether someone has radioactive material, when at the same time a human life is only worth a few paltry dollars at the border between Afghanistan and Russia."
"It would be far easier for a country such as Iraq or Iran to smuggle such material across the Khyber Pass than through a German airport."
"That brings us to an important fact: this traffic exists!"
"It exists without any doubt at all in the sphere of the secret services, otherwise countries like Pakistan or India would not have been able to gain possession of nuclear weapons after circumventing the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty!"
"Yet this traffic probably does not exist in the form described in the Commission communication or by Member State governments and interested journalists."
"Of course it is a threat if criminals get hold of plutonium or uranium or terrorist organizations procure themselves these materials in order to threaten the state."
"Of course it is a threat if a sect such as the Aum-Shinriko sect in Japan, for instance, with its apocalyptic fantasies, procures materials which could poison the groundwater of a town of more than a million inhabitants or which could pose a huge threat by dispersion in the air or by fire."
"That is why we must do our utmost to close down the potential sources of danger; these are indeed the nuclear facilities in the former Central and Eastern European states and the CIS states, where some nuclear technicians have not been paid for two years and are therefore susceptible to corruption."
"At the same time they are of course the people who know what substances are available and how to handle them and offer them for sale."
"That is why we must do our utmost to close down that source."
"But given that we must do utmost to close down that source I wonder, as I said in my report, why the Commission produces a communication which rightly describes these scenarios as they are, while at the same time we read in the draft budget that the staff, financial and technical standards, which urgently need raising, are to be cut by 30 %!"
"Let the Commission explain that."
"That is certainly the wrong place to economize."
"But we also need a realistic assessment of what is happening."
"I produced a statistic in my report which I know the right-hand side of this House in particular will try not to have included in the report, and I am rather surprised that one is not even allowed to give statistics any more."
"But let me give you one. The Institute for Transuranium, i.e., the Euratom analysis centre in Karlsruhe, has investigated 34 cases of seized nuclear material."
"Since 1991 the police has seized radioactive material in 34 cases and then handed it over to the Institute for Transuranium for analysis."
"One not so dramatic case was recorded in Belgium, 3 cases in Italy and 30 cases in the Federal Republic of Germany."
"That means that to date not a single seizure of radioactive material has been recorded in 12 Member States of the European Union."
"Some of the 30 cases in Germany are so dramatic that I want to describe one of them to you."
"A suitcase is checked with a Geiger counter and the customs officer says: ' it's registering, this is radioactive' ."
"Then the case is opened and smoke alarms are found from sprinkler systems in the former GDR."
"For some of these alarms were equipped with plutonium in preparation for the nuclear weapons programme."
"Then the newspaper headlines read: ' more nuclear material find, another case of smuggling!'"
"Some dodgy character has procured these smoke alarm rods, packed a whole lot of them into a suitcase and pretended he had something to sell."
"Dangerous as it is to ignore a real threat, it is just as dangerous to misrepresent a real threat."
"That is why it is urgently necessary for the Commission, for us as Parliament, but also for the governments of the Member States to point out where the real threat lies."
"There is no point in the German secret service, working with the criminal investigation office of the Federal Land of Bavaria, instructing Spanish criminals to fly to Russia, as happened in the case of Munich, and then to import plutonium into the Federal Republic, so that the same police officers who gave these criminals their orders can then arrest them and can go before the public and say: ' Look, we have got a grip on the illicit market in nuclear materials' ."
"That is totally counterproductive and does not help us really to clarify matters."
"The way to clarify matters is to show them as they really are."
"I have tried to do so."
"But we cannot accept one Member State government treating such a serious matter as casually as it has done."
"Some people carrying 400 grammes of plutonium in a Samsonite suitcase flew from Moscow to Munich in a Lufthansa plane with several hundred passengers, and no-one told the people in Munich or the passengers on that plane what a threat they were facing because plutonium happens not to be household dust."
"Plutonium is an extremely dangerous material and I cannot understand why a government that did not inform Euratom about this incident at the right time, although it should have done so, and then actually asserts it had informed Euratom, should not be asked by the Commission: ' What did you do about it?"
"Did you really circumvent European law and put several hundred people at risk simply to ensure that your political calculation of what was only an apparently accurate representation of a real threat worked out?'"
"I have tried to present a detailed report on the real threats, together with comprehensive proposals on how to deal with them."
"I would ask you to endorse my report and the amendments."
"Mr President, there can be no doubt that illicit trafficking in radioactive substances and nuclear materials is both wrong and a cause for concern, which this report rightly addresses."
"Yet it must also be a cause for regret that instead of focusing on the main issue this report has sought to widen the debate by including matters of national defence policy which are not within the competence of this Parliament, by attacking the competence of a Member State in the justice field and by using this as an opportunity, yet again, to open up a more general anti-nuclear debate."
"This report contains some very questionable assertions about both scientific and legal matters."
"I welcome the amendments brought forward to remove many of them."
"Most of all I welcome those amendments which remove references to the military stocks and defence competences of EU Member States."
"Not even this report is suggesting that any illicit trafficking originates in the EU in connection with Member States' stocks."
"The problem originates outside the EU."
"And by the way, that means outside our competence."
"So it seems silly to try to link external problems with Member State competence in defence and security."
"As to some of the scientific assertions I believe there is a sizeable body of opinion that would challenge the view expressed in Recital C. And there is certainly a widespread view in the industry that would disagree with the view in Paragraph 3 concerning MOX fuel."
"I note in the list of recommendations in the report for action there is a call for the Commission to reorganize the internal structure of those of its departments responsible for nuclear matters."
"I wonder how many times this call has gone out to the Commission for other issues and just what chaos might ensue within the Commission if all such suggestions were implemented."
"In conclusion, let me reiterate the risk that we run as a Parliament if we dilute our effort by not concentrating on the main issue and insist on poking our nose into matters which are not our competence."
"The risk is that Parliament will continue to be taken less seriously than it should be and will not gain any additional powers in the IGC."
"Mr President, it was with some surprise that I listened to the previous speakers, in view of the fact that the opinion of the committee which in the first instance has responsibility for foreign affairs and security policy was adopted unanimously."
"In that unanimous opinion we state, among other things, that there would naturally be a greater incentive to abolish nuclear weapons if those states which possess such weapons undertook to destroy their own nuclear arsenals."
"We also say that all states should naturally refrain from nuclear weapons testing pending international agreement on a total test ban."
"As regards nuclear power, we also state that over and above this, bearing in mind the ecological risks entailed in nuclear power, it is the whole way of producing energy which should be changed."
"This will be the major task of the next century."
"So this was the view taken by a committee which is primarily responsible not for environmental and energy issues but for foreign policy aspects."
"I have read with considerable interest the record of attendance for the meeting at which we unanimously backed it."
"The list includes Mr Matutes, Mrs Carrère d'Encausse, Mrs Aelvoet, Mr Bertens, Mr Caccavale, Mr Colajanni, Mr Goerens, Mr Von Habsburg, Mr König, Mrs Lenz, Mr McGowan, Mr Poettering, Mr Sakellariou, Mr Viola and myself."
"These include quite a number of Members who in other contexts would perhaps have adopted different standpoints."
"When I then see that Mr Schultz's main report has been adopted by only 12 votes for and 2 against, with 16 abstentions, I begin to wonder a little about how the decision-making system in this parliament operates."
"One must surely be able to assume that Members who participated in a unanimous report did not sleep through the entire proceedings but actually support it."
"I trust that they will act accordingly in the vote here today too."
"Mr President, I wish to compliment Mr Schulz not only on the quality of his report but also on his presentation this morning, which was excellent."
"Surely the future well-being of the human race is within the competence of this Parliament?"
"I want to see the world which my granddaughter will inherit handed over in a better form than it is just now."
"I believe we should deal with the threats we face."
"Without any doubt there has been, as Mr Schulz said, a disturbing and dramatic rise in the number of documented cases of illicit traffic in nuclear materials."
"What remains unreported or unknown is anybody's guess."
"But what is clear is that serious questions have to be raised about the effectiveness of international controls over nuclear materials."
"I listened very intently to what the Commission said in response to the calls for action which Mr Schulz outlines in his report."
"I just wish to take this opportunity to return to a question I asked the Commission recently regarding allegations that nuclear materials covered by safeguards at the ITREC facility near Rotondella in southern Italy were illegally removed from that facility."
"Now that is not in the former USSR, it is part of the European Union!"
"I would be extremely interested to know if the Commission could provide me with any further update on that situation, primarily because this incident typifies some of the concerns we have about the nuclear industry."
"First among these is public information."
"A well-informed public is one of the greatest safeguards we could possibly hope for."
"So information about storage, transport or processing must be in the public domain."
"Secondly, this close and dubious relationship between the nuclear and the civil nuclear industries: the very genesis of the civil nuclear industry was in the nuclear industry and the blanket of national security still weighs heavily there."
"We should lift that blanket and let some light in."
"Thirdly, the risks associated with radioactive substances which are not covered by safeguards: there is a case to be made for re-examining the controls over these particular substances."
"In conclusion, I plead for more active cooperation between nations and for more stringent and effective international controls in order to contain some of the gravest threats we face."
"Mr Schulz's report has opened our eyes to some of these threats and we must act on it now."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the charm of Mr Schulz's statements lies in their inconsistency."
"On the one hand Mr Schulz rightly pointed out that international crime is one of the greatest threats of the present and the future, on the other hand he tried to play down its importance in an unacceptable manner for internal political motives."
"In my view his statements today have made this very plain, because he keeps confusing the fire-fighters with the arsonists."
"Of course secret services operate in the grey area, because it is only in the grey area that they can pick up the criminal elements operating there."
"The statistic he gave is therefore most informative, which is why I am glad he produced it, even if I do not endorse the way he worded his proposal."
"It is informative because it proves that middle Europe, i.e., the countries along the former iron curtain, are particularly exposed to cross-frontier bands of criminals and nuclear crime."
"That is why we should be glad that the German and Austrian security services, like the Hungarian, Czech and Polish security services, are making particular efforts to control this crime, and we should be grateful that the Bavarian police and the Bavarian Minister of the Interior, Mr Beckstein, have taken up this challenge and thereby done a service to the European Union as a whole."
"In this area Bavaria is quite definitely in the front line of the fight against international crime on behalf of the entire European Union and if you try to knock the security services that can only destabilize these police forces who do such excellent work, which has long since been the practice in the regions of North-Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony, as we have seen from the internal security situation there."
"This is a most important subject."
"It is a European subject, and that is why I am sorry that you have dragged it down to the level of internal politics with your proposals."
"It is a threat!"
"Attali spoke of hundreds of cases of nuclear smuggling in a report for the United Nations."
"The United Nations is assuming that Russia and many former CIS states are not in a position legally or in terms of staffing to combat the spread of this crime."
"That is why we must endeavour to do so."
"It was not just some flight of the imagination that persuaded the Council, the individual Member States and the Commission to increase and coordinate their efforts and to discuss an increase in funding."
"That is why we do support your operative proposals, which are in stark contrast to the opinions you are disseminating here for demagogical reasons."
"You know full well that it is necessary to combat international crime on a European basis, and that is the purpose of our amendments and those by Mr Caccavale."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by thanking Mr Schulz for his report and for the great commitment he has shown in dealing with this issue."
"Just how much detailed work he has devoted to it is clear from range of documentation and statistics which indicate to us the scale of the problem."
"On the other hand, I have also to share in part the reservations expressed by some of those who spoke earlier."
"I think that the report has moved a little beyond what is strictly within the area of competence of the House and the committee which has produced the document."
"In point of fact the subject-matter of the report - I remind you that the title of the document is 'the illicit traffic in radioactive substances and nuclear materials' - has been extended to cover what are really energy and defence policies."
"That clearly does not mean that the problems are not linked."
"I realize, as Mr Schulz says, that the problem involves not only nuclear materials as such but the question of experts, particularly from the former Soviet Union, who are smuggling their experience in this field around the world as well as the technologies."
"In my view, furthermore, there is no precise list detailing the problem."
"We do not in fact know how many people there are posing this great threat that is spreading throughout the world, nor can we identify them."
"And it really is a great threat because many of the countries that lack proper democratic control are likely to pose a serious and very great threat to us and to the future of humanity, as a result of the traffic in those materials and the development of nuclear powers."
"Nor can we hide away behind the fact that this is now a major business."
"And to consider that it can be resolved by making proclamations seems to me to be an absolute non-starter."
"We have to realize that this is a difficult form of trafficking, that sales are not as easy as in the case of drugs, for example."
"It is therefore plain that attitude of the secret services has an important part to play."
"I believe that it is our responsibility, the responsibility of the democratic countries represented in this House, and the Members of this House to secure scrupulous monitoring of this activity, this grey area involving the secret services."
"The problem cannot just be one of organized crime!"
"Mr President, up to now there have not been any real accidents as a result of illicit dealings in nuclear materials but just imagine if nuclear materials got into the hands of a dictator or a terrorist group bent on mischief, then there would be every chance of a disaster."
"That means that we have to do everything possible to prevent trafficking in nuclear materials and, if it happens, to combat it."
"The Liberal Group believes that today's debate must focus on this, and that our debate and the resolution too must not address the pros and cons of nuclear energy as such, as I have just been hearing from the Green Group."
"Mr President, it goes without saying that we must help the countries of Eastern Europe to solve their problems in this regard."
"The resolution quite rightly calls on the European Commission to tell us what the financial implications of that support for Eastern Europe are and Parliament is entitled to be informed of them."
"Mr President, in connection with measures to counter trafficking I will say just one word: Europol."
"In the Internal Affairs Committee it seemed as if we were holding a German domestic political debate and I have to say in all honesty that I do not care over much for the high tone taken by our honourable friends, the German Members."
"The subject is far too important."
"The European Parliament must not meddle in German domestic politics but we must have a European Parliament resolution because if we do not Parliament will have achieved nothing and the matter is far too serious to allow that to happen."
"Mr President, the discussion on the illicit traffic in radioactive material in fact raises far more questions than we have answers to at present."
"First, we keep just hearing about the sellers."
"Who and where are the buyers?"
"Where there are sellers there are also buyers."
"Secondly, it is unclear why on earth 30 out of the 35 cases - for we have to include the recent seizure in a garage in Bavaria of 277 kg of highly enriched uranium - have occurred in Germany."
"Does that mean that the German police are particularly good or that the market there is particularly large?"
"Or are the police not so efficient in other countries?"
"Third question: how is it that the German Federal Government says that it informed Euratom on 27 July while Euratom says it was informed on 10 August, namely when the aircraft arrived?"
"There is something odd here."
"The call for the use of Europol misses the point."
"Let me remind you that by law nuclear material comes under the control of Euratom."
"So Euratom Safeguards must at last be put in a staffing and financial position that enables it finally to carry out proper controls."
"We are rightly upset at the 400 g of plutonium, but we have tonnes of plutonium in England and France."
"In France there are 265 facilities with nuclear material, only 116 of them can be inspected by Euratom, of which 30 are so-called mixed facilities, meaning facilities used for civil and military purposes, which we have to deduct too, of which France can say: ' No, not today' ."
"And there are 103 facilities in which only foreign material, i.e., nuclear material from foreign countries, is stored."
"And another thing: the IAEA can only inspect one facility per year in France."
"Surely that is the real scandal!"
"So we must make the following demand: the disclosure by all nuclear states of all their civil and military fissile material and of course a complete stop to the further use of plutonium and a stop to this senseless transportation from one country to another."
"That is the real, genuine threat in Europe, and I have not even mentioned the CIS states yet."
"We only have a vague inkling of this threat."
"We should have spent far more money on this area in order to enable the Euratom Safeguards departments to be up to date."
"They have to live on crumbs, with which they cannot carry out any controls."
"Mr President, the Commission communication gives a balanced account of how the collapse of the Soviet Union has created a dangerous situation with regard to the illicit trading of nuclear substances."
"In a structured manner the Commission explores ways in which the Union can tackle these problems."
"Mr Schulz's report, however, is downright disappointing."
"Instead of a report containing valuable recommendations to the Commission, we have a chaotic document in which all manner of irrelevant hobbyhorses are ridden to death."
"Insistence on nuclear disarmament, the ending of nuclear energy policy, insinuations against the German police."
"As a result the Committee on Civil Liberties approved the report by only the slightest of margins, which ought not in principle to be the case in matters dealing with this issue."
"Significantly, the Socialist Group only decided to vote in favour of the report once it became apparent that the Christian Democrats would be abstaining."
"Because, I ask you, who is there in this House who is not anxious to counter the illicit trading of nuclear substances?"
"A broadly based resolution should not be a problem and would certainly enhance the credibility of Parliament."
"Regretfully I have to say that the present resolution in no way meets that need."
"I hope that all its shortcomings will be rectified as a result of the amendments, but if not I shall certainly be voting against this report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Schulz's report contains some interesting points."
"Yes, the traffic in nuclear materials represents a deadly danger; yes, that traffic has grown alarmingly since the break-up of the Soviet Union."
"But we should not conclude from that that it was the USSR that was preserving Europe from the atomic threat."
"After all, we have nuclear power stations in danger of exploding, atomic submarines in the North Sea, tons of radioactive wastes discharged into the oceans - and all these things are the work of the Communists who held power until 1991."
"Today, other countries are in the process of providing themselves with atomic weapons, notably Iran - a terrorist state - aided by the old Communist nomenklatura."
"The American Government, too, bears some responsibility for this process."
"The Gulf War has destroyed Iraq, the only power in that region capable of counterbalancing the power of the Ayatollahs in Tehran."
"So the scale of the risk is significant, and it was the Front National which, during the 1970s, was the first political party in France to caution governments against their all-nuclear policy."
"Yet, in an increasingly dangerous world where new atomic powers are coming into existence, the protection of our nations depends, sir, on the acquisition of a credible nuclear deterrent, a civil defence system comparable to that enjoyed by the Swiss, and the reestablishment of border controls."
"Mr Schulz, in his report, recommends the nuclear disarmament of France and the United Kingdom."
"This is a far cry from trafficking in nuclear materials."
"He also passes over civil defence, and of course when he talks about borders he means the borders of the Europe of Maastricht."
"Moreover, the desire to give extended powers to the Commission and to Euratom is inspired by the same philosophy."
"On the pretext of a threat on a global scale, the Member States are to be deprived of their powers in favour of supranational institutions."
"Well, today we have the crisis of mad cow disease, which is first and foremost a failure on the part of the Commission, to serve as a dramatic illustration of the inability of Europe's institutions to protect the public, and the threat represented by the unrestricted opening of our borders."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the spectre of international organized crime is one of the greatest challenges facing all the Member States of the European Union."
"In the past it was traffic in human beings and drugs, and now it is increasingly also traffic in nuclear materials, which is of course also encouraged by countries that want to procure themselves nuclear weapons by illicit means."
"The problem is a very serious one."
"The Commission has presented a good communication."
"But the discussion will be brought into discredit if it is used for internal policy purposes and distorted into a kind of story time or unworldly energy policy."
"That is of course totally unworldly and does not take account of the fact that in the view of most of the countries in the world, without nuclear energy it is simply not possible to satisfy the energy requirements of a world that is growing by 260 000 inhabitants a day."
"And that is why 55 nuclear plants are currently under construction."
"But that is not the issue here."
"In 1992 Parliament proposed international monitoring plans, the classification of certain acts as a serious form of international crime and the training of experts."
"The Commission's recommendations and Parliament's discussions follow the same line: secure storage, accurate monitoring, early detection, identification and prosecution, specialist technical assistance for the countries mainly affected, stocktaking, accounting and monitoring."
"In other words a transparent system, together with cooperation between Member States on safety technology and of course building up Europol."
"Let me draw particular attention to paragraphs 11 and 14 of the conclusions of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, which points out that the incentives can be reduced by offering scientists opportunities to apply their expertise to peaceful activities."
"In particular, plutonium must be rendered harmless by conversion into MOX fuel elements."
"We can expect 100 tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium from disarmament over the next few years."
"It has to be reprocessed and made safe."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Schulz on his report this morning and his presentation and for pointing out to us the problems that we have in this area."
"It is horrifying to think that substances such as high-grade plutonium could get into the wrong hands, like those of terrorists and criminals; it is appalling to think of the spectre of nuclear explosive devices being available to them."
"We have the concern in Ireland that there are millions of tonnes of plutonium available in the UK and naturally enough it is worrying for us."
"Furthermore, it is no secret that countries such as Iraq and North Korea have made attempts to obtain bomb-building capacity."
"So for all these reasons it is important to guarantee that we control the supervisory measures over nuclear materials."
"It is well known - indeed Germany informed the International Conference - that 19 cases of thefts involving nuclear materials have been discovered over the last two years."
"Those were in Russia; but in addition the German authorities uncovered 267 cases involving either indirect traffic or fraudulent offers to sell nuclear substances in 1994, the most spectacular being the seizure of plutonium in Munich of course."
"The response of the Commission has been adequate in proposing to beef up the EURATOM Safeguards inspectorate and to develop closer links with the International Science and Technology Centre under the TACIS Programme."
"However, there is a need to improve the legal cooperation between Member States of the European Union and the Republics of the former Soviet Union to deal with the illicit trafficking of nuclear materials."
"This should come under the articles of Europol, the European police agency in The Hague."
"There is also the option of strengthening the controls of the European Union borders with Eastern Europe and finally, we should consider the formulation of various partnership agreements with the Eastern European States to deal with this issue."
"Joint action to help combat this growing problem could also be taken under the European Union's common foreign and security policy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by underlining that my group and I remain highly disturbed at the extent of the lack of reactor safety in the former USSR and the ineffective control of nuclear materials."
"That is why we are also concerned about the smuggling of nuclear materials and other radioactive substances."
"But we must certainly also endeavour to resolve this problem through cooperation with the Russian authorities and not through confrontation."
"However, my group finds a number of arguments incomprehensible and hard to understand."
"Firstly, the report does not distinguish clearly between questions of nuclear weapons proliferation and nuclear smuggling."
"The differences between the two questions should be made much clearer."
"Nor do we understand why the report postulates the abolition of nuclear energy while at the same time emphasizing the usefulness of plutonium for peaceful purposes in the European Union."
"In my view that is pure nonsense, for why should the reactors in the former USSR become safer, the nuclear materials be supervised better and the smuggling stop if the safe reactors in our country are shut down?"
"We are dealing here purely with problems in the former USSR, with problems which have indeed taken on dramatic dimensions."
"The countries of the former USSR, especially Russia, urgently need energy in order to survive, so they cannot abandon nuclear energy."
"At the same time, their control systems urgently need modernizing, since they are no longer able to ensure adequate supervision of the nuclear materials and radioactive substances."
"I discovered that myself a fortnight ago in Novosibirsk where I attended a conference on cooperation between Russia and Euratom on the control of nuclear materials and also had an opportunity to visit a Russian fuel elements factory."
"The situation is dramatic!"
"On the question of combating the threat of nuclear smuggling, my group calls for the Union to make every effort to link up the various executive authorities and thus finally to establish comprehensive cooperation."
"Furthermore, we call for closer cooperation with Russia on the prevention of nuclear smuggling."
"We must raise the necessary funds for this which, we believe, would be well invested."
"For it is without doubt cheaper and better to give full support to the Russian authorities concerned in their efforts to modernize or set up their control systems than for us here in the European Union to pick up the nuclear materials and other radioactive substances one by one."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from the viewpoint of a nuclear-free Member State the plain facts - I emphasize 'facts' - presented by the rapporteur look twice as serious."
"We are dealing here with what is no less than a European and international mega-problem."
"Combatting the illicit traffic in radioactive substances and nuclear materials is of course the concern of every country and should therefore be dealt with by the United Nations and be classified as a crime against humanity, as genocide was in the 1948 UN Convention."
"Given the growth of illicit nuclear trafficking, it still seems legitimate to ask whether the European Union should not regard it as an urgent task to endeavour to get out of the nuclear industry."
"At any rate, during the negotiations on the accession of new Member States, we will have to examine the safety aspect of their nuclear power stations very carefully indeed."
"Mr President, I will take less than two minutes."
"I would like to ask you to give me an opportunity to clarify something."
"I can just accept terms such as utter nonsense or similar interpretations, but not the word 'demagogical' for my statement!"
"That is why I would like to make a statement of fact that is not demagogical."
"Twelve Member States of our Union are not familiar with the problem of nuclear trafficking, three are."
"The police authorities of all three countries have confirmed to me as rapporteur that in no case could they establish the involvement of organized crime."
"That statement was made by the German, the Italian and the Belgian police."
"That is what I have to say on the subject of 'organized crime' and 'demagogy' ."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since my colleague Christos Papoutsis is not here, as he could not miss the Energy Council now being held in Luxembourg, and since the important decision on the first stage of liberalizing the energy market may perhaps be taken today, it falls to me, representing the Commission on his behalf, to reply to you on the most complex problems of trafficking in nuclear materials which may be used to manufacture atomic explosives and in other radioactive substances."
"As you know, since the outset the Commission has dealt - we think seriously - with this subject, as may be seen in the communication of 7 September 1994 to Parliament and the Council of Ministers, with which Mr Schulz's report deals."
"Since that first communication in September 1994, the Commission has spared no efforts to solve the problem and has had various opportunities to report, both in plenary sitting and in the relevant parliamentary committees, on the initiatives and measures it has been taking."
"Moreover following the presentation of Mr Schulz's report on 1 March 1996, the Commission adopted, on 19 April in the context of the G7 Summit at Moscow on nuclear security, a second communication addressed to the Council and to Parliament with regard to the application of the guidelines laid down in the previous communication and in the conclusions of the Essen European Council in December 1994."
"I should like to remind you here that the G7, at the Moscow Summit, agreed an ambitious programme for preventing and combating illicit traffic in nuclear material and made a call to the governments of other countries to join the G7 in implementing that programme."
"The Commission is already implementing, within the limit of its powers, the programme drawn up at the G7 Summit in Moscow."
"Against that background you will understand that the Commission has considered with great interest the report drawn up by the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs."
"In the first place the Commission would like to thank Parliament for its great interest and support in this matter and particularly congratulates the rapporteur, Mr Schulz, on the important work he has done in preparing this report."
"The Commission appreciates the great effort made by all honourable Members to make an in-depth analysis of the various aspects of a complex problem of world-wide importance."
"And on that point I should like to emphasize one aspect brought out in the speeches of Mr Schulz and others: naturally the Commission is very concerned about the question of the illicit traffic in atomic material; of course we are very concerned about it and obviously crime or rather the phenomenon of organized crime at world level does worry us - of course it does!"
"The Commission, then, approves Parliament's commitment and agrees with most of the passages in Mr Schulz's report calling for cooperation, coordination of measures, the effective use of resources and the rationalization of efforts."
"I can tell you that throughout recent years and to the extent of our financial limits - and within the bounds of our powers - the Commission has made profound endeavours to move in that direction."
"However, the Commission would also like to express its concern regarding certain information given in the report discussion today: first, it must be borne in mind, quite apart from the ideological or political view of each one of us, that the European Union plays a major rôle in the nuclear sector."
"One may be for or against the nuclear sector, as some honourable Members have pointed out; one may be for or against but the reality - at least for the Commission - is to make it clear that the European Union, at least in the nuclear sector, is a force to be reckoned with at world level."
"Secondly another feature of the European Union is that, as you know, apart from the predominantly civil nuclear energy sector, there is another sector of a military nature. All civil nuclear material is subject to the Commission's security control and is also to a large extent also subject to the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency in the 13 States which do not have nuclear weapons."
"Only control of military nuclear material has been expressly excluded according to the Euratom Treaty and the specific agreements with the IAEA."
"Nevertheless it must be pointed out that according to the Euratom Treaty all nuclear material outside the military sector is to be automatically included in the ambit of Euratom safeguards."
"The Commission's present thinking is that the system is working well and that history shows that illicit traffic has not arisen owing to the use of plutonium or highly-enriched uranium in the European Union."
"Of course the Commission agrees with the idea of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs of continuing to encourage nuclear disarmament and to process nuclear materials with high strategic value into other less dangerous materials, but the Commission has to consider all options and cannot exclude the possibility of recycling plutonium or highly-enriched uranium of military origin for use specifically in civil nuclear reactors."
"It is worth mentioning that whatever may be the final options - vitrification, transmutation, recycling, mixed oxide, - the appropriate safeguards will have to be maintained and even strengthened."
"The Commission has taken note, Mr Schulz, of your concern regarding the possible involvement of the secret services in illicit traffic in contraband."
"Without going into the details of this question, which has already been exhaustively debated in the committees, the Commission would like to stress that it has always complied strictly with the agreements in force made with the national authorities."
"And apart from this particular incident, faced with the constant rise in the number of cases of illicit traffic in general, which implies a considerable risk for the population and the environment, the Commission wishes to emphasize that we and the European Parliament need to be constantly working on this."
"For the moment and taking into account all the information available to the Commission, we are convinced that the origin of trafficking lies fundamentally in the serious economic situation of the former Soviet Union."
"So, although it needs a great effort - including sufficient human and financial resources - and although there are many practical difficulties, the Commission still believes that prevention through cooperation is called for."
"And on this point again, Mr Schulz, I should like to come up with another consideration of a political nature."
"If the basis is cooperation between all the Member States to control not only trafficking in nuclear material but also drugs and terrorism, we should have to ask how it is possible that although the need for cooperation is obvious, we should still not have approved to this very day the final Europol statute, because presumably Europol would be the very mechanism to make cooperation between the Member States effective."
"Consequently I think it is possible to agree on the objective and what we have to manage is to put the instruments for cooperation into force as soon as possible."
"There is one internal consideration regarding the Commission."
"Many of you have made it clear that this is a question which, because of its delicacy and importance, would need more material, human and financial resources."
"In view of the fact that the European Parliament is also the second branch of the budgetary authority, I can assure you that the Commission would be most gratified if the European Parliament were to take the initiative, within the budgetary margin, of increasing the funds available to provide the Commission with more officials and more logistic and more financial means."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be held at noon."
"Votes"
"Mr President, concerning paragraph 4 there is an alteration to amendment 5 which would read, following the oral amendment that everyone knows of, as follows: ' Urges that reductions in the fishing fleet should not depend only on reductions in vessels but also on active policies top defend fishery resources' ."
"This is the wording of my amendment on behalf of my group."
"Mr President, this oral addition does nothing to change the meaning of the paragraph, and we decided to reject it, not because of the merits of this amendment but because these same ideas can already be found in several other passages of the report."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I would ask that we not do proceed to the vote on the oral amendment."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, we have already overrun our time and we still have four motions for resolutions on the Schulz report."
"This report is most important and in view of the crumbling attendance here I request on behalf of my group that we vote on the Schulz report at the next part-session."
"I ask you to put that to the vote."
"Mr President, looking at the voting list I see that we currently do not have all that many votes still remaining, so that with a bit of goodwill we could well be finished by 1.30 p.m."
"Our Group thus prefers to complete the voting."
"Mr President, I find it unfortunate that we never manage to organize our voting time in a way that allows us to make best use of our sittings."
"In recent months we have repeatedly seen voting time extending far into the lunch break."
"I think we have to organize ourselves better."
"So I agree with the Socialist Group's suggestion that the Schulz report be voted on in two weeks' time at our next Brussels meeting."
"Mr President, it is very late in any case."
"I want to support the request by Mrs Hoff and Mr De Vries, for this report really is too important for us to try to get through it now."
"I too am in favour of voting on it during the next part-session."
"Mr President, if I understand correctly, the agenda which has been proposed for us provides for any unfinished morning votes to continue at 6 p.m."
"So I gather, Mr President, that a convenient slot is envisaged from 6 in the evening."
"The House will vote on the proposal that the vote on the Schulz report be postponed from this afternoon or from tomorrow morning to the Brussels part-session."
"(Parliament decided to postpone the vote)"
"Mr President, the same obviously applies to the Titley report as to the Schulz report."
"However, I would have nothing against our continuing the vote through to the end now."
"The House will vote on the proposal that voting continue on the Giansily and Titley reports."
"(Parliament agreed to the proposal)"
"I want to take what has been expected of us again today, namely to work here for hours and then not to vote, as an opportunity to request that we finally reinstate voting time on Thursday evening."
"We will not be able to do our parliamentary work here properly without that voting time."
"I ask you to put this to the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents."
"The Nordic passport union which has been in existence for just over forty years has functioned excellently."
"The Nordic countries have abolished passport requirements for their citizens, but not border controls."
"The Nordic passport union should not be put at risk for the sake of such a hazardous undertaking as accession to the Schengen Agreement."
"Should Norway for whatever reason not be able to participate in Schengen cooperation or be compelled to cease being a party to it in the future, this would put Sweden in an extremely difficult and in practical terms impossible position if the long land border with Norway had to be guarded."
"Accession to Schengen by Sweden would threaten the Nordic passport union and establish new borders with the Baltic states, Eastern Europe and the rest of the world."
"Sweden risks becoming part of a European security state which keeps records on and monitors the citizens of the Union and prevents others from entering 'Fortress Europe' ."
"In both Sweden and Norway Schengen is being marketed as an enlargement of the Nordic passport union."
"This is wrong, since the Nordic countries have abolished passport requirements but not border controls."
"If border controls are abolished 'monitoring measures' will be needed in the form of common police activities."
"This will require an enormous control system, the Schengen Information System (SIS) in Strasbourg, Europol, which is moving in the direction of a federal police force modelled on the American FBI."
"There is also a risk that the passport union will be replaced by an obligation to carry a special ID card at all times and in all places."
"Schengen also means stricter asylum, visa and refugee policies, with Sweden having to introduce stricter visa requirements for several countries."
"The risks of arms and drug smuggling will also increase if border controls are abolished."
"We have voted against this resolution because there are all too many question marks involving Sweden."
"We dissociate ourselves completely from the idea of the Schengen Agreement being incorporated in the EU Treaty."
"The Nordic passport union has worked incredibly well and should not be put at risk for the sake of the huge gamble which accession to the Schengen Agreement in many ways represents."
"Should Norway for whatever reason not be able to be party to the Schengen Agreement or be forced to withdraw from it in the future, Sweden would find itself in a precarious and practically impossible situation as regards control of the long land border between Sweden and Norway."
"Another reason not to proceed with Sweden's accession to the Schengen Agreement until further notice is the compensatory measures which Sweden would have to take when border controls vis-à-vis the Schengen countries were abolished."
"It has still not been said what these compensatory measures would be."
"It is therefore impossible to vote for this resolution since far too many questions remain unanswered as far as Sweden is concerned."
"For example, through the Schengen Agreement Sweden would be part of a common territory for the free movement of goods and persons."
"For our part, to share such a common area with the Netherlands, which takes a totally different view of the cultivation of narcotic crops, is an incredibly risky undertaking."
"Péry report"
"Mr President, on the Péry report, I am most amazed."
"We tabled an amendment on how Member States get round the multiannual guidance programme by transferring their vessels to third countries and by using flags of convenience."
"I am surprised that there were only 47 votes in favour of this amendment, despite the fact that even my own country of Ireland complains about it."
"The British, for example, are always complaining about the flags of convenience and the fact that their own government has failed to decommission and, instead, has sold off its flags of convenience to countries like Spain and France."
"This is quite appalling because it represents a failure to recognize that European fleets are far too large and need to be reduced."
"Member States have to recognize that fact."
"But some Member States are exploiting this situation and the people representing Member States suffering as a result do not even realize this."
"It is a disgrace that only 47 Members voted in favour of my amendment which criticized Member States which transferred their vessels to third countries which are already overexploited by the fisheries agreements or transferred their vessels to countries like Britain."
"They fly flags of convenience and then, when they break the rules, Member States, for example Spain, turn around and say: ' Oh, well, it was flying a British flag' , when the reality is that it was a Spanish-owned vessel."
"The Member States who are doing this have to acknowledge that they are not meeting their obligations."
"No-one would dispute that there is an urgent need to conserve fishing stocks by reducing fleet capacity."
"However what is in dispute is the size of the reduction and the particular manner in which it is to be applied."
"Ireland, since its accession to the EEC, has never been treated fairly with regard to our total allowable catch."
"Despite the fact that we have 20 % of European coastal waters we have only been allocated 4 % of fishing quotas."
"The proposed reduction in the European Union fishing fleet should be used to redress this balance and Ireland should therefore not be subjected to pro rata cuts."
"Furthermore if there is to be a major reduction in fishing activity it must be vigorously policed to ensure that there is no illegal fishing."
"And given the legitimate concerns of Irish fishermen relating to Spanish access to the Irish Box the EU must provide the necessary resources to patrol this and other areas."
"I rise in support of the case of the fishermen of Southend, Leigh and Canvey in my constituency, who are further threatened by the Commission's latest announcement."
"These fishermen are native to the Kent and Essex waters, with smaller boats under 17 metres, and have already suffered a cutback of more than half of their catch in the last ten years."
"Bigger boats from Belgium, Holland and other UK regions have grabbed their share."
"And whilst fish stocks in our waters have held up compared to elsewhere in the North Sea, these latest quota cutbacks threaten more non-native boats coming in to destroy the livelihoods of locally based fishermen."
"That is why our call today for more involvement by the fishermen themselves and the amendment which I have cosponsored to prohibit 'quota hopping' of British stocks by other European vessels is absolutely right."
"Our aim in Essex is to set up our own regional fishery with our own producers' organization to give the traditional and important fishing industry off the Essex coast much more control over our own waters and therefore over our own future."
"The fishermen of Northern Ireland have never felt more isolated."
"The recent Commission announcement of an intended 40 % cut in the fishing fleets of Europe was the final blow."
"Such a proposal would devastate the industry and the communities in which they are situated for they have no alternatives."
"This dictatorial approach without consultation with the industry and the fishermen is unacceptable and will be resisted to the bitter end."
"The Commission says there are fewer fish available to catch."
"The fishermen in my area say this is nonsense and the scientists never contact them or ask their advice on the stocks available."
"This is an impossible position for the Commission and the fishermen."
"Brussels is too remote and a more reliable system must be found, with more control devolved to the administrations closer to the people."
"The problem of quota-hopping and flagging out must be addressed for it causes deep resentment in the industry."
"We at present have a common fisheries policy which does not work and is not understood by the fishermen or the industry."
"We need and require positive proposals to revive the industry and instill confidence to ensure survival."
"With regard to both policy formulation and the implementation of policy, the European Union's approach on fisheries is seriously deficient and ineffective and is doing nothing to assist fisheries development."
"On the contrary, it is driving a sector which has traditionally been dynamic and productive, especially in the coastal and island regions on the periphery of the Union, which in many cases are dependent on fishing for their survival, into inactivity and decline."
"The imposition of Community directives which take no account of particular national circumstances, and which, rather than promoting modernization of the fishing fleet, demand ever more severe cuts in its size, and weaknesses in infrastructure and the miserly funding of fisheries research, which are depriving those involved in fishing of technical and scientific support, have led to problems in the sector which are beginning to look insuperable."
"The signs are already very worrying, even for a country like Greece with its long experience and tradition of fishing and its natural advantages in terms of geography and fishing resources."
"We think that the Member States must be given the option of managing their own resources, and we consider the implementation of discriminatory restrictions to ensure conservation of valuable stocks and of a range of technical measures (criteria for the granting of fishing licences and the necessary controls, breeding ground studies and protection, measures to protect seas against pollution by toxic and hazardous wastes etc.) to be essential."
"We do not believe that over-fishing and the over-exploitation of sea resources can be fairly blamed on the large numbers of inshore fishermen who each catch just a few kilos of fish, who have always existed (and are the ones whose numbers are falling with every passing year) and who contribute to the economies and help to maintain the ecological balance of their localities."
"The problem was started, and is being made worse all the time, by the big industrial fishing fleets; by the factory ships which fish for the world market and set prices, and which are causing economic, social and ecological devastation by fishing coastal zones to exhaustion."
"In the Mediterranean, in particular, this is tolerated, even connived at, by the common fisheries policy, which seems to work in favour of allowing sea resources to be managed, in terms of both orthodox fishing and aquaculture, by the multinationals whose only interest in the fisheries policy is making sure that it suits their ends."
"We believe that fisheries activity can and must be strengthened. However, this can be achieved only through a new policy dedicated to promoting proper exploitation of sea resources, to safeguarding the balance of the marine ecosystem via effective measures to curb the pollution which is one of the main causes of lower catches and to ensuring that workers in the sector receive satisfactory incomes and have a decent standard of living."
"Arias Cañete report"
"Mr President, the Arias Cañete report on fishing problems in the North-Western Atlantic area comes before us at a time when it could hardly be more topical, since the Euro-Canadian declaration which should have been adopted by the Council last week is still under examination today."
"Among the obstacles that have occurred is the Commission's determination to slip in free trade everywhere, even when the Council will have none of it, and the Commission's strange omission of the entire heritage of relations between the Union Member States and the Canadian provinces."
"Let us hope that these failings will be corrected."
"And then there is the thorny problem of fisheries, which we have been considering today."
"On this point, the European Community is calling on Canada to ratify the bilateral 'Fisheries' agreement of 1992, which provides in particular, and among other things, for the reopening of Canadian waters and Canadian ports to Community vessels."
"The Arias Cañete report, as adopted, supports that demand very strongly, and so do we."
"This matter of fisheries brings to light an institutional quirk which may help to explain the apparent weakness of the Union in the day-to-day handling of its problems."
"Within the North Atlantic Fisheries Organization, as within many other international bodies in the fisheries sector, the European Union has only one vote in total, rather than one vote per Member State."
"So, within the North-Western Atlantic Fisheries Organization, the European Union as a whole carries the same weight as Cuba."
"The Commission really must be very anxious to be thought of as the single Government of Europe if it has come to the point of tolerating this kind of anomaly."
"This is something that absolutely must be put right in the future."
"This fisheries report contains observations to which special attention must be drawn. I refer in particular to the following recitals:"
"The EU has nothing to do with these provisions as far as fisheries is concerned. The EU must learn to respect individual states' sovereignty as regards industries which are important to them;"
"V) which concerns the fact that Canada wishes to have zero quotas for cod, which the EU does not regard as being justified pending new scientific data on the subject."
"We consider that in the case of fish quotas the precautionary principle must apply so that stocks are not reduced/wiped out."
"The EU should respect Canada's opinion concerning zero quotas as an ecological measure based on the precautionary principle."
"Mather report"
"The Danish social democrats are voting in favour of the report on minimum requirements for improving the protection of workers potentially at risk from explosive atmospheres."
"Workers should be given the best possible protection."
"However, a connection is lacking between this proposal for a directive and other similar proposals, for example on chemical agents."
"It appears strange for special rules to be laid down when the general basis regarding chemical agents is not yet in place."
"The scope of the directive is thus unclear."
"We therefore hope to see a move soon from the Commission on chemical agents."
"Stenius-Kaukonen report"
"In that benzene is an extremely hazardous substance which is also extremely common I intend to vote for the most far-reaching requirements which are put forward."
"Naturally it is my hope that a majority in the EU parliament will also have the nerve to set proper requirements as regards the protection of employees."
"Even with a limit value of 1 ppm, which is proposed in the report, there are considerable risks of humans contracting leukaemia."
"It is therefore reasonable that the limit value should be lowered after 1 January 2001, as proposed in amendment 20 by the Green Group."
"This limit value is also being proposed in Denmark, for example, at the present time."
"In this connection it is important that it is made absolutely clear that this provision is binding and that no exceptions will be made."
"I naturally support the amendments relating to these requirements."
"Barón Crespo report"
"The Titley report on aid for reconstruction in the former Yugoslavia is full of high-minded sentiments."
"It is a pity, though, that this solicitude did not put in an appearance earlier, five years ago, when a number of States in the former Yugoslavia expressed the desire to gain independence and sovereignty."
"At that time, for the European Union to have recognized the independence of those States would no doubt have made it possible to avoid the war, and the destruction for which we are now paying, in every sense."
"We shall not be voting in favour of this report, for that reason and many others: because the only country that will benefit at present is Bosnia, since Croatia - one-third of whose territory has been ravaged by fighting - has been denied access to the PHARE programme, has seen negotiations for a cooperation agreement with the EU suspended, and has had the gates of the Council of Europe slammed in its face, though those gates were open to the great Russian 'democracy' ."
"Because Europe, despite the promises of other donors, is responsible for 1/3 of the donations in theory and 2/3 in practice."
"And because, above all, it does not seem to us that Europe will emerge politically strengthened by bearing the financial burden of the consequences of the international policing operations conducted by the United States under the leadership of the highly globalist United Nations Organization."
"Unless, of course, this Europe of yours believes that its international political dimension can only be asserted under the shadow of the Clinton administration."
"Pex report"
"The Pex report is about the way the Council treated the European Parliament at the last conciliation procedure."
"And here the question arises: what interest has the Council in ignoring the European Parliament's proposed amendments in this manner?"
"After all Parliament is not primarily concerned with disputes about areas of competence, as keeps being suggested, but with the matter in hand."
"The Council's proposed regulation falls well behind the existing means of supporting the CIS states."
"Furthermore it does not take account of the new facts, namely that the EU now has a long border with Russia."
"And lastly, what is called the compromise package really only regulates means of improving the way TACIS funds can flow back into the European countries and in such a way that all EU countries get their share."
"It fully ignores the fact that the sufferers will be the people in the CIS countries."
"Nor does it take note of the fact that small projects in particular will hardly be allowed now."
"The disappearance of the entire social dimension and most of the environmental and health aspects will considerably impair the process of transformation in these countries."
"By its attitude the Council is showing that it does not want these improvements in terms of content either, which is why it is hiding behind the arguments of the compromise package."
"That concludes voting time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.40 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Topical and urgent debate"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0735/96 by Mr La Malfa, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the elections in Albania; -B4-0774/96 by Mrs Green and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the elections in Albania; -B4-0783/96 by Mr Pasty and Mr Caligaris, on behalf of the UPE Group, on the elections in Albania; -B4-0791/96 by Mr Dell'Alba, on behalf of the ARE Group, on the elections in Albania; -B4-0794/96 by Mr Puerta and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the elections in Albania; -B4-0813/96 by Mrs Aelvoet and others, on behalf of the V Group, on the electoral process in Albania; -B4-0826/96 by Mrs Pack and others, on behalf of the PPE Group, on the electoral process in Albania."
"Madam President, in this debate today the issue is not whether we agree that the elections in Albania were undemocratic."
"Sadly, everyone acknowledges that there was an orgy of intimidation against the opposition, even those who are endeavouring to paint the situation in a more favourable light."
"The self-delusion of some people who maintain that it is a case of good pro-Westerners on the one side and supporters of the former regime on the other - that, too, is reprehensible, given that the roles of everyone, now and before, are known fact."
"They are all children of the former regime."
"The fact, however, that nine opposition parties boycotted the second round of the elections, the fact that the Albanian electoral committee itself felt obliged to declare the elections invalid in 17 constituencies and the fact that no international observers were present when the new elections took place in those 17 constituencies do not say much for the progress being made towards democratization in Albania."
"This country is a member of the Council of Europe."
"It aspires to closer links with the European Union."
"Nevertheless, it is true that Albania is still struggling to find its way in Europe and equally true that the road to democracy is not an easy one, particularly when a country has no tradition of democracy."
"The recent happenings are far from encouraging."
"If the European Parliament and the European Union genuinely wish to help the Albanian people along the road to democracy, they must issue a stern warning to Mr Berisha and condemn unequivocally conduct which may serve the interests in the region of certain parties in the medium term but will lead to greater tension in the long term."
"The region is already full of tension and burdened down by suffering in myriad forms as a result of the open machinations of powerful states and the zones of influence that they are striving to regain."
"Madam President, undemocratic elections have taken place in Albania, which is a member of the Council of Europe."
"The lack of a free media, the exclusion of certain opposition parties from the elections together with serious irregularities have made the Albanian elections into a farce."
"The OSCE report is very clear on that."
"We must do everything we can to steer Albania as quickly as possible back on to the road to full democracy. Albania is entitled to this, but so are we."
"So the elections must be held again from scratch."
"Political prisoners must be released and the conditions for the holding of new elections must be drastically improved."
"To that end the Union must pressurize the Albanian authorities and suspend cooperation with Albania."
"The European Parliament must send a clear message."
"Consequently the Liberal Group will support the amendments put down by the Socialist Group because any half-hearted pronouncement will only encourage President Berisha to continue his undemocratic behaviour."
"He has to understand that there is at present no democracy, in other words he must listen not to us but to the democratic will of his own people who are at last free of the yoke of the past."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, although the elections took place scarcely a month ago, the public has almost forgotten what happened around these elections."
"But the European Union institutions must not overlook these incidents."
"According to information received from international observers, these elections involved very serious infringements of the principle of free and democratic elections."
"Intimidation of voters and actual cheating were observed on several occasions and on such a massive scale that Helsinki Watch, the international human rights organization, pointed out in a report on these elections that their results must not be recognized because of the systematic infringements of local and international rules."
"Even before the elections, President Berisha and his government took a number of measures which considerably restricted the chances of the opposition parties."
"The opposition had little chance of presenting itself and its programmes to the media."
"The infringements of the democratic electoral process even led all the opposition parties to withdraw from the second ballot."
"Where there is no opposition, there is no democratic state."
"But President Berisha has achieved one thing now: in contrast to 1994 - remember - when the draft constitution he proposed was rejected by a clear majority of the inhabitants, he can now fashion the Albanian state as he wants and dictate what happens in the country."
"As a result of international pressure elections were held again in 17 constituencies without the participation of the opposition parties."
"It is clear that this has not saved democracy in Albania."
"Only new general elections that respect the international rules can put the democratic process in Albania back on track."
"No democratic party in the European Union can even consider any further cooperation with a party that shows so little respect for democracy and is only interested in staying in power."
"To pretend that nothing has happened is hypocrisy!"
"It is not enough to appeal as the Christian Democrats have done to the government party to make responsible and prudent use of the re-confirmation of their position as the majority party in order to achieve broad agreement wherever possible."
"That would legitimize cheating and be a threat to democracy."
"For the European Social Democrats it is not the colour of the government party that is important."
"All that counts for us is respect for democracy."
"Full or partial recognition of these elections is equal to the rejection of democratic principles for Albania."
"So we call on the Council and the Commission to freeze relations with Albania until new elections have been held in this country under international democratic rules."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in a Chamber as deserted as the one in which we now find ourselves in this form of normality that Parliament has appropriated for itself whereby policy has to be evacuated, it is appropriate that we should be discussing Albania and the difficult, the very difficult phase we are now seeing, with the holding of elections that were clearly completely, partly or largely irregular, as claimed by many, although not all, observers."
"And in these circumstances we are now witnessing a rather strange turn of events in that the two main groups in the House - which alone account for 400, if not more, Members - are not signing a text on Albania, are not therefore taking up a position, unless to absent themselves, and are not abiding by the compromise that was in fact negotiated with the Socialist Group and the PPE Group also."
"That document, signed by Group of the European Liberal Democratic and Reformist Party, the Group of the European Radical Alliance, the Green Group in the European Parliament and the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left endeavours to be balanced and robust, a strong but not an unbalanced appeal, as would appear to me to be the implication of what Mrs Hoff said."
"I would in fact agree with what Mrs Hoff said, were the philosophy of the Socialist group applied to all of the situations in which this happens, but it seems to me odd that in the case of Albania the Socialist Group should want to adopt a position which is absolutely at odds with that of the other part of the House and which above all - I repeat - is being applied in a somewhat unilateral manner to that country and not others."
"I therefore again ask the scant representatives of the groups I have mentioned to think again so that the text we have drawn up as a compromise and that I would describe as robust but acceptable can be adopted without going too far in one direction or the other."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen."
"The electoral fraud that has just occurred in the recent sham elections in Albania has been internationally recognised."
"Violations of the political and human rights of countless leaders, party members, trade unionists and members of the civil society in Albania are internationally recognised, too - violations that took place before, during and after the sham elections took place."
"In this context, the European Parliament must either adopt a clear position on this issue or set serious precedents for the future in similar situations."
"The European Parliament must adopt a clear position and not adopt any position that is in cahoots with democratic mockeries."
"In order to adopt that clear position we are tabling amendments along with the Socialist Group calling clearly for the elections to be re-held in accordance with international standards - or else any economic and political cooperation could be suspended."
"Madam President, as I had cause to say at the last part-session that we held in Brussels, practically all observers, of every nationality, found that the elections in Albania were irregular, and that the irregularities took place before the poll, that is to say in the course of the electoral campaign - as a result, for instance, of the fact that not everyone had sufficient opportunity to campaign; during the poll itself, as a result of clear irregularities in access to the ballot-box, by preventing the monitoring of the poll itself, and also after the poll because it was possible, contrary to democratic principles, to examine the votes and because opposition protests were suppressed."
"We are therefore dealing with a failure to respect the normal rules of democracy and have therefore to ask ourselves a question: what kind of process of democratization is under way in Albania at this point in time?"
"We are dealing - perhaps for the first time - with regression of the normal democratic process."
"That the previous elections went better than these therefore means that no attention was paid by international bodies, including the European Union, to ensuring that this was a progressive and not a regressive process."
"In that context, it is a matter of regret that yesterday, during the debate on the Italian presidency, President Dini did not discuss the issue of Albania."
"I believe that it is at any rate necessary at this point to hold new elections that respect democratic rules."
"We have to work towards getting the Albanian Government to change policies and give guarantees to that effect, but we have also to work towards securing rapprochement between the government and the opposition so that dialogue can be reopened in Albania."
"And we can also do this by bearing in mind that we need to replace the 1992 economic cooperation agreement: means of exerting pressure are therefore available to us."
"Finally, I wish to remind the House of the need to apply, from now on at least, the same methods and the same criteria to all countries in which a process of democratization is under way."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to stick to the facts and not to things someone has read somewhere."
"One: initially all the parties took part in the first elections in Albania."
"At that point, according to its own statements, the opposition saw no unsurmountable problems in participating in the elections."
"Two: the opposition parties, led by the socialist parties, withdrew their candidates and even their electoral assistants two hours before the end of the elections, but after the announcement by an American opinion poll that the election results were extremely unfavourable to them."
"Three: the latter event obviously led to irregularities at some polling stations."
"Four: the independent electoral committee found that irregularities and acts of violence had taken place in 17 constituencies and repeat elections were held there last Sunday."
"Five: the opposition refused to take part in this second election round."
"Nobody, my dear Mr Bertens, was excluded!"
"Six: following the opposition's call for a boycott the recorded electoral turnout was only 18 % lower."
"Seven: the high vote for the Democratic Party was therefore confirmed at the second ballot."
"Eight: the various observers of the first ballot did not agree in their assessments."
"Let me remind you, for instance, of the Helsinki Human Rights Group."
"And since only one report was taken into consideration, the ODIHR report by the OSCE, there really are doubts about the election."
"The composition of the group of electoral observers is extremely questionable."
"I identified no less than 14 of these electoral observers as Young Socialists, as genuine Young Socialists and not parliamentarians."
"In addition there were two Marxists, who were highly regarded guests in Albania at the time of Hoxha."
"These 14 people were originally invited as observers of the communists and only subsequently recruited by the ODIHR group to observe the elections."
"We should also remember that the EU ambassador and the American ambassador in Tirana drafted a document yesterday in which they picked the ODIHR report to pieces."
"And they were strictly opposed to these conclusions also being put to use here."
"We should take note of that and not only of what fits in with our political calculations."
"Nine: the Albanians voted in accordance with their own views and not the wishes of the Left in this House, which greatly pleases me personally."
"Ten: on the call for the release of political prisoners, let me say that I know of no political prisoners in Albania."
"I only know of the case of a prominent left-winger who is, however, in prison for financial offences - that is to say, a legal matter that I will not become involved in."
"Eleven: as Mrs Hoff said, I expect the Albanian Government to use its large majority with moderation and to involve the opposition in its activities, even though the latter rejected it."
"I hope this opposition will take a constructive approach, for it too represents its fellow-citizens and its country."
"Twelve: Albania had to find its way from the Middle Ages to modern times, i.e., from the high-security wing of communism to democracy, in a space of five years."
"That is hellishly difficult and there will still be a lot of mistakes for a long time to come."
"So let us not be so arrogant and blinkered in our judgment!"
"We too found it difficult to achieve our democratic standards."
"We can be proud of them, but now we should help Albania to refine these standards further."
"That is what we should do, rather than rejecting it!"
"Madam President, in response to what other speakers before me have said."
"I am happy to echo what Mr Bertens said about his Group's position and the clear message which his Group too wishes to send to the Albanian Government, to the effect that the situation there is not acceptable to us."
"Listening to Mrs Pack of the Christian Democratic Group I think our assessments of the situation there are quite a long way apart."
"Our concern is not so much with a party-political assessment of the situation there but primarily with the conclusion that there were so many irregularities in these elections that one cannot speak of a credible result and if there is so much uncertainty, so much doubt, we think the elections have to be held afresh."
"That is not a party-political choice."
"Our aim is to reach an objective verdict on what is going on in Albania."
"Observers, including observers other than those mentioned by Mrs Pack, identified so many irregularities, and where observers were not present all manner of things may have happened so that one can in all fairness talk of systematic fraud."
"In a situation like this, where there is so much doubt, we think that fresh elections have to be held and that we as Parliament should make a clear pronouncement on them."
"We can argue at length over who was or is to blame for the way things turned out but that is irrelevant to the question of whether the elections were fair."
"For the Albanians' understanding of democracy it is better, if errors are discovered, that the elections should be held all over again."
"That is better than endless discussions about where exactly irregularities occurred and where the voting needs to be done again."
"I also think, in conclusion, that we should treat Albania in the same way as we treat other countries, in accordance with the standards applied by the Council of Europe, and we cannot adjust those each time the political situation changes."
"My Group has clearly endorsed this position, also through the amendments to the joint resolution."
"In short, it makes it clear that we stand firmly behind the voter in Albania who has been treated with such contempt."
"Madam President, when I listened to Mrs Pack I actually had the feeling I should hand her my two minutes' speaking time, for what she said was so interesting, so clear and factual, and a good answer to the irresponsible demagogy we are faced with today."
"The truth is, indeed, that we find ourselves in a time of democratic decline."
"Anyone who knows a bit about Albania - unfortunately too few people know this country - will remember how things started out there."
"I was there shortly after the collapse of the communist regime and saw the dreadful conditions that prevailed there."
"Of course it is quite clear that you cannot have the kind of democracy we know in Switzerland or the UK there yet."
"But there is no doubt that great progress has been made."
"Something really is being done for the people in Albania."
"The country has a government that really wants to do the right thing, and we have to recognize that."
"That irregularities occurred during the elections cannot be denied."
"The fact that the elections had to be repeated in 17 constituencies is evidence of that."
"But in most constituencies the electoral process was orderly."
"I very much regret that the opposition, which for the rest was made up almost entirely of communists, withdrew the electoral observers before the end of the elections."
"They simply did not want to find out the truth because they knew full well from polls carried out in the course of the elections that they were facing a major defeat."
"So I believe that we should do our utmost to ensure that Albania gets what it deserves, namely that it is accepted into the community of European democracies, even if that will still take a while."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is, I believe, no question that the elections in Albania were not completely democratic, in fact that there were serious violations of the most fundamental principles of democratic competition: that is the position, there is nothing to discuss."
"But it seems to me that, as usual, we are moving from one extreme to another."
"We did all we could to secure some kind of European protection for the elections in Albania to achieve, as far as possible, non-violent transition towards democracy, and now we are calling for everything to be dismantled, for the elections to be held afresh and chaos to be returned to that country."
"That, I believe, is an approach that we have to reject: we need to exert strong pressure on the Albanian Government that has won the - in many instances, I repeat, nondemocratic - elections to hold them afresh in those districts in which irregularities have been established, but only in those districts."
"I think it incumbent on Europe, at this stage, to monitor closely, without creating further upheaval, this process of transition in Albania: it is not democracy that is at stake here but above all civil coexistence within the whole Balkan region."
"Madam President, the final report of the OSCE on the elections in Albania confirms previous reports detailing the irregularities which took place during voting and reports cases in which there were in fact infringements of the new electoral law approved last February."
"The European Union has issued a forceful statement concerning those events and has asked for the elections to be held again in those constituencies in which there had been irregularities."
"It also stated that the continuation of the electoral process according to international democratic rules constituted an essential factor for the successful future development of relations between Albania and the European Union."
"We also condemn the violent police response to the demonstration on 28 May."
"The Commission has received in Brussels the leaders of the Albanian opposition parties to hear their views and their criticisms of the way in which the elections were held and it was clear that the elections would have to be held again in various constituencies."
"The decision taken by the Albanian Government to hold the elections again in 17 of those constituencies is a step in the right direction but it is regrettable that this has not given time to take into account and evaluate the final report of the OSCE and for observers to be present when they are held again."
"Only yesterday an informal meeting of the permanent Council of the OSCE was held in Vienna with an Albanian delegation to discuss the OSCE's own report."
"Representatives of that organization were invited to Tirana to deal with the recommendations and technical aspects of the report."
"It - the report - includes recommendations on improving electoral procedures and the holding of elections."
"It passed no judgment on the general validity of the elections nor did it state the exact number of constituencies in which it would be appropriate to hold them again."
"It is clear that respect for democratic principles and legality will be decisive for the future development of relations with Albania."
"It is true, as some honourable Members have said, that Albania is an important factor for stability in an extremely unstable region and it is also true that in recent years important progress has been made in the economic field."
"We must therefore continue to support this internal trend which, I repeat, is in the right direction."
"In recent months the Commission has been engaged on preparing a negotiating mandate for a new trade and cooperation agreement with Albania."
"For the moment the Commission has preferred to wait to see how the situation in Albania develops and whether, through the actions of the party in power and the dialogue between President Berisha and the opposition parties, it is possible to restore calm in Albanian political life and gradually to establish normal democratic working."
"Thank you, Mr Marín!"
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the motion for a resolution (B4-0734/96) by Mr La Malfa and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democratic and Reformist Party, on the elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"Madam President, it is very important that democratic elections should be held in Bosnia."
"The date has been set and we must stick to it."
"However justified a postponement might seem in the present circumstances, that would carry a lot of risks, for example Bosnia might disintegrate further and we would have to continue our negotiations with the warlords of recent years even longer."
"Bosnia needs a stable and legitimate government, based on democratic elections."
"We must thus do all we can to improve the conditions in which those elections are held."
"First point: IFOR's mandate must be broadened so that IFOR can arrest war criminals and oversee the return of refugees."
"Free media must be encouraged."
"Separatist forces must be firmly resisted."
"Not only must Karadzic and Mladic be put behind bars, we must also reject the independence of the Bosnian Croats and strongly condemn the attack on Silajdzic."
"The announcement that the Bosnian Serbs are to set up their own tribunal to try their war criminals is yet one more slap in the face for the peace process."
"Our opposition to these developments must be very resolute and unequivocal."
"We must use every available instrument to get the message across."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission fully endorses the European Parliament's resolution on the holding of elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"They represent the crucial factor for the peace process and will form the basis for the Constitution of BosniaHerzegovina which will give its institutions legitimacy."
"In the Council for implementing peace in the former Yugoslavia held in Florence last week, preparation for the elections was one of the main subjects."
"Although conditions are far from ideal, the feeling was that it was vital to stick to the date of 14 September."
"To postpone the elections would aggravate the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina and would leave the country without appropriate tools to work on its future."
"The OSCE must ensure that the conditions for holding elections are satisfied and fix the date."
"It may be assumed that the decision will be taken towards the end of June."
"So it will be necessary to make an enormous effort between now and the elections to improve the present difficult situation."
"The slowness of the return of refugees and displaced persons, owing to lack of freedom of movement, of course complicates preparations for the elections."
"Freedom of movement does exist in theory but in practice there are numerous problems creating a climate of fear and mistrust aggravated by the presence in the Republica Srpska of people like Karadzic and Mladic who stand accused before the War Crimes Tribunal."
"The relationship between the various entities is subject to separatist tendencies and insufficient progress has been made within the Croat-Muslim Federation."
"Access to the communication media by all political parties is moreover still restricted."
"Since January the OSCE which was entrusted by the Dayton agreements with the supervision and preparation of the elections has been working on the spot in the difficult political and practical conditions I am describing."
"A provisional electoral commission has been set up to supervise the process and the rules on electoral registration, the right to vote - including that of refugees - and access to the communication media."
"Similarly a series of programmes intended for civic education has been organized."
"The Member States of the Union and the Commission fully support the OSCE's actions."
"The Member States - and the Commission -have strongly supported the OSCE's voluntary fund used for financing electoral preparations."
"The Community budget's contribution for civic educational material and for the manufacture of voting booths and ballot boxes comes to ECU 2 million."
"By means of a common Union programme we shall finance to the amount of ECU 3 million the deployment of observers to monitor appropriate preparations for the elections."
"Considerable help is also being given to the independent communication media."
"In this connection the Commission will contribute ECU 2 million to support Carl Bildt's proposal to set up an independent television channel."
"And naturally the European Union as such will also take part in supervising the elections according to rules to be studied with the OSCE election supervision coordinator."
"Thank you, Mr Marín!"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."

"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, once again we have condemned here the attitude of the Indonesian authorities that are continuing to use military repression on the people of East Timor and its youth in particular."
"Indeed once again this month the Indonesian authorities killed, wounded and arrested young Timorese citizens who were demonstrating peacefully in Baucau for freedom of religious practice following acts of provocation and religious intolerance culminating in the profanation of a Catholic religious image."
"In Jakarta the Indonesian police, once again, shot a Timorese youth."
"The gaols of East Timor and Indonesia continue to detain hundreds of political prisoners."
"The Indonesian government continues to ignore all of the positions taken by the international community calling for the respect of human rights and the right of the people of East Timor to self-determination. This cannot be tolerated."
"It is important that the European Parliament once again condemns the Indonesian authorities for the use of military repression against the people of East Timor and demands the immediate release of all political prisoners, in particular the lead of the resistance, Xanana Gusmão, and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the fight of the people of Timor for self-determination and an end to the illegal occupation of their territory."
"We cannot use words alone."
"To demonstrate our solidarity with the victims of the struggles and their families we must also call on Member States once again to stop selling arms to Indonesia and lending it military assistance."
"Madam President, the violent, bloody and deathly incidents described in the explanation of the joint resolution show that the sensitivity of the majority of Members of the European Parliament has not yet been taken in by the pro-Indonesia propaganda and the fight of the Timorese people for observance of UN resolutions and the respect of human rights is well known, backed and respected by the majority of political groups in this house and most Member States on the Council."
"This resolution only confirms that the cause of the East Timorese people is gaining more and more notoriety and international political backing as the repression of the Indonesian dictatorship insists on violence."
"Therefore, apart from common positions, occasionally adopted by the Council and suffering the ups and downs in terms of publication that are known to all by dint of the British position, positions that confront Indonesia vis-à-vis the respect of UN resolutions, I emphasise the common desire of the European Parliament that Indonesia should quickly and clearly respond to the dialogue initiative of the Portuguese prime minister as a first significant step towards finding a political solution for the East Timor problem."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen."
"The illegitimate, illegal and bloody occupation of East Timor by Indonesia is one of the recent decades' most serious and violent conflicts."
"Twenty years of war and military repression have led to large numbers of deaths, wounded, invalids and prisoners, challenging the culture, history and sensitivity of the increasingly martyred Maubere people."
"The events of last week in Baucau show once more how false have been the promises of peace and how sham is the respect of human rights and free exercise of religion in Timor."
"The Indonesian authorities took part in a terrible provocation of the mostly Catholic population's feelings."
"They gratuitously insulted symbols of a religion that they must respect, and killed, maimed and arrested indiscriminately people who legitimately dared to protest."
"All of these deeds must be strongly condemned but unfortunately some countries that speak of peace and the respect of human rights have been lending backing, weapons and logistics enabling the war and violence to go on."
"As we saw in December international hypocrisy actually condoned the terrible crimes that have gone on, you might say, in litis consortio ."
"There is no point in continuing to churn out resolutions condemning the Indonesians in the European Parliament, the UN or any other forum, unless there is a strong will and genuine desire to free the Timorese people from the Indonesian yoke and restore peace and security to its people."
"The truth is that if the many countries that claim to defend freedom and human rights really wanted it a solution for the East Timor problem could be found faster than one might think."
"It is time to say enough is enough."
"It is time to act instead of just talking."
"It is time to say that this barbarity is unbearable and shameful for the whole of mankind."
"To cap it all, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today in the press room of the European Parliament, is a press release strongly attacking Portugal, a European Union country that has only been defending the freedom of Timor, dated 3 July 1995 - yes, 3 July 1995 - revealing the attitude and permanent inflexibility of its authors."
"A year without changing a single comma of this matter is an eternity."
"Madam President, Timor again. Some of our colleagues seem to be a bit tired of this issue."
"For our part even if the Timorese themselves were tired - and, to their credit, they are not - and even if the Indonesians terminated their genocide, with the tolerance of the international community against its own positions, we still would not be sick and tired - our indignation would be as great."
"Is there anything new?"
"Yes, still more aggression and provocations following on from military occupation, and still more demonstrations by a people demanding self-determination."
"There is also the fact that we are discussing, umbilically, human rights in Indonesia and the occupation and repression that goes on in a still to be decolonised territory."
"The same root for two different situations."
"We must not be deluded into thinking that the international political issue can be solved by extension if there is more democracy in Indonesia since that would imply that East Timor is part and parcel of Indonesia."
"Representatives of the Timorese people are meeting Indonesian democrats."
"This is a positive signal that we applaud but they are meeting to coordinate different struggles and not to mix up the internal and external struggles."
"Then people come along in the service of the current Indonesian regime - they should be paid no heed or honour - to accuse Portugal of being the colonizing power and diverting attention away from the fact that this is a case of unfinished decolonisation business - this ignores the fact that the Indonesian government has not - yet - responded to the Portuguese initiative in the framework of negotiations under the aegis of the United Nations."
"They have used wily manoeuvres and we shall have nothing to do with them."
"Let us repudiate them."
"The question is the right of a people to self-determination, prevented by a military occupation that has led to religious, cultural and physical genocide."
"Madam President, I am hoping that East Timor will be top of Ireland's agenda on foreign policy during the Irish presidency."
"I believe the best way we can help East Timor is to openly criticise our EU partners who are arming the Indonesian dictatorship that has subjected the Timorese to 20 years of murder, rape, torture and oppression."
"We should not be afraid of offending our EU partners by condemning their cooperation with tyranny."
"This is one of the problems with this compromise resolution, that it is too weak on this point."
"This year at least three European Union countries have been involved in arms deals with the regime of General Suharto."
"Britain exported two Hawk jets to Indonesia in April."
"That is the first in a batch of 24."
"It is part of a £2 billion contract for British Aerospace."
"The pilots for these jets are due to be trained in Wales."
"Sweden has decided to resume arms sales to Indonesia."
"Finland issued a licence in March for the export of 60 armoured troop carriers to Jakarta."
"I think it is fitting today that we are talking about this issue because it is the 50th birthday of Xanana Gusmão, the Timorese resistance leader who is serving a 20-year sentence for opposing the Indonesian rule."
"In the eyes of the Timorese he is the Nelson Mandela of East Timor."
"Many governments and many human rights organizations have called for his release and for the release of all political prisoners."
"The other thing the Indonesians have to realise is that we need people to have access to East Timor."
"I was prevented myself from going there."
"Parliament should be forcing Indonesia to allow people in there to see what is really going on."
"Madam President, some people are tired of hearing the East Timor issue being raised here at the European Parliament."
"But the problem could easily be solved: all Indonesia needs to do is to stop systematically violating fundamental rights, such as the right to self-determination, the right to life, and in the specific case of Baucau, the right to religious freedom."
"Some people think that these things are less important than the roads that have been built in Timor by the Indonesians."
"But they certainly built more gaols."
"Thankfully there are people who do not swap the values of freedom and identity for concrete buildings and roads."
"That alone merits our appreciation."
"Finally how come the European Parliament has agreed on this for the last ten years, since the Portuguese arrived?"
"Why do the United Nations not recognise the Indonesian occupation?"
"All they all blind?"
"Why are there bullets and not ballots in Timor?"
"How cynical can you get when President Suharto launches a new car called the Timor on which you pay no sales tax, when he negates the most elementary liberty of circulation by Timorese citizens inside and outside the country?"
"Although Portugal has been designated administrative power by the UN rejects unilateral solutions and is proposing a dialogue with Indonesia and a joint solution."
"The Portuguese prime minister recently made concrete proposals."
"But what is serious is that Indonesia has not responded to this proposal and carries on torturing."
"Indonesia prefers torture to talks and so we ask for the country to be condemned by the European Parliament, aware that this body and Europe as a whole must be one of the great beacons of fundamental rights in the world."
"We shall come here as often as is necessary."
"That is the least we can do for the remotest and most ignored of all the suppressed peoples in the world."
"Madam President, it distresses us that a country like Indonesia, which we admire in many respects, is unable to resolve a number of structural problems concerning human rights."
"It is more serious still that the senseless and pointless repression, the curtailment of press freedom, the use of force against defenceless citizens as in the arrest of Dr Sri Bintang Pamungkas is not tackled seriously by Indonesia itself and that no efforts are being made to find a political solution."
"We have people here who would be willing to work together with the Indonesians to find a solution."
"That would be better, Madam President, than producing resolutions, since Indonesia takes no notice of these and obviously neither do the Member States since military aid and arms exports continue."
"This impasse has to be broken, Madam President."
"Madam President, there are three subjects with which we are constantly concerned here when it is a question of the right of a people to self-determination, subjects for which the colonial period is to blame."
"They are the occupation of the Western Sahara, Mururoa and, again and again, East Timor."
"We have a particular responsibility for that conflict."
"We must tell the Indonesians that they must respect human rights."
"It is a question here of the right to self-determination of the people of East Timor."
"Yet we as Parliament and the EU as a whole also bear a responsibility here."
"We have discussed the conflicts of Dili for years."
"Now there have once again been demonstrations and incidents."
"On 9 and 11 June two people were killed in Baucau."
"Injuries, arrests and further oppression are always the consequence."
"We are not dealing here with a religious conflict but with forms of systematic oppression."
"In Jakarta itself the 25-year-old Imanuel Suares was executed."
"We have the acts of oppression in Irian Jaya and one of the extreme cases was the arrest of the former member of parliament, Sri-Bintang Pamungkas, because he had spoken in Germany."
"He was accused of intending to instigate demonstrations against Indonesia in Germany."
"That is absurd, we can do that ourselves."
"But we did guarantee him freedom of expression."
"That has to be taken into account."
"That is why we call for his release."
"We have heard, however, that arms are continuing to be supplied from the UK, from Sweden and from the Federal Republic."
"The EU cannot permit that."
"Here it is up to the Commission to act."
"And it is up to us as Parliament finally to set up the delegation we decided to create in 1991 and called for in countless speeches."
"Here I expect an answer from you, Madam President, or from Mr Hänsch."
"When will this parliamentary delegation be set up?"
"How much longer do we have to go on talking about it?"
"Are the discussions here just window-dressing or will this Parliament take action as a parliament?"
"Only you can give me this answer from the Bureau."
"I hope this matter will be dealt with at the next Bureau meeting."
"Madam President, I want to say something about Nigeria, where the murder of Mrs Abiola has darkened what was already a murky political situation."
"This murder rekindles the memory of the victory of her husband, Mr Abiola, in the presidential elections just three years ago, and the annulment of the election by the military."
"Since then, imprisonment and exile have reduced the opposition to living on scraps."
"Mr Abiola, accused of treason, is being held in virtual secrecy and is at risk of the death sentence."
"We call for an international Commission of Inquiry to take up the investigations necessary to ensure that those responsible for Mrs Abiola's murder are punished, and we call for sanctions to be invoked against the Lagos regime."
"On that point, after the execution of the Ogoni, the junta - following international pressure - promised a programme of disengagement designed to hand power back to the civilian authorities in October 1998."
"In the meantime, in order to ensure that this return to normal takes place as soon as possible, it is necessary for the sanctions to be tightened and implemented by mutual agreement between the Commonwealth, the United Nations, the United States and the European Union."
"Madam President, the increasing volume and tempo of the human rights violations perpetrated by the Nigerian Government have brought us to a crossroads."
"These violations take many forms: restrictions on freedom of expression and association, improper detention without trial, harassment of opposition parties, persecution of intellectuals, capital punishment and collective executions as a matter of routine."
"At this parting of the ways, there are two roads open to us. One is the road of indifference or resignation, by following which the European Union would bow to the realpolitik dictated by Nigeria's oil wealth, lowering to halfmast the standard of human rights and democratic ideals."
"The second way would be the way of courage and dignity, the way that would lead us to demand the release of the political prisoners, with Mr Abiola foremost among them, the way that would enable us to set up an international Commission of Inquiry to throw some light on the murder of Mrs Abiola and, finally, the way that would lead us to resolve upon firm political and economic measures to lend weight to the demands we shall be making."
"That is the way, and the only way, that will enable us one day to be proud to salute the new Nigeria, as on another occasion we were rightly proud, in the light of the action we had taken, to salute the new South Africa."
"Madam President, this House has to protest once again by way of a further resolution condemning murder by the Nigerian Government."
"The murder of Mrs Abiola is simply the last and most serious incident in a long series of violations of democracy and human rights in Nigeria."
"The time has come for us to ask ourselves - and I am addressing the Commission here - whether we should continue to wait or should try taking substantial measures."
"I think that this latest incident may lead us finally to call for the perpetrators of this murder to be identified, and the only way of doing this is to set up an international commission of inquiry, because we certainly cannot expect the murderers to hold an investigation into themselves."
"Do we want to do this?"
"Do we want to take that kind of action?"
"I also believe that it is no longer possible to put off isolating this Nigerian regime within the African continent."
"And, as the European Union, we already have the means of doing just that, because Nigeria belongs to the ACP Assembly."
"We must take action at European level, and Europe can do this because commercial relations exist and I think that the time has come to impose exemplary sanctions that can no longer be deferred."
"Madam President, we are shocked at the death of Mrs Abiola, whose husband is in prison even though he was legitimately elected."
"We are shocked at the way the Nigerian Government is behaving towards us."
"The murder of Ken Saro-Wiwa gave rise to vehement international protests."
"There were resolutions and discussions."
"The Nigerian Government took an arrogant attitude to us in the Committee on Development and Cooperation and to the ACP Assembly but in the end there was some hope that we could enter into a dialogue and achieve a certain amount of democratization."
"This hope sprang partly from the fact that we have economic relations with Nigeria and that new agreements were concluded."
"Some of this has been destroyed again as a result of this murder."
"This dictatorship is being supported by our trade relations, by us buying up oil instead of imposing an embargo and lastly also by the European Union selling arms."
"We should not get our hands dirty here."
"We should stop at this point and demand that the Nigerian Government initiate a process of democratization, immediately release Mr Abiola, move towards new elections and take legal measures to prosecute the murderers of Mrs Abiola."
"Only by so doing can it signal a move towards democratization and real respect for human rights."
"Madam President, the military junta in Nigeria rules the country gun in hand and it arrests and murders political opponents and representatives of the civilian population without pity."
"The latest prominent victim is Mrs Abiola, wife of the democratically elected President Abiola."
"Mrs Abiola was merely defending the cause of her husband who was arrested because he was victorious in the 1993 presidential elections and the military junta was not prepared to acknowledge his victory."
"And in order to silence the democratic opposition, political opponents are terrorized and if necessary assassinated."
"Nigeria is a great power in Africa."
"Nigeria has the largest population in Africa and ties many African countries to it through its oil reserves."
"The Nigerian military junta thinks that this knowledge and the possession of oil reserves means that it can do as it pleases."
"And we have to admit that this arrogant attitude is paying off since world protest is loud but nothing is done."
"We saw how the Nigerians operate at the last ACP meeting when fifteen diplomats flew in in a special plane to intimidate the other African countries to such an extent that they did not dare vote in favour of a resolution criticizing Nigeria."
"And only urgent intervention by us to secure a secret vote made it possible ultimately for that critical resolution to be passed by a large majority."
"We have been complaining about the Nigerian Government's behaviour for months now and I think it is time to take action."
"I would urge the Commissioner to take a firm stand, along the lines set out by Mr Mandela, for example, and that means that really there is no option but to go for a diplomatic boycott, an oil embargo or an arms embargo."
"I think the Nigerian authorities will only respond to tough measures after everything they have done."
"I urge the Commission to act along these lines."
"Mr President, further repressive measures directed at Mrs Suu Kyi and her party have just been adopted by the military junta."
"The clear purpose is to muzzle the opposition, by imposing upon it heavy sentences of as much as twenty years' imprisonment."
"Yet that is not preventing the Burmese opposition from gathering in thousands outside the barred gates of the building where Mrs Suu Kyi lives under house arrest."
"Her supporters know that by gathering together they are defying the ruling junta."
"The deteriorating situation in Burma is causing concern to the ASEAN, which had responded to the appeal by the junta by granting credit to it."
"That is why its Member States are hesitating to introduce sanctions against Burma, which might result in the brutal suppression of the activities of Mrs Suu Kyi's party, the LND."
"It is deplorable that some Asian States have now demonstrated their sympathy with the military junta for reasons of commercial opportunism."
"We therefore call upon them to ensure that the SLORC - the initials of the ruling junta - is politically and economically isolated."
"Since the opposition in Burma has so little room for manoeuvre, it is up to Europe to respond to its appeal for openness and dialogue, in an effort to solve the Burmese question before further blood is spilt."
"Mr President, this third human rights subject also concerns the European Union's relationship with a dictatorial regime and the relations between politics and economic power."
"This time we are concerned with Burma."
"We are concerned with the National League for Democracy, with Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi, with the opposition movement there."
"The latest measures taken in Rangoon to suppress the opposition movement, which we support, have shocked us."
"The question is, what can we do about it?"
"I believe we can make political protests, but we in our Member States should also use our economic power to persuade the appropriate undertakings to implement our political demand, namely: the need to respect human rights."
"Undertakings should give practical support to our demands in their dealings with the political leadership of such countries."
"If BMW from Germany, Heineken from the Netherlands, Total from France go to Burma now, their economic cooperation should be accompanied by political dialogue."
"They must not fail to refer to the need for democracy!"
"Of course that should also form part of the negotiations which the Commission is conducting on behalf of the European Union and which we are conducting with the ASEAN states to ensure that human rights really are respected there and that the opposition has freedom of movement and expression."
"Mr President, last month we adopted a resolution on the human rights situation in Burma which seemed to take sufficient account of the situation there at that time."
"Regrettably, however, the political situation appears to have taken a turn for the worse with the fresh threats by SLORC against not only Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi but her followers."
"Anyone who turns up to hear the weekly address by Mrs Kyi is threatened with up to twenty years imprisonment."
"There are now fears for the personal safety of Mrs Kyi and of her followers."
"We therefore make two proposals in the resolution."
"One, to invite the Commission to investigate the general human rights situation in Burma."
"Two, to ask our own Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy to consider sending a European Parliament mission to Burma for talks with SLORC."
"We would also ask the Commission to report on the use of forced child labour in Burma and whether it intends to withdraw the system of generalized preferences."
"Mr President, since this Parliament approved the customs Union with Turkey in December of last year, human rights, Kurdish rights and the situation in South-East Turkey, far from improving, have in fact deteriorated, despite all the promises and hopes of the period leading up to our vote in December."
"Leyla Zana and the three other former Kurdish MPs have not been released but are on hunger strike along with Kurdish prisoners in many other Turkish jails."
"Torture has not been stopped and the prosecution, imprisonment and ill treatment of both Turks and Kurds who speak out for freedom has continued."
"Army operations have been stepped up and Turkish troops have again penetrated into Iraqi Kurdistan, despite the declaration of a ceasefire by the PKK on 15 December."
"We most earnestly appeal to the next Turkish Government to end this never-ending saga of oppression and civil war, to liberate political prisoners and to seek to settle the conflict in the south-east by peaceful means and not force of arms."
"We urge the Council and the Commission at the same time to search out and pursue every possible opportunity to promote initiatives aiming to resolve this tragic situation without further suffering and loss of life."
"It is announced today that the doctor appointed by the prison authorities to deal with the health of those on hunger strike has been arrested after a report he made to the effect that prisoners on hunger strike are at the stage of death."
"I hope the prisoners can be persuaded to end their hunger strike and it is possible to avoid further loss of life that would add further to the appalling cost in terms of human suffering of people who are all Turkish citizens after all."
"We all want closer association with Turkey and its peoples but I hope the Turkish authorities will see this resolution as a clear statement that unless steps are taken to achieve positive improvements in Kurdish and human rights and to end the suffering, our mutual relations will be seriously damaged."
"The democratic veneer adopted by the Turkish authorities in order to organize the Habitat II World Conference in Istanbul has quickly peeled off."
"Demonstrations have been suppressed, and intellectuals are once more being prosecuted before the courts."
"Leyla Zana - who I would remind you was awarded the Sakharov Prize by this Parliament - and three other members of the DEP are still being held in prison under intolerable conditions."
"The army has intensified its offensive in the Kurdish provinces: more than 3000 villages have already vanished from the map for refusing to respond to the cease-fire appeal made by the PKK on 15 December 1995."
"This situation, which has lasted all too long, is intolerable."
"The approval of the customs union was a bad solution, because it was perceived by the Turkish authorities as an encouragement to persevere."
"We should remember that those who asked us - almost begged us - to vote for that customs union were telling us that it would help to improve the situation, that it would strengthen our position."
"Well, before customs union, I was able to visit Leyla Zana and the imprisoned members of parliament, and now we can no longer do so."
"So we need to start taking action again, in every form and at every level, to secure respect for human rights and the opening of negotiations with the Kurdish organizations to find a peaceful political solution to the Kurdish question, which they have been demanding for a very long time."
"Let us not be indifferent, then, to the hunger strikers in the support of political prisoners."
"The adoption of our resolution is a logical continuation of this campaign, which has to be relaunched by the Commission and the Council, and also by national governments which are demonstrating culpable collusion, or even complicity. Take the case of France, the French Government, which is putting on the pressure to develop its trade relations and laughing both at human rights and at the rights of the Kurdish people."
"No more collusion."
"Freedom for Leyla Zana and all political prisoners."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we saw a number of things in Istanbul with our own eyes: the Turkish police evicting the leadership of human rights organizations from the premises they had rented during Habitat II; family members who had asked for news of missing relatives being intimidated by the police; a colleague from our own Group being detained for the simple misdemeanour of giving out an invitation to the seminar organized by the Greens; the chairman of the Green Group being grilled for a whole hour by the police because she had given a press conference on Habitat II."
"So we have now experienced these kinds of conditions for ourselves. Even more serious is what Turks who question existing policy have to endure in these circumstances."
"I was particularly struck by how utterly impossible it is to talk about the Kurdish question."
"You are immediately categorized as a terrorist and separatist sympathizer."
"We are thus very concerned at present for the hunger strikers, amongst them Leyla Zana, the winner of Parliament's Sakharov prize."
"We thus urge the Commission to give Parliament an interim report on the human rights situation."
"Human rights in Turkey, of course."
"Mr President, it is a matter of great regret to our group that we should feel obliged yet again to table a resolution about human rights in Turkey, but I feel we have a moral duty so to do."
"When as a Parliament we agreed to the customs union with Turkey, before Christmas, we did so on the strict understanding that steps would be taken to allow real freedom of speech and full respect for the human person."
"Sadly, it appears little or no progress has been made in this direction."
"For that reason we are, as a Parliament, continuing to withhold our agreement to the adoption of the regulation for the associated financial protocol and I find it hard to see how we could change our attitude."
"The reports of ill treatment, to which colleagues have referred, in Istanbul's prisons, are particularly disturbing."
"Then we have the former MP Leyla Zana and others who continue to be held in jail, while the famous writer Yasar Kemal continues to be harassed."
"So fresh initiatives may well need to be called for, and hence our proposals in the resolution to put the Kurdish issue and Turkey on the agenda of the OSCE and we would like to hear from the Commissioner on this subject and also maybe to explore other avenues."
"In any case we look to the Commission to provide us with the further reports promised to us on the human rights situation in Turkey."
"Mr President, the life of Carmelo Soria, a Spanish national and an official of the United Nations removed from his post in Chile, came to an end on 14 July 1976."
"He was tortured and murdered by Major Salinas Torres and NCO San Martín, members of the Directorate for National Intelligence."
"It is a paradox that on the anniversary of the beginning of the French Revolution, 14 July a democrat should have been murdered by the collaborators of the Chilean liberticide, General Pinochet."
"The Soria family, like the families of all the victims of that sinister era, demand justice."
"The dignity they deserve is the dignity they claim for their nearest and dearest; neither Carmelo Soria nor those who met this same tragic fate will recover it until the guilty are judged."
"Nobody is asking for a squaring of accounts, only that those who committed those barbarous deeds should be tried subject to guarantees - which their victims did not have - and should be sentenced."
"The transition to democracy in Chile is not proving an easy one."
"The military authorities are still playing too great a part in the social and political life of that nation."
"The Constitution grants Pinochet the right to appoint senators, a right which he exercises; that shows the extent to which Chilean democracy is controlled by Pinochet."
"That allows him to continue protecting those who collaborated or committed murder and carried out torture."
"This debate is not intended to be a criticism of the present government, it is only a call for the defence of human rights, a demand for dignity, and it must be a support for keeping up action before the courts."
"It may even encourage justice in Chile to act in freedom and without fear."
"It is a moral condemnation of the murderers and must be a living memorial to the victims, including Carmelo Soria."
"Without justice there is no democracy."
"Democracy, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, must be all-embracing, generous and indulgent with those who transgress and who, after being tried, demonstrate their wish to take part in democratic co-existence."
"But that has nothing to do with guilty silences which frustrate justice and bring democracy into disrepute."
"We here therefore ask the European Parliament today to raise its voice on behalf of the consolidation of democracy in Chile, denouncing the attempt at shameful side-stepping of justice in the case of the political murder of the European citizen Carmelo Soria."
"Naturally, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Mrs Miranda said, we are not motivated by malice or even by our repugnance when we remember the crime."
"We are motivated by the basic principle with which I began this speech, that is, that without justice there is no democracy."
"And the wish of this European Parliament, Mr President, is that Chile should live in full democracy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the terrible legacy of the Pinochet dictatorship has still not been overcome in Chile."
"There are still more than one thousand unsolved cases of disappeared people, the torturers and murderers have not been found and sentenced, crimes have not been atoned for!"
"An unconstitutional amnesty law still covers the period from 1973 to 1978!"
"Unfortunately I have to add that torture is still taking place in the prisons!"
"Five political prisoners still fear the death sentence and the Amnesty International annual report that has just appeared paints a shockingly gloomy picture."
"Today we are concerned with the case of a Spaniard working with CEPAL who was murdered by the Chilean secret service in 1976."
"His file was wrongly closed."
"But in fact we are concerned with far more than that, for the murder of Carmelo Soria is not an isolated case."
"It is urgently necessary for the amnesty law pronounced by murderers to be suspended and for the government, military and police apparatus to be purged completely of all those who committed crimes during the military dictatorship."
"The families have the right to know who murdered their relatives and that the perpetrators must atone for this."
"There must never, never be torture in Chile again!"
"With the forthcoming signature of the EU-Chile framework agreement President Frei will testify to that."
"Mr President, I turn to the case of Raghbir Singh Johal who is a journalist, editor of a Punjabi newspaper, who has lived peacefully in my constituency for many years and is known to me."
"He has been detained since 29 March 1995, for over 15 months, without charge or without trial."
"Amnesty International have produced, in February this year, a report entitled 'The wrongful detention of asylum seeker Raghbir Singh' ."
"He is currently awaiting deportation for, and I quote, ' reasons of national security and other reasons of a political nature, namely the fight against international terrorism' ."
"This House has often asserted that the rule of law rests on the presumption of innocence in the absence of the proof of guilt."
"In this particular case there is a prima-facie case of abuse of internationally recognized human rights."
"We therefore call upon the British Government either to produce evidence of complicity in international terrorism or to release Raghbir Singh Johal from custody forthwith."
"Mr President, our Europe is a place of boundless idealism."
"There are men and women donating their free time, their energies and their financial resources to help the child victims of the Chernobyl disaster who were exposed to radiation."
"To pursue this aim, there are hundreds of people, thousands of people, in the Member States who are giving what they can spare, certainly, but are also giving of themselves to help those children."
"They are sending convoys to Byelorussia, technical aid, medical aid, medicines, even offering those child victims of radiation the opportunity to spend holidays here in Europe, with our well-to-do families, families where people eat well, live well, enjoy freedom and health."
"And, so far, all this has gone very well."
"But what is happening now, Mr President?"
"What is happening, so we learn, is that the authorities in Minsk have refused to allow the non-governmental organizations that were providing regular supplies of medicines for Belarus's child victims of radiation to enter the country unless they agree to allow the authorities to be responsible for delivering those medicines."
"In other words, instead of those medicines going directly to those who need them, to their doctors and their hospitals, they are at present being diverted through other channels, and the bottom line is that we no longer know if they will ever reach the children."
"This is a scandalous situation."
"I believe it must stop, and we call upon the authorities in Minsk, the Byelorussian authorities, to cease their policy of obstruction and allow the non-governmental organizations to carry their aid - that vital aid - to the unfortunate child victims of Chernobyl."
"Mr President, the human rights situation is and remains a matter for concern."
"During the commemorations of Tiananmen Square 50 dissidents were arrested in order to prevent demonstrations."
"Nine of them are still in custody."
"Meanwhile new figures from Amnesty and other sources tell us that 2 000 executions were carried out in 1995 and that more than 3 000 new death sentences were imposed the year before that."
"There are hundreds of reasons why China deserves to be condemned worldwide for its serious abuses of human rights."
"The scandalous treatment of Mr Wei Jingsheng and the hundreds of thousands of citizens held in labour camps are just two of them."
"At the beginning of March China managed, after a lot of machinations, and despite great efforts on the part of the Union, to prevent the adoption of a highly critical resolution by the UN Committee on Human Rights."
"The difference was just one vote."
"I will conclude, Mr President. The Union must continue making China aware of its bad reputation and we must lobby for worldwide condemnation of China."
"Our standards and our respect for democracy make it imperative that we do so."
"We must not be distracted from this by any economic considerations."
"We must seek broad cooperation with other partners in order to exert as much pressure as possible."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, the absence of any policy towards the People's Republic of China on the part of the Union and the Member States is more apparent than real."
"Such a policy does exist - it is the old policy of reasons of State and the primacy of commercial interests."
"Only this Parliament seems willing to denounce it."
"Some will say that this is yet another manifestation of the marginal nature of this Parliament."
"For my part, I am convinced that the reverse is true."
"I believe that our Parliament, even if it is still being too timid, is in the process of laying the groundwork for a genuine policy towards a country which will be one of the major issues of the next century."
"A country the size of a continent, which both the governments of the Member States and the Commission persist in regarding as first and foremost a market to be conquered, where the law of every man for himself is becoming more and more important. And so they forget the reasons that lie at the origin of their union and they forget, too, and more importantly in my view, that this self-styled policy has a price - the liberty and democratic rights of 1, 200 million people, whether they be Hans, Uygurs, Tibetans, Mongols or Manchus."
"I believe that this difference between our Parliament and the other institutions does it great credit, and the recent positions adopted by the parliaments of Denmark and Luxembourg, by the Belgian Foreign Affairs Committee and by 200 members of the French Parliament, directly inspired by resolutions adopted by our Parliament relating to the invasion and occupation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China, are all eloquent proof of that."
"Today, we are preparing to vote on another important text."
"Starting from the denunciation of the position of Wei Jingsheng, an exemplary and central figure in the democratic and non-violent opposition to the Communist Government in Peking, what we want to emphasize is the situation of hundreds of thousands of prisoners of the laogai , thousands of people under sentence of death, tens of thousands of people subjected to torture."
"This reminder of the situation is, of course, addressed to the Chinese authorities, but even more so to the Union and to the Member States, urging Europe finally to break with this policy of de facto complicity with the current regime and not to reproduce in the case of China the Munich-style policy of appeasement that it adopted towards the Soviet Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, yet again attention of an unheeding public is being drawn to a very serious problem: I am referring to the increasing number of executions that are taking place in China, that are related to crimes of opinion and economic or tax offences and that are connected with the secret market in human organs for transplant: all of this is happening in clear contempt for important fundamental rights and proper process of the law."
"In those circumstances, the call for the immediate closure of the labour and detention camps, better known as the laogai , has a symbolic value also, as does the call to reopen the case of Wei Jingsheng, on the basis of an independent judicial review open to international observers, to put an end to the emblematic persecution of the most famous Chinese dissident who is being held in sanitary conditions that are a cause of concern."
"That is also the backdrop to our request to the Commission that it look at this and present to the House a report on the Union's current policy towards China."
"The Chinese are a great people and China is a great country but also an interesting economic and consumer market; that does not make it acceptable - and I am appealing to you here, Commissioner - that Europe should be the silent accomplice in an unacceptable trade in human lives and fundamental rights."
"Mr President, I should like to go back to another of the world's benighted countries, Nigeria."
"Despite international pressure things are going from bad to worse in Nigeria and there is no sign at all that those in power are prepared to allow the opposition any room for manoeuvre."
"Quite the opposite."
"The measures which the European Parliament has called for in earlier resolutions are manifestly not enough to make dictator Abacha see reason."
"Unfortunately too, I see too little serious criticism and measures from Africa itself and notably from the Organization of African Unity."
"I mention the OAU, Mr President, because Nigeria is also a responsibility of the African states."
"The motion for a resolution now before us - the third within a short space of time - talks of tightening sanctions."
"I think this is the only logical conclusion and we could take a new initiative here, which Mrs Maij-Weggen mentioned, namely a diplomatic boycott."
"Nothing else is going to work."
"Mr President, first let me say that I am not speaking on behalf of the EPP Group because this time I am representing a minority of the EPP."
"Mr Moorhouse has already spoken for the majority."
"I just want to say one thing on behalf of this minority: we are a liberal party which can represent different views."
"We systematically regard some nations as the whipping boys of the world and assert all kinds of things about them; it is quite clear that Turkey will figure among them."
"Yet Turkey ought to be our friend, that would be in the European interest."
"I at least take the view that we have been elected here in order to represent Europe, to represent European interests and not to go on some kind of worldwide excursions that may be wonderful but have no effect whatsoever."
"As Europeans it is simply our duty to say some things more clearly, that is in our interest."
"Mr President, I shall certainly not vote for these senseless resolutions."
"Thank you, Mr von Habsburg."
"I believe that we have in this Chamber 626 people who are free to express whatever view they wish."
"I would merely remind you, as I understand it, that you are down to express the view of your group."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that, sadly, again today we are going to be discussing China, the violations of human rights, the labour camps, the laogai and the executions that take place daily, but absolutely nothing will change today, tomorrow or the day after because business with China will go on, because the big business opportunities along that vast frontier are too important to the international market, because Europe is absolutely powerless, because we, my friends, count for absolutely nothing here."
"I therefore believe, Commissioner, that the time has come to do something concrete and stop going on about what we all, unfortunately, know: in China human rights are a utopian concept at this point in time."
"A word or two on Nigeria now, Mr President."
"Commissioner Marín is very familiar with the issue of cooperation with developing countries."
"In the case of Nigeria we have a weapon: let us throw Nigeria out of the Lomé Convention, Commissioner!"
"Mr President, as regards Nigeria, Mr Caccavale has said it for me: it is clear that the terror campaign waged by this regime continues unabated."
"Mrs Abiola's murder is proof enough of that."
"I would draw attention to the arrest of a new campaigner for democracy and the environment, Mr Nwimmo Bassey, who has been imprisoned for fear that he might become a new Ken Saro-Wiwa."
"Clearly it is not easy to put pressure on the military, but we have a number of instruments and we have a number of resolutions calling for those instruments to be used, otherwise there is no doubt that Abacha's men will go on wiping out the opposition."
"The announcement of the opening of registration for political parties for the 1998 elections shows that Abacha is not prepared to hold democratic elections."
"The conditions make it virtually impossible for the opposition parties to register."
"Once again, the European Union must keep banging the drum and in conjunction with other countries must use all means available to put as much pressure as possible on the Nigerian military regime."
"Mr President, on a point of procedure, not really about Nigeria."
"But it seemed a good time to make this point."
"If I were sitting in the visitors' gallery or if I were a journalist I would be a bit confused here."
"Why can we not take one subject at a time instead, notwithstanding the Commissioner's global horizons, of shunting back and forth between Nigeria, China and Eastern Patagonia?"
"We should not do that."
"It is not a serious way of doing things."
"Mr Bertens, that, as you know, is a problem that has been raised on several occasions, and you certainly did well to make use of a point of order, but that is not the way to resolve it."
"I think that the best way - and some of you have already done this - is to speak to your group chairman to get the Conference of Presidents to decide to find a better solution, given that this is something we all feel the need for."
"Mr President, I should like to speak to say something to Mr Bertens."
"I had the honour to be in the Chair during one of these sittings and Mrs D'Ancona and Mrs Lenz called attention to the fact that on the subject of human rights speeches flitted from one subject to another."
"I took up these concerns and reported them to the President, and the Parliament staff organized for us an ordered debate in which the various subjects referring to human rights were kept separate."
"Mr Bertens has perhaps not entirely noticed that now each of these subjects is separate on the agenda."
"At the end some speeches were intermingled, but during the whole of the debate the speeches were kept separate."
"Mr President, let us render unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's and unto God the things which be God's."
"Mr Bertens has already been given a partial reply by Mr Gutiérrez."
"It will probably not be completely satisfactory, but my invitation to refer the matter to your own group chairmen naturally stands."
"I feel I must refer again, Mr President, as other fellow-Members in this House have already done, to the concern aroused by repeated breaches of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Turkey, in spite of the fact that that country has signed the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and has undertaken to observe them - an undertaking which has not stopped their taking political prisoners, the maltreatment of those arrested - a situation which is all the more wretched since they are in a position in which they completely unable to defend themselves - and the violence against the Kurdish people, which has got worse since the customs agreement was signed."
"Such a situation represents on Turkey's part - and that has been said before - a violation of the spirit of the customs union and is sufficient reason for asking the Council and the Commission - to our regret - to urge the Turkish authorities to take steps to guarantee an end to such ill treatment, to free political prisoners and to end violence towards the Kurdish people."
"Mr President, it is unfortunate that we in the European Parliament are once again compelled to debate the issue of Indonesia."
"The Indonesian military's repression of the people is continuing and has recently been directed against the country's young people too, young people who only want the minimum human rights and freedoms to which all people of the world should really be entitled."
"The Indonesian authorities have also imprisoned enormous numbers of political prisoners and we naturally demand that they should be released as quickly as possible."
"While the Indonesian regime continues with this oppression the Member States of the EU should of course stop exporting arms and providing military assistance to Indonesia."
"To everyone's surprise arms exports from countries including Sweden and Finland have been restarted and exports of guns and ammunition have been resumed."
"This is taking place under the name of 'follow-up deliveries' ."
"Guns, however, are not spare parts, nor do they constitute follow-up deliveries."
"These activities are therefore totally unacceptable and must be stopped immediately."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, among the subjects under consideration in this House today is East Timor."
"One can only welcome that fact."
"The compromise text contains a few good things, in particular the denunciation of Indonesia's occupation of East Timor."
"But, alas, I fear that this hour's debate and the vote that will follow will do little to improve the lot of that small Catholic nation."
"In order for that to happen, our Governments would have to take specific action to obtain a commitment from Indonesia to respect international law, the more so since East Timor is under the sovereignty of a Member State - Portugal."
"Admittedly, after the 'carnation revolution' , the Portuguese administration collapsed and the territory fell into the hands of two rival factions - the Fretilin Communists and the Muslim factions in the pay of Indonesia."
"However, the unilateral proclamation of the independence of Timor by the Communists on 28 November 1975 is no more legitimate than the annexation of these Catholic territories by Indonesia on 31 May 1976."
"No one consulted either the population of East Timor or Portugal as the sovereign power."
"Since then, the 500, 000 Catholic Timorese, who have become a minority in a State populated by 160 million Muslims, have been suffering the fate familiar to all Christian communities in Muslim countries - annihilation."
"The alternative offered by the Communist movement is not much of an improvement."
"It is up to us, confronted by these two forms of totalitarianism which are threatening our own countries too, to offer the Timorese another alternative - the reestablishment of Portuguese sovereignty."
"Mr President, I met Mr Raghbir Singh Johal's wife several months ago at one of the largest Sikh gurdwaras in Europe: there were some several thousand people in the Sedgely Street Temple in Wolverhampton."
"She was absolutely distraught."
"She could not talk to me properly because she was crying so much, she was so worried over the detention of her husband."
"It cannot be right, in 1996, that a democratic country imprisons without trial or without charge a man for over 15 months."
"I must pay tribute to the British Sikh Federation and to the National Union of Journalists who have campaigned tirelessly on behalf of Mr Singh Johal."
"But this Parliament which - let us be honest and open with each other - is the very physical embodiment of democracy in 15 separate European countries must send a clear message to the British Government: either produce the explicit evidence that shows that Raghbir Singh Johal is actually involved with international terrorism, or release him immediately."
"That must be our simple, strong, clear message from this House."
"Mr President, I find it deeply depressing to have to return for the umpteenth time to the subject of Turkey, particularly after the approval of the customs union."
"There are at least two areas in which that country must sooner or later change it ways."
"First, on respect for human rights, where practices and shortcomings in disregard of everything that the international community stands for are still continuing."
"Then there is the behaviour towards a Member State of the European Union and towards other Mediterranean neighbours of Turkey which is seriously inconsistent with the philosophy and principles of the Barcelona procedure and international law."
"Mr President, the policy being pursued by Turkey in the region is generating problems and posing a threat to the security and stability of the European Union's south-eastern corner."
"Turkey must therefore be sent a message from here to put its behaviour to rights."
"Mr President, the arguments put to the European Parliament by the representatives of the Commission and the Council six months ago as the supposed case for eliciting our support for the customs union with Turkey are still ringing in my ears."
"What did they tell us?"
"That we should approve the customs union as a means to curbing the threat from the Islamists, namely from the party of Mr Erbakan."
"That by approving it we would be helping the cause of human rights. That there would be big economic benefits for the Turkish people."
"Now, Mr President, six months later, the party of Mr Erbakan has become the biggest party in the Turkish parliament, and as Mr Lake's report, which you have to hand, shows, the situation on human rights and democracy has deteriorated."
"The Commission's representative in Turkey has sent a report to the Commission which makes it clear that the human rights situation has worsened."
"And as to the economic benefits, just ask the Turkish people."
"There is something else as well. Something which has been worrying me a great deal."
"All the main Turkish newspapers have carried a story stating that Mr Yilmaz told his parliamentary party that when Mrs Çiller was asked by President Demirel what had happened to the 6.5 million dollars of secret appropriations that were found to be missing after her fall from power, she replied that the money had been used for 'buying' the customs union!"
"What did she mean by that, Mr President?"
"What did 'buying the customs union' involve?"
"Whom did she buy?"
"The Commission must give a response to this claim by Mrs Çiller, because we have a duty to give an answer to those who are watching and listening from the gallery, to the people of Europe, that is."
"Mr President, the current list of human rights violations in Turkey is a long one: illtreatment of detainees, disappearance or death of prisoners."
"The facts complained of are virtually always the same, quite a strange situation in a member of the Council of Europe which has subscribed to the values of liberty and respect for human dignity."
"Strange or not, as long as Turkey refuses to declare out-and-out war on torture, the hope of putting an end to this shameful situation will be a vain one."
"As long as Turkey can shelter behind the provisions of Article 11 of the Convention against torture - and thus oppose the publication of the reports in which the Control Commission, whose job it is, denounces these violations - human rights will be violated behind a cloak of anonymity, not to say general indifference."
"The customs union between the European Union and Turkey, as it may be necessary to remind those honourable Members who prematurely ratified it, is producing very disappointing results when we recall the charm offensive carried on by Turkey before December 1995 - in other words, before the ratification of the customs union."
"Mr President, let us at least have the courage to enforce transparency upon Turkey when it comes to respect for human rights."
"Mr President, all those who know, love and value Belarus and the people who live there are noting with great concern that human rights violations in that country are becoming a constant theme here."
"There are continuous reports about the decline in democracy in that country."
"Belarus is isolating itself more and more."
"Wide circles of Belarussians, and not just the Popular Front but also the non-governmental organizations and the liberal democratic and social democratic forces within the Belarussian Parliament are making efforts to direct this process of transformation towards reforms."
"Yet the stubborn line taken by the government keeps destroying these efforts."
"We must continue to support the democratic forces in that country by adhering consistently to our decisions."
"We should constantly remind the Belarussian Government that in signing the interim agreement it has also signed the democracy clause, which we consider important."
"It is incomprehensible why the Belarussian Government is playing down the decision by this Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs and dismissing it as personal animosity."
"Mr President, let us go back to the case of Chile, and for our part we think this debate is not only appropriate but even essential since the European Parliament must not stand idly by whilst justice and international law are flouted by the disguised trap of an amnesty or pardon which is really only a cover for the concealment of unacceptable acts such as the case of the murder of the Spanish national, Mr Carmelo Soria in Chile in July 1976, most of all today when a recent, though respectable, democracy is already established in Chile."
"Chilean democracy is indeed recent but we must still acknowledge that the level of democracy in Chile is fortunately amongst the most consolidated on the Latin-American continent."
"Since that is the real position it is not right to look away when there, years ago, human rights were trampled under foot and justice has not been done."
"Mr President, just one comment on the resolution about the behaviour of the authorities in Minsk, Belarus."
"We note in this resolution that medical aid is being provided in Minsk by independent NGOs, medical aid for children damaged by Chernobyl."
"They are truly independent NGOs."
"Their aim is to supply medicines to the children in Belarus affected by radiation, and these NGOs are simply not allowed by the Minsk authorities to supply them direct."
"They are told they must deliver to the Government."
"We find that very strange."
"We would like to know if the Commissioner understands why the authorities are behaving in this way."
"What lies behind it?"
"We would also ask the Commissioner if he is prepared to use our existing ties with Belarus to find out what the situation is there in regard to this matter."
"Mr President, I speak about China and in particular the case of Wei Jingsheng."
"When the delegation of the European Parliament was in China last month we were repeatedly asked: why so many resolutions?"
"So far 24 have been tabled in Parliament on the subject of China and human rights."
"The explanation is quite simple."
"The European Parliament follows the Treaty and in its declaration on relations with China the Council, on 4 December 1995, stated that the basic goals of the EU in relations with China are: the promotion of democracy, structures based on the rule of law and respect for human rights."
"In the case of Wei Jingsheng it is precisely the rule of law which is not being upheld; not the rule of law of the European Union but the rule of law of China itself because he is being held in detention, he has not been charged, and he has been in this state now for 14 years."
"It is because China ignores basic human rights and ignores its own so-called rule of law that we are able to criticize."
"On this occasion I hope that Parliament will support this resolution and the amendment tabled which asks the Commission to state whether it will take human rights into account in its recommendation on China's request to join the World Trade Organization."
"With regard to Indonesia I must mention in the first place, Mr President, that the Commission has protested to the Indonesian Government on numerous occasions about the human rights situation in that country."
"Those protests include not only requests to come to a fair agreement respecting the aspirations of the people of East Timor but also criticism of unjustifiable acts, the need for impartial judgments, appropriate legal representation and access to prisoners in general."
"In December 1995 the presidency made representations to the Indonesian Government with regard to the sentences imposed on journalists."
"As you know, the question of human rights was also raised at the last AsiaEurope meeting held in Bangkok in March 1995."
"The President's final declaration made it clear that a dialogue should be initiated on the basis of mutual respect, equality and defence of human rights."
"Similarly the firm commitment to the United Nations Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the action programme of the World Conference on Human Rights was reaffirmed at that meeting."
"The Commission supports the project - to reply to a question by Mr Telkämper - of possibly sending a delegation of the European Parliament to Indonesia; and the Commission will naturally continue to defend human rights and fundamental freedoms in its relations with the Indonesian Government."
"I now turn to the speeches about Nigeria."
"There can be no doubt that the Commission shares with all speakers their regret at the recent murder of Mrs Abiola."
"The circumstances of her death are still, up to a point, mysterious."
"The Commission recently launched an analysis of the present European Union measures against Nigeria, applied following the hanging of Ken Saro-Wiwa in November 1995."
"The Commission in fact considers that new measures should be adopted, particularly to lend greater support to the Nigerian groups committed to the fight for democracy and human rights and that additional sanctions should be studied along the lines of freezing assets and against the oil industry."
"The purpose of these measures would be to hasten the peaceful withdrawal of the military from the positions of power in the Nigerian Government and the election of a coalition government, accompanied by the restoration of human rights and the independence of the judiciary."
"The Commission assures the Members of the European Parliament that it is doing everything in its power within the limits of its authority to speed up the peaceful transition to a democratically elected government in Nigeria."
"In this connection we are studying how to step up the dialogue with the Nigerian authorities on these matters."
"The possibility of expelling Nigeria from the Lomé Convention has been mentioned."
"But from the experience we have had on other previous occasions which I do not need to quote, when the Commission has tried to do that but has failed, we must be very cautious before putting that type of decision into practice."
"In any case I have told you that the Commission is in favour of introducing additional sanctions."
"With regard to Burma, the Commission shares with honourable Members their concern at the recent arrest of 262 elected members of the opposition and the continued threats from the government -the military Junta of Myanmar - to the democratic movements since that Junta cut short the beginnings of democracy in 1990."
"The Commission continues to monitor the internal situation in Myanmar carefully but, apart from the freeing of Aung San Suu Kyi in July last year, there has been no sign of significant improvement in respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms or of any steps taken towards the restoration of democracy."
"Consequently it may be said that the problem of Burma continues to be a matter for concern and that it is impossible to trace any progress on the part of the authorities of that country."
"That has led to the Commission's proposing to cancel all benefits of the system of generalized preferences in favour of that country, and this will be the first case in which the new arrangements envisaged in the system of generalized preferences in the event of failure to observe human rights have been put into force."
"As regards Turkey it must be recognized that since the general election in December 1995 it has been experiencing a serious crisis."
"Last March the then Prime Minister, Mr Yilmaz, in his inaugural speech, clearly placed the strengthening of democracy in Turkey on his government's programme; the Prime Minister similarly made certain positive statements on the cultural rights of the Kurdish people in Turkey."
"During the visit of my colleague Mr van den Broek to Turkey last April and during Prime Minister Yilmaz's visit to President Santer at the beginning of this month the Commission had the opportunity to tell our Turkish partners again of the importance which it - like the European Parliament - attached to the continuation of the reforms initiated last year and the putting into practice of Mr Yilmaz's statements in this connection."
"It is no secret that the coalition government in Turkey has not lasted very long and it is clear that the accepted by the then Prime Minister, Mr Yilmaz, will be hard to fulfil."
"And not only did that process cease from the second half of last year - at least as far as declarations are concerned - but we are sorry to note also that there have been fresh dubious happenings in Turkey, which increase our concern in the matter of human rights."
"In any case, conscious of the concerns of the European Parliament, we intend to continue the dialogue on these questions as soon as there is a new government team in Turkey."
"Mr Moorhouse has asked the Commission to send an annual report on the human rights situation and the progress of the democratic process in Turkey."
"That annual report will be sent to Parliament in October."
"With regard to Chile, the Commission agrees with honourable Members that Mr Carmelo Soria indeed murdered and on those grounds the Commission's own delegation in Santiago de Chile has taken various steps to bring this to the notice of the competent national authorities."
"I must also tell you, that following the line expressed in the resolution, specific representations were made on 5 June - only a fortnight ago - by the Troika in Santiago de Chile; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was informed of the need to make this case the epitome of what ought to be seen in practice from justice and the review of a case which, as I said, is nothing but a political murder."
"As regards Chernobyl and Belarus, the Commission has been informed of the restrictions imposed by the Government of Belarus on independent non-government organizations."
"Both situations must give us concern but in different ways."
"In fact no government action must interfere with the distribution of humanitarian aid in Belarus or in any other geographical region."
"However, the Commission can tell you that the European Union's aid programmes in Belarus are proceeding normally and at least the non-government organizations working with the Union have not raised any complaint or reported any interference from the Government of Belarus."
"Human rights are another matter."
"In this case the Commission gave our views to the Prime Minister, Mr Tshygir, in March 1996 and more recently to the Foreign Minister, Mr Syanko."
"In addition the ambassadors of the Member States also made further diplomatic representations on 13 June to make our concern clear."
"The Commission will continue to keep a careful watch on the human rights situation in Belarus, including freedom of the press, so that it can constantly keep bilateral cooperation between the European Union and Belarus under review."
"Finally, China."
"The question of human rights in China has been systematically taken up within the political dialogue with that country, the last meeting for which was held on 14 June in Beijing."
"The fact is that apart from some significant reforms - such as the new legislation amending the Chinese law of criminal procedure - the human rights situation remains a source of disquiet to the European Union and the motions submitted by honourable Members contain precisely those matters which the European Union is to raise with China as a matter of priority."
"The Commission will inform Parliament at a later date how those contacts have developed."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0736/96 by Mr Bertens and Mrs Larive, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on nuclear tests; -B4-0768/96 by Ms Malone and Mr D'Ancona, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and China; -B4-0788/96 by Mr Mamère and Mr Dupuis, on behalf of the ARE group, on nuclear tests in China; -B4-0805/96 by Mr Piquet and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL group, on the fresh Chinese nuclear test and the negotiations on the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty; -B4-0812/96 by Ms McKenna and others, on behalf of the V Group, on Chinese nuclear testing and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty negotiations; -B4-0830/96 by Mr Fabra Vallés and Mr Oostlander, on behalf of the PPE Group, on Chinese nuclear testing."
"Mr President, time is now getting short for completion of the talks on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty."
"These talks have to completed by the end of next week, or the signing ceremony cannot take place in September during the next session of the UN General Assembly."
"Compromises on verification mechanisms and the conditions for the Treaty's entry into force are currently being worked out."
"China has finally agreed to things which may mean that it cannot conduct further peaceful nuclear tests."
"That at least is something."
"The bad news, meantime, is that India has announced today that it will not sign up to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty."
"International pressure must be brought to bear to change India's mind."
"The difficult negotiations are also constantly being undermined by what is going on on the ground."
"China's recent nuclear test and the announcement that it is to carry out another one before September is a slap in the face to the negotiators."
"Moreover, Mr President, the American announcement that subcritical nuclear tests are to be postponed till next year is not exactly encouraging either and detracts from the credibility of this forthcoming CTBT."
"America, China and India must all realize that they are jeopardizing everything which has been achieved so far in respect of nuclear arms reduction."
"Mr President, at exactly this time last year you will recall that there was worldwide condemnation of the French nuclear tests and this Parliament told President Chirac in no uncertain terms here in this hemicycle what we thought of his government's actions."
"I deeply regret that the People's Republic of China has now carried out a nuclear test after the conclusion of the NPT Conference."
"In the resolution before us today we call on the Chinese Government to abide by the moratorium adopted at international level."
"The Chinese must understand that the continuation of nuclear testing is incompatible with implementation of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty."
"The Chinese Government insists that it should be permitted to carry on with peaceful nuclear explosions or PNEs."
"A PNE programme can form part of a nuclear research and development programme and the organization Greenpeace contends that a significant reason for China's attraction to PNEs comes from encouragement by weapons scientists in both Russia and the United States."
"These scientists are unable to pursue PNEs in their own countries due to environmental and cost reasons."
"With regard to recital E in the compromise text I should like just to point out that I was not involved in the negotiations and I wonder if there would be any way of getting agreement on a change because there is an inaccuracy."
"The factual situation is that China is proposing that peaceful nuclear explosions should be reconsidered at a review conference ten years after the Test Ban Treaty enters into force and that review should be automatic unless a majority of parties vote against it."
"Would it be possible to take a split vote on recital E?"
"We were concerned last year - as were millions throughout the world - at the health and environmental consequences resulting from the testing in the South Pacific at Mururoa and most Members here will recall the public hearing held here in Parliament which dealt extensively with this issue of health and public safety."
"I do not know and I am not qualified to say what the consequences of the recent tests will be on the health of the people living in the Lop Nor region."
"But there are obviously concerns there and it is right that Parliament should voice these concerns."
"I ask all Members to support this resolution."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, as this House prepares to vote on this motion for a resolution calling upon China to put a stop to its nuclear tests - which our entire group will of course be supporting - I look around in vain, I must say, for the Fausto Bertinottis and Carlo Ripa di Meanas and their like, our friends in the socialist group, our friends of the United Left, our friends in the Green group who were so active, so determined just a few months ago when, disdaining the most elementary courtesy, they were attacking President Chirac in a manner that we all remember."
"I am looking for their banners, their streamers, and I see nothing at all."
"Can I assume that the People's Republic of China's nuclear tests are safe, or somehow different?"
"Mr President, let me take a few seconds to tell the honourable Member that there are some of us here from the European United Left, and I am one of them."
"As for the Greens, I can see them too, they are here, and I see no banners or streamers."
"I think that brings me to the start of my speech, but perhaps it was necessary to open our friend's eyes and ears so that he can follow what I say."
"Just after announcing that it would be applying a moratorium on testing from September, China went ahead on 8 June with its 44th underground nuclear test."
"It must be admitted that this is not the best way of reaching a successful conclusion to the negotiations currently taking place in Geneva on the Treaty to prohibit nuclear testing."
"On behalf of my group, I join in the international chorus of protest and I condemn the Chinese nuclear test just as I recently condemned the series of tests by the French Government."
"A ban on nuclear tests, including laboratory testing, represents the essential first step down the road to disarmament, to non-proliferation and to the elimination of all nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction."
"Our group calls upon all parties to the current Geneva negotiations - and especially the Member States - to do everything possible to ensure that those negotiations end, before the 28 June deadline, with an agreement readopting the zero option - in other words, the prohibition of all testing of nuclear weapons and any other kind of nuclear explosion, supplemented by an effective international verification and control system."
"So I welcome the fact that the compromise motion for a resolution embodies the essence of these proposals."
"By adopting it we shall be able to give a clear signal to the negotiators in Geneva and at the UN General Assembly, to open up the prospect of a test ban and the establishing of a binding timetable of nuclear disarmament with a view to the total elimination of all nuclear weapons."
"Finally, let me tell Mr Dupuis that I did not have a visa to attend the Intergovernmental Conference on Women in Peking, perhaps because I have too frequently annoyed China in this House."
"So I stand in need of no lessons from you, and nor does my group."
"Mr President, allow me to reply in person to the somewhat provocative remarks of our young colleague."
"My group did indeed demonstrate with banners and streamers, outside the Chinese Embassy because it is at China that such action should be aimed."
"Moreover, if the President of China were to appear in this House we should do the same, and I should be glad if Mr Dupuis would join us."
"Mr Aelvoet, of course that was not a personal statement: it was in fact a political comment on what the previous speaker had to say."
"At any event, the Chinese President will not be able to come here."
"That, I believe, is out of the question!"
"Mr President, thanks to your wise words, I shall give up my speaking time."
"I wish only to say that I note what Mr Aelvoet said - evidently, it seemed to me also that it was certainly not a personal statement."
"As far as I am concerned Mr Chirac got all he deserved here."
"In fact, if I had my way, he would not even have been allowed in Parliament."
"We have always been outspoken about condemning nuclear tests."
"Now, just to get back to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty currently being negotiated in Geneva: there must not be any loopholes to allow countries to conduct nuclear tests."
"If it is not watertight it means that certain countries will find ways of carrying out nuclear experiments and producing absurd arguments about how they are essential for world peace, just as Mr Chirac did during the debate on the French testing in Mururoa last year."
"What Mrs Malone said is very true: recital E is actually misleading."
"China has long favoured an exemption from that treaty for so-called peaceful nuclear explosions."
"This concept originated in the US in 1957 as a method of investigating the non-military uses of nuclear explosives."
"The whole concept is an actual farce because the results of these 'peaceful' explosions can easily be used to develop weapons of war."
"For example, India described its only nuclear test as a 'peaceful nuclear explosion' , but it still used the results to develop its weapons programme."
"The other sad fact is that this Parliament does not really have the moral high ground to condemn nuclear tests after our failure on the whole issue of France's nuclear tests and nor does the Commission because the Commission sat on its hands when it had the power to do something and it did not do anything!"
"The Member States which let France go ahead with its nuclear tests all have dirt on their hands, so we cannot take the moral high ground here."
"Mr President, there is no getting away from the fact that nuclear tests run counter to the letter and spirit of the nuclear weapons reduction treaties because they are intended to promote qualitative improvement of nuclear weapons, which is of greater significance than an increase in their quantity or their geographical proliferation."
"Likewise, there is no getting away from the fact that China should cease carrying out nuclear tests immediately."
"Mr President, if we want to steer clear of displaying double standards, it is important that we call on China to do what we called on France to do, namely to halt nuclear testing immediately."
"Mr President, I am glad that, following the underground nuclear tests in the Lop Nor desert in China, honourable Members have stressed in their motion for a resolution the importance and urgency of the question of the Treaty on a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing."
"Following approval of the extension for an indefinite period of the Treaty on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in May 1995, for which the European Union made an unprecedented diplomatic effort, there is today a new opportunity in the context of multilateral nuclear disarmament which, in the Commission's opinion, the international community must not miss."
"The signing of a Comprehensive Nuclear Weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty including the zero option is a fundamental objective of the common foreign and security policy."
"For that purpose the Commission associated itself with the European Union's declaration on 22 April last year."
"That declaration emphasizes the importance of negotiations to make it possible to sign the Treaty in the autumn, precisely at the opening of the Fifty-First General Assembly of the United Nations."
"Similarly it would be appropriate to try to ensure that the Treaty is a universal one and that its application on an international scale may be genuinely monitored."
"Consequently the next week is of fundamental importance and I am sure that all the Member States of the European Union and the associated States will make an effort so that it may be possible as I said to turn the need to sign this Comprehensive Nuclear Weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty at the next opening of the General Assembly of the United Nations into a reality."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0770/96 by Mr Sauquillo Pérez del Arco and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the assassination of humanitarian relief workers in Burundi; -B4-0779/96 by Mr André-Léonard and others, on behalf of the ELDR group, on Burundi; -B4-0786/96 by Mr Pradier, on behalf of the ARE Group, on the murder of three members of the ICRC in Burundi; -B4-0789/96 by Mrs Baldi and others, on behalf of the UPE Group, on the murder of three ICRC delegates in Burundi; -B4-0798/96 by Mr Pettinari, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the assassination of three ICRC delegates in Burundi; -B4-0821/96 by Mr Aelvoet and Mr Telkämper, on behalf of the V Group, on Burundi; -B4-0824/96 by Mr Günther and others, on behalf of the PPE Group, on the situation in Burundi."
"Mr President, first I should like to propose an oral amendment to the joint motion for a resolution. It is to add at the end of paragraph 5 a request to the Commission to retain its office in Burundi."
"In the past week - since the tabling of this motion for a resolution on the death in Burundi of humanitarian aid staff - a further 70 civilians, this time Hutus, have been murdered."
"All deaths have the same value, but the murder of three members of the International Committee of the Red Cross marks a qualitative change in the scale of the conflict."
"For the first time there has been an attack on the international presence which plays a fundamental rôle in the attempt to contain of the conflict by means of humanitarian aid."
"At every significant stage in this war the European Parliament has approved a resolution with specific proposals."
"Now that we are about to vote on one more we have to wonder about the point of this type of action."
"Politics take on a purpose only if they extend to practice and do not keep repeating the same thing, each time with less impact."
"If the results obtained constantly fall short of our proposals, then apart from the human tragedy, in this case for the population of Burundi, we must reflect upon our own performance and the effectiveness of our institution, the European Parliament."
"In Burundi peace will be possible only if it is possible to achieve an international agreement on an effective arms embargo with sanctions for those who fail to observe it; supervision of the disarmament of all the parties involved, militias and armed forces; and the holding of immediate official negotiations under the supervision of an international authority and in the presence of observers."
"The negotiations would have to involve reform of the army and of the police, a solution to the problem of refugees and displaced persons under international supervision, the establishment of an effective judiciary and of a system for protecting humanitarian aid and staff."
"However, neither the Commission nor the Council nor the Member States of the European Union individually have provided the resources for these measures to be applied or consequently for peace to be a reality in Burundi."
"Once again we condemn the situation but we also wish to condemn the failure to put these measures into practice."
"Mr President, in view of what has happened in Burundi during the last few months, we are indeed divided between the temptation to lapse into somewhat gloomy resignation and the determination to silence the guns and those who serve them."
"In this very House dozens of texts, some more thunderous than others, declarations of all kinds, tons of paper and gallons of ink have been expended, and massacres in Burundi continue unaffected, claiming several hundred victims every week."
"Far from regarding ourselves as blameless, Mr President, we need to accept that we bear our share of responsibility for the lorry loads of corpses being shovelled into the communal graves in that country."
"And even today, when the International Committee of the Red Cross, the specialized United Nations Organizations like the WFP, the UNCD and the WHO are pulling out and even the non-governmental organizations are pulling out, we of the European Union can at least try two gestures."
"The first is to stay put; the second is to maintain a rapid reaction force on the borders, capable of being deployed in a few hours."
"The mediation missions under Mr Nyerere and Mr Ajello have been stonewalled by the mistrust between the various factions, and especially the attitude of the extremists; the Belgian and French schools in Bujumbura have been closed; French military and civil cooperation has been suspended; the activities of some NGOs have been suspended; the national political dialogue has reached deadlock, with violence escalating in the hinterland; and - let us not mince words, Mr President - the army has been using violence against the civilian population."
"And yet there is no shortage of international diplomatic initiatives working to restore peace."
"But the impression one gets is that there are arguments for and against each of them, to the point where none of them make any progress."
"The intransigence shown by some of them is dangerous, because it threatens to plunge the country in despair, opening the door for the settling of scores."
"That is what the extremists have long wanted, and with each day that passes they become more difficult to control."
"So, Mr President, when are we going to see an arms embargo?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if there is one subject on which I think everything possible has been said and said so many times without any adequate action being taken, it is the situation in Burundi."
"We have here a special kind of civil war in which it is wrong to speak of extremist groups because it is a generally acknowledged fact that the Burundian army itself is a party to the conflict."
"Last Friday I entertained a delegation of parliamentarians from Burundi."
"I was given a whole list of killings in a particular diocese, the diocese of Muinga, from which it is clear that the army itself is blamed for half of all the cases."
"If you add the case of the three Red Cross workers, whose deaths prompted the urgent debate here today, and the fact that it is known that these Red Cross people were murdered by the Burundian army, then there is more to this than crimes committed by extremist groups."
"We really do face a fundamental political problem here."
"There are two things which need to be said."
"Firstly, the political dialogue so vigorously advocated by Nyerere is currently blocked in Tanzania due to Uprona's refusal to sign the agreement which was reached, thereby making the political situation even worse."
"Secondly, it must be pointed out that all the international organizations are currently in the process of pulling out, including the representatives of the European Commission."
"As regards the latter, I would earnestly recommend that the people there are given the protection which they themselves have requested."
"I also think it has to be said that an international intervention force should be on standby in the region to take action if things should escalate further, and no one can ignore the fact that the danger of that happening is very real."
"Mr President, honourable Members have rightly condemned the climate of violence again present in Burundi."
"I shall therefore confine myself to putting a question to the Commission - a request for clarification in relation to the fact that in recent days and weeks the violence has become directed towards the humanitarian organizations present in Burundi."
"It seems evident to me that by striking at those organizations, the more violent factions are seeking to tear asunder one of instruments still available to those who are currently striving in Burundi for peace and civil coexistence."
"I am then asking how and whether the European Union is seeking to prevent those organizations from abandoning Burundi."
"I also consider it very important that we reconfirm our full commitment to this continued humanitarian presence, to be demonstrated in two ways: first of all by guaranteeing that European aid will continue to arrive directly with the population and, secondly, by ensuring that the staff of the humanitarian organizations enjoy adequate protection."
"Here too, I believe that the Commission can take further steps to secure improved protection."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in this joint resolution we call for three things: creating an international force, abiding fully by the Carcassonne action plan and providing assistance for the restoration of an effective system of justice."
"Let me follow this up with a few other questions."
"What has become of our calls for the dissolution of the armed militia?"
"What has become of our call for support for the OAU so that it can join in implementing this global action plan?"
"What has become of our call for the legal prosecution of criminal offenders and for aid for the restoration of the certainty of justice?"
"What has become of the proposal to send out human rights experts under the umbrella of the UNHCR?"
"And what has become, for instance, of our call for some pressure to be put on the Security Council to keep the conflicting parties apart?"
"We already called for that last month!"
"What has become of Parliament's call for the Council and the Member States to draw up emergency plans in case the violence should escalate and to create safety zones to protect the civilian population?"
"We called for that too in May this year!"
"What has become of our call for support to be given to the special envoy of the United Nations in organizing regional conferences on peace and security and making comprehensive, emergency financial aid available in order to stabilize the Burundian state before this escalation occurred?"
"What became of the document on preventive diplomacy of December last year that was accepted by the Council?"
"What became of the measures we called for in order to protect the humanitarian workers and what is to become of our appeals today?"
"Mr President, when in recent years the massacres began in Rwanda there were those who said that Europe was unprepared, that we had not in fact grasped the serious threat that was affecting the region of the Great Lakes."
"Today, in the case of Burundi, no-one can claim that; no-one can claim that we were unaware of the danger threatening that region torn apart by ethnic rivalry, by age-old hatreds which surfaced in the form of unthinkable, unprecedented massacres, unparalleled in that region in recent years."
"The most recent incident that has come to our attention is of particular concern to the Red Cross, some of whose delegates have been assassinated, but continues to affect Burundi's civilian population that suffers acts of banditry and daily violence, and that should not leave us helpless."
"I believe that clear action is now needed: I am calling upon the Commission to take an initiative to set up an international force ready to intervene - including militarily - in Burundi, with global action by the European Union directed towards an effective common policy in the region."
"Mr President, once again today we see that the world is letting slip a chance of using active, preventive diplomacy to stop a conflict from escalating."
"The bloodbath in Burundi which involved members of the Red Cross and other NGOs is bound to have repercussions."
"How long does the international community think that the NGOs will go on providing humanitarian aid if they remain targets for uncontrolled young people and gangs?"
"When are we at last going to decide to accept our responsibilities?"
"We seem to get nowhere when we ask for the Carcassonne action plan to be carried out."
"It does not seem as if an international military force for Burundi is going to get off the ground."
"Srebrenica must not mean that we are never again willing to take part in peace-keeping operations under UN auspices."
"We must accept our responsibility, even if it is just in training and helping to set up an African military presence."
"And further work is needed on the political front too."
"Nyerere's initiative, as has already been said, is very welcome, and so is the European special envoy."
"Mr President, the tribal warfare between Hutus and Tutsis is escalating again, this time in Burundi."
"Extremists on both sides have gained control there."
"The Tutsi army is losing its hold on the countryside and various Hutu guerilla movements are increasingly carrying out attacks in a number of regions."
"And the civil war is increasingly becoming regional in character."
"It is also worth pointing to the extremely dubious role being played by President Mobutu of Zaïre."
"He says he wants the Rwandan and Burundian refugees to return to their homeland, but in reality he is supporting the Hutu rebels."
"There are even indications that the Zaïrean army is helping the Hutus with ethnic cleansing."
"The media too play an important part in the ethnic conflict."
"One even hears talk of a Hutu press and a Tutsi press."
"Last time the conflict in the Great Lakes region was discussed it was still possible to argue in favour of a regional conference."
"That time is now past."
"Ending the bloodshed must now be the first priority."
"International intervention in Burundi is thus a matter of urgency."
"The question is whether intervention in Burundi alone might not simply move the conflict to the neighbouring countries of Rwanda and Zaïre."
"The main question is which country should take the lead in any intervention in the Great Lakes region."
"Following its action in Somalia the USA has intimated that it is prepared to send equipment but not troops."
"It is also doubtful whether France will take the lead in view of that country's close involvement with the parties in the region."
"The fear thus seems justified that following a disaster of the kind which occurred in Rwanda objections to intervention will disappear."
"But for thousands of people it will then be too late."
"Mr President, the Commission profoundly regrets the murder of three Red Cross delegates and the threats recently made against their colleagues in Burundi."
"This is tragic evidence of a security situation which is rapidly deteriorating."
"On the other hand it shows the risk run by staff at present working on the aid programmes in Burundi which in our opinion has reached such a pitch as to be barely acceptable."
"The Commission has therefore decided, in close consultation with the Member States, to evacuate from Burundi families and staff not regarded as essential."
"However the Commission will continue to be represented on the spot and to support the efforts to re-establish peace and stability in the region and in Burundi in particular."
"Missions from the troika have visited Burundi, various diplomatic representations have been made and both the Union and the European Parliament have put forward various resolutions."
"The European Union is trying to play an active part in these efforts as is very clearly shown by the appointment of Mr Aldo Ajello as a special envoy of the European Union in the region."
"Mr Ajello is already recognized as a valuable partner in the quest for peace."
"His mandate is to support the actions which are in progress - in particular those of ex-President Nyerere - and to press for a regional conference under the auspices of the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations."
"In all these diplomatic and political initiatives the message has been identical: violence must stop at once; a dialogue of national reconciliation must be opened; there is no possible military solution; peace and stability in Burundi - and in all the region - can only be re-established at the negotiating table."
"We place great hopes in the laudable efforts of ex-President to unite, or reunite, the parties to the conflict round the negotiating table in Tanzania."
"The Commission, for its part, has done everything possible to support this initiative and those of the other prominent figures who are devoting their talents and experience to finding a peaceful settlement to the conflicts in the region."
"Since the beginning of the crisis in the Great Lakes region the Community budget has made available more than US$ 700 million in humanitarian aid and rehabilitation work."
"Considerable sums are still available and the Commission would be prepared to release them as soon as the political, security and human rights situation allows."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m."
"Votes"
"Mr President, in Amendment No 4 by Mr Pex there is a problem in the English translation."
"Could you ask the author of the amendment if he could explain the phrase 'decisions taken on improper grounds' ."
"It does not make sense in English."
"Mr President, Mr Pex has asked me to say that the Dutch text is the original text. Unfortunately the chairman of the Committee on Petitions is not able to read the Dutch text, but it is perfectly clear."
"Mr President, I am against this amendment."
"It is quite improper in the English language and it is quite contrary to the Treaty."
"We cannot accept this amendment in its present form."
"Mr Pex knows that and has admitted so to me."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, firstly I would like to congratulate the Ombudsman on a successful first year of activity."
"One of the European Ombudsman's most important tasks is to play a role in developing a Union citizenship, which presently is only a small germ of an idea compared to what it could become."
"It is very pleasing that the Ombudsman, Mr Söderman, has chosen to take a stand on a matter of such importance to all citizens as openness within the European Union."
"Openness is one of democracy's cornerstones, and Mr Söderman has sent an inquiry to Union bodies regarding the way in which documents are made available to citizens."
"Let us hope that this inquiry speeds up the development of openness and transparency within the European Union."
"The Ombudsman's area of authority is very closely connected with the citizens' actual constitutional position in the European Union, and I assume that as soon as he has established his position, discussions could be started regarding a possible extension of the civil rights of Union citizens. This way also the Ombudsman's authority would increase and develop its full potential."
"It is evident from the above that the European Ombudsman plays an essential role in developing the European Union into an authentic citizens' Community."
"The European Ombudsman has its good and bad points as an institution."
"The same applies to Mr Söderman's report."
"On the positive side, any system of complaints can help to promote the hard-pressed concept of legal safety."
"It is also clear from many of the opinions which Mr Söderman has delivered that he is a serious lawyer, who in a number of cases has taken both the Council and the Commission to task, especially in connection with questions of openness."
"On the other hand, the creation of the European Ombudsman provided for by Article 138e of the Treaty on European Union is clearly a federal move which serves to give the Union and the European Parliament a false air of democratic legitimacy - an expression both symbolically and in reality of 'more Union' ."
"Unfortunately, Mr Söderman has already accepted this function in his opening statement on taking up his post in September 1995."
"It grated on the ear to hear him say that the idea behind the European Ombudsman was to promote the concept of European citizenship."
"There is no shortage of control mechanisms in the EU; they have a tendency to develop into self-sustaining bureaucratic instruments."
"If the Ombudsman were to be an effective guardian of legal safety in the same way as the national Ombudsmen, it would require a huge bureaucracy."
"By way of comparison, the Danish Ombudsman has a staff of 25 lawyers."
"I wish to record my support for the new Ombudsman as this new role is another step in the direction of making the European Union more accessible to ordinary people."
"As an elected representative I feel it is vital that my constituents have someone to turn to with their complaints at the highest level."
"I recognize that the Ombudsman has already become a champion of ordinary people's interests."
"However, as the role of the Ombudsman is so new, we in Parliament must make sure that both the Council and the Commission cooperate fully with his office."
"Any information required to answer people's enquiries must be forthcoming from the Council and the Commission."
"Having established this important new role to give our citizens more knowledge of EU decisions we, as their representatives, must make sure they are not disappointed."
"There must be no secrecy where my constituents' grievances are concerned."
"That concludes the vote."
"Money laundering"
"The next item is the report (A4-0187/96) by Mr Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the first report from the Commission on the implementation of the money laundering directive (91/308/EEC) (COM(95)0054 - C4-0137/95)."
"Mr President, this is a report the Commission submitted with a view to implementing the 1991 money-laundering directive."
"We are giving our position as Parliament."
"There can be no doubt at all that combating money laundering is one of the crucial crime-prevention tasks of our time."
"There is a very close link between money laundering and organized crime which - as we all know - is constantly growing in Europe too and threatens to take on huge dimensions."
"In this context the European Community issued a directive on combating money laundering in 1991 which was addressed to all the Member States so that they would introduce a certain minimum standard with regard to combating money laundering."
"This 1991 directive does in fact set a relatively low standard compared to most of the legislation in the individual Member States."
"Let me put that more simply: basically this directive mainly covered drug-related offences, which is one aspect of organized crime."
"For those occupational groups that are in the end to be included in the scope of the national legislation there is so to speak only a minimum standard, which in principle covers the banking world, while many other areas, such as gambling casinos and other undertakings that are concerned with financial services are not adequately covered."
"It has indeed now been left to the individual Member States to issue their own national laws over and above this minimum framework laid down by the directive but there have actually been wide variations - as a result of this discretionary approach - in the individual Member States."
"The UK is one of the countries that has gone furthest here."
"It has included virtually all serious criminal offences in its criminal records and it has included virtually every occupational group that is in any way concerned with money in the list of occupational groups that bear their own responsibility for combating money laundering in the sense of being liable under criminal law."
"The other extreme, if I may cite an example, is Luxembourg which by comparison has a very liberal money-laundering legislation which basically only comes up to the minimum standard laid down in the directive."
"Parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs and Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights organized a hearing on this report in December last year, which the Commission has submitted to us."
"It became clear from the views expressed by both committees that there certainly are weaknesses in the field of combating money laundering in Europe, and in particular they both found that the level of Europe-wide harmonization is inadequate."
"The representative of the City of London Police, for instance, pointed out that constant difficulties arise in the cooperation between the various countries' judicial authorities because cases which constitute a criminal offence of money-laundering in the United Kingdom, for instance involving reciprocal financial transactions with other Member States, cannot necessarily be considered a money-laundering offence in those states, which leads to constant problems in terms of cooperation."
"It appeared from the hearings - for we also heard a representative of the Federal Criminal Police Office in Wiesbaden - that the same difficulties arise with regard to the coverage of different occupational groups."
"Here the experts called for closer harmonization - in plain English for the money-laundering directive to be tightened up - in order to facilitate cross-frontier measures to combat crime in Europe."
"A further aspect that became clear from the hearing was that a number of new forms of financial services now exist."
"One example is direct banking, which in the experts view is evidently not properly covered in most Member States and is of course not covered by this directive either."
"Both committees, Legal and Internal Affairs, considered that it would be most useful to adjust the directive to the new situation in this area too and of course then to adapt national legislation accordingly."
"A final aspect that emerged is the problem that most of the money laundering no longer occurs in Western Europe now but mainly in Eastern Europe."
"Today there are close interconnections between the banking world and organized crime in Russia in particular, but also in other Eastern European states."
"The demand that was clearly expressed at the hearing and which we also took up in the committees was as follows: the agreements concluded with these states we must also require that they adopt equivalent money-laundering standards to those we impose on ourselves."
"Those are the main requirements laid down in the report before you and which we ask the House to endorse."
"There are a number of points of dispute, which is of course always the case, and which I shall list: one was the question whether the directive should cover only organized crime or also all 'serious criminal offences' ."
"As rapporteur I was against going beyond organized crime because I believe otherwise it would be very difficult to differentiate."
"The second problem concerns the following: with this money-laundering legislation we are intervening very deeply in the relationship of mutual trust between banks or financial institutions and clients."
"For it to intervene in their relationship of mutual trust does indeed mean that the state must have a very strong interest in taking such action."
"That is the subject of my report."
"I ask the House to approve it."
"Mr President, today money laundering is probably the most sophisticated and complex financial transaction."
"Gone are the days when some petty criminal walked into a bank with a suitcase full of notes."
"The advances in electronic banking have removed the personal contact, and criminal-controlled financial outlets provide a legitimate base for successful money laundering."
"This is a global problem which has no regard for any international boundaries."
"The European Union must play a prominent role in international efforts to deal with this global crime issue."
"The United States of America is arguably at the forefront of the campaign tackling the problem of money laundering."
"But its efforts can only be successful if it is aided and assisted by other countries."
"It is, therefore, to our eternal shame that the European Union has not fully established Europol or provided the necessary resources for it."
"The blocking actions by a certain Member State, it could be argued, are every bit as criminal as the people involved in money laundering."
"There will also have to be a harmonization to a higher standard of the laws on money laundering throughout the Member States of the European Union so as not to allow a weak link within the Union."
"We must also look beyond our borders where the European Union has influence, especially to those Eastern and Central European countries."
"With the collapse of communism, overt criminal activity has increased."
"Financial institutions within these countries are now being regularly used as a link in the chain to legitimize dirty money."
"To combat this we must look at drawing up a list of clean banks, but we must also give urgent consideration to strengthening our articles of agreement with our partner countries to encourage them to adopt equivalent standards for supervision and transparency in financial transactions to those prevalent within Member States of the European Union."
"Money laundering is not solely connected with drug trafficking but also takes in arms dealing, prostitution, art fraud and many other criminal activities."
"By tackling the ill-gotten gains we will start to tackle the problem of crime."
"We must not allow Europe to become the centre where crime pays."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has presented a first report on the implementation of the money-laundering directive which is very useful and informative."
"It offers us an opportunity to concern ourselves in detail with the phenomenon of money laundering and to identify the weak points in the measures for combating this offence."
"The weak points derive from the fact that the directive does not go far enough but also from the fact that organized crime is becoming increasingly cunning and using both new techniques and new means of investment."
"We all know that the large criminal organizations which we lump together rather vaguely as organized crime are organized and built up in much the same way as economic undertakings and that the most sustainable way of reaching them is through their assets."
"Any measures that prevent the proceeds of crime from being smuggled into the legal economic process are therefore very valuable and well targeted."
"The motion for a resolution contains some sensible requests to the Commission to extend the scope of the directive."
"In particular, national legal provisions on money laundering should expand the list of activities that constitute criminal offences."
"It is incomprehensible why only drugs trafficking should be included and not other forms of organized or professional crime."
"As has been pointed out, organized crime includes a whole range of crimes, from traffic in human beings to arms traffic, blackmail for protection money, gambling and many other areas."
"So it would appear important to include all these areas of crime and all the proceeds from them."
"I also think other occupational groups must be included in the scope of the directive."
"Criminal organizations are inventive and their interest in the banking sector heightens the risk."
"I just want to say a few words on the banking sector."
"Mr Lehne mentions in the explanatory statement to his report that savings accounts in Austria could be used for money-laundering purposes."
"To that I can only say that there are no savings accounts in Austria, only savings books."
"Money can be paid into savings books and money can be withdrawn from them."
"But money cannot be transferred."
"I believe it is important to establish that."
"Also, I do not think the figure of about 26 million savings books is really so high if you consider savings habits in Austria, where every pensioner opens at least one savings book for each grandchild and in any case everyone has different books for different savings purposes."
"And I want to make it quite clear that accounts are not anonymous, neither current accounts nor any others, and that anonymity has also been abolished for securities accounts."
"Austria lays great value on the fact that it is not a distributing centre for money laundering."
"To return to the content of the resolution."
"It can indeed be observed that mafia organizations and business people are appearing more and more often in the fields of real estate, gambling, jewellery and art with dubious funds."
"So it is worth considering whether occupational groups such as jewellers, casino owners, lawyers and notaries should not be involved more closely in helping to combat organized crime."
"Technical developments in financial transactions are also facing us with new problems."
"It is very important to improve cooperation with the authorities responsible for combating organized crime and to keep a constant watch on developments."
"Criminal organizations adjust very quickly to new measures and methods."
"It is important to remain on the ball and react very promptly to changes."
"The opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs takes the same line as the motion for a resolution submitted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights."
"It too calls for the directive to be amended and to include in its scope a wider range of criminal activities."
"Combating internationally operating criminal organizations is a great challenge for the European Union and its Member States."
"The people of Europe expect us to combat crime successfully."
"Combating money laundering is certainly an important means of combating international crime."
"Mr President, you will understand that in my constituency, in Essex in the UK, the menace of drugs misuse is bitterly understood."
"In the last year in our community we have suffered the tragic death of teenager Leah Betts, after taking ecstasy pills in a Basildon nightclub."
"In a quiet country lane in Rettendon, three drugs-related execution-style murders today remain unsolved and a Billericay businessman was found shot dead in his car with £5, 000 of drugs money left on the dashboard."
"I am sad to say that we understand only too well that the scourge of drug addiction is big business too."
"That businessman's used car business is under investigation as a possible front for drug trafficking and therefore as an easy way to launder the profits of this destructive trade."
"That is why tonight we call for a tightening of the rules, not against the people in the mafia-style gangs, but the men in the sharp suits and with the briefcases who are behind this $500 billion drugs trade worldwide."
"After the scandals of Nick Leeson and Barings and in the last week of Mr Hamanaka and the Sumitomo Corporation we know that massive fraud and deception is happening today within these multinational financial institutions."
"When a 59 year old grandmother, a 30 years' activist in the British Conservative Party is jailed for five years for laundering £400, 000 on behalf of the fugitive Azil Nadir, funder of that same ruling Conservative Party, we know that these criminals can be found in the most unlikely places."
"Our local authorities, police and health agencies will do everything possible at the local level to combat illegal drugs supply and misuse, but they will not win the war against drugs until we at the European level bring about the necessary cooperation between governments, law enforcement agencies and banks to stop the bankrolling which is behind the scourge of the drugs trade."
"End the dirty dollars and the hot money and we will really put a stop to the senseless and needless deaths."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, money does not stink, as the saying goes;"
"I would add, unless it is laundered."
"That takes me right into Mr Lehne's report, which I consider particularly thorough."
"Money laundering is, as we know, only the final link in a long chain of criminal activities, many of which are coordinated by organized crime."
"As we all know, these are cross-frontier phenomena which, like combating fraud in general, require intensive cooperation between the Member States of the European Union in the field of both domestic policy and judicial policy."
"Consequently we need comprehensive legislative action to improve the coordination between the national judicial and police authorities."
"In this context particular emphasis is laid on the need for appropriate procedural provisions in the Member States."
"Only then will it be possible to detect and prosecute criminal money launderers successfully, for instance by making it easier to monitor telecommunications traffic or temporarily confiscating assets."
"The rapporteur rightly points out that the criminals are entirely at home with computers and the most recent techniques."
"In view of the enormous technical advances, it is therefore quite right to call for the existing European system for combating money laundering to be adjusted to technical innovations such as direct banking and prepaid cards and under no circumstances to delay this."
"That this requires highly developed control systems and techniques but also of course specially trained personnel is self-evident."
"The call to extend the measures to combat money laundering not just to money from drugs trafficking but to all the proceeds of organized crime is also important."
"It is particularly necessary at this time for us in the European Parliament to give a signal to the people and to make them more confident that Europe is combating crime consistently and successfully."
"In that sense the Lehne report is a major step forward."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Lehne for the excellent work he has done."
"His is a good report, bearing in mind that the Commission is asked to take more resolute action in seeking data and information, communicating with the House and promoting greater cooperation with the national authorities by amending the directive on the recycling of capital."
"Up to this point we are clearly in agreement, as we are in agreement on the fact that EUROPOL needs to be ratified as soon as possible, as it may provide an important means of combating this problem, just as, on the other hand, it could be very dangerous to open up to other countries, such as Russia, without the necessary guarantees on the issue of money-laundering."
"It is clear that money-laundering is now the main weapon of organized crime - let us be clear about this - a lethal weapon which means that organized crime is taking possession of the economic and productive nerve centres of the large-, medium- and small-scale economic activities to be found in Europe."
"I do not, however, believe that it will be possible to resolve the problem on the basis of controls or policing activities in regard to banks, for example."
"The same is happening, for instance, in the case of the drugs problem, as Mr Howitt said a few moments ago: that problem is simply the product of a mistaken approach, a repressive approach the sole effect of which is to expand the drugs market."
"I believe in and stress the importance of striking at the economic interests of organized crime and thus moneylaundering, by bringing into effect the concept of confiscating the proceeds of organized crime. This should be done not only in relation to organized crime but also in relation to individuals who commit such offences."
"Mr President, in the first place I should like to say that the report on the implementation of the directive has made clear the need to take account, in the prevention of money laundering, of the new types of financial transactions and the elaboration of new legislative measures to deal with the complexity of such transactions."
"In the second place it should be said that the present directive needs to be revised to include in its field of application occupations and categories of business likely to be involved in money laundering and similarly the directive should be revised to bring greater flexibility into the measures to be taken and the provisional confiscation of goods suspected of being of illegal origin."
"Finally I should like to point out that the effectiveness of the campaign against money laundering depends both upon widening the field of application of the directive and on better information on the flow of capital to ascertain the origin and the monetary impact of the relevant transactions."
"Otherwise how can we ascertain whether or not they are legitimate?"
"Without such a move towards transparency, although the measures proposed are positive and deserve to be approved, I do not think it will be possible to put an end to the wealth born of crime, which is usually so tempting precisely because it pays so well."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the rapporteur had to do more than just square the circle or hit a nail on the head."
"Because of the 1991 directive he was forced to take a legislative approach to a subject that is after all basically financial and economic. He had to deal with a range of criminal activities for which there is no EU criminal law."
"He had to set up a police force for which there is neither a legal basis nor democratic or judicial control. With the list of clean banks he was forced in the end to show the money launderers where best to invest their money and in the end he, who after all wants to combat money laundering as we all do, had to call for evidence that the practice of money laundering is on the increase and that it is playing a growing part within the network of criminal associations."
"The rapporteur is certainly not responsible for the mistaken philosophy on which the entire money-laundering legislation is based."
"For the basic mistake is to take money laundering as an established fact instead of destroying the economic preconditions that make it so and, secondly, to intervene in the protected private sphere by legislative means instead of withdrawing the protection from those who misuse it to cover up their criminal activities."
"That creating 'clean banks' will be a strong weapon for combating money laundering is in my view the opposite of likely in more than one respect."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, has made certain improvements by comparison with the Commission's first report, they are still far from sufficient, given the scale of the problem."
"Unlike the rapporteur, I believe that an enumerative, unnumbered and above all truncated report, a report in other words that annoys no one, cannot be a good report."
"Nowhere is any mention made of numerical data on either the conventional or new laundering channels, although the total extent of the laundering of capital can be evaluated at ECU 500 thousand million."
"More seriously, the report gives a clean sheet to the twelve Member States that signed the directive."
"Yet the reality is very different."
"After all, how can we explain the fact that the banks in Guernsey, which are under the authority of the British Crown and were formerly known for their cattle, are sitting on a hoard of 27 thousand million pounds sterling?"
"How can we explain the fact that the Dutch Government has ratified a unique form of tax convention with the Dutch Antilles dependencies?"
"I shall not go into any detail about the fiscal and banking legislation in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg."
"And I can already picture Austria's formal ratification of Directive 91/308."
"How are we to explain the fact that a State that is home to 8 million souls has managed to amass within its territory more than 20 million anonymous savings books?"
"To pretend to display firmness by ratifying such directives, while at the same time continuing to wash our dirty linen in private; to play the policeman without ever being seen as the villain in the eyes of public opinion - what hypocrisy!"
"Do we have to wait for one of our Heads of State to be caught in some dark dealings with money laundering, perhaps associated with arms dealing or drug trafficking?"
"Do we need a European version of Mr Samper to force our leaders to see reason?"
"Let us start by going to the root of the problem."
"Let us start by regulating and legalizing all drugs, now."
"Until that happens, my group will abstain."
"Mr President, the Commission's first report on the implementation of the 1993 money laundering directive has pointed to vast differences in the way the legislation is applied by the Member States."
"As a result it is still possible for dirty money to move with ease throughout Europe."
"The Irish Government has declared the fight against drugs a priority of its presidency."
"I share Mr Howitt's concern that the existing laws do not crack down on the proceeds of crime."
"Indeed a major international crime conference in Dublin this week highlighted the very serious difficulties drug squad officers from European countries have in dealing with the Europol drugs unit in the Hague."
"There were, for example, long delays in obtaining vital information from some countries."
"The current directive on money laundering is clearly ineffective given the scale of this drug problem in the cities mentioned and in other areas and also the ease with which the proceeds appear to be laundered into legitimate businesses."
"We clearly need a far more flexible legal framework to keep abreast of technological advances in banking systems."
"Some of these have been outlined by Mr Miller."
"I want to see a situation where criminals, whether they are drug dealers, IRA, bank robbers or white-collar fraudsters find it impossible to launder their ill-gotten gains anywhere in Europe."
"I am also calling for much closer cooperation between the police, the courts, the revenue authorities and financial institutions."
"I have spoken to some accountants who work in this area."
"What they recommend is that civil proceedings should be taken in tandem with criminal proceedings so that the ill-gotten gains be confiscated on conviction."
"We should not forget that Al Capone was eventually imprisoned for tax evasion."
"Finally, the directive should also be extended to cover the proceeds of fraud against the EU budget."
"In Ireland we have the scandal relating to the beef export refunds and the continuing massive transit fraud in, for example, cigarette smuggling."
"There are huge sums of money going astray which we could use very effectively in the European Union."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Lehne for an excellent report."
"Money laundering is a growing problem in all Member States."
"The authorities should prevent criminal money from penetrating the financial system."
"This is essential, since criminal money puts at risk the reliability and stability of the entire financial system."
"In Europe resources should be centralized to support preventive activity and to facilitate information exchange between the authorities receiving notifications, because information exchange at the European level is extremely difficult, especially between authorities and the police."
"A system should be created which would prevent successful money laundering by supporting preventive measures in respect of targets exposed to money laundering risks and which would make it possible to discover, trace and investigate money laundering."
"The system should work on two levels."
"There should be a preventive function, including checks and training of targets under surveillance, analysis of money laundering methods and legislation initiatives, and an investigative function, including investigating suspected money laundering incidents."
"If money has slipped through security measures, this money should be identified, traced, confiscated and the offenders brought to justice."
"Money laundering can be done in various ways, which is why the reporting obligation should be extended."
"Dealers in securities and money exchange bureaux will in all likelihood be obliged to report this year."
"In the future also enterprises dealing in betting and gaming, real estate developers, companies or individuals in occupations handling valuable objects, accountants and enterprises or professionals offering financial services will in all likelihood be obliged to report."
"A number of international organisations are involved in resolving the problems of money laundering."
"There is clearly a need to co-ordinate measures at European level, in order to avoid a duplication of effort."
"Mr President, the rapporteur Mr Lehne rightly said that the fight against money laundering must not be confined to drugs money but must of course also include the proceeds of all criminal offences committed by organized crime."
"That is also why the European Parliament organized the first committee of inquiry on the transit system, for the Member States and the European Union are losing billions of ecus through the evasion of duties, especially in the case of sensitive products such as cigarettes, alcohol and certain foods."
"Organized crime is active there too."
"That is why we need comprehensive rules."
"It is also necessary, however, to include and criminalize fraud involving EU budget funds in all the EU states."
"To date that is only the case in some countries and it is quite incomprehensible why loopholes are being created here, which make it more difficult if not impossible to combat money laundering."
"On the other hand it is a little naive to believe - and here I am addressing Mr Dupuis - that anonymous savings books with small deposits of less than ECU 15 000, which is laid down as the limit in the directive, or similar banking transactions in other EU countries, such as Italy or Germany, that do not need to be disclosed, are used for money laundering purposes."
"There are quite other reasons for that."
"As Mrs Hlavac rightly pointed out, it is simply the case that many people open small savings books for their children, grandchildren and for the whole family."
"That area is not suitable for money laundering."
"Organized crime uses dummy firms, fictitious transfers and cover-ups on a large scale."
"That is why the Community has to take a coordinated approach and needs a uniform information system, which also has to be extended to the Visegrad states if they are to be included in our system."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission I thank Parliament, and in particular its rapporteur Mr Lehne, for the comprehensive survey of the Union's activities in the field of combating money laundering and the means by which we can jointly boost these efforts."
"We are all aware of the damage being done to our society by the drugs traffic and other forms of organized crime."
"If we can prevent criminals from laundering, using and investing their dirty money that will be an effective means of combating crime."
"As we all know, dirty money corrupts everything, including the financial system."
"And that was also the point of departure for the Community's activities in this area, namely the prevention of misuse of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering."
"Pursuant to the 1991 directive, the Commission must report to Parliament and the Council on its application."
"We have done so, our report is the subject of the report before you this evening."
"The Commission is convinced that the directive entirely fulfils its task and that in general it was transposed well in the Member States."
"But that does not yet mean that we have effective means of also combating the causes of organized crime."
"As our report says, money laundering is now a criminal offence in all Member States."
"At first, in 1991, that was not the case, as we know."
"We broke through the protection offered by banking confidentiality."
"All financial institutions now have to actively notify the authorities of any suspicion and may no longer just wait until they are asked."
"Yet it will never be possible to regard the battle against money laundering as won."
"As soon as we close up one loophole in the system, the money launderers look for new points of attack and, as has been made very clear here, use the most recent techniques for doing so."
"But we can make this increasingly difficult and expensive for them and thereby thwart their tactics and strategy to some extent at least."
"Both reports realise that this battle is a long-term one."
"I only want to discuss a few of the most important matters raised in the motion for a resolution, since there is no time to go into all 20 paragraphs individually."
"Many of these points are addressed not to the Commission but to the Member States, as the rapporteur just said in his oral statement."
"We can endorse many of them, especially the call to include a very wide spectrum of serious crimes in their money-laundering legislation, to continue work on the Europol Convention and for all the Member States to ratify the Vienna and Strasbourg conventions."
"Let me just point out that extending the scope and improved cooperation form part of both the Vienna and the Strasbourg conventions."
"The Commission will examine every single point you raised in depth and will certainly discuss them with the Member States."
"That is why the Commission has deferred the scheduled meeting of the Contact Committee until the autumn, so that this report by Parliament can be discussed adequately and thoroughly there."
"What are the main themes?"
"Firstly, the report requests more information from the Commission on reported cases and convictions, on new types of money-laundering and their economic effects."
"As you know, some of this information is extremely difficult to obtain."
"Where the Commission does have access to reliable information, it will of course pass it on to Parliament; but you know that here we also have to rely on the information and the goodwill of the Member States."
"The Council has already requested a second report on certain aspects of the directive and we will be drawing up another report both for Parliament and for the Council."
"The present report also calls for a revision of the directive."
"This relates mainly to the field of new financial techniques, but also to the other occupations and activities concerned and to their proper surveillance."
"To be frank, the Commission is rather hesitant to draw up a new directive at this point."
"The 1991 directive determines the objective and leaves the Member States a certain amount of room for play in implementing it."
"It is not a technical measure and nor does it examine the individual financial products or techniques, but it can also be applied to areas that are not specifically mentioned in it."
"Nor is the Commission entirely sure that it has a firm legal basis for further-reaching measures to deal with the fact that the main emphasis of measures to combat money laundering is shifting away from the formal financial sector."
"As was also made clear in the report, it is generally agreed that what is needed most at present is closer cooperation between the Member States' authorities responsible for combating money laundering."
"Several speakers here have also pointed that out."
"Cooperation between the police and the judiciary is an area in which the Commission does not at present have any right of initiative."
"So we have to confine ourselves to calling for closer cooperation in this area and I hope we can jointly urge more movement on the third pillar at the intergovernmental conference."
"The Commission is currently working on a number of areas together with the Contact Committee."
"They include the misuse of bureaux de change and the problem of non-personal transactions such as telephone or computer banking."
"This committee is doing very good work and the Commission is confident that further progress can be made in the framework of the existing directive."
"Only if this fails will the Commission consider a further directive and even then only if it has found a solid legal base for it."
"In any case the Commission will keep Parliament informed of both the progress made and the problems encountered."
"Let me briefly discuss the requested extension of these measures to the Eastern European states."
"I would very much like to point out that money-laundering clauses form part of the partnership agreements and association agreements with these countries and that we are also supporting practical means of advancing along this road, for instance through technical aid under PHARE, so that the arm of the law can reach beyond our borders."
"Finally, let me again thank Parliament for its comprehensive and constructive report."
"The Commission will continue the dialogue with you and I hope that together we will manage to achieve better results."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 9 a.m. tomorrow."
"Linguistic diversity in the information society"
"The next item is the report (A4-0148/96) by Mrs Mouskouri, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, on the proposal for a Council Decision on the adoption of a multiannual programme to promote the linguistic diversity of the Community in the information society (COM(95)0486 - C40152/96-95/0263(CNS))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal from the Commission comes in the framework of the growth of the information society."
"The Commission is proposing the adoption, that is to say, of a multiannual programme to promote the linguistic diversity of the Community in the information society."
"This proposal brings two benefits, the second of which flows from the first."
"Firstly, it accepts the reality of linguistic diversity in the European Union, the reality of the linguistic pluralism which is currently under pressure because of the use on the information highways of only one language, English, which monopolies not only technology but also communications generally."
"The use of this single language threatens to lead to a standardization of thought and to deprive large numbers of people in the Union of access to information, progress and knowledge."
"For that reason the adoption of this programme should be warmly welcomed because it comes to the aid of our linguistic heritage and seeks to promote it, while at the same time offering total participation in the information society for all of Europe's citizens without exception."
"The second benefit is economic and springs from the fact that undertakings which have previously confined themselves to local markets will in future be helped by multi-lingual products to find international outlets."
"In presenting to you the Commission proposal, with a number of amendments inserted by the Committee on Culture, I would like to draw your attention to a serious issue concerning the legal basis. The programme has the objectives of promoting the use of technologies and methods which can reduce the cost of transferring information from language to language, strengthening the languages industry and encouraging the development of multi-lingual services."
"The question we have to ask ourselves is whether the promotion of linguistic diversity in the Union is an objective end it itself or simply a means to the promotion of the information society at the international level."
"The Committee on Culture has come to a clear conclusion, namely that the programme as such is the main objective and that appropriate means are contained within it for the realization of that objective."
"This means that the cultural dimension of this programme has priority over the industrial effects and that therefore a change is necessary in the legal basis."
"We are pleading with the Council and the Commission to accept that this proposal be at least given a double legal basis, with recourse to Article 128 as well, rather than having it rest solely on Article 130 which would be much too restrictive a basis for the subject."
"The European Parliament would be willing to request a judgment from the European Court, not only for the purpose of seeking support for its position in this particular case but also in order to seek, above all, confirmation and endorsement of the importance of the role of cultural values in the European infrastructure."
"The Commission has proposed three action lines: support for the construction of an infrastructure for European language resources, mobilization and expansion of the language industries and promotion of the use of advanced language tools in the European public sector."
"The programme ends in 1998 and has a budget of ECU 15m."
"Allow me to turn now to some of the Committee on Culture's most important amendments."
"Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 7 make the case for placing the Commission proposal in the cultural sphere, with Article 128 as the legal basis."
"In a related way, Amendments Nos 8, 9 and 10 emphasize the social aspect of the information society, the need to ensure democratic access in order to protect certain population categories against exclusion."
"Amendment No 11 underscores the threat of 'dialectification' to languages left on the margins of the information society."
"Amendments Nos 23 and 39 deal with the economic aspect."
"Most of the enterprises with an interest in this programme are small and medium-sized, and it is important that we protect and assist them."
"Amendment No 25 proposes the use of the Structural Funds by the Member States to help protect our linguistic heritage."
"Many of the amendments call for special attention to be paid to the lesser-used languages and for examination of the possibility of seeking synergies with other social programmes such as the ARIANE programme."
"Lastly, taking account of the great importance of this programme, it is proposed that the financing be raised from ECU 15m to ECU 20m."
"In concluding, I should like to re-emphasize to the House the immense importance of preserving the European Union's linguistic heritage and of ensuring, above all, that it is not devastated in the future by information highways whose content is incomprehensible."
"Lastly, I would like to thank the Commission very greatly for its excellent initiative and to say that I hope that this proposal will be accorded the cultural dimension that it merits and that it can be implemented swiftly."
"Apart from the parliamentary courtesy which requires me to thank you, Mrs Mouskouri, I should like to offer my warmest thanks today because in this institution, faced with all the budgetary and technical difficulties we work with 100 % multilingualism."
"There is a concern to promote the many languages which exist throughout the European Union."
"Your words, which have stressed the importance of languages as a factor of culture, are without doubt a very important aspect and I can assure you that your speech was music to the ears of everyone here - one of your best songs."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by warmly congratulating Mrs Mouskouri on her polished and excellent report on the Commission proposal on promoting the linguistic diversity of the information society."
"I emphatically support her in her attempt to free this three-year programme from the confines of the purely economic vision of the Commission."
"For linguistic diversity is not just an economic resource that may even represent a barrier."
"The terms used by the Commission, such as language industries, language as a product and so on, totally disregard the fact that linguistic diversity is a cultural asset and an important mark of identity."
"This cultural heritage must be preserved."
"That is why preference should be given to Article 128 as the legal base."
"It concerns culture and gives precedence to non-commercial, cultural exchanges."
"It ensures co-decision by Parliament, instead of mere consultation under Article 130, as the Commission proposed."
"Since I am delivering the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, let me point to a few financial aspects."
"The meagre funds of a total of ECU 15 m allocated to this programme could be increased by amending the financial perspective, otherwise the burden would fall on other Category 3 areas."
"The appropriations must be safeguarded in each annual budget, taking account of the preceding year's execution of the budget."
"That also includes administrative costs."
"For the rest, the financial statement does not take account of potential revenue from the participation of non-member third parties."
"Nor is the number of officials already working in this field clarified; two additional posts are being requested and two national experts."
"We should take every care to avoid duplication of work and costs."
"That is why we propose a link-up with other programmes, e.g. INFO 2000 or TELEMATICS."
"It is doubtful whether the advisory committee will have the kind of overall view that will enable it to promote not just mega-projects but also micro-projects."
"These two questions of the advisory committee and the establishment plan posts both need to be examined during the annual budget procedure."
"I warmly thank the rapporteur again for accepting the amendments from the Committee on Budgets."
"Mr President, the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy considers it essential for the European Union to draw up a policy aimed, on the one hand, at guaranteeing and promoting the cultural and linguistic diversity of the Union in the information society and, on the other, transforming the obvious advantages of the Union at the level of knowledge and experience of multilingualism into new economic and job-creating opportunities."
"Any effective action must start out with a sound knowledge of the facts of the problem."
"In that connection, the Commission document is disappointing."
"Indeed, apart from a very approximate estimate of the financial dimension - unsupported and lacking in detail and some reference to jobs - it contains not the slightest analysis of the market in question."
"This seems to us to represent a highly detrimental omission."
"It would be desirable for the Commission to complete its proposal by adding a searching analysis of the world and European markets and of the strengths and weaknesses of European undertakings."
"This would create the opportunity to make soundly-based choices and to target efforts."
"It is clear that this programme is far from equal to the situation it describes."
"Given the advantages of Union industries, the activities of European undertakings in this market deserve to be supported."
"This programme in its present form is incapable of providing the necessary assistance and it can, at best, prepare the ground."
"The development of the global and multimedia means of communication can jeopardize the cultural and linguistic diversity of the Union."
"It is, therefore, appropriate in that connection to draw up a policy for the defence of cultural and linguistic identities already existing, the number of which is, of course, much higher than the number of official languages in the European institutions."
"In this connection, the arrival of new translation and interpretation techniques can help the so-called minority languages to flourish."
"On the other hand, technological development that will lead to production of new translation and interpretation tools could enable the European Union to exploit economically its natural knowhow in multilingualism at world level."
"A market for these new applications of language technology is a highly promising one, in particular in terms of job creation and exports."
"In that connection the Union must conduct an interventionist policy of accompaniment and support for the efforts of European undertakings that have committed themselves to this market."
"I now wish to congratulate the rapporteur on behalf of the Green Group and to say that my new computer at home sings to me, but not with the richness or diversity of the rapporteur herself or the human voice in general, and the computer will never take the place of human beings."
"I share her view that we must dismiss the quick fix of English only: we must take concrete action to promote cultural and linguistic diversity in the information age."
"The right of mother tongue access to information technology must go hand in hand with the promotion of language learning."
"In this regard, the non-official languages of the Union which have a status recognized at regional level are used as instruments of communication, both for the transmission of technical information and in teaching and cultural activities."
"The diversity of the languages used in the European Union constitute a wealth that must be preserved and dynamically developed, both from a cultural point of view and to secure economic spin-offs for the language industries."
"Action taken in this programme should help to create a favourable environment for strengthening the language industries."
"I thank the rapporteur very sincerely for her efforts."
"Finally, we must create an environment favourable to the expansion of the language industries and promote the development of multilingual services."
"Mr President, I congratulate Mrs Mouskouri on this report on the promotion of the linguistic diversity of the Community in the information society."
"The development of globally interlinked information and communication services could have a major impact on the languages we use."
"People who are not in a position to communicate properly in the usual languages could be prevented from taking full part in our increasingly information-oriented society."
"Since information affects all levels of society, equality of opportunity for all is of major importance in order to ensure full participation by all."
"If we allow the information revolution to advance unchecked this could lead to a two-tier society."
"Many of the minority languages find themselves in difficulties under the influence of changing communication patterns."
"If the new technologies are put to full use that could even speed up the process and risk destroying the linguistic and cultural diversity of the European Community."
"I recently leafed through a report by 'Euromosaic' which is about minority-language communities and which points out that earlier proposals concerned emotive, traditional activities such as folklore whereas today we are also concerned with preventing the social and economic marginalization of minority-language communities and that it is also of decisive importance whether the use of the language in question is extended to the working environment."
"That is to say, we are concerned today not with cultural but with economic measures."
"By the way, there is also some criticism of the fact that not only are not enough funds available but that they are not always spent efficiently."
"We need specific directives to ensure a balance between the major language groups and those languages that are used in smaller national or regional groups in Europe, with a view to achieving equality of opportunity."
"Resources such as electronic dictionaries, terminology data banks and language and grammar data banks are needed in order to transform communication technologies into marketable products."
"Here the necessary efforts will have to be made to attract investment from the private sector and small and medium-sized undertakings."
"Small undertakings, as Mrs Mouskouri also noted, that are confronted with large and diversifying markets also need to be offered adequate assistance."
"The Member States, the European Commission and private undertakings have already invested substantially in the production of language resources."
"However, most of these are single-language systems and, moreover, the current systems are not sufficiently compatible."
"The linguistic diversity in Europe is notable compared, for example, with that in the USA or Japan."
"Europe has the scientific and technological know-how and the economic strength, but it must also have the political will to maintain its linguistic diversity in the information age, which is what the people of Europe want."
"Let me underline that the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media calls for the modest financing basis to be increased from ECU 15 m to ECU 20 m."
"The people must be guaranteed their basic right of access to information in their European mother tongue."
"European society must not be split into the informed and the uninformed."
"Europe's richness lies in its diversity."
"We must promote it and invest in it in a well-considered way."
"Mr President, first of all my compliments to Mrs Mouskouri for her excellent work and for the power of her conviction. And I very much approve of the Commission proposal."
"Linguistic diversity in the Union is a matter close to my heart."
"It is not just an economic burden which we seek to ease by technology."
"It is above all a cultural asset, something precious which should be treasured."
"Our citizens attach importance to this, for a variety of reasons."
"We must support them in this, at Union level too."
"In this respect the programme is a step in the right direction."
"Thirdly and lastly, a small complaint."
"I absolutely do not agree with the legal basis and am totally with the rapporteur on this."
"Of course it makes sense to make room for a programme like this in industrial policy."
"It fosters economic integration, opportunities for small businesses and the competitive position of the language industry sector."
"But legally and politically it is a mistake to use only Article 130 as a legal basis."
"Firstly, because this cuts out the Committee of the Regions and Parliament totally and partially."
"Secondly, and most importantly, because it does not appreciate the cultural dimension of this subject."
"Language is both the basis of culture and its expression."
"I would be glad of an answer from the Commission, preferably a straight yes or no, to each of the following two questions."
"Does the Commission view linguistic diversity as an aspect of cultural diversity within the meaning of Article 128 of the Treaty?"
"And secondly, and I will end on this: in the Commission's view is linguistic diversity a part of our European cultural heritage, within the meaning of Article 128 of the Treaty?"
"Mr President, I welcome the proposal of the Commission for the adoption of the programme to promote linguistic diversity in the information society and offer warm congratulations to Mrs Mouskouri."
"The linking and interoperability of file and information centre services will certainly be an advance."
"However, we need to ensure that the periphery, which is striving hard to adjust and needs greater support, is not further marginalized because of infrastructure shortcomings and deficiencies in technical know-how."
"There is a connection between that and the threat to the lesser-used languages of Europe and to the future of multilingual European culture."
"We must reject one-dimensional linguistic cultural expression, and Mrs Mouskouri's excellent report emphasizes that very clearly."
"That means giving our support to the efforts to promote cultural products released in the various languages of the countries of the European Union."
"It was to that end that we gave our support for the preferential treatment of multilingual audio-visual works via the MEDIA II programme, and for the conversion of printed publications into electronic publications via INFO 2000."
"And the ARIANE translation programme was formulated in the same general spirit."
"We must now support the increased appropriations for the financing of linguistic diversity in the information society."
"In addition, as has already been said, Article 128 must be given primacy, so as to create, together with the use of Article 130, a double legal basis which can accommodate the essentially cultural character of this programme."
"Lastly, we must keep on insisting that each country must have access to the information centres and to the services of the information society in its own language."
"As has been already been emphasized, and I am glad that it has come also from Members whose mother tongue is English, the quick fix of English, of that language which is used in such a debased and codified way, can neither reflect, by itself, nor defend our multi-cultural Europe."
"Mr President, the future of the languages of Europe is a central problem to the policy of the European Union even if the Union does not seem to acknowledge that, given the paltry size this programme."
"It must be debated and discussed, something which has not yet been done in full detail and complexity, to find solutions, with a contribution by all the Union's institutions and those of the Member States, specialised bodies and relevant companies."
"The Mouskouri report is an excellent list of questions. It reflects the great openness of its author."
"But I would like to see a clearer definition of the priorities."
"Language policies need to be dealt with at very many levels."
"First of all, the language itself."
"Each country and each linguistic region needs to requalify the instruction of the language at school - that is a basis which does not exist at present."
"Secondly, functional bilingualism: every citizen must, as of the most basic educational level, be trained in the notion of the European linguistic plurality and become bi- or even trilingual."
"That could cement European citizenship together."
"Thirdly, translation; the circulation of knowledge throughout Europe, be it artistic, literary or scientific, must be done in all languages, with reliance on a coherent common policy, with linguistic resource infrastructures created by the different Member States and, in cases where subsidiarity allows, by the European Union."
"The problems concerning scientific and technological translation, literary translation, translation of the multimedia need to be dealt with, taking into account their individual specific needs."
"Fourth point: the Union and Member States' official policies."
"European language policies must give equal treatment - and that does not mean egalitarian - to all national, regional and minority languages in Europe, and also to non-European languages spoken by communities residing in Europe."
"I should like to end by referring to one last point and making one proposal."
"My final point is about translation and interpretation at international fora."
"The future of the use of different languages by international organisations deserves to be given thought in the cool light of day."
"I think it would be a serious mistake to pull out a pistol every time someone mentions reducing the number of languages."
"It is not here that our identity is at stake."
"I think that the launch of this three-year Community programme is the right time to hold a major international conference on the future of language sin Europe so that we can decide clearly which direction to take when the programme comes to an end in 1998."
"This is my proposal to the Commission."
"I shall be voting in favour of this report, and I must thank Mrs Mouskouri for a very significant improvement to the Commission's text, which I am bound to say badly needed it."
"The Commission, in fact, adopted a very economistic approach, reflected in the choice of legal basis in Article 130, paragraph 3."
"We find the spirit and letter of the Bangemann report in this talk of achieving economies of scale, the view of multilingualism as an economic asset and the talk about the language industry, the view of linguistic diversity as an obstacle which creates a cost burden, and the proposal that these linguistic barriers should be overcome in order to enable us to benefit from the advantages of the internal market. All of this I quote from the report."
"As the report recommends, it is essential to retain Article 128 as the legal basis and to ensure that, in the age of the binary language of computers, the networks are not monolingual in English and, at the same time, the information society does not create a new social dichotomy through the agency of discrimination."
"In order to avoid this, all languages must be fully integrated into the information society, and we must therefore be particularly attentive to supporting minority languages, including regional ones."
"From this point of view, the structural funds could be used to preserve and develop the linguistic heritage of the Member States."
"We must be careful not just to favour the megaprojects; more modest projects need to be supported and, with them, the SMEs which are developing multilingual tools, methods and services."
"We must not forget that the inequalities in our societies have a profoundly cultural aspect which finds expression in terms of exclusion and disaffiliation."
"In the field of languages, as in other cultural fields, it is still necessary - as Brecht said about the theatre - to 'increase the number in the know' ."
"The conditions for that increase have yet to be established, and will require a budget worthy of that ambition."
"Mr President, the diversity of our languages is an integral component of our cultural heritage and must be preserved and maintained."
"The planned action programme will support this important objective."
"But let me just point to one aspect to which perhaps not quite enough attention is paid, that of the minority languages."
"They too are an expression of cultural diversity and I am glad therefore that the rapporteur has made constructive proposals on this important question in several amendments."
"The programmes must take account of minority languages, even if they are languages that are only the official language outside the Union."
"Precisely these languages must not be excluded from the information society either."
"For instance, a significant Slovenian minority lives in the southernmost province of Austria, Kärnten, and their language is protected and taken into consideration in the Austrian educational system in exemplary fashion."
"Unfortunately one cannot say the same for the German-speaking minority in Slovenia."
"But quite apart from that it would be important if pilot actions could be envisaged and carried out precisely for this kind of linguistic minority, as proposed in Amendment 29."
"Actions of this kind could also give rise to interesting synergies in relation to enlargement eastward, which will naturally have a major impact on the Austrian frontier regions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I too should like to congratulate Mrs Mouskouri on her splendid work and stress the importance of the subject we are discussing and the part which the European Parliament must play in everything related to defending and encouraging linguistic diversity in the information society."
"The information society offers us the opportunity of enriching the main European bastion, which consists of a rich cultural, historical and linguistic heritage, in offering us the possibility to provide new services intended for a wider European audience."
"By means of the so-called information highways culture and languages will spread more rapidly and widely within and outside Europe."
"The building of Europe must develop by means of respect for the cultural and linguistic heritage of its citizens and initiatives like this help to encourage that diversity."
"We must take advantage of the challenges and opportunities which the information society offers us on behalf of European citizens, safeguarding one of the basic principles of Community law such as equality of opportunity."
"The use of all Community languages in Community networks is fundamental for developing information and communication accessible to all since citizens who are not able to communicate in the widely-spoken languages such as, for example English, might be cut off from any form of communication or at least placed at a disadvantage."
"Parliament must take an active part in the functioning, establishment and results of the programme as a body representing the interests of European citizens, ensuring in its turn that there is synergy between this programme and other programmes relating to the information society, since it is clear that coordination saves duplication of effort which unfortunately frequently arises in the Union."
"For all these reasons, Mr President, I should like to express again all my support for the report and of course to repeat my sincere congratulations on the rapporteur's work."
"We must also support Community initiatives like this programme for the encouragement of linguistic diversity, which guarantees full multilingual protection in the use of computerized information."
"Mr President, I support the Commission's three-year programme to promote linguistic diversity in the information society through the encouragement of new technologies and the development of multilingual services."
"I also support the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media amendment to increase the budget allocation from ECU 12m to ECU 16m."
"We must all ensure that the spread of modern technology will strengthen rather than weaken the continent's rich multilingual diversity."
"The growing emphasis of an English-dominated global network information and communications service must not undermine the range of European cultures and languages."
"This programme aims to encourage producers to supply support material and manuals in various languages, devise ways of making online dictionaries and terminology banks multilingual and encourage the expansion of software products."
"With English firmly established as the major international high technology language, there are fears that non-English speakers may not be able to benefit from the various services available, reducing the information society's impact on schools, businesses and homes."
"There is justified concern that the linguistic diversity resulting from the 45 national and regional languages spoken by the EU's 270 million inhabitants could be suffocated by the predominance of one or two major languages."
"We should never overlook the fact that 20 % of our citizens speak minority languages."
"These languages should not be allowed to suffer because of the dominant role of a few major languages."
"These of course include the first language of my country, the Irish language."
"People must have access to information in their own language."
"I hope the Telecommunications Council meeting on 27 June next will have the wisdom and foresight to support these innovative proposals from the European Parliament."
"Mr President, it is a case of David and Goliath, minor languages against major languages."
"I choose this image advisedly, because I am convinced that the minor languages must not come off second best, even despite the revolution in the information society."
"Our many languages are one aspect of our wealth and information in one's own language is a fundamental right of the European citizen."
"But the minor languages are indeed coming under pressure."
"At the beginning of 1995 I was in sharp disagreement with Alain Lamassoure who wanted to limit the number of working languages in the European Union after further enlargement."
"Three weeks ago I had occasion to ask a question of Commissioner Cresson who had given instructions in a letter to her DGs that all correspondence with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe should be written in French, even replies to letters in English or German."
"I do not find that very friendly, and who in Central and Eastern Europe understands French?"
"But it is encouraging that the Commission wishes by this proposal to promote linguistic diversity in a European Union in which the information society is irrevocably gaining dominance and in which English is usually the language of choice."
"Countless problems still remain over the importation of multilingual products and this is why this proposal is so important."
"We must seek ways of breaking down the language barriers."
"If such ways are found, we shall see a whole lot of new forms of economic activity which will be advantageous to small businesses in particular."
"Bravo, Mrs Mouskouri."
"My Group too backs Mrs Mouskouri's amendments which want to see Article 28 and not Article 130 chosen as the legal basis."
"The objective here is linguistic diversity."
"Industry plays an important part, developing technologies, expanding the language industry, but the preservation of one's own language is primarily a cultural matter."
"Many thanks, Mrs Larive."
"You know that the President's gavel is not to stop you speaking but on the contrary to tell you that you have used up your speaking time."
"Mr President, although my Group regards the Council proposal for the establishment of this programme as highly positive it nevertheless regrets that the budgetary allocation envisaged in principle is insufficient to achieve the objectives set by the promotion of linguistic diversity with a view to the new information society."
"The European Charter on minority languages forbids any kind of discrimination with regard to their use and the safeguarding of that principle may be endangered by an upsurge in new forms of communication in privileged languages."
"On the other hand perhaps the Council is underestimating the aims to be achieved."
"If we have proposed in these programmes to guarantee the citizen's democratic access to information it is essential that it should be available in his own language."
"On the other hand I think that if appropriate finance were assigned to this programme it would be in our power to ensure that our cultural diversity in the new information society should indeed be a source of richness and that, furthermore, this rich European diversity should become the key feature distinguishing us from the world of informatics - only in English - which comes from the United States."
"Our Group in convinced that the Union's minority languages as well as of the minority languages brought to us by others whom we welcome to our territory need to be promoted."
"That will no doubt help to increase the cultural diversity of this pluralistic and democratic information society which we desire for Europe."
"In the Spanish State, where languages like Catalan, Galician and Basque form an important part of our cultural heritage and as such, and in their capacity as official languages, they deserve every possible assistance to flourish and thrive."
"Finally, perhaps I may make a reference to languages such as Berber which, apart from being spoken in Spanish territory, is the languages of thousands of emigrants who also help to enrich the Spanish and European cultural heritage."
"Thank you, Mr Mohamed Alí, and thank you also Mrs Larive."
"When I use the gavel it is only so that you may know that you have used up your time, but you can decide for yourselves in such a quiet and interesting evening as this and in such good company."
"Mr President, this report corrects what at times is an unforgivable oversight in the European institutions."
"There is much talk of official languages of the Union and it is forgotten that many millions of us citizens speak languages which are not official, though they are official in our own different spheres."
"It would be cynical to talk about linguistic diversity without putting these languages on the same footing and would constitute discrimination against the linguistic rights of European citizens."
"I would even go so far as to say that these languages need additional support because they are weaker in the face of the challenges posed by the information society."
"The Commission says that market forces by themselves are not enough to achieve the multilingual information society in Europe which is essentially a positive measure."
"So that is all the more true, if possible for the less wide-spread languages."
"Parliament's action in supporting this aspect in its Committee on Culture is an important advance, as will also be its final approval, I feel sure."
"Support for the weaker languages deserves special emphasis, particularly in bilingual regions."
"Bilingualism is cultural richness, but it is also an interesting aspect of tolerance and mutual respect."
"Having two languages is for some people something which helps us to understand a little better the concept of respect for others, as long as we are able to accept both as appropriate."
"We have to make appropriate machinery to ensure that in the information society in which communication will radically change, these languages may develop."
"Our world is experiencing two different phenomena, two faces of the same coin: globalization with the new technologies and innovation as a driving force, and at the same time, a return to what is small, to our own, to something with which we can identify ourselves."
"I think support for multilingualism in the information society will represent a fine balance between them."
"So, Mrs Mouskouri, many thanks for your report, which I am sure will work in that direction."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my enthusiastic support for Mrs Mouskouri's report on the adoption of a multiannual programme to promote the linguistic diversity of the Community in the information society."
"The report - and the amendments proposed by the Committee on Culture - show a laudable sensitivity and a very positive proposal for the application of the principles contained in the Treaty with regard to cultural policy, the conservation and protection of the Union's cultural heritage and the application of the principle of unity in diversity."
"The report and the amendments it proposes guarantee these principles, pay special attention to the non-official languages of the Union which have a recognized status at regional level and place the emphasis on the application of a policy guaranteeing and promoting the linguistic diversity of the European Union, ensuring multilingual information, including the protection of and help for the so-called minority languages and approving the funds necessary for it by an amount of ECU 20 million, according to the distribution proposed in Amendment 2."
"Vostè, senyor President, comprèn, com a català, l'especial importància del contingut d'aquest informe, atès el treball que realitzem per defensar llengües europees que, com la nostra, representen la identitat i la cultura de milions de ciutadans europeus, una riquesa espiritual a la qual Europa no pot renunciar, ans al contrari, ha de promoure i recolçar."
"For those who have not been able to follow the dialogue between the President and me, I was telling him in a common language spoken by millions of European citizens that we understand the importance of this report precisely because there are millions of European citizens able to express themselves in their own language, which expresses their identity and which is a spiritual richness which we cannot give up."
"Thank you, Mr Gasòliba."
"Ladies and gentlemen, although you may have been lost for some of the time, Mr Carles Gasòliba's speech was very interesting and I think it is also interesting for us to get used to hearing what languages sound like and so, on a day like today and in a debate like this, it seems very appropriate to hear one of the languages which represent the multilingual cultural wealth of the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the following quote from a recently published book on tele-translation goes to the heart of the proposal before us."
"It reads more or less as follows: now that we are beginning to master the technical problems the real problem of communications is coming to light, and it is enormous."
"Various languages wait like stumbling stones on the other side of the electronic highway and fully reveal the problematic nature of cross-cultural communications."
"To find solutions, that is the far more difficult task that the Commission has undertaken with this proposal for a pan-European project, together with the Member States and the appropriate private and public institutions."
"The report by Mrs Mouskouri, the rapporteur, on which I too want to congratulate her warmly, endorses our analysis of the impact of the information society on the European languages and vice versa."
"Nor is there any major difference of view on the actions required, although the European Parliament is rather more ambitious than the Commission thought justifiable at this point."
"Let me make it clear from the outset that the multilingual information society programme forms part of the comprehensive action plan entitled 'Europe's way to the information society' and is and must be coordinated with other actions provided for in that plan."
"After careful analysis of the 59 amendments the Commission decided to accept 21 amendments in full and 16 in part with small textual changes."
"For reasons of time I will not read them all out now."
"But the Commission does not find itself able to accept the remaining 22 amendments and I will now discuss the most important of these and explain why not."
"The European Parliament proposes taking Article 128 as a further legal basis in addition to Article 130 and links this with several other amendments as a logical consequence."
"The Commission is adhering to Article 130(2) as the legal basis because the main aim is to motivate industry to develop and offer multilingual products and services using advanced technological and linguistic tools."
"But its adherence to this legal basis has not prevented it from nevertheless asking the Committee of the Regions to give its opinion, which I am sure you are familiar with."
"The people of Europe use many languages in order to communicate and the information society must ensure that they can continue to do so."
"The main players who should ensure that the people can use their mother tongue are the many undertakings, the public sector and the private organizations that supply information to the people or receive it from the people and the specialized undertakings and occupations which facilitate the provision of these kinds of services in the various languages."
"The actions proposed by the Commission are directed primarily at them, in order primarily to create an awareness, to stimulate cooperation and to make the provision of linguistic services more transparent."
"These practical objectives led the Commission to propose Article 130(2) as the sole legal basis, even though the Commission fully and entirely appreciates the impact of this programme on other aspects of life and society and in particular on the protection of the linguistic heritage."
"The European Parliament regards the Commission's proposed funding as too modest."
"The Commission is assuming that for reasons of subsidiarity the Member States will primarily have to provide the funding, but that the private sector is also likely to invest in it."
"The proposed programme is due to run for only three years and it is breaking new ground."
"That is one reason to start modestly."
"The Commission's proposed budget of ECU 15 m is indeed limited but, in our view, it is appropriate for financing surveys, promoting awareness, mobilizing those concerned, creating the bases for institutional and linguistic infrastructures and promoting the use of multilingual tools."
"May I remind the European Parliament that the general financial plan seriously restricts new budget initiatives and the current Chapter 3 restrictions of the financial perspective are particularly stringent, as Mrs Theato has also just pointed out."
"Let me also point out that in line with the joint declaration on financial regulations of 6 March 1995 the Commission does not lay down any indicative frameworks in legal acts that are not the subject of co-decision."
"With regard to the allocation of funds, i.e., Amendment 58, the Commission can appreciate the emphasis on action lines 1 and 2, although one must not underestimate the important role of the public sector as the demonstrator of multilingual practice."
"In relation to synergy with other programmes I would like to point out that both the Commission and Parliament take the view that successful cooperation is and must be a keynote of this programme."
"However, the potential of cooperation and synergy is not restricted to Community initiatives."
"It would be counterproductive for this initiative to be isolated from similar national or regional initiatives."
"The multilingual information society can basically be regarded as an exercise in European cooperation, but that means that the programme must also be an attractive partner for other initiatives."
"Good and transparent management of the programme, broad political support and adequate financing are therefore necessary."
"Let me only emphasize, on the basis of my own dossier, that to some extent we also specifically promote minority languages in our INTERREG programme in order to make it clear that they represent a fundamental aspect of European diversity."
"So we are fully aware of the regional-policy importance of this subject."
"Let me end by thanking Parliament's committees, and especially you, Mrs Mouskouri, and the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media for your constructive and creative proposals."
"I am sorry that we differ as regards the legal basis."
"Nevertheless we can accept in part the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media's interpretation of the programme."
"We recognize that measures to deal with linguistic communication problems have cultural, social and also political consequences."
"But in the Commission's view the programme is directed above all at industry and the language industry, even if that word does not necessarily fill everyone with enthusiasm."
"For legal reasons the Commission cannot support the European Parliament's proposal."
"Nevertheless, the European Parliament and the Commission are following the same direction, although Parliament, as is only its right, is looking ahead a little further and more quickly."
"I am convinced that there is a general agreement between Parliament and the Commission on the need to take practical action to promote the development of a multilingual information society that will do justice to European diversity."
"Mr President, I put two very specific questions to the Commission."
"I can live with the fact that I am not getting an answer for the moment, but I did wonder if I might get an answer later in writing or whether I first need to put my question in writing in order to be sure of an answer."
"I would like to know, please."
"I am grateful to you, Commissioner, for the replies that you have given us."
"I would just like to say that the placing of Europe's diversity on an industrial footing is very difficult to accept."
"It is something that we cannot accept."
"Europe needs to create an infrastructure of its own based on its linguistic pluralism, on its multilingual wealth."
"Because its culture, to which, in the creation of this Europe, all of the countries will be linked, resides therein."
"I think that Europe's identity is encapsulated in its multilingualism, and restricting that multilingualism to an industrial presentation will restrict the projection of its quality."
"Spreading Europe's identity through the information highways with a quality lower than it would have in the dimension that is necessary for it, namely the cultural dimension, will place limitations on it."
"We shall keep on pressing as much as we can for that in the hope that you will be very understanding."
"Just a quick word to you, Mrs Mouskouri."
"We do not want to industrialize the diversity of Europe but on the contrary use industry, but also the public service and political measures, as instruments for making this cultural dimension of practical use to the people."
"That must after all be our objective."
"We cannot do that alone as an institution, nor can the European Union do it alone; to do so we need those who have to provide the resources to enable the people actually to be able to communicate in their own language on the data highway."
"I believe we entirely agree on that objective, even if we have different views on the legal basis."
"I would like to answer your questions, although I thought I had already done so in the context of the Committee of the Regions."
"Perhaps we can clarify the matters that are of special interest to you in a moment."
"My answer may have been too general."
"We are happy to go into more detail on certain questions if you wish."
"Thank you, Mrs Wulf-Mathies."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 7.55 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, yesterday morning I raised, under the Minutes, the suggestion that we should record in the Minutes the average cost of roll call votes, because I noticed that there were quite a large number from the previous day."
"That cost does not appear, nor does the suggestion about the number of trees that might be involved in a year in roll call votes."
"I mention this in particular because the Green Group managed to call for more roll call votes than anybody else."
"They should think of the trees!"
"Mr Kellett-Bowman, that was not the subject of the discussion but of course we will raise it and consider it."
"Madam President, I am very sorry but I have to speak up here."
"I am not usually inclined to comment on the Minutes, but Mr Kellett-Bowman should remember that the Green Group is not the only one to request roll call votes."
"Moreover, the Green Group is very much the group which constantly sees to it that trees are planted everywhere in Europe, forests are protected and roads are not built because they interfere with nature and destroy nature."
"So do not accuse the Green Group of destroying the environment by asking for roll call votes."
"You, Mr Kellett-Bowman, belong to a group which is constantly advocating trans-European networks which will ruin the natural environment everywhere."
"Mrs Van Dijk, we are discussing the approval of the Minutes!"
"Madam President, I had asked to speak before Mrs Van Dijk began talking about the networks, which cannot be discussed if there are no motorcyclists."
"I refer you to the proceedings for 18-19 June, page 18: in connection with what Mrs Larive said just before Mrs van Dijk spoke."
"Mrs Larive has just left for Cuba - I do not know if she has gone for good, I presume she is coming back - but the proceedings say ʼlastly, Madam President, an appeal to the motor cyclist himself, 82 years, average value'."
"Motor cyclists are usually on the elderly side when they hang up their helmets for good, but Mrs Larive was not referring to 82-year-old motorcyclists, but to 82 decibels."
"Will you have that corrected?"
"Mr Wijsenbeek, we are discussing the Minutes."
"What you are referring to is the Rainbow edition."
"But you can make requests for changes there too if you believe something needs changing."
"Madam President, the Schulz report was postponed yesterday and it says in the Minutes that it was deferred to the next part-session."
"I would like to know whether the so-called mini-session in Brussels is or is not now a part of this plenary part-session, for that would mean that it is postponed to July, or whether the Brussels part-session should be regarded as a separate part-session."
"I would also like to know whether this report is to be taken on Wednesday at the beginning of the part-session or on Thursday during voting time."
"Would you please clarify this because it is in no way clear from the Minutes."
"Firstly, the part-session in Strasbourg and the mini-session that follows it are regarded as a package and their agendas are drawn up together."
"The Schulz report will be put to the vote on the Thursday of the mini-session at 11 a.m."
"Madam President, people who are in the chair should express themselves carefully."
"There is no such thing as a mini-session."
"There are sessions or no sessions."
"Unfortunately this expression has become current, but in future I will express myself correctly."
"(Parliament approved the Minutes)"
"Votes"
"Madam President, do I understand from Mrs Mouskouri that this extremely long text is being presented as an oral amendment?"
"May I ask for clarification, because I was not altogether sure."
"Does Mrs Mouskouri's proposal entail amendment of the financial envelope?"
"Because if so, I really wonder whether that can be done in an oral amendment, otherwise could you just read out the one sentence containing the oral amendment."
"Because that is not clear at the moment."
"Mrs Mouskouri, could you please read out the sentence that is to be added again?"
"Madam President, Mr De Vries, yes, indeed, this will replace the first part of Amendment No 33."
"I will read it to you in French in order to be more precise."
"The reference amount for the total duration of the programme shall be ecu 20 million, of which ecu 5 million will be subject to the revision of the financial perspective."
"The added phrase states that ECU 5 million will be subject to the revision of the financial perspective."
"That is the oral amendment."
"Is that clear now, Mr de Vries?"
"On Amendment No 58:"
"Yes, precisely, Madam President, this follows on from Amendment No 33 and means that we should reject the second paragraph of Amendment No 58."
"The first part is exactly the same, following on as it does from Amendment No 33."
"So it should be put to a split vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"The Commission initiative to create a programme to promote linguistic diversity in the Community in the framework of the information society is fundamental for maintaining the Union's cultural diversity."
"An initiative that the excellent Mouskouri report, which I shall vote for today, has undoubtedly improved thanks to the tabled amendments."
"I should like to pick out those that change the legal base which makes it possible to bring the proposal through the co-decision procedure and those that help to highlight and strengthen the linguistic plurality of the Union by including regional and minority languages."
"Special importance for me as a representative of the people of Catalunya are those amendments that I myself introduced in committee and which mean that Catalan will benefit from the programmes contemplated in the proposal."
"In any case, the Mouskouri report is another step along the road towards a European Union that respects its cultural diversity and the signs of peoples' identities which comprise it and therefore I hope that the Commission will adopt it."
"As chairman of the Intergroup Working Party on Minority Languages I congratulate Mrs Mouskouri on her outstanding report and on the fact that the amendments of hers that were adopted today concentrate very strongly on promoting minority languages."
"Anyone who, like the rapporteur, is at home in nearly all the cultures of Europe, is aware of the inestimable value of cultural diversity and therefore able to sweep away the widely prevalent trend towards centralism."
"I now appeal also to the Council, the Commission and colleagues to maintain the budget line for the promotion of minority languages and, since it was used 100 % and a growing number of tasks need to be carried out, to agree to increasing it by 15 % during the forthcoming budgetary deliberations."
"Aid to ACP banana suppliers"
"The next item is the report (A4-0182/96) by Mr Castagnede, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a Council Regulation (COM(96)0033 - C4-0187/96-96/0028(SYN)) amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2686/94 establishing a special system of assistance to traditional ACP suppliers of bananas."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, you know that the Lomé Convention guarantees the presence in the Union market of traditional banana suppliers from the ACP countries."
"You also know that the creation of a common market organization for this product in 1993 affected the position of the traditional ACP banana suppliers in the Union market."
"It was for this reason that, in 1993, the Union created a special system of technical and financial aid to its traditional ACP banana producers, calculated to enable them to adapt to the new market conditions and, also, to ensure the maintenance of their income."
"This special system was defined within the framework of a regulation adopted in 1994, which formally expired on 28 February 1996."
"The Commission is proposing that we should extend the period of validity of that regulation until 31 December 1996, for two reasons."
"First, the delay in the availability of the statistics necessary to calculate the level of income support; secondly, the time required to present the projects eligible to benefit in those countries from the Union's technical and financial assistance."
"In principle, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's proposal presents no problem of any kind. That is why the Committee on Cooperation and Development proposed that it should be approved."
"However, it turns out, first, that during the past year the banana market in the Union underwent substantial and abrupt changes."
"As you know, the Union has expanded to include new Members and, for that reason, the Commission felt it should significantly increase the free import quotas for certain third countries, which are in essence the banana producing countries of Central America whose crops are marketed by the American multinationals."
"Apparently, the gate was open too wide."
"There was an oversupply in the market, and prices slumped."
"Secondly, it so happens that the common organization of the market in bananas is undergoing reorganization and redefinition, and this will be referred to very shortly."
"The ACP countries, as traditional suppliers of bananas, are legitimately concerned by these developments and, in particular, by a development which, because it would result in the market being opened up too widely to supplies from third countries, especially those producing at very low cost, threatens naturally to compromise their position in the market."
"The ACP - European Union Joint Assembly, meeting in Namibia during March, echoed these concerns and, by a resolution of 22 March, indicated its support for a mechanism which guarantees and perpetuates the special tie of solidarity that links the European Union to these ACP countries."
"Your Committee on Cooperation and Development felt that reference should be made to this resolution by the Joint Assembly in the interests of consistency between the positions defended here and those expressed before the representatives of the ACP countries."
"The committee wanted to make this reference simply in the form of an amendment, which does not modify the basis of the Commission's proposal but merely changes its recitals."
"So it seemed that there was no legal obstacle whatsoever to a decision by the European Union making reference to the opinion of a consultative body."
"I would simply like to make it clear that, if the effect would be to delay the application of the special assistance system, your Committee on Cooperation and Development would in all probability not maintain a position which would produce such a negative effect, the more so since Parliament will very soon be asked to consider the merits of the conditions of the changes in the market organization."
"That, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, concludes the remarks I wanted to make in connection with this Commission proposal."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Castagnède has accurately explained the meaning of today's debate on the partial and concrete modification to Regulation 2686/94 setting up a special assistance system for traditional ACP banana suppliers."
"The Commission is simply proposing to extend the expiry date of the Regulation - 28 March 1996 - until 31 December for reasons which are fully explained by the rapporteur, Mr Castagnède and which I shall not reiterate for time reasons."
"The amendment tabled by the Committee on Development is an amendment that takes up, as the rapporteur also said, a motion for a resolution that I myself, together with Mr Robles Piquer, tabled at the ACP Joint Assembly meeting in Windhoek, Namibia and that, with contributions by other members and other groups of ACP representatives, was unanimously adopted."
"It is simply a political declaration intended to strengthen the position of both ACP countries and European banana producers, defending what is done by the banana COM."
"Defence of Regulation 404/93 which is quite relevant as, ever since its approval, the banana COM in Europe has come under constant attack by means of legitimate measures, undoubtedly, in many cases, in most cases, but sometimes using measures that do not seem to be entirely justifiable."
"For example, we have known for some months now that up to 100, 000 tonnes of bananas per annum have been smuggled in through European ports by quite fraudulent means: each bundle of bananas must weigh 18.14 kg but when inspections are carried out it seems that they all weigh more, mostly 19-20 kg."
"This is part of a plan to undermine quotas, in other words it is yet another way of undermining or violating current Community rules."
"We think that the resolutions proposed by the Committee on Development should be approved as it is defended by Mr Castagnède with the amendments tabled by the Committee on Development."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not think I need describe the proposal again because the rapporteur has presented it to you."
"So I will only point out that it is urgent to adopt this proposal because the regulation lays down that the income support must be calculated annually in July."
"ECU 30 m is entered for this purpose out of the 1996 resources, but until the proposal has been accepted, we will not have the necessary legal basis for allocating them."
"Unfortunately the Commission does not find it possible to accept the two amendments, because they are not legally compatible with the text of the regulation, because the Commission does not accept the Windhoek resolution and in particular because the second amendment goes beyond the framework and scale of the resources allocated."
"That is why I would ask you to withdraw that amendment."
"Thank you, Mrs Wulf-Mathies."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Madam President, I think that Mr Castagnède has gone out but I think that he clearly said that now that the Commission opinion is known - we found out about it a few days ago and it has now been reiterated by Mrs Wulf-Mathies - both amendments should be withdrawn and not put to the vote."
"In nay case we would recommend a vote against them."
"Madam President, I rise to confirm the point of view put forward by Mr Fernandez Martin."
"As soon as the Commission informs us that the adoption of the amendments might result in delaying the implementation of the assistance system, we shall take the responsibility of asking you not to vote on those amendments."
"Madam President, this explanation of vote will be very brief."
"The consensus which has very clearly formed on this proposal and the pragmatic approach which led us to take all necessary steps to ensure that assistance is expedited require no explanation, but argue in favour of the need for the European Union to accept its historical role and, consequently, to demonstrate its solidarity with these ACP countries, whose economies are highly dependent on one-product systems."
"Those systems were established during the colonial period and have been reinforced since these former colonies became independent of their European rulers."
"Next, it is important that the European Union should remain faithful to its principles, and in particular to the social clause."
"Mr Castagnède, the rapporteur, has moreover reminded us forcefully that, gradually, the Union has been attentive to the social clause and, therefore, to the need to be extremely rigorous with regard to imports of bananas from the dollar areas, where social dumping is widespread and the democratic rules that govern market economies are not properly respected."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Wine"
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the wine and sparkling wine sector is regulated by a large number of European regulations."
"Over a year ago Parliament delivered its opinion on the common organization of the market in wine."
"To our great regret this subject was not taken up under either the Spanish or the French presidency of the Council and nor will Italy reform the wine market in such away as to meet the justified demands of the various wine regions in the European Union and of the wine market."
"The European wine description legislation should be checked and reworked thoroughly."
"The current description legislation has developed from a compilation of the various provisions in the Member States and at the initial stage it was possible to harmonize only a few regulations with a view to a single market."
"Given this background, which was most apparent in the approval or prohibition principle, a very complex, obscure and in part unsystematic set of provisions inevitably developed."
"Simplification is urgently needed here in general."
"The Commission proposal deals with the amendment of four regulations on wine and sparkling wine."
"New developments and knowledge make it necessary to adjust the existing regulations."
"The European Parliament was consulted on only two of these four regulations."
"But since the main points are to be found in the other two regulations, the Committee on Agriculture decided to give its position on them too."
"One important point in the Commission document concerns the indication of the producer."
"The Committee on Agriculture considered that in the case of quality sparkling wines the name of the producer must be indicated on the label."
"Over and above that, however, the name of the vendor may also be indicated, on a voluntary basis."
"Many hotels, restaurants and firms, and the European Parliament too for that matter, offer sparkling wines which indicate not the producer but the hotel or restaurant as the vendor."
"That signifies that this cuvée has been specially selected by that hotel or restaurant for its customers."
"So the name is a guarantee of the quality and contents of the bottle."
"This house-label business offers many sparkling wine firms a considerable sales market."
"In Germany alone there are some 20 000 house labels."
"This market must not be destroyed."
"That is why the EPP Group has submitted a compromise proposal making it optional whether to indicate the vendor."
"In some Member States, an imitation sparkling wine is being produced and marketed in Russia as genuine sparkling wine."
"This imitation sparkling wine has never seen a grape."
"It consists of water, alcohol, liquid sugar and flavourings and colourings and is carbonated."
"But the Russian consumer cannot learn this from the bottle because the label is not written in Russian script."
"One German firm wants to produce 100 million bottles a year."
"That has to be banned!"
"We cannot have this kind of artificial product being marketed in a sparkling wine bottle."
"For of course the consumer believes that is what he is buying."
"We want to prohibit the use of sparkling wine bottles for this product."
"The report clearly defines which beverages may be bottled in sparkling wine bottles."
"In addition to champagne and sparkling wine, beverages which have traditionally been marketed in these bottles may continue to be marketed in them."
"But these bottles may not be used for imitation sparkling wine."
"Following a judgment by the European Court of Justice, the term 'crémant' is now authorized on a wider basis."
"The Commission has laid down the minimum requirements for the production of crémant."
"There must be no deviation from the quality criteria."
"After a controversial discussion of this point in the Committee on Agriculture, a compromise proposal has now been submitted."
"In future crémant may be produced in all wine-growing regions of the European Community in which quality sparkling wine has traditionally been produced, but subject to strict quality criteria."
"The Commission also proposes including the terms 'Qualitätswein garantierten Ursprungs' and 'Qualitätsschaumwein garantierten Ursprungs' in the list of terms authorized for Germany."
"As rapporteur I welcome that proposal."
"That enshrines these two terms in EU law and means that in future they may be used in Germany."
"The Commission provides for two new designations for table wines."
"The Italian term 'vino tipico' is to be replaced by 'indicazione geografica tipica' and the term 'regional wine' is introduced for table wines originating in the United Kingdom."
"There are also to be new terms for indicating the taste of sparkling wine, namely 'brut nature' or 'no dosage' ."
"The term 'brut nature' is traditionally used in Spain for sparkling wines."
"We have to accept this regional fact and enshrine the term in EU law."
"Those are the main points of my report."
"I thank Members and the secretariat of the committee for the good work done together and would ask you to support my proposals."
"Madam President, I would like to pay tribute to Mrs Klaß for her work on this excellent report."
"We have all enjoyed the discussions - sometimes very wide-ranging - we have had on it."
"Mrs Klaß has borne them with good humour and we have all learned a great deal and I thank her for her work."
"From the Socialist Group's point of view we will be supporting most of the amendments tabled."
"On our voting list we made a slight mistake: we will now be supporting Amendment No 11 which Mrs Klaß referred to earlier - so I would remind my Socialist colleagues to vote for Amendment No 11"
"I particularly welcome Amendment No 10 because it will place a limit on the way in which champagne-style bottles can be used."
"In England where we do not produce these beautiful wines there is a development which is to be regretted, namely that manufacturers of alcoholized cola and alcoholized lemonade are putting their products into champagne-style bottles, trying to give the impression that they are of good quality when, in fact, they are absolute rubbish to drink and to taste."
"So I hope that Amendment No 10 will play some part in ensuring that this regrettable development stops."
"We welcome this report and look forward to it going through hardly amended."
"Madam President, this is a proposal for a Council regulation amending four previous regulations concerning provisions on quality wines produced in given regions and on sparkling wines produced in the Community."
"It is a proposal with which we are fundamentally in agreement because it meets basic objectives: first of all to unify legislation and adapt it to the needs and realities of European Union wine producers."
"I shall speak only about the latter."
"We fully agree with the Commission proposal to maintain the use of one, two or three varieties."
"We also agree that the name of the producer should be shown, and possibly the name of the seller."
"We also back the idea on brut nature - which we shall not develop because everyone here knows what it is about - and the solution found for the problem of crémant which created discriminations between different producing regions in the European Union."
"A compromise solution has been found that I think is reasonable for everyone."
"As Mr Hallam said we insist on an immediate ban on the bottling of other products in champagne-style bottles, a current trend."
"This situation is harming the Union's producers of the real products to the tune of millions of ecus."
"This must be banned and care must be taken to observe this ban throughout the Union, including exports."
"Madam President, here then we have four regulations to bring a little order into the confused bundle of legislation in the most delicate of the agricultural sectors: wine and, in particular, sparkling wines."
"What a good idea of the Council to have a thorough report by Mrs Klaß who has had to work her way through the many and varied styles in which Community producers perform here."
"Yes indeed, because wine is not made solely of grapes, it is also made of culture, and it is specifically those differing practices that frequently conceal serious threats to the moral integrity of wine that has at least and always to be mainly derived from grapes."
"Wine production in areas in which grapes do not grow is therefore an industrial and not an oenological practice."
"Transporting too many grapes from one region to another distorts one of the basic characteristics of wine which derives its character and identity from its place of registration."
"That is stated by Regulation No 2392/89 which rightly places a strong emphasis on origin and, in the case of table wines, replaces the weak description 'vino tipico ' with the more robust 'indicazione geografica tipica ' , now finally in force - and, what is more, with retroactive effect."
"That same regulation limits to three the grape varieties to be shown on the label."
"Frankly, that is still too many for anyone wishing to defend their own personality."
"But the proposal with the most bite comes from Regulation 2332/92 on sparkling wines."
"These are the stars of the market, following in the footsteps of their noble cousin, French champagne."
"Quite rightly, the precautions taken here are greater still, but it may perhaps be a little exaggerated to propose a minimum of 90 days on the lees in all cases."
"For some sparkling wines that are obtained in autoclaves using agitation, a shorter period will suffice."
"Of importance in this regulation is the extension granted to 31 August 1998 for the process of adjusting superior wines using products that did not originate in the area of production, albeit subject to drastic limits."
"Moving on to sparkling wines, we are also right to be concerned about the constitution of a product that is held in such high regard."
"That is why I am opposed to any concession concerning the use of typical sparkling wine bottles for wines or other food products."
"The risk of fraud is always just around the corner and even the smallest concession may encourage it, that is why I have asked that we vote separately on the different parts of Amendment No 10 - the first paragraph is acceptable but thereafter it contains too many dangerous exemptions in regard to other products."
"Unfortunately, fraud is already rife on the market, as we were reminded by the rapporteur: there are, for example, the producers who send from France and Germany to Eastern Europe tankers full of grape or other fruit juice to which alcohol is then obligingly added, and this is subsequently sold as sparkling wine in elegant bottles that are easily mistaken for the real thing and, what is more, to complete the deception - beware - the names given on the label are in Italian."
"Mr President, the Liberal Group very much supports the work of the rapporteur and most of the amendments, although not those of the ARE."
"I was interested to hear Mr Hallam's comments in the long tradition in the UK of Socialists supporting champagne."
"We agree with his comments."
"I personally - and the Liberal group - welcome the fact that certain English wines can now have regional designations."
"I am still very concerned that no vineyards are able to have quality labels within the United Kingdom."
"In my constituency in Fowey in the Camel Valley we have excellent wines which are still not able to have those designations."
"With your indulgence I would like to move on to a more important topic."
"Last night in my constituency a gentleman called Albert Tong was arrested by the British authorities to be deported to Hong Kong, causing the break-up of a British family."
"He is now in hospital with heart condition."
"I wish to express my dismay and disgust at those actions."
"Mr President, first I would like to congratulate the rapporteur."
"It is always a pleasure to deal with people who know what they are talking about and that is quite definitely the case here."
"Even if the report looks rather technical at first glance, it does cover major problems as regards content."
"Let me particularly emphasize the fact that it is thanks to the rapporteur's and the committee's work that regionalization in the wine sector has now been established and trend away from the producer towards the vendor, towards artificial production, has been stopped."
"In our group's view that has something to do with ecology, even if no specific reference is made to it here, because the description of origin allows the consumer to know where a product comes from and to check how it was grown."
"In the age of BSE, when we have seen what anonymity and uncontrolled sales can lead to, it is particularly important to be stringent in this field."
"Now one could say, in relation to sparkling wine in Russia, that it does not matter what you get drunk on, but of course here we are concerned not with alcohol but with a semi-luxury."
"That is why I am very glad that this report was drawn up; our group supports it and the amendments it proposes."
"Mr President, so, while we wait for the end of the saga of the COM for wines and while we wait for the European Commission, scratching its head over its meat problems, to adopt the legislation on registered designations of origin, we are being asked to amend, for the sake of simplicity, this legislation on quality sparkling wines produced in specific regions."
"As all speakers have pointed out, this concerns many regions of Europe and especially of France: the Jura, the Loire, Burgundy and of course not forgetting my own region of Languedoc-Roussillon."
"I would remind all honourable Members that it was in 1531 - in the XVIth century - that people in the Limoux region began to produce what was to become the world's oldest dry sparkling wine, even before Champagne, represented by our colleague Bernard Stasi, got to work."
"The cooperative cellar at Arques, for example, produces 6 million bottles and serves more than 500 producers."
"As to the minimum definition, everyone agrees on it."
"100 litres of settled must for every 150 kilos of grapes, the pressing of whole grapes, a maximum sulphur dioxide content of 150 mg, a sugar content of less than 50 g per litre, everyone agrees on these, although it should be specified that secondary fermentation in bottle is necessary and also - something which I regret to see has not been made clear - that the wine must be left on its lees for at least 9 months."
"And we all agree with the concept, the idea that crémant must be associated with a specific region to prevent the global insanity of the European Commission endlessly extending the production areas."
"Even so, I have certain reservations."
"The period of fermentation with the traditional methods is based on that for closed vats, and I can tell Mr Santini that the longer the period of fermentation the higher the quality of the finished product."
"So it should be clearly understood that a fermentation period of 90 days is a minimum."
"A much greater anxiety, Mrs Klaß, relates to the naming of the winemaker on the label."
"I am well aware that this is included in the basic Regulation, but the concept of winemaker is not clear."
"A producer is associated with a particular region, whereas the concept of a winemaker may allow the emergence of multicultural, multiethnic, multiregional wines: we are going to find ourselves stirring up wine from Australia, Chile, Argentina, Spain, more of it, if it really is from Spain - and France, all of it bearing hotel labels!"
"I have heard about hotel labels, restaurant labels, McDonald's crémant."
"So I have misgivings, Mrs Lulling, because the European Commission can always be expected to do its worst - never forget the meat business, remember it for ever."
"So it is absolutely essential to prevent the creation of vineyard Coca-Cola and a situation where the multinational Cigrav, which is a winemaker, mixes everything up together and make us a crémant which - if I can say this about a crémant - makes us foam at the mouth."
"That is my most important reservation."
"Yes to specific regions and no to vineyard Coca-Cola."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Klaß for the excellent report she has produced in consultation with the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"I also extend my congratulations to my colleague Mrs Barthet-Mayer for the effort that has gone into her numerous amendments."
"And, if I may, I should like to make a few comments on the amendments that have been tabled."
"First, Amendment No 1. On the official pretext of easing the administrative burden on winegrowers, this amendment may have the unwanted effect of making it difficult to monitor the quality of wines and grape musts."
"Similarly, I shall be opposing Amendment No 4, because it makes it possible to retain the term 'wine' for sparkling wines which have not achieved the legally prescribed excess pressure or no longer exhibit that excess pressure."
"My reasons are simple: if the product is not of sufficient quality at the end of the production process, or if the storage conditions have not allowed it to retain that quality, it is logical that the product should be destroyed or reprocessed - according to the statutory and recognized oenological practices, naturally - before it is marketed."
"As regards the amendments relating to the definition of crémant, about which we have just heard so much, I shall of course be in favour of Amendment No 9, the result of a compromise reached by the Committee on Agriculture, because crémant must remain a quality product and so correspond to specific standards in terms of traditional vine varieties, pressing rates, maximum sulphur dioxide content and maximum sugar content."
"Moreover, the name 'crémant' represents a particular oenological method and must compulsorily be associated with a specific region within a Member State."
"So we can talk about Crémant d'Alsace, Crémant de Bourgogne, Crémant de Loire, Crémant du Jura, etc., and not just 'crémant' on its own."
"I shall be voting in favour of Amendment No 10, and I will ask the rapporteur to accept an oral amendment from me."
"This is because the amendment contains the words 'may be put up in 'Champagne'-type or similar bottles' ."
"I would prefer the term 'Champagne' , which relates to a French registered designation of origin, to be replaced by the term 'sparkling wine' , which conforms to the original text of the amendment and, moreover, has the advantage of being a generic expression which makes no reference to any particular geographical indication."
"With regard to Amendment No 11 tabled by the rapporteur, this states that it is necessary to add 'the name of the local administrative area, or part of the local administrative area, and Member State in which the abovementioned person has his head office' ."
"For many undertakings, and especially winegrowing ones, the registered office of the undertaking is located at the same place as the premises where the product is produced."
"On the other hand, in the case of large undertakings, a single head office may cover a number of different production establishments."
"I shall of course accept all the amendments tabled by my colleague Mrs Barthet-Mayer, with who I have worked very closely. However, I cannot accept Amendment No 6, tabled by her and accepted by the Committee, unless the word 'complete' is deleted."
"My reason here is the statement that the term 'producer' defines the operator who undertakes the complete production of the product."
"Moreover, in some regions, it is possible to subcontract certain procedures, bottling for example, a practice more commonly known as bottling to order."
"However, in other regions, some wine is sold in barrel."
"The definition of a producer must not be too strict, or it would result in unnecessary detail on the label and would disrupt the economic balance existing in our production regions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to express my support for the proposals in the reports by Mrs Klaß, which have the advantage of paying special attention to quality wines and sparkling wines - one of the sectors in the European Union that has developed fastest and shown positive developments, in my country, Catalonia, for example, in respect of cava ."
"This process of improvement and accuracy had to be reflected in the regulations, especially vigilance over quality, because it is by improving quality that this sector can be competitive and face up to other wine derived products."
"Mr President, Mrs Klaß' report proposes a number of important simplifications to the current EU rules and regulations."
"So in principle our group very much welcomes it."
"But in our view the Commission's proposal to indicate three instead of two vine varieties on the labels of quality and table wine is not useful because it would lead to even more confusion on the labels."
"We should take a decided stand against allowing artificial and imitation sparkling wines, which the consumer has always recognized as such, to be bottled and marketed in traditional sparkling wine bottles."
"In the opinion of Austrians, who had to deal with an appalling wine scandal some ten years ago, any measure that describes the quality of a product in clear, honest and comprehensible terms is a good one, because it will do much to restore consumer confidence."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the present regulation applicable to wine may be regarded, both as regards definition and as regards presentation or labelling, as extremely complex."
"Though we may regret this - in that major efforts have to be made to comply with provisions which sometimes seem pernickety - we also have to accept that it is necessary, because of the extreme complexity and diversity of wine itself, the different grape varieties, different regions, different designations relating to ancestral production traditions and customs reflecting the growth of what I will unhesitatingly call 'the civilization of wine' ."
"It was logical, then, for the Commission to propose adjustments, and I must thank and congratulate Mrs Klaß, who is absolutely right when she refers to the need to simplify the rules."
"So I will dwell briefly on a few specific points, with a view to the joint interests of the producer and the consumer."
"As regards quality sparkling wines, the concept of the producer seems to us to be essential: after all, apart from the grower of the grape, it is he who gives the sparkling wine its character, and who guarantees its quality associated with its designation."
"It does seem to us essential, therefore, that the name of the producer should appear on the label of this type of wine."
"In fact, for us, as consumers, this information is a yardstick for the quality of the product."
"Although it should of course be permitted for the vendor to be named, we believe that this should be an optional addition to the naming of the producer."
"The best solution would be to make it obligatory throughout the Member States for the producer's name to be stated in black and white."
"If this is perhaps impossible or unacceptable as yet - though we shall come to it one day - it is at least essential to give every Member State the option of doing so."
"That is the purpose of the amendment tabled by Mrs Barthet-Mayer. I fully approve of that amendment, and recommend you to vote in favour of it."
"As far as crémant is concerned, I will not dwell on matters that have already been covered."
"What matters to us, I feel, is to ensure that quality and tradition in wine-growing are respected."
"We need to apply strict production criteria and to retain an association between the word 'Crémant' and the region from which it comes - crémant de Bordeaux, de Moselle, d'Alsace, etc.: that is the condition for the idea to be accepted by the only traditional regions where quality sparkling wine is produced."
"This is the purpose of the amendment tabled by our rapporteur."
"It is the result of a carefully negotiated compromise within the intergroup of which I am chairman, which has thus once again shown how useful and dynamic it is."
"Mr President, I shall conclude by expressing the hope that matters of this type, brought up on a Friday when the House is sparsely attended, will be better treated in future."
"Wine, a fruit of our Mediterranean and European civilization, would, I think, have been deserving of a wider audience."
"I urge you then, ladies and gentlemen, to ensure a very large majority for the survival of the values that our Western civilization associates with wine."
"Mr President, as this is my maiden speech I should like to begin by thanking the presidency for their kind words of welcome on 20 May and thank all of my colleagues that I have met here in this excellent Assembly."
"Since I come from an excellent wine-producing region, the ancient kingdom of Navarre, it is with much interest that I have followed the excellent work done by my colleague, Mrs Klaß."
"Unfortunately, I was unable to take part in the debates but I have been particularly concerned about Amendment No 3 changing the date for allowing the use of 15 % of grapes from regions not mentioned on the label."
"I am worried that no new date has been set and that this exemption has been extended indefinitely."
"This might be the thin end of the wedge and mean that even more than 15 % of other-region grapes could find its way to our cellars, raising problems with DOC."
"The quality wine we want to protect must respect the consumer and the region it is supposed to come from."
"In any case it is laudable that both the Commission and the Committee on Agriculture are taking an interest in overseeing our wine production and the two million producers in the Union."
"There may be concern in some other committees, like that on Economic Affairs, where discussion has begun about the surplus production and how special taxes might foster such a surplus."
"I think that production is not too high but demand is too low."
"It is the non-producing countries with their high taxes on wine that are preventing lower income families from drinking wine."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad that I have been able to discuss two European cultural products while I was here today, namely linguistic diversity and now the diversity and quality of wines and sparkling wines in Europe."
"That is why I want to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and especially Mrs Klaß for their very good work on this report."
"The report contains a thorough analysis of all four proposals to amend the regulation on quality wines produced in specified regions, sparkling wines and their description, even if the European Parliament was only formally consulted on two of the amendments, namely the amendment of Regulation No 823/87 on quality wines produced in specified regions and of No 2332/92 on sparkling wines."
"The Commission takes note of the call to simplify the legislation on the description and presentation of wine."
"It also welcomes the fact that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has approved many of the Commission's proposals without change."
"That applies in particular to Regulation No 823 on quality wines and Regulation No 2332 on sparkling wines; only one amendment was tabled on the latter."
"Unfortunately that amendment calls for the possibility of using 'return' wine in the production of sparkling wine."
"The Commission cannot agree to that without first having an opportunity to discuss it in depth with the Member States."
"All the other amendments relate to Regulations Nos 2392/89 and 2333/92 on the description of wines and sparkling wines."
"On Amendment No 1 concerning no compulsory indication of the alcohol content and the nominal volume in the accompanying documents let me make the following comment: the Commission can take account of your views and make it clear that both must be indicated under the implementing provisions."
"The Commission cannot, however, accept Amendment No 2 on indicating only two vine varieties on wine labels because the indication of more than two vine varieties is now common practice and improves consumer information."
"Nor can the Commission accept the amendment proposing an unlimited extension of the exceptional provision under which quality wines may use the name of a geographical unit smaller than a specified region provided 15 % of the grapes used are harvested outside this geographical unit named on the label."
"It could, however, consider extending the deadline so that some Member States can make the necessary adjustments."
"Amendments Nos 5, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 concern the obligation to indicate the name of the producer or vendor on the label."
"The Commission can under no circumstances accept making it compulsory Community-wide to name the producer or vendor on the label, even if in some cases it only applies to quality wines produced in specified regions."
"Given the various types of sparkling wine produced in the Community, and in view of the different conditions in the individual Member States, the Commission believes it would be best to leave it up to the Member States to decide whether or not to make it compulsory to indicate the producer."
"That is why the Commission finds Amendment No 12, which provides for the possibility of producer Member States making it compulsory to clearly indicate the producer's name or firm, entirely acceptable, although the proposal on the optional designation of the vendor can be dropped since that is already regulated by the existing rules and I have understood that the compromise by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development also tends in that direction."
"The Commission cannot, however, accept Amendment No 5 on a new definition of sparkling wine producers because this definition is confined to sparkling wine produced in specified regions and according to traditional methods of fermentation in the bottle, which precludes from the outset sparkling wine produced in specified regions according to the pressure-vessel method."
"The Commission can accept Amendment No 8 concerning the indication of the sugar content of sparkling wines because it clarifies the conditions for the use of the proposed new designation."
"Regarding Amendment No 9 introducing additional criteria for the use of the term 'crémant' , the Commission agrees with some of the additional criteria proposed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for instance that the Member States must decide whether this term should be used in a specified region."
"But the Commission found it unacceptable for the term 'crémant' only to be used in regions which have traditionally produced this product."
"It therefore proposes - and from what some speakers have said I think there would be a consensus on this - that this rule should apply for all quality wines produced in specified regions in which the prescribed technical rules and therefore also the quality criteria are observed."
"With regard to the use of traditional vine varieties, the Commission does not consider it necessary to apply this new criteria to 'crémant' since it already applies to all quality wines produced in specified regions."
"Finally, the Commission can accept Amendment No 10 banning the use of sparkling wine bottles or bottles of a similar type for what are called imitation sparkling wines because it is designed to make the products that have traditionally used these types of bottle more recognizable and to prevent the public from being misled."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"I support this defence of quality products associated with particular regions, particular varieties in the case of wine, and very strict traditional methods."
"Today, we are concerned with the crémants."
"Their name cannot be given to just any sparkling wine, some of which have never seen a single grape!"
"Some time ago, we were defending the Champagne designation - and rightly so - prohibiting even the use of the term 'Champagne-type' ."
"Today, the problem is crémant, whether it comes from the Loire, the Jura, Alsace, Languedoc or Luxembourg."
"There can be no question of allowing any old sparkling wine to add to the confusion already caused by the shape of the bottle by deceiving the consumer with an ambiguous label."
"Our group, being concerned to ensure respect for traditional and regional products, has expressed the desire both within the Committee on Agriculture and in the plenary that crémant should remain a quality product complying with strict oenological and production standards."
"That is why we helped to draft, and supported, the amendments setting a maximum content of sulphur dioxide (150 mg/l), a sugar content of below 50 g/l, a pressing rate limited to 100 litres of settled must for every 150 kg of grapes, and wines produced from traditional grape varieties."
"These standards, of course, define a minimum quality level in order to be permitted to use the term 'crémant' ."
"But the Member States, the institutions responsible for registered designations of origin and the winegrowing syndicates must always be able to adopt stricter standards if they so desire."
"The use of the term 'crémant' must always be associated with a name identifying a production region."
"I stress the word always , because I know that some Member States and some third countries would like to use the word 'crémant' on its own, without associating it with a production region."
"Their aim would be to make 'crémant' a manufactured product of constant quality, irrespective of any typical features associated with region, vintage or harvesting and winemaking conditions."
"In order for crémant to remain a traditional product, therefore, an association with a region is essential."
"Crémant d'Alsace differs in composition, grape variety and characteristics, from the crémants from the Loire, Burgundy, the Jura, etc. and it must remain different."
"Our Alsace growers, our winegrowing syndicates and the INAO (National Institute of Registered Designations of Origin) have worked for more than twenty years to ensure that Crémant d'Alsace is what it is, and we must not allow community legislation, which will be replaced in the medium term by that of the IWO (International Wine and Vine Office) to destroy the heritage of our products."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Ornamental horticulture"
"The next item is the oral question (B4-0446/96-0-0118/96) by Mr Jacob and Mr Filippi, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, to the Commission, on the Community initiative to assist ornamental horticulture."
"Mr President, first I want to thank Mr Jacob and Mr Filippi for their oral question because I consider it important for Parliament to concern itself with this particular economic sector."
"As you know, the Commission has submitted a proposal on measures to promote the marketing of live horticultural plants and goods."
"The purpose of this proposal is to support national programmes to promote the use of live horticultural plants and goods produced in the Community, not just in the Union but in third countries too."
"The Community budget will bear 60 % of the total costs of the programme, which should amount to a maximum of ECU 10 million a year."
"The Commission is aware that the trade associations would like more funds to be allocated."
"The ECU 10 million proposed by the Commission is, however, comparable to the amounts available for advertising measures in other important agricultural production sectors, such as the dairy sector."
"The Commission is assuming that these programmes will have a positive effect on the incomes of the farmers concerned since general advertising measures of this kind have proved successful in the past and have markedly improved turnover and consumer interest in ornamental plants."
"Mr President, obviously ornamental horticulture is a sector of high ambitions in many countries which have concluded or would like to conclude a free trade agreement with the European Union."
"It has gone unnoticed that the European Union has already granted considerable trade concessions in this ornamental horticulture sector to countries which are actual or potential exporters of these products."
"I do not wish in any way to argue in favour of a more protectionist policy on imports of ornamental products."
"And the European Union has an interest in having free access to third country markets."
"Nevertheless, because of the great pressure from imports from third countries and because its own production has increased, the ornamental horticulture sector frequently suffers the problem of unduly low prices and incomes."
"Every effort must thus be made to improve the market position of ornamental horticulturalists in the European Union."
"The European Commission clearly has a job to do here in launching a Community initiative."
"With this in mind it is useful to make a comparison with the fruit and vegetables sector which is not unrelated to ornamental horticulture."
"In the fruit and vegetables sector the Commission proposed strengthening this sector by means of support for certain activities of producer organizations."
"This was to be done primarily by means of a Community contribution to action funds held by these producer organizations."
"Might the Commission consider a similar policy for ornamental horticulture, perhaps in an amended form?"
"The area concerned is the marketing activities of the producer organizations."
"With fruit and vegetables payments made be made for not selling, and there may be compensatory payments for market intervention."
"This does not arise in ornamental horticulture and would not have to be encouraged."
"But for most other marketing activities, primarily promotion, the system proposed for fruit and vegetables could also apply to ornamental horticulture."
"Is the Commission prepared to look at this and make funds available?"
"This would provide a fairer deal for this sector which all too often ends up as the poor relation in EU talks on free trade."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the appropriate exploitation of the natural resources of European regions must be stimulated and preserved in order to protect the lives of their populations and usually modest resources."
"When those regions suffer from natural disadvantages and their development has to be faster or more significant, that obviously calls for greater protection of those resources and the potential that they offer, especially when it is a question of agricultural production."
"The defence of ornamental plant and flower production is extremely important in the European Union and in the country I represent, especially the autonomous region of Madeira."
"Given the current imbalances in the marketing of exported flowers, because of trade agreements with non-Community countries in which due attention was not paid to their impact on the economies of Member States, the Commission must take urgent action, introduce financial aid and take other measures so that production can be preserved and, better still, so that it can properly expand."
"It must not be forgotten that, as well as all the European Union support to Member States and their producers, it is vital to apply to our production - and not only farming production, but especially quality production at good prices and of manifest interest for the whole European economy - the principle of Community preference which should always figure and been observed in cooperation agreements with third countries."
"The problem of unemployment is now at stake and we do not want it directly or indirectly worsened."
"To go off on a slight tangent, I recall that in one way or another Community preference has been mentioned or applied but only in a few cases and when the interests or strength of stronger countries is at stake."
"I sincerely congratulate Mr Jacob and Mr Filippi on the relevance of their oral question on this issue."
"As for the amendments to the text of the resolution tabled by Mr Mulder, I cannot support his first amendment on the application of VAT but I fully back his suggestion about creating a quality label that properly applies to present and future farm production."
"Mr President, the Commissioner can count herself fortunate this morning."
"Not only is she dealing with two European cultural products, she is getting a third one this morning, European flowers and ornamental horticultural products."
"This sector is currently in some danger, as a result of the conclusion of all manner of free trade agreements which are largely disadvantageous to this sector."
"They are disadvantageous because in those countries with which agreements are being concluded horticulture is extremely important and much of the produce is exported to Europe."
"What is important to us is that the conditions of competition should be the same."
"It seems to me not very fair that we in Europe should impose all manner of strict environmental requirements on horticulture and that we should import flowers from producers who do not have to meet such requirements."
"Hence my argument in favour of a quality mark."
"Another point: more promotional funds, not 0.05 % of total sales in the sector but I would say about 0.5 % of the value of the sector."
"Mr President, ornamental horticulture is having a difficult time at present."
"Growth is stagnant and competition is particularly fierce as a result of free trade agreements with countries such as Morocco."
"A strong boost is thus needed to sales of this economically important sector by means of marketing and promotional activities."
"In this respect the Commission's creation of a promotional fund is a welcome initiative."
"But the 10 million ECU budgeted for it are totally inadequate."
"Thanks to the lowering of tariffs on imports from third countries the Commission will lose some 60 million ECU."
"In fact this is a form of subsidy to ornamental horticulture in those countries."
"The 10 million ECU which the Commission is earmarking for the European promotional fund is in stark contrast to this."
"It is altogether reasonable to support the promotional fund too to the tune of 60 million ECU."
"Together with the 40 million ECU which the private organizations themselves spend on marketing and promotion, that makes an available total of 100 million ECU which is still well below the 2 % of the value of the trade which the Commission recommended for this objective in an earlier study."
"Let us not forget either that this fund is the only form of European aid to ornamental horticulture."
"Other sectors receive enormous sums of money."
"Lastly, I would ask the Commission to press for cut flowers to remain in the low VAT band."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, I just wanted to say that in my country, in Catalunya and the País Valencià, the production of ornamental plants is an important crop that has replaced other crops for many years now."
"We are quite aware that the European Union has to reach agreements with third countries, especially North African countries."
"The Barcelona Conference was quite explicit on this score."
"But reaching trade agreements with these countries does not mean neglecting or undermining the needs of the ornamental plant sector in the European Union."
"I therefore think that what Mr Mulder said is important - there must be fair competition and proper environmental conditions must be demanded of countries exporting flowers to the Community so that we can safeguard our own sector, a very important one in the Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in my country too ornamental horticulture is going through a difficult period for the reasons already stated but primarily too as a result of the great difference in the VAT rate between ourselves and our neighbours."
"The Commission proposal which sought a solution was blocked for a long time by the Belgian Government."
"Its view was that from 1995 the normal rate had to apply in all Member States."
"Last year it even went to the Court and brought an action against seven Member States."
"This attitude is hardly helpful to the ornamental horticulturalists."
"The Belgian Government is inconsistent too, because it is not in favour of raising the reduced rate on firewood and wool, principally products from French-speaking Belgium, but is in favour of reducing the normal rate on cut flowers which are principally grown in Flanders."
"Fortunately a preliminary agreement seems to have been reached within COREPER on the application of a reduced rate."
"I hope the ECOFIN Council will ratify that agreement on 8 July next."
"I also hope the Commission will quickly come up with measures to keep the sector competitive."
"Mr Mulder's suggestion of a quality mark is certainly worth investigating too."
"I would just like to add two comments to what I said earlier, firstly on Mr Sonneveld's suggestion about the question of comparable treatment with the fruit and vegetable sector and secondly in relation to VAT."
"I also thank Mr Mulder for presenting me here with another bouquet of cultural products of Europe."
"On the question of comparability with the fruit and vegetable sector let me point out again on behalf of the Commission that of course the horticultural sector has its own characteristics that are not comparable with those of other sectors, including fruit and vegetables."
"It is, however, true that increased imports from third countries are putting pressure on our own producers' incomes."
"In order to remedy this situation, a rule was introduced in the EU organization of the market on adherence to minimum prices for products imported from Mediterranean countries together with a protective clause that will be applicable from 1 January 1997 under the new generalized system of preferences."
"In the Commission's view these measures, together with the above support programme, suffice to maintain the dynamism of the sector."
"As regards VAT, i.e., the reduced VAT rate, I hope that the compromise reached in the Council by the presidency will be adopted at the next Council meeting and that VAT can therefore soon be reduced for this sector."
"In accordance with Rule 40(5) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received two motions for resolutions."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Motion for a resolution B4-0732/96"
"We cannot support a proposal which seeks to provide support of ECU 60 million per year for horticulture."
"It is unreasonable that every single sector of agriculture should receive additional support every time it gets into difficulties."
"After all, this does not happen with other sectors of the economy, such as industry and services."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Aid to the Slovak Republic"
"The next item is the report by Mr Konecny (A4-0157/96), on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, on the proposal for a Council Decision repealing Decision 94/939/EEC providing further macro-financial assistance for the Slovak Republic (COM(96)0009 - C4-0154/96-96/0018 (CNS))."
"Mr President, when the Commission and Parliament decided at the turn of 1994/1995 to grant the Slovak Republic a loan of ECU 130 million it did so with the intention of supporting a positive course of economic reform, in particular by ensuring that it would not be threatened with balance of payments problems."
"The reason this decision is now to be repealed is that both these objectives have become obsolete."
"Firstly, the economic situation in Slovakia had already begun to change in 1994, which led to impressive growth rates, a marked fall in the inflation rate and above all a change in the balance of payments and current account."
"These showed surpluses again as early as 1994."
"Under these circumstances it is obviously no longer necessary to grant a balance of payments loan, for which the EU would have stood guarantee."
"This indisputable economic success, on which Slovakia must certainly be congratulated, is, however, only one reason why we should now repeal our decision."
"The second, equally significant one is the fact that the negotiations with the new Slovak Government of the time on the economic conditions that were to be tied to this loan had reached a dead end by the spring and summer of 1995."
"Slovakia neither proved willing to repeal the protectionist measure of a 10 % import levy nor - which I at least consider even more serious - did it indicate that it was prepared to repeal the change of course in its privatization policy at the time."
"And this without doubt takes us to the crux of our disagreement with the Slovak Republic and its current government, which neither can nor should be concealed in this context, although I am quite deliberately confining myself to the economic aspects and not taking into consideration the many political questions which have also been discussed and criticized in this House."
"After all the European Parliament sees it as its particular task to support movements towards reform in the Central and Eastern European states on a basis of solidarity, since they create the conditions for further steps towards integration and eventually in many cases for membership of the Union."
"That includes, for instance, the creation of sound economic structures."
"I must express my doubts about their 'soundness' and therefore about the success of the current economic course being pursued in Slovakia."
"This year there is a deficit again in its foreign trade balance."
"One might ask whether it is really sound for two undertakings each to account for almost 20 % of all exports, namely on the one hand a refinery which has no raw materials basis in the country itself, and on the other hand a steel works, whose most prominent products are certainly not suited to peaceful uses."
"Then we have the form of privatization, which we imagine as fair, transparent and forward-looking."
"The repeal of the former programme of voucher privatization is extremely problematic from that point of view."
"In the view of many observers, the form of what is called management buy-outs that is generally chosen now does not just squander the national wealth but in particular forms a basis for non-transparent power structures in the Slovak economy, which are no less than an invitation to suspicion."
"Privatization should include an orderly economic life, and that cannot be reconciled with events such as occurred two weeks ago when the management of a large undertaken was dismissed and led away by armed works guards, only to come back the following day under a police escort which in turn disarmed the works guards."
"Nor can it be reconciled with government crises that are sparked off by arguments about which party's sphere of influence a supposedly privatized undertaking is to come under."
"I quite understand that a nation that only became independent so recently feels particularly sensitive."
"And it is certainly not an easy task to turn a part of what was once a unitary economy into a national economy."
"Slovakia is extremely sensitive about anything that looks like interference or a patronage, and it deserves our understanding for that too."
"But it is without doubt our duty and our right to call, without any arrogance but emphatically, for the establishment of the common economic values characteristic of our Community."
"We hope and wish that Slovakia will correct its course and move politically and economically towards the common values on which the Union is based."
"Mr President, After this excellent report by Mr Konecny, I can be very brief."
"This Parliament's Group of the Party of European Socialists will fully support this report."
"I believe the rapporteur's statement complemented the report extremely well and threw great light on the complexity of the European Union's relations with the Slovak Republic."
"Given the positive trend of the Slovakian economy which has been referred to, and which of course led to today's decision, it really is incomprehensible why Slovakia is still imposing a 10 % import levy."
"At its second meeting in Brussels early this month the EU-Slovakia Joint Committee unanimously called for its abolition."
"We are assuming that this demand will be met in the foreseeable future."
"We also believe that the already mentioned, encouraging economic figures of the Slovak economy may also give cause for a certain optimism so that the political inadequacies rightly referred to by the rapporteur can be remedied in the foreseeable future."
"We are of course very pleased, given the budgetary situation in the European Union, that today's decision will relieve some of the pressure on a somewhat tight area, namely the European Guarantee Fund."
"Mr President, the reason I like the report by Mr Konecny so much is because it paints a differentiated picture of the differentiated situation in Slovakia, which is usually depicted in a simplistic manner."
"I am pleased with his reference to the fact that through their hard work in the recent years of change, the Slovakian people helped ensure that the money we have already granted is in a sense flowing back to us."
"OK, we no longer have it, but in a sense it is flowing back to us."
"I think we may conclude from this that Slovakia is on the right path in many areas."
"But I can also understand the concern he expressed in paragraphs 9 and 10 of his explanatory statement, both as regards privatization and the accompanying concentration of power in what are possibly the wrong hands, and as regards the political framework conditions."
"I think it is important not to separate the economy and the political framework conditions, for you simply cannot have a working market economy the rule of law also prevails."
"That is why I would point out - as the rapporteur did in his report - that it is not just the language law he mentions but also the criminal law that was recently introduced for allegedly anti-state opinions expressed abroad that are likely to destroy international confidence in Slovakia."
"On Wednesday the vice-president of the 'coexistence' movement of the Hungarian ethnic group in Slovakia was a guest of the inter-group working party on minority languages which I chair, and he told us about this problem and about the problem of the administrative reform, which is an attempt to rob the minority of the basis of their livelihood."
"We must continue to keep a careful eye on this situation."
"We should not try to tell them what to do but should distinguish on the basis of dialogue between the Slovakian people and various wrong turns."
"We have always supported self-determination for the Slovakian people."
"But this self-determination is only possible for the smaller nations of Central Europe if fragmented artificial states are replaced by a new, large entity that links the nations together, namely if the European Union is enlarged to the east."
"The peoples of this region must not confront one another but form a community that binds them together."
"That is why Slovakia must remain in the front row of countries we hope will become Member States."
"To support this is an important task, which is why I am glad that Mr Konecny has taken this matter up as he has."
"I believe we should certainly not slam the door on Slovakia and use the fact that economic successes have been achieved but that there are also points of criticism in order to enter into a differentiated dialogue with the Slovakian people, who clearly belong with us."
"Mr President, it is of course good news that a country previously promised macrofinancial assistance does not need it and, as Mr Posselt says, the money thus comes back."
"We are happy with that."
"Slovakia, Mr President, has seen unexpectedly positive economic development: economic growth of 5 to 6 %, a sizeable improvement in the balance of payments - from a one billion dollar deficit in 1993 to a small surplus in 1995 - and a rapid fall in inflation."
"This is an impressive achievement, and many a country of the Union would do well to emulate it."
"Slovakia is now able to operate in the capital market on its own account."
"This is all the more remarkable in that institutionally and economically quite a few problems remain."
"Slovakia is reluctant to agree to the terms attached to the macro-financial assistance it had requested earlier, and the privatization process in particular was a point of concern to would-be lenders."
"The European Union must continue to pay appropriate attention to this country by means of structured dialogue."
"In the first place - and the two previous speakers have already said that - an eye must be kept on the political situation and rights of minorities."
"For the time being it would appear impossible for Slovakia to join the Union on the basis of the current situation, but the same goes for privatization."
"The exemption of major areas of the economy creates great problems."
"Broad dialogue with the Slovak authorities would appear appropriate."
"And may I once more compliment Mr Konecny on this report."
"Mr President, I too shall be supporting Mr Konecny's report, but like all those who have spoken before me I must also express my concern at developments in Slovakia."
"It may well be that Slovakia does not need this loan, but it may primarily be a signal from the Meciar Government that it does not need the Union."
"It is precisely this which bothers me, because I know that the great majority of Slovaks think otherwise."
"The problem is of course that the Meciar Government has so far always ignored the pressure put on it by the Union."
"Examples have been given here, of action by the Meciar Government against minorities in the use of language, also for example the redrawing of provincial borders to ensure that the Hungarians will not be in the majority in one of the provinces, the laws on seditious talk, and so on."
"I think the Meciar Government has to remember that it has to respect human rights, that it has to respect democratic principles."
"I think it is very important in the near future, if the door is not to be shut in Slovakia's face, to encourage NGOs from the West and from Slovakia to contact each other and try jointly to get a dialogue going from the bottom up."
"I think quite honestly that this may achieve more than what we have been doing so far with our pressurizing of Slovakia, though this must of course continue otherwise Meciar will simply carry on as before."
"Mr President, Slovakia's economy is doing so well that foreign help with its balance of payments is no longer needed."
"The economy is growing considerably and unemployment is falling."
"Reasons enough to vote for the Commission's proposal to end macro-financial aid."
"But there are also economic minus points."
"The privatization programme is stagnant and the level of investment is very low."
"The question is thus whether the economic recovery is sufficiently sustainable, especially as Slovak exports are largely generated by just two companies and are heavily dependent on imports of cheap raw materials from Russia."
"So for the longer term not all the economic signals are green."
"The greatest problem, however, is the political problem."
"It is well known that there is tension between the president and the prime minister."
"There is no media freedom and life continues to be made difficult for the Hungarian minority."
"There is also notoriously the law on protection of the republic under which criticism of government policy may be a criminal offence."
"Commissioner van den Broek has repeatedly raised these matters with the Slovak Government."
"That critical dialogue should be continued."
"The tempo of change may be somewhat hesitant, but the changes do have to be in the right direction."
"Mr President, the Council proposal to repeal the financial assistance and the Slovak Government's rejection of further financial assistance is presumably based on the fact that Slovakia no longer wants to follow the path proposed by the European Union, in particular in its privatization policy."
"Moreover, the Slovak Government is not prepared to suspend the 10 % import levy on foreign goods."
"A further reason is probably the Slovakian nuclear policy."
"Slovakia is obviously not prepared to continue the construction of Mochovce according to Western safety standards and at the same time to close down the obsolete Bohunice nuclear power station."
"What does that mean in terms of cooperation between the European Union and the Slovak Republic?"
"For with the association agreement on the one hand and the disappearance of the financial aid and the conditions tied to it on the other, however much understanding we have for its difficult position, it will become easier for the Slovak Government to revert to a planned economy."
"For all these reasons the European Union must make greater efforts to seek dialogue with the Slovak Government in order to prevent Slovakia from pursuing a policy that tends to move away from Europe again instead of towards Europe."
"Mr President, the Commission welcomes Mr Konecny's report on behalf of Parliament's Committee on External Economic Relations, which supports our proposal to repeal the financial assistance to Slovakia."
"In 1995 the Commission held talks with the Slovak Government on the economic-policy conditions to which the loan was to be tied."
"No agreement could in fact be reached during these talks because the Slovak Government could not decide to take various measures that the Commission considered essential and in particular, as all the speakers have pointed out, rapidly to abolish the 10 % supplementary import levy which Slovakia has imposed since 1994."
"Moreover, the Slovak Government decided to cancel the voucher-privatization plan, which the Commission regarded as a highly important precondition for payment of the loan."
"Because of this about-turn in its privatization policy, the interim review provided for under the standby credit agreement with the IMF could not be carried out."
"This led the World Bank to break off the talks on a structural adjustment loan for the Slovak financial and business sector."
"Meanwhile, as has also been pointed out, the balance of payments situation in Slovakia has improved markedly, so that the Slovak Government has declared it is no longer interested in continuing the programme agreed with the IMF."
"In view of these facts and in particular of the inadequate structural reform carried out by the Slovak Government, the retention of the supplementary import levy and the marked improvement in the Slovakian balance of payments, the Commission proposes repealing the Council decision on financial assistance to Slovakia."
"In a letter the deputy prime minister and minister of finance of Slovakia addressed to the Commission at the beginning of the year, he took note of the Commission's proposal to repeal the financial assistance and conceded that this assistance is no longer justified."
"Once this assistance has been repealed, the necessary budgetary rectifications will of course have to be made."
"Let me point out that regardless of these events the Commission will continue its critical dialogue with the Slovak Government."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Fishery products from Ceuta"
"The next item is the report (A4-0154/96) by Mr Valdivielso De Cué, on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, on the proposal for a Council Regulation opening and providing for the administration of Community tariff quotas for certain fishery products originating in Ceuta (COM(95) 0687 - C40134/96-95/0351(CNS))."
"Mr President, in March the Council consulted the European Parliament on the proposal for a regulation opening and providing for the administration of Community tariff quotas for certain fishery products originating in Ceuta."
"The legal basis chosen by the Commission is the Spanish Act of Accession, in particular Article 25.4, calling for the opening of the quota to be regulated by a Council regulation and also calling for the European Parliament's opinion."
"I would like to remind you that Spain has three customs systems: one covering the mainland and the Balearics, the customs union with the European Union; one for the Canaries, and another for the territories of Ceuta and Melilla situated on the Mediterranean coast of North Africa."
"Once the report was assigned to the REX Committee we contacted the people of Ceuta in order to discover the social and economic reality there so that this report would be as objective as possible."
"Analysis of our report shows clearly that Ceuta is a city in decline, lacking land, water and energy and that the free port is also in decline, as we shall see."
"84.5 % of the population lives off the tertiary sector and is highly dependent on the current customs set up."
"This situation changed after the signing of the Mediterranean Agreement between the European Union and the kingdom of Morocco, setting up a free trade area over 12 years, breaking the previous trade specialisation model and raising problems of the future viability and economic survival of the city."
"Analysis shows the need for a new development strategy for Ceuta."
"On this score, we must consider using customs policy measures - in the REX Committee - as an instrument of economic and social cohesion for ultra-peripheral regions."
"Although the European Union has co-funded in Ceuta aquaculture activities and has started up a fish farm with genuine success, we think that it should also use - as a tool for boosting the economy and creating jobs- since there is a market - the possibility of adopting customs measures since Ceuta, although a part of a European Union Member State has a separate customs system; especially bearing in mind that extending the quota proposed in this report, together with the REX Committee's own amendments, would not distort the Community sea bream and sea bass market, as these are the products concerned and which enjoy full and growing demand."
"Therefore logic calls for an increase in the tiny quota of 200 tonnes proposed by the n to 1000 or 1200 tonnes in accordance with the projection included in the draft resolution."
"The knock-on effect on the g market would be very limited - not to say practically nil - other than in southern Spain. On the other hand the development of this activity would be beneficial for the GDP of the city of Ceuta, possibly as much as a 2 % increase."
"We think that employment would go up by 0.5 to 1 %. The economy would also be diversified whereas at the moment it is in dire straits as we have already said, for reasons already explained."
"Therefore the REX Committee is proposing to the Commission and the Council to extend the Community quota for sea bass and sea bream."
"This extension would result in a 69, 000 ECU loss for the Community budget but would harmoniously consolidate and develop industry and help the economic diversification of the region as the quotas could be gradually increase over the next two years."
"That is why we are asking the Commission to draft a technical report in order to assess the effects of the planned trade liberalisation and relations between the European Union and Morocco, that so much affect the city of Ceuta. This petition would also be extendible to the situation in Melilla."
"To sum up, we should like to see management of quotas as an instrument of social cohesion in a declining region."
"Mr President, the Liberal Group fully endorses Mr Valdivielso's report, and I compliment him on it. The Commission's proposal for a new tariff quota for certain fish species merits support, but more desirable still, in all honesty, is a doubling of the quota for sea bass and sea bream, as the rapporteur proposes."
"Ceuta is greatly affected by the European Union's new Euro-Mediterranean policy."
"The gradual creation of a free trade area with neighbouring Morocco will, as we all know and as Mr Valdivielso has already said, totally remove Ceuta's trade advantages."
"In order to strengthen local aquaculture and for reasons connected with diversification of the economy it is thus desirable that we should create this quota."
"Aquaculture in Ceuta has great potential."
"This tariff quota may boost Ceuta's economy but will have very little effect on aquaculture in the Union."
"So anyone who urges caution on environmental grounds should be very careful and bear in mind that this quota means only 0.18 % of the Community market's absorption capacity, in other words it is well short of the 2-10 % of capacity."
"Furthermore, demand for sea bass and sea bream is rising in the Union and a doubling of the quota, as I have indicated, would thus be a good thing from that point of view as well."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to thank Mr Valdivielso de Cué for his excellent report on quotas for certain fishery products originating in Ceuta."
"As you know, Ceuta is in an extremely complex situation."
"It is situated on the periphery of the European Union but it suffers from many additional problems."
"There is also the other geographical problem, the fact that it is situated on the African continent."
"Other questions have created a difficult situation."
"Ceuta's economy depends heavily on the tertiary sector and this has used up much of its potential while it continues to need to expand its economy in order to deal with its social needs."
"If Ceuta's economy is to be maintained it needs a boost in terms of increased activity in the primary and secondary sectors, especially the primary one."
"Yet its geographical position presents the main obstacle to its development. An additional problem lies in the restricted territory of Ceuta and its soil and climatic features which make the development of farming impossible."
"The fishery sector of Ceuta suffers from the same problems as the rest of the sector in the Community, due to a lack of resources."
"The geographical situation again hinders marketing and this is all made worse by the nature and obsolescence of its fishing fleet."
"Despite all these problems, the conditions in Ceuta are such that the development of economic sectors outside the tertiary sector is prevented."
"This is due to the fact that products face the same cost of access to Community markets as Moroccan products. However wage costs and social security are far higher than those in Morocco."
"Moreover, Ceuta does not enjoy the preferential quota treatment granted to Morocco. Since Ceuta is not part of the customs union, products from the city face a much harsher quota regime than Moroccan products."
"Although this is adapted to the tertiarisation of the Ceutan economy, it prevents the development of activities based on other sectors."
"Here is a paradox: the European Union has funded a project whose products face serious marketing problems stemming from the customs regime of Ceuta."
"Marketing aquaculture products from Ceuta can only be carried out in the European Union and, unless the customs regime for these products is changed, Community aid and investment will be money down the drain."
"The proposal for a Council regulation has no other virtue than to strike a certain coherence between the Community's structural policy and certain paradoxes inherent in the Customs Union."
"However, there is a problem which lies in the fact that this is a static position and economic activity is not like that nor, by definition, can it be."
"This is all the more so when an activity is being started up."
"The rapporteur has found a worthy solution to this problem within the framework defined by the proposal for a Council regulation, increasing the quota for fresh or frozen sea bass and sea bream."
"This will give the Ceutan aquaculture industry a breath of fresh air and at least help to start up the activity and seek markets with better future prospects."
"But it must be taken into account that in the medium term this quota will have to be revised upwards."
"Finally I should like to repeat my thanks to Mr Valdivielso de Cué for his report."
"Mr President, Mr Valdivielso de Cué's report on the tariff quotas for certain fishery products originating in Ceuta very clearly describes the current economic situation in Ceuta and the prospects of developing its aquaculture."
"Ceuta is part of the national territory of Spain but not of the Community's customs territory."
"Protocol No 2 to the Act on the Accession of Spain and Portugal applies to trade between Ceuta and the Community."
"The purpose of this proposed regulation is to extend the provisions applicable in the preceding year and to expand them by adding further fish varieties."
"Let me give my position on the individual amendments. Amendment No 1: since Ceuta is not listed in the declaration on the outermost Community regions annexed to the Treaty on European Union, it cannot be regarded as such a region in this regulation."
"Amendment No 2: the Commission can accept this additional recital."
"Amendments Nos 3-5: the purpose of these amendments is to increase the newly proposed tariff quota for sea bream and sea bass from 100 tonnes to 200 tonnes."
"For if the Council did not adopt the regulation, that would mean that none of the proposed tariff quotas could be applied because the existing regulation has expired."
"On the impact-assessment report you request, I would ask Mr Monti to examine whether and in what form Parliament can be given information on this matter."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Mr President, I just wanted to say the following on Mr Valdivielso's report. We are facing a very serious problem in the Ceuta region because of developments in Gibraltar."
"That will lead to political tensions."
"Here the Valdivielso report raised a very important subject, namely aquaculture."
"Any who knows this region is aware that it is almost predestined for aquaculture."
"I just wanted to put the question whether joint aquaculture projects could not be carried out between Gibraltar, Ceuta and Melilla and also include Morocco, for then we could contribute towards the political detente of the present situation through a practical economic project."
"That is why I welcome this excellent report but hope that we will also take it further, for this is where a real start can be made, which might prove important in the future."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 21 June 1996."
"Urgent political matters"
"The next item is the statement by the Commission on urgent political matters relating to the meeting of the G7 states in Lyons."
"I call Mr Santer, President of the Commission."
"You mentioned that the first item on your agenda was combatting international terrorism."
"Can you tell us whether you are more optimistic now that the Europol Convention will be ratified during the Irish presidency? As you know, it is one of the main focuses of the Irish presidency."
"As drugs are part of the international terrorism network can you tell us what precisely you agreed at the G7 conference?"
"Also, may I use this opportunity to express my regret about the incident in Osnabrück which happened during this conference and on a more local level at the outrageous murder of Ms Veronica Guerin by people involved in the drugs trade."
"Mr President, in Lyon you expressed appreciation - at least as reported in the newspapers - of the Italian government's document on economic and financial policy for 1997-1999. In the days that followed there was controversy in Italy - I imagine your assistants provided you with a fat press file on the subject - because Commissioner Monti expressed a different opinion on that document."
"So I want to ask you one question: do you agree with the strategy set out in the Italian government's document on economic and financial policy, yes or no?"
"Mr President, in the run-up to the G7 summit the Council adopted a new action programme to support the Russian Federation."
"This programme was indeed discussed in the Commission but it was not notified to Parliament."
"I would very much like to know what the content of this action programme is, whether it is a new parallel programme to the TACIS programme, whether this programme played any part in the summit or whether it was merely intended as electoral support for the presidential elections currently being held in Russia."
"Florence European Council - activities of the Italian presidency"
"Mr President, President Prodi, Mr Foreign Minister, President Santer, now that each Member State has restated its position and the political aspect of the mad cow crisis has been settled, it is time for the IGC to concentrate its efforts on the real reason for its existence - adapting the European institutions to the challenges of the present and of the very near future."
"Should it not be a priority for the fifteen governments within the Union to hold fundamental discussions on the objectives to be adopted with regard to what form Europe should take in the third millennium?"
"What kind of society do we want?"
"And on what broad principles is that society to be based? And, once that has been redefined, what is the essential institutional organization that will implement these projects?"
"The responsibility of the national governments, which are too frequently inclined to blame the Union for their own lack of courage and lack of political determination to solve problems that are really theirs, must be denounced. The report on the financing of the Transeuropean networks, about which we have all been talking, and the creation of jobs that must flow from it is a sad example."
"It is not enough to do as the Heads of Government did in Florence and take formal note of the revised formula presented by President Santer. Is there a gleam of hope when the Commission finds that the majority of Member States are prepared to accept the broad outlines of that formula?"
"Be that as it may, and this is Parliament's virtually unanimous opinion, it is a matter of urgency that we should at last move forward to the operational decisions."
"It is not just courting popularity to remind the House that 17.5 million unemployed deserve something better than declarations of intent. The war in the former Yugoslavia and Europe's inability to play any part in it have left a lasting impression on Europe's citizens."
"It demonstrates its determination to see the establishment of institutions and procedures such as to provide the essential instruments for instituting a genuine foreign policy. My hope is that the Irish presidency, strengthened by the experience of the Italian presidency and with the support of the Commission, should clear the way, following a period of crisis, for an overdue relaunch of activity in Europe."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Foreign Minister, I believe it is right, at the end of the Italian presidency, to express a calm and considered judgement on these months of work. My judgement is broadly positive, because these months have been marked by a wealth of useful initiatives for the European Union, many of which were mentioned just now by Minister Dini."
"I want to make it clear that my judgement - positive, I repeat - is not affected by the fact that I belong to a movement, the Unitary Communists, which is part of the government led by Mr Prodi."
"But for the sake of clarity, I also believe that, as Italy prepares to vacate the presidency, there must be straight talking on the difficulties encountered, perhaps straighter than we have heard so far. It must be made clear what the Florence Summit was like."
"It was good, very good, in that it succeeded, at least for the moment, in resolving the crisis with the British government."
"It was good on arms reductions but bad, very bad, on the issue undermining each of the Member States more than any other: unemployment."
"On employment, honesty demands the admission that the summit was a failure. Why?"
"In my opinion, because instead of everyone concentrating their efforts - political and financial - on attacking this terrible scourge of lack of work, discussion always and exclusively revolves around how each country can get into a position, however high the social cost, to satisfy the parameters, timetable and compatibility of Maastricht."
"I am asking you not to do that and I also think it is wrong for certain European Commissioners to approach the economic problems of our country, Italy, as if Member States were made up of computers and machines instead of families, men and women. Just cut wages and pensions, and lo and behold, 3 per cent of public debt, as required by the treaties, is achieved."
"A Europe which only holds together for strong states and crumbles for the weaker ones. So why not insert another parameter for the single currency, a minimum level of unemployment, without which monetary union cannot take place."
"The rigid terms agreed at Maastricht can be revised by the Intergovernmental Conference."
"So my group - the Confederal Group of the European United Left - calls for the timetable and the establishment of the single currency to be linked to employment. These terms must be revisited or Europe cannot really be united!"
"Politically and economically united, and including all its Member States."
"If the Italian presidency can leave that message of openness and flexibility behind it, it will have done a really good job and it will have set ambitious and positive goals for the future of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Legislative and administrative simplification"
"Mr Wolf may speak for one minute to make a personal statement."
"President Santer reacted irritably to my question yesterday and accordingly congratulated himself on the fact that he was not descending to my level."
"A Member from one of the large groups asked me whether I would accept that as it stood."
"Surely no self-respecting Parliament can allow itself to be attacked in this way by an Executive!"
"That is why I want to explain my question yesterday and clarify some personal questions which President Santer brought up."
"Firstly, Mr Santer is an honourable man in his own choice of words."
"I had no intention of saying nor did I say anything that would cast any doubt about that."
"However, I must confess that I am somewhat concerned about one thing, namely that the political attitude displayed by President Santer yesterday in pretending that every failure and every defeat was a success could one day plunge our EU into a serious crisis of credibility."
"It fills me with consternation that the question about the Lyons summit and the way it was used for electoral purposes, which is an objective one - and not just for President Santer - was punished with authoritarian disparagement on the part of the Executive, for it makes me pessimistic about our parliamentary future if objective problems of this kind can no longer be addressed in graphic language."
"But I am not giving up hope that this was merely a slip-up and that in fact President Santer has a more highly developed sense of democracy than to regard himself as an authority who may at most be criticized in the roundabout language of sycophants."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I very much hope that you will realise that here I am addressing a common concern of this House."
"Mr President, following that last intervention, I would not want Parliament to associate itself with this remark, because it referred to respect for Parliament."
"Parliament is respected to the extent that Parliament itself respects the other institutions."
"The manner in which Mr Wolf addressed Mr Santer yesterday was not a mark of respect."
"Mr Herman, ladies and gentlemen, we are not going to open a debate on this question."
"Mr Wolf, in accordance with Rule 108 - personal statements - has made use of the legitimate right which the Rules of Procedure give him."
"What he said was addressed to the Commission."
"Any reference which might have been made to that institution has been explained by Mr Herman."
"We shall not therefore start a discussion on this question which has now been considered in accordance with the provisions of Rule 108 of our Rules of Procedure."
"Commercial transactions, capital markets and information networks"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0147/96 by Mrs Ewing, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the second report from the Commission relative to the implementation of the decision regarding the provision of Community interest subsidies on loans for small and medium-sized enterprises extended by the European Investment Bank under its temporary lending facility (the SME facility) (COM(95)0485 - C4-0594/95); -A4-0168/96 by Mr Harrison, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the communication from the Commission reporting on the feasibility of the creation of a European capital market for smaller entrepreneurially-managed growing companies (COM(95)0498 - C4-0486/95); -A4-0161/96 by Mr Harrison, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the Commission recommendation on payment periods in commercial transactions (C(95)1075 - C40198/95); -A4-0161/96 by Mr Hendrick, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the report from the Commission on the future operation of the information and cooperation networks in the framework of enterprise policy (COM(95)0435 - C4-0012/96)."
"Mr President, there are very pessimistic statements going round about the industrial prospects for the Union."
"A draft communication on European industrial competitiveness from the Commission paints a very gloomy picture."
"Our position is deteriorating every year compared with America and Japan."
"Many people have spoken about the 18 million unemployed and the 50 million on the breadline."
"Starting with that pessimistic note, we have a bright star on our European economic horizon, namely the potential of small and medium-sized enterprises to create jobs."
"I am privileged in being asked to make my report on the Commission report on what has been a very practical and successful step to help small businesses to create jobs."
"I am calling for more information than the Commission has given us."
"At the outset I want to say that I accept the one amendment tabled."
"It also recognizes the need for more information."
"The idea is quite a simple one."
"Compared with big businesses, small businesses are at a disadvantage when they seek access to funding."
"They often do not have the collateral."
"Yet, if they could just get the money on loan at reasonable terms they could create jobs for us."
"So here is the practical arrangement."
"The bankers acting as intermediaries may lend at 2 % less than the standard interest rate for a period of five years."
"The amount available is ECU 30, 000 multiplied by the number of jobs to be created."
"There is a very practical step."
"For my own part, I wonder whether the dissemination of information about this scheme is satisfactory."
"Banks are not being encouraged to advertise this."
"They say it might distort competition."
"European information centres, where they exist, do a good job but there are not enough."
"In an area such as mine there is one but as it is a very large area many people do not know about this."
"As an MEP representing a specific geographical area I try to disseminate information to bodies such as the Federation of Small Businesses."
"So, the scheme is in place but is not sufficiently publicized."
"However, one has to say that the Commission has reported considerable success."
"Some Member States, however, have not taken up the allocation."
"We have to find out from the Commission why this is."
"Why are some states not seizing on this and why do some have a greater success in job creation than others?"
"Why do some find that they can create a job with a smaller loan than others?"
"These are some of the extra bits of information I am sure we would find useful if the Commission can step up the considerable statistical work it already does."
"By July 1995, 95 % of the total resources were allocated so the Commission is reporting this as a considerable success."
"But we need to know more so that we can do a better job of getting the money where it could be best used."
"The Committee on Budgets suggests that there should be a more favourable attitude to small and medium-sized businesses in peripheral areas."
"Naturally, representing the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, I would agree with that."
"Every job there is of such vital importance to the whole survival of communities."
"I welcome the change in the attitude to what is meant by small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I welcome the division of the criteria into the very small (under 10 jobs), the small (10 to 50 jobs) and the medium (50 to 250 jobs)."
"I would like to think that the ELISE programme which I welcome very much should concentrate on the very small and the small."
"That is where the greatest number of jobs will be created."
"The Commission boasts that 42, 000 jobs have been created."
"We need to know more about where these are and in what sectors of economic activity."
"Perhaps the Commission could give us this extra information."
"Parliament welcomes this scheme being extended and expanded."
"Mr President, small businesses is big business for the European Union as we strive for growth recovery in jobs."
"Small capital markets are potentially big for us and for Europe's small but fastgrowing firms, the expansion of which depends on regular shots of fast capital at their most explosive stage of development."
"Get these SMEs on the travelator of success and we can really be seen to be helping to tackle the scourge of unemployment which still disfigures the EU in too many of its Member States."
"Help is at hand for these smaller entrepreneurially-managed growing companies in the form of Europe's small capital electronic stock markets like EASDAQ in Brussels, AIM in London, Neuer Markt in Frankfurt and Paris's Nouveau Marché."
"I should make it clear at this point that the earlier references to EASDAQ in my text should be replaced by the term pan-European small capital markets."
"All these new markets borrow ideas from the world's most successful small capital market, America's NASDAQ, its most famous listing being Microsoft itself."
"Not only is NASDAQ the forcing-house of American fast-track SMEs but it is also the home to European companies thirsty for capital."
"Ten per cent of new listings on NASDAQ are European and European finance institutions use NASDAQ to invest in new American companies to the tune of 20 % of turnover and in NASDAQ-listed Euro companies by 35 %."
"How crazy!"
"Why are we in Europe not providing home pitches for our domestic SMEs and finance institutions to come together and marry their finance and their entrepreneurial flair for Europe and Europeans' benefit."
"Well, now we are, and the Commission's report is a response to this fast-changing situation."
"The Commission and Parliament acknowledge the need to focus on the specialized area which in the American hothouse of NASDAQ has netted 16 % of all new jobs in the early nineties despite representing only a minuscule 0.04 % of all US company listings."
"Europe's focus then is on high-risk, high-return entrepreneurialmanaged growth companies with trans-national aspirations whose Jack-and-the-Beanstalk growth often implies early years of loss-making expansion, a fact which would disqualify them from a listing on Europe's more traditional markets."
"Parliament can strongly support the Commission's communication reporting on the feasibility of creating what are more Europe-wide capital markets, another distinctive feature of which would be the electronic screen-based nature of the marketplace."
"Such a development is the way of the future and threatens those existing market locations which remain flat-footed in their thinking and their response to a changing market scheme."
"But Parliament calls for caution to be mixed with enthusiasm."
"We believe that issues of liquidity, regulation and possible protectionism have to be addressed."
"We call upon Member States, for instance, to repeal restrictions on pension fund investments in securities listings or exchanges in other Member States and in unlisted securities."
"We are, after all, in a single market and we should make that single domestic market work for our own small businesses."
"But hand-in-hand with this liberalization should go the strict observance of prudential rules established by appropriate regulatory authorities."
"In addition, access to small capital markets should be facilitated."
"Entrance fees should not be prohibitive."
"Investors should not be discriminated against fiscally in terms of double taxation or capital gains tax because they choose to buy shares that are listed in a market located in another Member State."
"Insofar as we can, we should ensure that the duplication of markets does not take place such that we divide our effort to set up an alternative to America's NASDAQ."
"On present evidence we will avoid that problem."
"To interest big institutional investors we need the highest standards of regulation, perhaps a European Securities and Exchange Commission."
"The prospectus approval system must be streamlined by harmonization or by mutual recognition."
"Any panEuropean small company stock market should of course be complementary to the national official list but Member States should not frustrate the development of such markets by engaging in unfair competition practices, for example by withholding settlement facilities."
"Finally, I reiterate the point that the introduction of the Euro as our single currency will heighten the attractions of a small capital market for all Europe's fastgrowing hi-tech companies."
"Indeed, any such pan-European market will itself be an appropriate means of channelling European investment funds."
"I welcome the Commission's report."
"On late payments, recently in my home town of Chester, I was approached by a small firm which was suffering cash-flow problems as a result of a big firm paying late."
"Their problem was intensified, however, by the fact that their supplier in the chain of added-value business was a business in Sweden where payment times are short due to the far-sighted payment practices endemic to Scandinavia."
"My local firm was caught by the double whammy brought about by the single market: in hock to a larger firm happy to pay late but obligated to pay a Swedish firm used to being paid early."
"Two other firms in my constituency in Ellesmere Port and Crewe name the culprit late payers as the European Commission itself."
"Mention of my role as Parliament's rapporteur on this vexed subject prompted payment double quick but these are all too familiar stories in Europe today."
"It is small firms which are the revving engines of Europe's growth and recovery which too often have been the victims of slow payment at the hands of big business, local or central government or, indeed, the Commission itself."
"That some of our Member States do not take the matter seriously was sharply exemplified by the confession of UK Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine that he built his own big business empire on the backs of small businesses whose bills he habitually paid late before breakfast, before lunch and before supper."
"It is time to call it the Last Supper for those who deliberately flout proper business practice by paying their colleagues late."
"In any other parlance we would call these people cheats and they certainly swindle the small businesses which go to the wall after such daylight robbery."
"Late payment is, arguably, SMEs biggest problem."
"It is a worsening rather than improving situation."
"As the Commission's recommendation reveals, the outlook is bleak for those businesses which attempt to trade across borders."
"The variation across the EU markets for a bumpy playing field is such that the EU average of thirteen days delay after due date is exceeded by the UK's deplorable figure of twenty-three days and includes Sweden's admirable average of a mere seven days."
"How do we right this wrong?"
"How do we help SMEs regain monies which might otherwise be used profitably to invest in growing small businesses and producing jobs for Europe's jobless."
"Remember we are talking megabucks here."
"The UK-based Forum of Private Business calculates that the British SMEs are deprived of £20bn at any one moment in the business cycle through late payments."
"My answer - and I hope Parliament's too - will be a directive aimed at introducing a statutory right to interest for firms paid unwarrantably late."
"Such a system could encourage a virtuous circle where prompt payment becomes the norm not the exception."
"Existing Swedish legislation and the US Prompt Payment Act have each transformed the business culture."
"We must act here for all the European single market, perhaps targeting first all public institutions like governments and local authorities."
"The penalty of a statutory right to interest is where Europe can score right between the posts and bring succour and soccer to Europe's level playing-field for its SME entrepreneurs."
"I implore the Commission to bring forward a directive with this purpose in mind."
"In the meantime we will naturally support all the other worthy ideas set out in the Commission communication."
"It must be wise, for instance, to establish definitions regarding due date, to have common ideas on payment periods - perhaps 60 days - whilst leaving such decisions to the contracting parties, to encourage the development of a common format for invoices, to applaud the publication of appropriate credit information on persistent late payers, to harmonize legal provisions especially in respect of enforcement procedures, to supply concrete measures for training SMEs in credit management, something positive which was recorded in the latest Coopers and Lybrand report on British SMEs."
"All these carrots of encouragement are bland without the stick of a statutory right to interest."
"This is the linchpin in tackling trade's toughest task."
"As parliamentarians we must ensure that small businesses are given the true opportunity they should have by acting on late payments."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to support the Hendrick report on the future organization and operation of the information and cooperation networks."
"The incorporation of computerized communication networks in business is fundamental in an interconnected, open world such as we now live in."
"The business world cannot be left behind by a reality such as the information networks, Internet and the like, but it is a reality which must be regulated in order to prevent those networks from being used for spreading criminal material, diffusing pornography or defending terrorism and also in order to protect data of a personal nature and the private life of users."
"I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Telecommunications Council on approving the harmonized rules for protecting data of a personal nature."
"I regard it as a first step in seeking solutions at European level, the OECD level and on a world scale in this field."
"With regard to the Hendrick report on the other hand I must confess that I have my doubts about his view that these communication networks and so on can create employment in line with the Delors report."
"I think they are necessary and indispensable, but intrinsically there is nothing about them which creates employment, since the only thing they do is to adapt situations to present-day life and frequently jobs are unfortunately lost."
"I should like to consider the statement that there will be an automatic net creation of jobs, as was mentioned."
"There is no doubt that strengthening new technologies, processes and procedures creates employment, but unfortunately harsh reality confirms that frequently more jobs are lost than are created."
"On behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations I should particularly like to thank the rapporteur for agreeing to accept the new conclusions from our committee which he has incorporated in his work and for which I had the honour to draft the opinion."
"So I basically support the rapporteur's report and I should like to add certain details about the networks as regards third countries."
"It is obvious that virtually all countries observe the rules of the free-market economy and consequently immense markets are emerging in Asia, Central America, South America, Central and Eastern Europe and so on. A transnational basis consequently needs to be established for business relations."
"Such links, such networks serve to promote cooperation and must incorporate support for those bodies which have the most direct contact with the actual business world, such as chambers of commerce, trade guilds and the like."
"What are the main existing networks?"
"The Euro Info Centres, the Business Cooperation Networks, the Business Cooperation Centres and so on."
"What are the results? To put it briefly, they are all being pooled in order to develop these networks."
"However, the evaluation of the results varies greatly according to the network."
"Their effectiveness could be greatly improved and they should be brought closer to the business world."
"Distribution is not homogeneous as regards human resources. I am referring to the quality."
"There is a risk of developing variable-speed networks. Operation of the networks is not sufficiently decentralized and is too bureaucratic."
"To sum up, I should like to emphasize the importance of these networks."
"We note their disparity, we think it is important to consolidate them and we welcome the new phase which is dawning with the information offices."
"I therefore repeat my thanks to the Commission for the progress made along these lines."
"Mr President, the most serious problem faced today by Europe and European society is the very high level of unemployment that prevails, which threatens the fabric of social and economic life."
"Unfortunately, the European Union has not so far been able to develop a long-term and cohesive policy to promote employment, which would include among other things funding for infrastructure projects, networks, etc."
"There are proposals."
"There is the White Paper of President Delors and the recent Confidence Agreement by President Santer."
"What is lacking, is the political will to provide the necessary funding."
"The activity we are debating today on the opportunity of the Commission's report concerning the implementation of the decision on Community interest subsidies for loans by the European Investment Bank to small and medium enterprises, is a positive step by the European Union in the right direction, though its scope is limited compared with the overall problem."
"It relates to SMEs, which are the backbone of business activity in many Member States and which are the main sector in which new jobs can be created."
"The report describes the course so far of this loan facilitation and must be welcomed because it demonstrates that substantial progress has indeed been made, while the measure as such has worked relatively well."
"It is significant that 42, 000 new jobs have been created so far."
"Yet, a number of comments concerning the problem should be made:"
"First, so far as jobs are concerned, it is not clear where those jobs have been created and in which sectors; second, it is not clear how the aid has been distributed between large and small countries, and perhaps it would be appropriate for the Commission to examine ways of favouring outlying and peripheral regions; finally, I believe that the Commission ought to submit proposals to extend the programme, which has ben shown to be both useful and beneficial."
"Mr President, I rise to present my report to Parliament and to say that the exercise of compiling this report was extremely gratifying."
"I have been very interested in the work that the European Information Centres have been carrying out both in the UK and elsewhere around the European Union."
"As many of you will know, the enterprise policy for the European Union began approximately six years ago and these centres have been in operation for that period."
"Particularly at a time when the finances of the European Union are coming under great scrutiny for various reasons - fraud, mismanagement and waste - it is particularly important that we assess the benefits as well as the costs of these information centres and the services they provide to small business."
"I was particularly interested to visit one in my own region in the City of Liverpool which has been operating for quite some time and to see how it was helping business."
"The people at the centre were very keen to show me examples and case studies of businesses they had worked with and how people had benefited from their activities."
"I was particularly interested in how the networks function and the fact that we have this network across Europe."
"It is doing much to foster enterprise and trade across the European Union."
"I have recently come from a BBC TV interview where they asked me some very clear questions about what the benefits of these centres are to the Community."
"My report focuses on two particular areas."
"Firstly, as I have already said, it is clear that significant amounts of European Union funds go into these centres."
"Therefore, at a time when the finances of the Community are under scrutiny, it is important that we begin to quantify the value of the work they are doing."
"That means we need to measure the benefits of the centres as against the costs."
"As the Commission report itself points out, no significant amount of work has been done to assess the benefits."
"Some measure of customer or client satisfaction is obviously required to determine the benefits and then to weigh those against the costs."
"At the moment people in these centres feel they are doing a good job."
"They are fostering enterprise and promoting business but it is difficult to say how many businesses they are helping and how successful that help is."
"In some cases one centre may quickly find business across the European Union with another company in another country but then it may only come six months later because in many cases what is on offer is not necessarily the sort of services you would expect from a consultancy."
"It may be just that the centre has pointed a business in the right direction and it takes the business some time to link up with another company."
"For example, a company which sells bolts and wishes to sell in France needs to be matched up with a company in France that wants to buy bolts."
"It is this matching process which may only take hours but in some cases can take months."
"That is an area I am concerned about and in my report I have suggested that a review procedure takes place and a set of parameters is developed whereby the benefits to the small business can be measured as well."
"I have also suggested that, as we are moving towards an information society in the next century, the centres do as much as they can to benefit from the new technologies which are becoming available."
"At the moment the centres tend to pick up most of their inquiries through telephone calls and use fairly basic new technological methods such as electronic mail in order to pass messages around the Community and to match up companies."
"At the present time, where millions of pounds can change hands in a micro-second and with the sort of activities that go on the stock exchange and new methods of electronic commerce, it is clear that the matching of two companies - one which wants to buy and one which wants to sell - can be done quite automatically."
"I would like to see the centres begin to introduce these new techniques so that the enterprise policy for the European Union can move into the next century."
"With those comments, I ask Parliament to support my report."
"Mr President, today there are four reports on the agenda which have a bearing on the position of European small- and medium-sized enterprises in the internal market."
"Yesterday too in the debate about simplification of legislation the concept of SMEs occurred repeatedly."
"The position of small- and mediumscale businesses is a little like that of women."
"The target group is large and appealing and they are discussed at length, but very little is done."
"Take for example the squabbling about the budget for the European multiannual programmes for small-and medium-scale businesses."
"We are thinking of the ECU 180 million which the Commission needs in order to carry out its action programme properly."
"Let the Council realize that this is a minimum and if that amount is not produced, then as far as I am concerned the Council need never again mention employment plans and all the rest of it."
"A sphere in which the European Union has a clear responsibility, which it actually accepts, is the establishment of mechanisms for giving small- and medium-scale businesses access to risk-bearing capital."
"Mrs Ewing rightly remarks that the temporary lending facility of the European Investment Bank has been a success, but not in every country."
"Parliament increased this budget heading for 1996 to ECU 50 million."
"I applaud the latest Commission proposal for providing credit guarantees for investments of small- and mediumscale businesses through which the SMEs get better access to financing, the so-called ELISE programme, particularly because it is specifically addressed to the really smaller businesses."
"I see it as a continuation of the growth and environment budget heading which I had to defend almost with my life in this Parliament in 1995 and 1996."
"I hope that will be a success so that the ELISE programme may also be a success."
"It is unusually accessible and very unbureaucratic, so it should deserve genuine success."
"Secondly my Group is glad that something is being done with the establishment of the EASDAQ, the European exchange for high-growth innovative companies with trans-frontier ambitions."
"From the forthcoming European observatory for SMEs it will appear that this is the group of firms which will generate the most employment and from their manner of working we can perhaps learn a lot about solving the employment problem."
"But what is important is that the Commission is investigating how many European undertakings meet the conditions laid down, how many European firms actually qualify for joining the EASDAQ which are now quoted on the NASDAQ in the United States."
"How many of those firms are actually planning to come over to the EASDAQ?"
"This would enable us to estimate the credibility and liquidity of this future pan-European exchange."
"It will have to be attractive for investors to invest their money and for firms to put their shares on this exchange."
"The European Association of Securities Dealers would perhaps be the appropriate body to recommend this market to investors."
"One European measure to improve the liquidity of the market might consist in the abolition of national restrictions with regard to investment of pension funds in stocks and shares."
"The recent pronouncements of Commissioner Monti about summoning a number of Member States, namely Italy and Denmark, before the European Court because of a restrictive policy for those pension funds give hope for the future."
"It goes without saying that there must be clarity with regard to the relationship between the future EASDAQ and the existing national and regional exchanges in connection with undesirable overlapping and competition."
"These small- and medium-scale businesses which have to act as a driving force for employment deserve real support at the moment from both Parliament and the Commission, and not last, in drawing up the budget in the near future, from the Council."
"Now is the moment of truth."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it was the European Council in Copenhagen which, in 1993, instituted the SME mechanism, providing for the appropriation by the EIB of one thousand million ECU for schemes designed to increase the competitiveness of small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"In 1994, the Ecofin Council held that, in certain circumstances, the loans granted could be the subject of interest-rate subsidies financed from the Community budget."
"Only those loans made within the framework of the EIB's SME mechanism are eligible, and the subsidies - granted for a period of five years - are fixed at 2 %."
"In other words, a loan granted at a rate of 8.5 % per annum, for example, costs the borrower only 6.5 % per annum, the difference being paid from the Union's budget."
"For some time now it has been apparent that some Member States were committing only a small proportion of the funds appropriated to them. It is clear that these delays in the appropriation of resources are prejudicial to potential borrowers in the Member States."
"Consequently, we support the rapporteur when he invites the Commission and the EIB to examine why these delays are occurring."
"Similarly, it is noteworthy that some Member States are publishing much higher job creation forecasts than others, and again that some Member States are, it seems, able to create jobs with infinitely smaller loans than the others."
"Mrs Ewing's report is approved by our group as a whole, though we would enter certain reservations."
"I should remind you that the original mechanism was intended to promote investment to create jobs, not to subsidise the creation of jobs."
"Consequently, it would be dubious under these conditions to create a mechanical link between the total subsidy - ECU 30, 000 per job created - and the number of jobs created, without taking into account the type of investment made or the quality and durability of the jobs created, even if we favour endeavouring to ensure that the Community scheme produces the best effect on employment."
"Any comparison between enterprises or between States thus appears somewhat random."
"Similarly, we consider that it is not a matter for the States to assess what is the most effective vector for promoting and organizing this type of mechanism."
"Furthermore, Article 10 appears to us to be unfounded in that its effective functioning does not presuppose the creation of a joint committee which would prove to be an ad hoc supervisory body."
"Finally, ladies and gentlemen, our group will support the report by Mr Hendrick and Mr Harrison."
"Our group particularly values the call in Mr Harrison's report for the creation of a pan-European capital market on which high-growth entrepreneurial companies could make contact with private and institutional investors at minimum transaction costs and quotation fees but with the assurance of absolute transparency and security."
"However, this initiative will be conclusive only if the obstacles relating to liquidity, regulation and the risks of protectionism are attended to."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is certainly important because it reconsiders specific and very relevant questions to try to give due attention to entrepreneurial activity which is of paramount importance in creating employment - and which forms the basis of the European Union's business activity - such as the small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"And it deals with questions genuinely concerning the real problems experienced by the SMEs, as is the case with the loans at below market rate interest - the loans provided by the European Investment Bank - or again the subject of security and the periods for recovery of payment for the services supplied by the small- and medium-sized businesses, which sometimes face excessive pressure from the great conglomerates, both commercial and managerial."
"Of course these are questions of fundamental importance affecting the most important social problem raised by the European Union, namely that of employment, and let us remember once again that it is precisely the small- and medium-scale businesses which, at times of crisis or recession or simply of economic stagnation like the present, create the most jobs."
"So in this debate there are a number of features which we must emphasize and I should like to say how anxious I am for this debate to come first to the ears of the small- and medium-sized enterprises so that they may know that the European institutions and the European Parliament do concern themselves with the specific problems affecting them and so that they have the best access to these facilities provided by the European institutions."
"Mr President, regarding the future economic structure small enterprises are no doubt of great interest."
"But at the same time we should not have a too idealistic and optimistic view of their ability to create new jobs."
"Firstly small companies are of divergent types. Subcontractors are very different from companies operating in the consumer goods market."
"Small companies in different lines of business also have different opportunities."
"Secondly, a great number of small companies are established, but a fair number also go under."
"Many companies have a limited life, which also decreases the effectiveness of subsidies of a general character."
"Although the purpose of subsidies and lower interest rates is good, it is questionable whether they are effective when there is a general economic depression."
"Sweden's experience of reduced social costs for example is that they are practically worthless."
"A current survey of small companies in Sweden shows that most companies blame a weak market as the source of their difficulties."
"And this is evidently the conclusion to be drawn, that ultimately macroeconomic policy is the decisive factor as regards small companies contribution to job creation."
"The current deflationary policy in Europe restricts opportunities for small companies."
"Thank you, Mr President. Mrs Peijs, I would like to compliment you on the energetic manner in which you always raise the question of the SMEs and put forward your arguments, many of which I agree with."
"I am very glad to see how energetically you keep doing so, in our committee and here in Parliament."
"The Council should not only take that to heart, that is one aspect, but should also take a closer look at the problems of the SMEs in Europe."
"For small and medium-sized enterprises and the policy vis à vis these enterprises represent the policy for the basis of employment in Europe."
"Basically, in terms of support measures the SMEs still come off worst in comparison with large firms, with shortterm industrial projects, especially in rural areas."
"Now one could say that these are the usual arguments put forward by parliamentarians, who always want more and more and are never satisfied."
"That is not the case."
"I regard the ELISE programme as a very good project."
"And it will bear fruit."
"My request to the Commission and the Council, and especially to the Council, is that they draw up a more consistent and well thought-out general plan for the SMEs."
"To be paid too late for work already done, especially outside Europe, spells the end for small and medium-sized firms, which is why my group endorses and supports a directive on payment periods, as referred to in Mr Harrison's report."
"We also support Mr Hendrick's proposal, which Mrs Hautala will be discussing in a moment."
"Mr President, small- and medium-scale businesses should be pleased about the enormous interest of the authorities, at both national and European levels in recent years."
"Small- and mediumscale businesses seem to be the European politicians' pet child."
"Let us hope that with everything we do not cuddle small- and medium-scale businesses to death."
"There is a real danger of that."
"So with measures for encouraging SMEs the accent must be placed on lightening administrative burdens and simpler legislation."
"That works much more effectively than any system of subsidies, because in practice it seems that financial encouragement of small businesses costs a great deal of effort on the part of both the authority providing the subsidy and the firm receiving it."
"What does the Commissioner think of the suggestion of concentrating subsidies for supporting SMEs on test projects established by the bodies providing services perhaps in collaboration with educational institutions?"
"With regard to Mrs Ewing's report about interest subsidies I notice that relatively few firms with fewer than 250 employees are included."
"That is due particularly to the short period for application."
"It is worth recommending that local and national employers' organizations should be involved in the information process."
"The Euro Info Centres would then have to collaborate closely with that kind of organization."
"Then I come to the European capital market for rapid-growth firms."
"I understand that such an institution gives a positive spur to promising firms, but I have one fundamental question: is it the authorities' job to set up such an exchange?"
"Definitely not, in my opinion."
"The authorities ought simply to remove obstructions and create the necessary legislative preconditions for such an institution."
"Finally the problem of the late payments in the European Union."
"How do we solve that?"
"With a recommendation or a directive?"
"Paragraph 6 of the motion for a resolution calls for a directive."
"The arguments for that are too slight."
"A directive looks very nice for the SMEs but how will that help an employer?"
"If others have to pay on time, he will have to as well."
"That will just be robbing Peter to pay Paul."
"The rapporteur's argument does not hold water."
"There will not be nearly so much capital freed as he maintains for investments and employment."
"The risk that a customer will not pay remains the same."
"So employers would be better served by a course in how to assess a customer's credit-worthiness."
"It would also be a good thing if small firms were allowed to deliver their VAT return quarterly or were allowed a longer time for returns."
"More far-reaching proposals would quickly amount to an encroachment on freedom to contract."
"I say in advance that I shall not blame the Member States if they say they cannot do much with the Commission's recommendation."
"Mr President, SMEs are becoming increasingly important as a means of boosting the economy and reducing the high unemployment figures."
"That makes it all the more pleasing that, if the report draws the right conclusions, the grant of interest subsidies has done more than expected to create new jobs in European SMEs."
"It is to be welcomed that the definition of the size of SMEs has been reviewed in this context and the dimensions are to be revised downwards in order to take account of the real situation of European enterprise structures."
"And efficient information and cooperation networks can give small SMEs in particular the necessary market access so that they do not to lag behind in terms of efficiency and can participate in the innovative developments."
"Even though I am in favour of privatization on principle, we must ensure that the proffered information services are simple and affordable for the SMEs."
"Finally, we must also pay attention to the balanced distribution of the horizontal information and cooperation networks to preclude from the outset any risk of distortions of competition in this area too."
"Mr President, I think that, as has already been said, we owe hearty congratulations to the Commission because this initiative means an important series of measures which help to find a solution to the excessively long payment periods in commercial transactions and which provide security for their recovery."
"And of course I should like to congratulate Mr Harrison for his splendid report."
"Up to a point the recommendation - which is not binding according to Article 189 of the EC Treaty - diverges from Parliament's resolution on the Commission's communication on the implementation of an integrated programme, but all the same it must be accepted seeing that this instrument is intended as a first stage in regulating payment periods, with a view to creating a reference framework."
"A single solution is impossible."
"Different solutions will have to be applied."
"What is happening is that the report on the recommendation has the great advantage of bringing solutions to a specific subject. At international level it is important to stress that it would be necessary to begin extending to the commercial field the Rome Convention on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations and also to carry out a study of the situation of those who, in spite of the 1968 Brussels Convention on Jurisdiction, have difficulties in obtaining enforcement."
"As I said before, the problem of payment periods has no single legal solution and the law cannot be regarded as the only option."
"Any rules governing payment periods will moreover have to take into account aspects of tax policy - particularly those relating to SMEs, banking policy, cross-border transfers, industrial policy, business training and business management techniques."
"Mr President, in supporting today's proposals in favour of small business I want to bring to this Chamber the clear experience of small business in my own constituency."
"I speak as an honorary member of the South Essex Chamber of Commerce having close contacts and met in recent weeks with the Thurrock Industrial Association and the Basildon Business Association and just last Friday participated with representatives of over one hundred local companies at the launch of Business Link Essex."
"All these organizations are committed to nurturing small and medium-sized companies."
"The question is what can the European Union do to help us."
"Firstly, I should like to give the strongest support to action to halt the scourge of late payments which threaten so many of our small businesses."
"I would highlight a small printing company in Tilbury in Thurrock, S & S Printing, which finds by and large that it is working for other companies which are larger and more secure."
"Yet non-payment of invoices presents a real problem to their manager, David Stear."
"He puts it plainly when he says that when these companies who are in debt to him pay their salaries they are doing so with his money."
"In another arena that would be called fraud and it is shameful that the UK has the worst record of late payments in Europe at a dismal average of 23 days."
"That is why our initiative to end this scourge of late payments is absolutely right."
"Secondly, I wish to support the continuation of our European programme for intra-subsidy loans to small companies but to call for clear improvements in the way that these loans are administered."
"Eleven small companies have benefited or become eligible to benefit from South Essex since 1994."
"Too many of them have told me of the difficulties associated with this scheme."
"Let me make it clear that bank loans are absolutely crucial to this sector of business and European support with minimum bureaucracy and targeted at job creation is a very effective way of offering support."
"Precision Components in Benfleet, a small engineering company, started by the owner's father from a garage and still present on the same site were enabled to invest in new equipment for the first time in four years."
"Before the recession in the 1980s they invested in new capital every year and our help has returned them to the path of growth and new competitiveness."
"Just this week Thames Estuary Plastics of Rayleigh has had its interest subsidy from Europe confirmed to support twelve new jobs as part of a £470, 000 project."
"In addition, we will enthusiastically try to implement the new loan guarantee scheme, ELISE, in my area."
"However, Terry Pearce from Precision Components remains sceptical about Europe's involvement."
"While Thames Estuary Plastics have had to wait nearly two years for confirmation of their support, another company, Camtac of South Woodham Ferrers, have waited so long that their success in the meantime means they now no longer have need for the loan."
"A success story for them but hardly for Europe!"
"Another company, Beaver 84 Ltd, of Basildon was not even told by its intermediary that its application for a financial lease was even on the list for a European subsidy."
"Europe's role was hidden from them."
"The solution to all of this is to ensure that sufficient funds are given to meet the demands and to avoid lengthy delays on the waiting lists."
"In Britain as a whole 700 companies have been helped but 650 more applied and were eligible."
"Intermediaries should be much clearer about the role of European support and all Member States should operate a reserve list system to help eligible companies who were not first in the queue."
"Finally, on the European information centres, we receive no service in Essex."
"There is a huge gap to the north of London, in Essex, Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire."
"Essex has 66, 000 overseas and UK businesses providing 590, 000 jobs."
"Commissioner Oreja's answer to my parliamentary question on 13 June when he said that services are provided from Norwich or should be sublet from Norwich is wholly unacceptable."
"Let the Essex County Council Library Service be a European information centre."
"No new money is needed."
"We simply want the title so that we can get access to the information, to the publications and to the network of other centres."
"It is not working at the moment in Essex."
"Look at our case once again."
"Mr President, I am glad that before dealing with the multiannual programme for SMEs we can devote a whole morning to these dossiers."
"Since Edinburgh it has been the custom for every European Council to sing the praises of the small- and medium-scale businesses."
"Again and again the part they play in economic growth and in the creation of employment is painted in glowing colours - as happened in Florence too."
"The fundamental political significance of this must naturally not be underestimated, but let us not forget that a policy needs specific action if it is to be of any use."
"To improve the SME climate effectively and to make all the solemn declarations credible, measures are needed."
"In the organization for independent employers and SMEs for which I worked for years it was our slogan that SMEs are not just pocket-sized big business."
"They have their own characteristics and need a specific policy."
"This morning's dossiers are an apt illustration of that."
"The small-scale and frequently the family nature of these businesses means that they have to settle funding problems in a special way."
"Their small scale moreover prevents them from taking in experts in all fields, so that there is a danger of chronic lack of information."
"Finally small businesses find late payers more than a nuisance."
"The Community initiative for granting interest subsidies on loans was modest but welcome."
"At that time I was anxious to reduce the target group to undertakings with fewer than 250 employees."
"The Commission did not want to support my amendment but did promise to steer the bulk of the resources to that sector."
"I am glad to note today that that promise has been kept."
"I also support the rapporteur, Mrs Ewing, to the full when she asks for priority attention to those of less than 50 employees."
"I hope ELISE will give our new loan guarantee system a push in the right direction."
"The SME capital market is another instrument for financing."
"The EASDAQ may perhaps start in September and will finally provide a solution within and not outside Europe for the rapid-growth advanced high-technology SMEs."
"The Euro Info Centres and the Cooperation Networks are more necessary than ever."
"The rapporteur, Mr Hendrick, is right to emphasize that service to the SMEs must be the criterion."
"We shall certainly talk about this again in debating the multiannual programme."
"Finally there is the Harrison report about terms of payment."
"Late payments are not infrequently the cause of one or a series of bankruptcies."
"They are an evil which SMEs relatively often have to reckon with. The lack of knowledge and expert advice and an incomplete internal organization certainly have something to do with this, but also the lack of a position of power in negotiations serves the SMEs ill."
"The question is whether we can put this right with a directive."
"Personally I have doubted this for a long time and have always advocated harmonization of procedural law, the introduction of simple judicial procedures and encouragement of extrajudicial arbitration procedures."
"I still think this is needed, but I admit that many discussions with employers have also eventually convinced me of the need for a directive - a directive with rules of imperative law but also, as regards terms of payment themselves, rules of dispositive law."
"Mr President, you will certainly allow me to tell the rapporteur that I found his willingness to cooperate exemplary."
"As a result we have been able to arrive at a report which has the full approval of my Group."
"I would have been glad to hear from the Commission exactly what it plans to do now about late payments."
"Is a proposal for a directive already being prepared, or are there other plans?"
"Mr President, our group has come out in favour of the position sustained by the rapporteur this morning on small and medium-sized enterprises."
"We could not do otherwise, because anyone with a broad vision of Community economic growth cannot dismiss the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"But if they are to grow they must be given the necessary tools, on the one hand legislative, laws geared to the needs of the market, and on the other hand financial. I do not think anyone doubts that the development of the European economic fabric over the next few years will above all depend on small and medium-sized enterprises rather than large ones, so greater attention must be paid to that sector, with appropriate support."
"In this context we can only applaud the new multi-annual plan for 1997-2000 recently drawn up by Commissioner Papoutsis and DG XXIII with special attention to the necessary financial instruments, which we will shortly deal with in this Chamber."
"The fragmentation of the Community capital market constitutes a problem for all growing firms. Too often when companies turn to other countries and to other sources, we do not do our job very well."
"So it is vital to strengthen the European capital market where firms can get directly in touch with private and institutional investors, with steadily falling brokerage charges."
"We are convinced that a phenomenon of late commercial payment exists and that it is a great burden, especially for micro-businesses which survive on respect for payment terms."
"That is less true of medium-sized and larger companies."
"In that sector payment conditions are only one of the contractual terms governing relations between client and supplier."
"So it would be absurd to seek to regulate one of the normal conditions of relations between businesses by law. The recommendation relating to medium-sized firms is more than sufficient, while legislation is desirable for micro-businesses."
"One final point I would like to mention here is the distinction that should be made between the various economic sectors of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"We believe three sectors deserve particular attention because of their innate potential for development, employment and investment. I refer in particular to crafts, tourism, commerce and distribution."
"These three sectors have the greatest resources and the greatest direct contact with the consumer, which is the real objective of the daily work of millions of entrepreneurs, however small or large, facing a market we are duty-bound to expand and improve."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the importance of smalland medium-scale businesses is once again highlighted with the discussion of these four reports today."
"An important subject which is raised here is the establishment of a European capital market for small-scale growth businesses."
"It is high time for a pan-European capital market to become operational - the EASDAQ as a match for the American NASDAQ."
"This will perhaps become a reality at the end of September."
"We are always talking about the creation of sustainable employment."
"One of the very measures which can really lead to permanent jobs more than all manner of employment programmes is the encouragement of growth undertakings."
"An earlier American study confirms this."
"The businesses quoted on NASDAQ, it is true, constitute only 0.4 % of all American businesses, but they created 16 %, or 300 000, of the total of jobs created between 1990 and June 1994, whilst with the 500 biggest businesses in the United States 850 000 jobs were lost."
"Except in one or two Member States venture capital is insufficiently encouraged and treated as the Cinderella."
"Pensions, which can play an important part or may be an important source of risk capital, have to put up with restrictions or high taxes."
"The European Federation of Pension Funds recently submitted a report to the Commission with a recommendation which would yield an astronomical amount of reserves towards the year 2020."
"The report supports the idea that greater mobility for investments of pension funds might play a part both within a country itself and between one country and another."
"The Commission must make the necessary effort along with the Member States so that free movement of capital does not remain a dead letter here and so that obstacles such as double taxation, amongst other things, might be overcome."
"Mr President, it is known that both development itself, and the promotion of employment rely largely on the existence and activity of small and medium enterprises, and more particularly, small enterprises."
"It should be stressed, however, that SMEs and in particular the smaller among them face very acute problems due to the intensified competition brought about by the internal market, the internationalization of production, and the coordinated action of major international capital."
"The result is that thousands of companies are approaching extinction, with the loss of tens of thousands of jobs."
"From that standpoint, the European Union's measures so far on behalf of SMEs cannot be regarded as satisfactory."
"They are fragmentary and purely administrative, and they try to present the alibi of protection, when the European Union's more general policy is stifling such companies and contributing to their extinction."
"That is the background against which we judge the implementation of the programme 'Facilities for small and medium enterprises' ."
"Subsidies should be directed towards companies that are really unable to cope with the burden entailed by recourse to foreign capital."
"Small and medium enterprises employing fewer that ten people, which account for 92 % of SMEs in the European Union, should be treated favourably."
"Consequently, we consider that the limit of 500 employees mentioned in the decision is entirely unacceptable."
"In essence, it is a means of providing yet more help to large companies."
"The reduction of that limit to 250 and the classification of SMEs suggested by Commissioner Papoutsis are along the right lines, but not enough."
"Granted the essential coverage of the initial distribution of one billion, we call upon the Commission to extend the programme by approving new appropriations, and to adopt special support measures for very small companies, in other words those employing fewer than 10 people."
"Mr President, I would like to express a few thoughts on the views put forward in Mrs Ewing's report."
"I agree with Mrs Ewing that we should consider going even further in directing interest subsidies to the very small companies, and in this respect the ELISE programme occupies a key position."
"Another aspect which I would like discussed is that when public funds are used to support companies, we really need to know in detail whether our good intentions are achieved with this support."
"In this respect the Green Group has tabled an amendment to Mrs Ewing's report, which emphasizes that the Commission should look into those sectors of business where the support system has succeeded in creating more jobs."
"In actual fact I would like to ask the Commissioner whether she thinks that we have an adequate picture of the effects of the support on unemployment."
"Interest subsidies are in themselves an excellent instrument."
"They are flexible and perhaps provide an opportunity to provide support to a greater variety of companies than would be achieved with direct support."
"In connection with this I would like to bring up a slightly difficult, sensitive matter, that we should also encourage investigations into how support to companies may distort competition and hinder the activities of healthier companies."
"I would be interested in hearing whether the Commissioner has given any thought to this matter, and if the Commission has possibly looked into whether support to companies does distort competition."
"I know that in some business circles there is a desire to cut back on direct support and perhaps give companies support from the community for example in the form of tax reliefs."
"Mr President, late payment is the scourge of businesses the length and breadth of the single market."
"It is an especial problem for our 17 million small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I welcome the Commission's initiative in the area of late payment but my welcome can only be qualified."
"The recommendation is acceptable only so far as it goes."
"Europe's SMEs and SMEs in towns like Dudley, Halesowen, Stourbridge, Smethwick and Wolverhampton in my constituency need more."
"In the early 1970s my father set up his own small business."
"One of his first major contracts was to erect a security fence around a cold storage company premises."
"He had to borrow money from the bank to buy his materials."
"The cold storage company, an internationally renowned business, delayed its payment."
"This delay took my father's young business to the verge of collapse and I can well remember the anxiety this financial crisis caused in our family home."
"We need to change the business culture regarding late payments but I would say to the Commissioner that I do not believe this can be achieved with a recommendation which is essentially a wish list for best practice observance."
"This is a carrot approach without the stick."
"A directive introducing the automatic statutory right to interest on late payments of outstanding commercial debt would be that stick."
"The need for such a statutory right of interest was the conclusion of an EMAC hearing in April 1995."
"All the small businesses that spoke at this hearing spoke persuasively of the need for a statutory right."
"Mr Sam McCrone from Scott Young Research of Brierley Hill and Mr Ian Brough, chief executive of Dudley Chamber of Commerce and Industry gave the hearing the benefit of their experience of late payments as it affected their locality."
"Mr McCrone, in particular, made the point that this was a single market issue."
"Small and medium-sized businesses such as his were experiencing real late payment delays in other parts of the European single market such as France."
"I believe we may be back here in two or three years' time talking about the failure of the recommendation to deliver what we want."
"We should have that directive and have it now."
"We can save ourselves the trouble of waiting for two or three years and actually deliver for our SMEs not just in my part of the industrial West Midlands but throughout the whole of the single market."
"Mr President, today we have four documents from the Commission on the agenda; a communication, two reports and a recommendation."
"The texts usually contain plenty of sensible comments."
"Unfortunately these documents do not always lead to firm actions."
"The four separate reports from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy are very good."
"They indicate an understanding of the conditions of small and medium-sized companies."
"I would like to mention one report in particular. Mr Harrison's report on payment periods in commercial transactions, which should have been issued as a binding document from the Commission."
"Instead it is unfortunately only a recommendation, which means that it does not receive the attention required to promote effectively shorter payment periods and consequently lead to less strain on cash flow for European companies."
"Sweden's experiences of legal regulations currently in force on the recovery of payments for the benefit of commercial companies are good."
"What I dislike about the Commission's recommendation and the final report is the interference with freedom of contract."
"In my opinion there is no need for statutory payment conditions."
"Access to capital is essential for a growing company, both through better cash flow and the opportunity of generating its own capital without high taxation and through the possibility of accessing venture capital."
"The latter particularly concerns fast growing companies in the high-technology sector."
"This was dealt with in Mr Harrison's second report."
"I agree that European companies must be given the same conditions as their American counterparts, and it would be excellent if a working capital market could be established as part of this process, otherwise we run the risk of the good ideas being exploited elsewhere."
"I hope that the Commission will take the initiative for the legal conditions required to establish a European capital market."
"National regulations and restrictions on the movement of capital will have to be abolished in order to create an effective capital market."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteurs on these reports."
"They are very helpful contributions to the very important debate we are having about small businesses."
"As we know, the latter are so important in the generation of wealth and employment in our Union."
"The schemes which have been put in place by the European Investment Bank have been extremely good."
"Certainly in my country the way these have been operated through some of the commercial banks have been very helpful to small companies."
"I would like to see the European Investment Bank investigating a little more closely how they are actually put into operation."
"I have had complaints from businesses in my constituency of commercial banks requiring the businesses to move their accounts to those banks before money can be paid out under the schemes."
"If that is the case it is a deplorable situation and it would be good to see it investigated."
"The work that is being done on capital markets is most important."
"The biggest problem that small businesses face across the Union is access to capital."
"But perhaps the most important and most immediate of all these reports is that on late payments of debt."
"In my country we know that the total trade debt owed to private business is now of the order of £46bn, that the total overdue debt owed to private business is now of the order of £20bn. These figures are ones which are clearly not helping small businesses and these reports can only be helpful in achieving a satisfactory solution."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I myself run several SMEs in France, and it is in that capacity that I offer these comments on the reports before us today."
"I have never resorted to an EIC to obtain information."
"In my country, the prefectures, general and regional councils, chambers of commerce, professional associations and other bodies deluge us with information."
"For me, therefore, going to the European level would be gilding the lily."
"As regards the delays in payment, which are now as long as six months, you are attacking the consequences and not the cause: the general economic crisis."
"These payments would be made much more quickly if the economy were in good health, and the economic policy which you impose on the Member States is not conducive to growth."
"Charging interest in default, which is actually obligatory in France, is rarely respected for fear of losing a customer."
"The really good idea contained in this report is the idea of paying VAT when invoices are actually settled."
"This is a commonsense measure attractive to all heads of businesses."
"The creation of a second European market, in the sense in which you mean it, is of interest only to a few enterprises in a very specific sector."
"I should be content with a flexibilization of the second French market to make it more accessible to small private shareholders and businesses."
"Savings exist, but they are not invested in the economy for lack of suitable structures."
"Finally, as far as credits are concerned, the EIB mechanism seems to me to be the prototype of restrictive aid to employment, which becomes the focal point of enterprises' financial arrangements and very often brings about their downfall."
"Abandonment of EMU, cheaper credit and persuading the banks to stop regarding loans to SMEs as a risk they are no longer willing to take - those are the things that would help us."
"Finally, as I see it, the main problems of the SMEs are as follows: cost of credit, the nervousness of the banks, administrative constraints, taxation, excessive social burdens - and none of these problems, I fear, will be solved by your Europe."
"Mr President, before I became a Member of the European Parliament I was for some fifteen years a member of a local authority in the United Kingdom and for ten of those years as deputy chairman I was responsible for an organization called the Staffordshire Development Association, the main objective of which was to encourage and foster the growth of small businesses."
"In this organization in Staffordshire we had over 200 members ranging from large companies such as Wedgwood and Steelite which are well-known - when you drink your coffee in this Parliament it is from crockery made in my constituency by Steelite - to micro companies."
"I really want to address my remarks on the two reports before us today to the question of those micro companies."
"These are the companies consisting of between roughly 5 and 15 employees."
"When I was deputy chairman of the Staffordshire Development Association two key problems emerged in dealing with small businesses."
"One was the access to capital markets."
"In her report Mrs Ewing highlighted the problems - despite some changes - which small businesses face in that area."
"The work of the EIB is highly commendable but two points should be taken on board."
"The sums available of ECU 1bn are too small given the number of micro companies in the European Union."
"We need to increase that sum steadily over a period of years."
"The second point which is very important is that there ought to be a target or targeted fund for the micro companies in particular."
"Those companies which have a small number of employees find it most difficult to access resources to expand their businesses."
"If we go back to the Delors White Paper, as Mr Harrison has commented, we see that the engine of growth is going to be the micro companies."
"These are going to be the organizations which are going to grow."
"We have to focus on them."
"Also, we have to study the lack of takeup in some Member States' economies."
"Another point is the late payment argument."
"There have been many wonderful contributions from this Chamber."
"We need a statutory right to interest."
"For too long now we have been pussyfooting around."
"It is local authorities and large organization, quangos and national governments which are by and large responsible for a very high proportion of that."
"If we do not have a statutory right to interest, if we do not bring forward legislation on this, we are going to sell short our small companies in the European Union."
"The figures on late payment which Mr Harrison gives in his report pale into insignificance compared with debt payments in Staffordshire which take much longer and which are driving small businesses into the ground."
"Let us have a Commission proposal and statutory right to interest right across the European Union to encourage and help small businesses."
"Mr President, I welcome these reports today and their recommendations."
"I particularly welcome the proposal for a statutory right to interest on late payments."
"I hope it will improve confidence and the functioning of the single European market and eliminate unfair payment practices."
"It would be ideal if companies were to take their responsibilities seriously in terms of prompt payment but we know that is not the case and therefore minimum legislation is necessary to improve the business culture and ensure fair and good practice."
"Companies need to understand that late payment is not good credit management."
"How often have we said in this House that the growth of SMEs is the key to fighting unemployment in the EU and indeed in our regional policy programmes we have strengthened our support for SMEs in recognition of this potential."
"It would be a travesty if, as a result of late payments, we were to undo all that good work."
"It is a fact that many small firms struggle because of late payments."
"Their cash flow dries up."
"Innovation and enterprise is halted because funds cannot be released due to supporting late payment."
"It is time for action."
"Governments, public institutions and the Commission should lead the way by example."
"They can institute a policy of prompt payment without the need for EU legislation."
"Recently the British Government White Paper: Competitiveness - Helping Business to Win said that small firms pay a vital role in the economy."
"They are flexible and responsive to change."
"They stimulate, and are a major source of, job creation."
"Yet I am sure you will agree with me that it is scandalous and shocking that the Economic Secretary to the Treasury in the UK and the spokesperson for small businesses, Angela Knight MP, an MP in my own Euro-constituency, said that the Treasury's late payment on 25 % of its bills is not exactly the crime it has been portrayed as."
"It is a crime if, as a result of late payments, small firms go to the wall."
"They collapse and people lose jobs and our social security bill increases."
"I welcome this directive."
"I welcome the chance to improve the survival chances and financial prospects of UK small companies and also to contribute to the overall competitiveness of the EU in boosting job creation."
"I also hope that it will force the UK Treasury and Miss Knight, as Economic Secretary, to pay their bills on time."
"Mr President, we have advanced a great deal since a few years ago, when very little notice was taken of small and medium-sized firms, even in the European Parliament. I am pleased about this."
"But today we are in a delicate, difficult stage."
"There are two questions that I want to put to you, Commissioner Papoutsis. First, the Florence Summit, which was not positive on the issue of employment or therefore on small and medium-sized firms, threatens to weaken the policy on small and medium-sized enterprises as well as the funding for the third programme."
"How are we going to react?"
"The second question is about the way small and medium-sized enterprises are being strangled by delays in payment by larger firms and also by public authorities."
"The recommendation is a first step which I myself asked for many years ago, but if it does not bear fruit, if the Member States do not apply it, we will have to move quickly to a directive. That is the political point."
"So, I propose a grand meeting of the European Parliament and Commission with representatives of the small business community to address this problem. Either the recommendation is applied or we will have to move to another, more binding, instrument."
"That is my proposal, Commissioner."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the European Parliament for organizing this joint debate at a very appropriate time."
"As you know, all the European Councils from 1993 onwards have stressed the importance of small and medium enterprises for Europe's economy."
"The Florence Summit Conference stressed the importance of the European Confidence Agreement on Employment, as Mr Speciale stressed a few minutes ago when he called upon the national, regional and local authorities and the social partners and Community bodies to take action to promote development and the creation of jobs within the scope of an integrated approach."
"SMEs are now called upon to play a protagonistic role in that effort."
"However, Mr President, let me at once answer Mr Speciale's first question."
"Following the Florence Conference, it is now in the hands of the other institutional bodies, mainly the European Parliament during the debate on the budget for 1997, but also those of the Council on Budgets, to demonstrate whether we really intend to abide by our political commitments and, of course, adopt the decisions that must be taken in relation to the financial consequences of those political commitments."
"All these years, the European Parliament with its resolutions has stressed the essential role of SMEs in economic development and employment, but also the problems faced by European companies. I would like, Mr President, to congratulate the rapporteurs on the four excellent reports they prepared and presented today."
"On these important issues, we will have other opportunities for debates in the future, with the report which Mrs Thyssen is working on concerning the third multi-annual programme on behalf of SMEs."
"Today, however, let me comment on the reports one by one, in sequence:"
"As for the serious matter of funding, dealt with by the report prepared by Mrs Ewing, I would like to remind you that finance facilities for SMEs, amounting to one billion ECU of subsidised loans, were absorbed by the end of 1995. However, a significant fraction of the demand, representing over 400 million ECU, was not satisfied."
"On the basis of information collected, the sums committed for specific companies show that the target of creating 33, 300 jobs was exceeded, granted that so far over 45, 000 jobs have been created."
"95 % of the subsidised loans, within the scope of the facility for SMEs, were granted to companies employing fewer than 250 people."
"The actual disbursements are accelerating."
"In some countries, indeed, jobs have been created with lower loan levels than in other countries."
"This is because the need for capital is not the same in all industries and all over the Union."
"The Commission and the European Investment Bank are looking at ways of assessing the structural nature of the jobs created thanks to this programme of facilities for SMEs."
"This will certainly be a very difficult procedure. Yet, it is a fact that though facilities for SMEs have existed throughout the lifetime of the Union, they have been used more in some countries than in others."
"A probable explanation of this phenomenon is that the structural funds sometimes offer SMEs more attractive conditions than those offered by this facility for SMEs."
"Secondly, the structure and specialization of the banking system in each country also plays an important part in channelling state support to companies."
"Thirdly, the number and type of intermediate financial credit agencies in each country plays an important part in attracting companies to take advantage of this initiative."
"I want to assure you that the Commission will consider some of the points raised by the European Parliament in Mrs Ewing's report at greater length."
"After the completion of the third report on financial facilities for SMEs, we will be in a position to examine those issues."
"At any rate, I can say that the financial facility for SMEs has been a clear success."
"And this is due largely to the fact that the Commission and the EIB made it their common aim to create a simple and effective mechanism, and to ensure its prompt implementation."
"We are now very carefully examining the results of implementing those measures, and particularly the distribution of the jobs created."
"The EIB is carrying out a similar study."
"And in answer to the questions by Mrs Ewing, Mr Kranidiotis, and Mrs Hautala, from the facts and figures available to us today from just one country, France, the subsidized loans went mainly to arts and crafts enterprises employing up to 10 people."
"The Commission will include the European Parliament's proposal in its preparation of the mechanism for the ELIS initiative, an initiative which also supports the creation of jobs by small companies via a loan guarantee system."
"I would like once more to thank you for your support in this new initiative, which is so important for the support of SMEs."
"Now, as for the report prepared by Mr Harrison on the Commission's statements concerning the feasibility of creating a European capital market for developing SMEs, as you know, and thanks to the Commission's activity in that sector, various European capital markets are being designed or are already in operation for dynamic SMEs with an international orientation."
"It is worth mentioning two more particular initiatives, because they are European in the scale of their implementation."
"In other words, the planned EASDAQ market, which is to begin its transactions next September, and the EURO-NM initiative, a joint venture between the parallel financial markets of three countries: France, Belgium and Germany."
"The Commission welcomes such initiatives, granted that they contribute towards improving the access of SMEs to funding by venture capital."
"I would like, however, simply to point out that all these new markets are initiatives in the private sector, initiatives that operate within the scope of competition between the capital markets, which were created by the directive on investment services."
"The role played by the Commission was to stimulate interest in the creation of new capital markets for SMEs."
"Now that the interest of the private sector has been awakened, it is up to the markets itself to determine the future of those capital markets."
"However, the access of small companies to finance by venture capital and to the capital markets in general is a steady feature of the Commission's agenda."
"It is one of the basic funding problems faced by many SMEs, and is at the same time one of the ingredients in the third multi-annual programme on behalf of SMEs."
"The Commission is now working on yet another statement, a statement which will examine the perspectives of these new markets, but at the same time the obstacles that may impede their successful operation."
"I believe that we will be in a position to present this second statement to you in the near future."
"Now, as for Mr Harrison's second report, the Commission is fully aware of the importance of dealing with the problem of late payments, both to improve the funding environment of SMEs, and to encourage cross-border exchanges between SMEs in the context of the Single Market."
"As you know, in 1995 the Commission made a recommendation to the Member States concerning that issue."
"The recommendation persuaded the Member States to adopt necessary measures to reduce the problems created by late payments."
"On behalf of the Commission, I want to express my great satisfaction at the fact that the Harrison report supports the initiatives undertaken by the Commission in that area."
"Now, as for the European Parliament's request to consider converting the recommendation to a proposed Council Directive, the Commission is quite willing to carry out an intermediate assessment of the consequences of the recommendation at the beginning of 1997."
"Personally, however, I believe that we should go ahead with the formulation of a proposed directive - and I agree with Mr Murphy - but before we go on to formulate a directive, I would prefer to have more facts and figures about the result of implementing the recommendation in the Member States."
"Of course, the issue of automatic imposition of interest for delayed payments is something that we should really look at very seriously during our thinking."
"And in answer to that point in the second question by Mr Speciale, in other words, concerning the possibility of a major conference between the European Parliament, delegates from the national Parliaments, and representatives of the SME agencies, personally I would like to say that I think this is a marvellous idea."
"I believe that the European Parliament could very well undertake that initiative, and I personally commit myself to support that effort in every way I can on behalf of the European Commission."
"Besides, the services of Directorate-General XXIII will be at your disposal to assist in the organization of so large a conference."
"We will have to move ahead, however, and we must do so as carefully as possible."
"I believe that within the scope of the new multi-annual programme on behalf of SMEs, there is great potential to speed up the assessment procedure envisaged by the 1995 recommendation concerning delayed payments."
"The need for further action will be justified on the basis of that detailed reconsideration of the matter."
"Besides, the Commission will support further action that could be undertaken by various bodies to improve payment practices in industry. And it will also continue to encourage the Member States to adopt the necessary measures to reduced problems created by late payments."
"Finally, as for the report prepared by Mr Hendrick, I am particularly glad that this report agrees with the Commission's approach and proposals concerning the future operation of information networks and the development of company relations."
"And I am particularly glad that the Hendrick report recognises that companies throughout the European Union are clearly taking advantage of those networks."
"Those networks are intended to provide better access to information, and at the same time, they provide an adequate mechanism for the creation of entrepreneurial company relations."
"The Commission's report on the future operation of the information networks and on cooperation, was drawn up after widespread consultations with the members of the network."
"The Commission's report expresses the common desire to continue and extend the activities undertaken in connection with functional aims."
"The basic problems analysed in that report have been included in the proposals for the third multi-annual programme on behalf of SMEs, which is now being examined by the European Parliament."
"I would like to remind you that the approach chosen by the Commission, in other words to encourage the creation of a favourable environment for the development of companies in the European Union, has a clearly decentralizing effect."
"Intermediate agencies established throughout Europe, undertook to put the objectives for the integration of the internal market into practice."
"And they are trying to do this by improving the flow of information in relation to the risks and opportunities which that creates, and of course, by enhancing cooperation between companies and regions."
"This decentralized approach has the advantage that it has promoted a strategic European dimension in the context of the activities of companies at local, regional, and national level."
"And it has also contributed to the effective preparation of companies in the context of the internationalization of the economies."
"The Commission echoes the views expressed by the rapporteur, who recommends continuation of the operation of the European information centres by local agencies and, of course, recommends the development of cooperation with newer networks."
"The Commission also shares the view that the activities of networks should be determined by demand, and should be inspired by the spirit of providing services. We also agree with the finding that the improvement of knowledge about the quality aspects and the satisfaction of customers are important aspects of the information and cooperation services."
"Now, as for the network of Euro-infocentres, the Commission's report has opened the way for the proposal made by the European Council of Madrid concerning the renewal of the mandate of the European information centres, to operate as first-contact centres, particularly granted the evident need for greater transparency of the numerous Community services that they offer."
"That is also the reason why the Commission proposes to maintain the two existing cooperation networks, in other words BC-NET and BRA, bearing in mind the need expressed by SMEs to search for partners in various ways depending on the degree of complexity of the cooperation sought."
"In addition, the use of the latest technology by the networks for their more effective operation has also been taken into account in the new multi-annual programme on behalf of SMEs."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have tried to present briefly the basic aspects of the critical issues dealt with by the four reports."
"I believe that the sector of SMEs will play a definitive part in the development of Europe's economy over the next few years."
"Today's debate has been very useful."
"It has contributed a great deal to our thinking about how to deal with the more particular problems and how to promote European company policy still further."
"In conclusion, I would like once more to thank the four rapporteurs and the European Parliament for its support throughout all these years in the preparation and implementation of the policies and programmes on behalf of SMEs, and to assure you that the Commission will take serious note of all your comments and proposals."
"Thank you very much, Mr Papoutsis."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be held at 11 a.m."
"Votes"
"Madam President, our group voted against the Schulz report because for internal policy reasons Mr Schulz has created an extremely contradictory report through his amendments, by which he has tried to belittle the Bavarian security organs, which represent an important front in the fight against organized crime."
"That is why we could not vote for that report and we call on Mr Schulz to follow the example of the US Congress and the US Senate, where both large parties have jointly initiated a major programme to combat nuclear smuggling, which they designated as the number one threat to the United States, on the basis of a report by the Institute for Strategic Studies which drew on hundreds of cases of nuclear crimes in the territory of the former Soviet Union."
"The United States has managed to get the major democratic forces to cooperate."
"Mr Schulz has missed that opportunity and I hope we will soon follow the example of the United States in this area."
"I should first like to pay a sincere tribute to our colleague and friend Mr Schulz, for the documentary quality of his report and the intense effort that must have gone into it."
"We are rightly focusing on this traffic in nuclear materials, a quite recent development."
"This form of contraband presents dangers on a completely different scale to those we have encountered in other fields."
"Thus, we need to reconsider the nuclear problem in terms of its origin: the production of energy."
"We must not totally call into question nuclear energy for peaceful purposes."
"On the other hand, we need to be even more vigilant in view of the potential dangers it involves."
"Next, we need to take due account of the handling of nuclear wastes and to suppress this unhealthy trade that I have denounced."
"It is absolutely essential to monitor all flows of fissile materials and other nuclear wastes."
"Euratom could very well take charge of this if the Commission and Council were to take a decision to that effect."
"The territory of the European Union cannot remain a permanent nuclear danger zone."
"With this aim in mind, we must take into account the many questions posed by the countries of central and eastern Europe, which today are juggling dangerously with the civil and military nuclear arsenal which they have acquired."
"Our duty is clearly to establish the means for combatting the distribution of these substances."
"These are areas in which there is a need for precise knowledge of the situation with this traffic and the risks being run."
"We need a strong political will to protect the public."
"I have no desire to find myself shortly a victim of those 'sorcerer's apprentices' whom I denounced a few months ago."
"Illegal trade in nuclear material and radioactive elements must of course be fought strongly."
"This trade is evil both for human beings and for the environment."
"Action must be taken to stop it."
"But we are being used to bring about the creation and extension of Europol and as a means of exerting pressure on Member States to ratify the Europol convention."
"We have therefore chosen to abstain from the final vote on the Schulz report."
"My understanding is that it is necessary to get to the root of this problem which is the production of radioactive elements leading to potential for trade in 'waste products' ."
"This problem is mentioned in paragraph 3 of the Schulz report, which is good."
"Therefore, I intent to vote no to Amendment No 22, which would remove this."
"Illegal trade in nuclear material is a problem not only for EU countries but an international problem."
"Therefore, we must take action internationally to resolve the problem. Of course the UN and Interpol should receive increased resources to be able to take action."
"Closer cooperation between all the countries involved is important, not just in the EU but internationally."
"Europol is not the appropriate organisation for this issue as Europol is not a global organisation."
"I am voting against paragraph 18 which requests that Member States should immediately bring about the creation and extension of Europol."
"The Danish social democrats in the European Parliament are voting in favour of the Schulz report on the illicit traffic in radioactive substances and nuclear materials."
"We are doing so because we agree with the rapporteur that it is absolutely essential to do something to prevent this illicit traffic."
"As the situation appears now, the actual problem is very small, but there is potentially a major problem just around the corner."
"If we do not treat the problem with the respect it deserves, it may come to be a threat to the environment, public health and both internal and international security."
"One of the most important ways of combatting illicit traffic is making the best possible use of the technology available to us."
"That is why, in this report, Parliament is calling on the Commission to assess the possibilities offered by modern technology."
"It is also vital for us to set up close monitoring and a comprehensive register of the trade in radioactive and nuclear materials, as a means of uncovering any illegal ramifications."
"Moreover, it is clear that we should keep a watchful eye on the countries of Eastern Europe, and also investigate whether these countries are complying with the rules on safety monitoring, and how security can be improved and extended."
"However, it is important to emphasize that even if the problem is potentially a major one, we should not make the very serious mistake of devising a much too complicated and comprehensive solution which simply adds to the problem instead of solving it: the solution must be appropriate to the problem."
"Even the tiniest amounts of plutonium are enough to poison the whole of mankind."
"For that reason alone we must prevent the production of plutonium."
"To do so we must put an end to the civil and military use of nuclear energy."
"But even if we abandon nuclear energy, that does not eliminate the existing plutonium."
"The civil and military stocks must be declared and placed under the control of Euratom and the IAEA."
"Under no circumstances may any more plutonium be carted around on our streets or in the air."
"The Munich plutonium scandal in particular raises a number of questions that should be clarified by a committee of inquiry. firstly: the Federal Government, the Bavarian State Government and the authorities told the public fairy-stories for electoral strategy reasons."
"They irresponsibly stirred up fears and put many people at serious risk, in an infringement of international law."
"Headed by the public prosecutor Helmut Meier-Staude, first they created the demand for plutonium, so that they could then make loud noises about a nuclear market and present themselves as anti-crime supermen."
"The astonished public is then faced with the question: who is more dangerous or a greater criminal, the Bavarian State Government or the traffickers in nuclear materials?"
"Second question: when did the Federal Government inform Euratom?"
"Two dates have been given."
"So: who is lying, the German Federal Government or Euratom?"
"The plutonium scandal raises a third question: the question of the relations between the secret service and the police."
"After the terrible experiences with the Gestapo under Nazi rule, people in the Federal German Republic drew strict distinctions between secret service and police."
"Particularly in Bavaria, these distinctions are becoming increasingly blurred."
"The Munich scandal showed where that leads: both agencies become unpredictable and uncontrollable."
"That provokes breaches of the law."
"My colleague Martin Schulz has taken up the questions I have discussed in his very good report."
"That is why we endorsed the report."
"European Council in Florence"
"Madam President, the European Council in Florence gave the impression of enormous confusion where the problems of employment are concerned."
"Yesterday, in the report given by the Italian presidency, we heard two expressions which are typical of European speeches today."
"First, that there is no miracle cure for unemployment; secondly, that the national level is the level best suited to combat unemployment."
"The cumulative effect of these two proposals, which incidently are partly contradictory, is hardly exhilarating."
"This sudden desire to respect powers of the Member States would be more convincing if one did not have the feeling that it was dictated mainly by impotence, and if the violation of subsidiarity had not become an everyday event - especially as represented by President Santer's Confidence Pact, despite all its manifest good intentions."
"In the field of international trade, especially, one may wonder whether the implicit purpose of this new presentation is not to dilute European responsibility by this sharing-out of functions."
"The Commission wanders the world negotiating free trade agreements in the supposed interests of mankind, while the Member States try to deal with the unemployment that is partly as a consequence of those agreements."
"Obviously, we are not in agreement with this share-out which seems a little too convenient for the Commission, which we feel should get it into its head that its primary task is to defend the States of Europe."
"Finally, the conclusions of the Florence Council relating to the IGC contain another proposition: a call for improved European coordination of national policies."
"This policy is based on the notion that improved European coordination would necessarily, everywhere and always, produce beneficial results."
"Unfortunately, one may wonder whether the bureaucratic coordination of ill-conceived policies like those of today may not be more likely to paralyse growth and employment, as seems to be proved, a contrario , by the experience of those countries that have remained outside the Union."
"This European Council was overshadowed by the so-called mad-cow crisis. The mad cows actually rescued the summit because it was possible to claim that it was a success just because the boycott threatened by one Member State or its prime minister was avoided, apparently firmly."
"But was public health truly safeguarded, unequivocally, on the basis of scientific criteria?"
"From this point of view the Council was not such a resounding success and the European Parliament's resolution does not raise this vital question."
"This Council was once again a 'summit' meant to define policies, take measures, sign pacts and which, following on from the indecisive positions taken at other Councils, was meant to fight rising unemployment and the deteriorating social situation."
"One boycott replaced another without being clearly denounced."
"Another Member State, another summit protagonist, impeded any clear affirmation of proposals, proposals of good intentions, together with any previous ones."
"Not even that."
"This too has not been properly dealt with in our resolution."
"This Council was a reaffirmation, intransigent for some and autistic for others, of one road towards 'European Construction' ."
"Not even sweetened with good intentions and better words. These major questions were left for Councils of lesser ministers."
"Accelerated liberalization of public services, especially telecommunications because there are information highways to earn profits and for circulating, competitiveness and wage restraint, but not offset with any consideration of moderating speculative transactions that withdraw capital from its job-creating function, a clear threat of diverting structural policies away from their objectives linked to the now forgotten economic and social cohesion."
"That is what is present in and absent from the summit 'conclusions' and the resolution says nothing about this."
"As far as foreign policy is concerned, once again 'sympathy' for Turkey without the necessary self-criticism for the steps already taken banking on the fact that minimum human rights would be observed when, on the contrary, the situation has deteriorated."
"On the other hand, as for Cuba, the firmness towards the unacceptable US legislation was tempered with unfounded not to say false assessments as to the responsibility for the rift in relations between the US and the European Union."
"For these reasons (and more) a Council unable to cover up social failures withe so-called successes over mad cows and EUROPOL and a resolution that once again skirts around the real issues as if they had been solved or would be solved once we reach El(euro)dorado ."
"Transitional period in the accession treaties"
"In our opinion the European Union will not prevent any Member State from going ahead with reforms on environmental protection even if other Member States feel that it infringes the four aspects of freedom of the internal market."
"There has been no evidence so far that the environmental guarantee exists in reality."
"In our opinion the environmental guarantee shall apply as soon as it is referred to by the national parliament of a Member State for a decision to be made."
"Mosiek-Urbahn report"
"We have voted for Mrs Mosiek-Urbahn's report."
"We agree to a large extent with the criticism of the Molitor Group's report which is presented in Mrs MosiekUrbahn's report."
"We feel that when talking about pan-European issues, especially social issues relating to the labour market and problems relating to the environment, minimum regulations are required also at Union level."
"This however does not prevent individual countries from proceeding on their own and introducing more stringent regulations."
"This requires for example that the current Article 100a(4) of the Treaty of Rome is made more stringent."
"But we are also critical of some aspects of the report of Mrs Mosiek-Urbahn, namely the proposal that by virtue of Article 171 Member States would be ordered to pay a penalty."
"The wording in clause 1.26 is in our opinion completely absurd."
"It reads: ' The European Union is currently conducting the greatest simplification campaign in modern economic history by endeavouring to replace 15 sets of rules and regulations with 1' ."
"It is beyond our comprehension how a parliament which would like to consider itself as serious can accept such wording."
"The Swedish environmental party, like the environmental parties in the other new Member States, were seriously concerned that joining the EU could lead to a situation where our existing standards on environmental, social and consumer protection, among others, would be lowered."
"Unfortunately developments so far seem to justify our misgivings, which has been proven for example by the fact that the Commission has not fulfilled its promises to increase the EU's environmental standards to the level of the standards in the new Member States during the transitional period agreed."
"This apart, I cannot support the conclusions of the so-called Molitor report, since they only involve the interests of big industries."
"It also seems clear that the Molitor Group's intention was in fact to use the deregulation of EU legislation as a model for similar measures at a national level."
"The intention was simply to break down what has been achieved for example within environmental protection in Europe, instead of progressing."
"Since I, as a member of the Swedish environmental party, generally speaking remain rather sceptical for reasons mentioned above to EU legislation in certain areas of importance to us, I would like to concentrate on clarifying my vote regarding the two amendments I have tabled."
"The first proposal is about the Molitor Group's view that economists are the only experts regarding decisions on legislation in society."
"Therefore we wanted to stress that there are other aspects than financial calculations of importance when decisions are taken on the need for legislation."
"The Green Group in the European Parliament has also expressed concern that clauses on minimum standards regarding environmental, consumer and social protection in the future are interpreted as optimum standards."
"For us it is therefore essential that a lowering of existing national standards is not imposed in the name of free competition in areas of vital importance to the environment and for the so-called ordinary citizen."
"It is equally important that the EU does not constitute an obstacle to further progress in these areas."
"Deregulation at EU level is of importance in order to reduce unnecessary regulations and bureaucracy."
"The report however only deals with the symptoms of the problem, since regulations at EU level are already a reality."
"The report should have examined which issues should be considered at various levels; local, regional, national and European EU level."
"A check list describing the issues to be considered and by whom they should be considered should have been drawn up."
"The report also concentrates on deregulation of trade and industry for the benefit of strengthening competition."
"Deregulation is important from a democratic point of view to simplify existing regulations for the individual citizen and to clarify at what level different decisions are taken."
"A 'subsidiary list' with issues which could be transferred back from the EU to national, regional and local level should have been drawn up."
"This report deals with an absolutely crucial issue, the importance of which for the further development of the internal market - and, in this context, for employment and economic growth in Europe - must not be underestimated."
"The report thus contains an excellent analysis and a critical assessment of the so-called Molitor Group's report on legislative and administrative simplification."
"On the whole, one must agree with the rapporteur and the committee in their criticism of the Molitor Group's report, since while the report does indeed contain a useful summary of the problems connected with extensive legislative or administrative regulation of the market, it unfortunately also tends to underestimate the adverse effects in terms of competition and/or consumer policy of arbitrary deregulation at European level."
"The rapporteur is thus entirely right to draw attention to the need for an analytical checklist to be compiled, making it possible to judge whether it is necessary to implement any new piece of Community legislation or whether new Community initiatives are required, and also to assess the consequences of repealing or amending legislation which exists already."
"In this context, it must be borne in mind that the implementation of common legislative provisions in the EU - where the introduction of such provisions is necessary in the first place - is in itself a considerable simplification of the rules for the benefit of our citizens and businesses, since fifteen different national sets of rules are thereby replaced with one."
"Mombaur report"
"Debates on energy have been fashionable in the European Parliament just recently."
"So far, they have been conducted more from a liberal, industrial and competitive standpoint than from an environmental one."
"This report by Mr Mombaur seems to be an essential one."
"Its subject is nothing less than the future of the planet and the satisfaction of ever increasing energy needs."
"All of us here know that the road we are currently following in order to meet those needs is a dead-end."
"Our sources of energy are far from inexhaustible, and in any case they cause pollution."
"While the former aspect is a matter of concern for future generations, we are already feeling the effects of the latter."
"Also, I would like to pay tribute to the clarity of the report and to the innovations it suggests, which are the result of deep analysis."
"The European Union really does have an interest in developing renewable energy technologies."
"Nature itself offers us the means of achieving this."
"It is up to us to be able to and willing to exploit these means."
"And it is up to us, too, to equip ourselves with the necessary resources."
"We need to convince the Council of the value of this research, and to take swift steps to promote new, healthy and efficient energy sources through tax incentives."
"It is necessary for the Union to set an example and increase its consumption of renewable energies."
"Admittedly, the initial investments are high; admittedly, just how high depends on how conveniently situated the sources of these energies are."
"But the stakes are equally high - the issue for us is to preserve our planet but also to enable everyone to produce energy sources to guarantee independence and development factors that are mutually complementary."
"The Union needs to integrate this necessity into its policy of development and cooperation."
"Today's investments will be tomorrow's economic, human and ecological benefits."
"Renewable energies exist, even in the northern European countries: solar energy, wind energy, hydraulic energy, biomass."
"Renewable energy techniques need to be developed on a voluntary basis: if, as this report demonstrates, the same appropriation from the European Union budget were to be made to the promotion of renewable energy sources as is made to the promotion of nuclear fusion, ECU 840 million in other words, they would soon reach a competitive standard."
"The objective is clear: we must make use of these energy sources, which are inexhaustible, non-polluting, capable of decentralized exploitation, well accepted by public opinion, not reliant on mega-installations like nuclear energy and offer great employment potential."
"The stimulus to master the various technical and economic problems can come from the European Union, but that is not to say that the Member States have no responsibilities of their own to discharge, especially if the target - as this report proposes - is that renewable energies should amount to 15 % of all primary energy by the year 2010."
"One essential condition has to be satisfied in order for that to be possible."
"In order to ensure the competitiveness of renewable energy technologies, it will be necessary to take into account the true costs of other technologies."
"In the case of nuclear energy, then, that would have to include security measures, investments and the enormous cost of treating nuclear wastes and decomissioned installations, not to mention the overall social cost of a high-risk technology that has never been completely mastered by man."
"I would like to express my complete agreement with the measures proposed by the rapporteur for the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, and to congratulate him on this important work."
"I have voted for the report which in principle I find satisfactory."
"Most of the EU funds for energy research are spent on fusion research within the so-called JET programme."
"This could be reduced or dropped completely."
"More resources are required for research and development of renewable energy sources."
"It is completely unacceptable to invest 400 million ecu on two nuclear reactors in the Ukraine, and this must be rejected."
"The Commission must quickly present proposals as to how carbon dioxide emissions are to be reduced."
"A recommendation for a carbon dioxide tax must be drafted."
"This is a commitment accepted by the EU and its Member States at the conference on the environment in Rio in 1992."
"The Euratom Treaty must be transformed into a treaty for investing in renewable energy resources."
"We have long been aware of the need for a consistent reorganization of energy consumption."
"Around the time of the oil price shock in the 1970s, the western industrialized countries recognized the need to step up research into the use of renewable energy."
"This was above all out of a concern for security of supplies, stemming from the realization that our energy needs could not be covered indefinitely by the use of fossil fuels."
"Since then, environment policy considerations have understandably come to play an equally important part in the debate - not least in view of the fact that the world's overall energy consumption is expected to increase dramatically within the next quarter of a century, as a result of the industrialization of many third world countries."
"Against this background, it is high time that the European Union implemented an action plan to promote renewable energy sources, taking special account of the particular conditions for using certain forms of renewable energy in the individual Member States: increased use of solar energy in the Mediterranean countries, for example, further use of wind power in the north-western Member States, and so on."
"This report from the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy contains an excellent analysis of the proposals from the Commission, amongst which those concerning measures to improve the competitiveness of renewable energy sources are of particular interest."
"The continually increasing demand for energy, combined with the shortage of conventional energy forms and the problems they create, make it essential to develop renewable sources of energy."
"For countries such as Greece, moreover, the issue is vitally important granted that the country's geographical and morphological structure enhances the importance of developing renewable energy sources such as wind energy or solar energy, as a means of meeting the energy demands of island and outlying regions."
"Reduction of the energy dependence of the Member States would contribute towards improving the publicsector economies by decreasing reliance on external energy sources, while it could also contribute substantially to regional and local development and to the growth of employment."
"In that context, the EU could contribute by devoting financial means at its disposal to the support of related programmes."
"However, we categorically oppose not only the liberalization of the energy sector more generally, but in particular the sector of alternative energy sources."
"Liberalization would have tragic consequences, granted that this is a branch of strategic importance."
"Any such development would threaten security of supply, even at the present level of energy availability, to the benefit of major capital which would make huge profits while threatening the viability of public agencies that would provide no more than the infrastructure, and also to the cost of the economy and consumers, who are entitled to cheap, adequate and environmentally friendly energy."
"In our opinion technological advances should not be sacrificed on the altar of profit."
"It must be made possible for everyone to benefit from them, and they should not become the means to increase the profits of some who exploit them to their own advantage."
"Fouque report"
"Our colleague Antoinette Fouque is presenting to us here a report following up the International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo in September 1994."
"In doing so, she is offering the European Parliament the opportunity to review the status of development and the condition of women in the world."
"First and foremost, I must thank her for her work and for the enthusiasm that inspires it."
"That Cairo conference, like many other international conferences, is often called into question, some people regarding it only as a mass of good intentions, soon forgotten."
"I believe, nevertheless, that they are creating increasing interest, as witness the Cairo conference, which is intended to enable the Union to express, once again, its principles with regard to development and women's rights."
"The Cairo conference reaffirmed the essential status of women in the quest for sustainable human development."
"Confronted with demographic growth and the consequences to which it leads, the conference clearly defined the role which women could take in controlling it, and the trump cards they hold."
"As our colleague recalls, birth control alone cannot solve the population problems facing the world, and more particularly the developing world."
"Early steps need to be taken to allow for the problems of aging, rural depopulation, international migration and, above all, the environment."
"Within this framework, the demographic problems associated with non-respect for women's rights have to be solved."
"Women must be able to become the protagonists of this renewal."
"Freedom of choice to have children, free access to health and education for all women, these are the best tools."
"Too many women in today's world are not 'full members' of the human race."
"Who can settle for that?"
"Who can accept it?"
"There is a need for a genuine development policy, integrating the objective of the valorization of women as the motive force of development."
"The Union has already entered into commitments along these lines, and it would be well for all the Member States to do the same, following the example of our German and Dutch friends."
"The financial commitments entered into must be respected, and the facilities must be granted to ensure that this aid is not wasted because of the sluggish administrative procedures that we know too well!"
"We must think in terms of new partnerships, and develop our cooperation both with third countries and with the NGOs."
"The subject is a crucial one."
"It is the guarantee of the future for one part of the world."
"At all levels, we have to commit ourselves to sharing in this new state of mind."
"Let us think again about development, let us think of ways of helping those men and women who are suffering."
"Technical assistance in itself is not enough - it must be backed up by consideration and concern for universal dignity, the specific feature of the human condition."
"I was pleased to note that the report really does attempt to contribute to a practical implementation of the results of the conference in Cairo regarding the EU's policy on development aid."
"Women, and hence children, in different parts of the world are in real need of direct, strong action."
"All the same the report leaves a bad taste in the mouth."
"As usual the European Union is quick to take a stand and set requirements for countries outside the Union."
"Poor developing countries are expected, with help from the EU, to manage things that some of the EU's own Member states do not manage."
"For example:"
"' Adequate' courses in sexual education at different school levels; -Encourage the use of condoms which are distributed free of charge; -Family planning to be integrated into co-operation programmes; -Introduce equal opportunities for women in politics/economics; -The right to free and legal abortion etc.Should our next objective perhaps be to implement the results of the international conferences on women within the European Union and the Union's co-operation countries?"
"It should also be mentioned that the existing, virtually unrestrained market liberalism of which the EU professes itself adherent does not favour women either within the EU or in the developing countries."
"Quite the reverse!"
"Despite the above I am voting for the report, since the purpose of promoting women's situation, is the essential issue after all."
"Olympic Games in Atlanta"
"The idea of the Olympic Games is a grand idea, the idea of bringing together men and women from all five continents to participate in a sporting competition based on the principles of brotherhood and fair play."
"But what happens to this fine idea under the influence of discrimination?"
"The European Parliament must reassert its essential commitment to equality between men and women, and fight against all forms of obscurantism, whatever and wherever they may be."
"Even more seriously - and here I echo the text of the motion for a resolution and the oral question - we cannot accept, I trust, a situation where the European Union finances or aids, by whatever route, all or some of those countries which prevent their women from going to compete in the Atlanta games."
"We cannot be the accomplices of this kind of segregation, which in our eyes represents a seriously retrograde step."
"I would venture to hope, then, that the Council and the Commission will quickly give us assurances on the points that have been mentioned and will officially adopt a position hostile to such methods."
"Our credibility is at state here."
"Ewing report"
"I have given my support to this report today because I am a keen supporter of small businesses, as we all should be if we are interested in the future of Europe's economy."
"Almost 100 % of our companies in Europe are officially classed as SMEs."
"Yet too often these key companies who employ two-thirds of all EU workers and generate two-thirds of our business turnover are forgotten by policymakers because they do not have the lobbying voice of industrial giants."
"All the more reason for the Commission to extend the affordable loan scheme for smaller companies which is a genuine EU success story - as far as it goes."
"When in the UK alone over ECU 200m has helped to create almost 12, 000 jobs since 1993 it is vital that we build on such success, given the hard economic times people are living through in my constituency and across Europe."
"Our people deserve any assistance we can provide to their businesses upon whose success we all depend."
"Harrison report (A4-0161/96)"
"I am glad to support this report by my British Labour Party colleague Mr Harrison as it aims to give businesses - and in practice that means small businesses - the protection they deserve from the unacceptable practice of too many larger companies who pay their bills late."
"This trend has caused real financial hardship to many of the honest and hardworking business people and employees of commercial areas such as my own constituency."
"That is why my own party is addressing this problem in Britain and why the Commission is looking at late payments at European level."
"However, the good intentions of the Commission will not be enough if as currently suggested compensation to creditors affected by late payments is a nonbinding Recommendation to Member States."
"Given that the Conservative President of the Board of Trade in Britain himself virtually boasted of his skill at paying creditors late during his time in business, I can think of one Member State at least whose government needs a directive if we want them to act to protect the honest and hardworking from what we in Britain call the 'spivs' ."
"That concludes voting time ."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament."
"(The sitting was closed at 12.55 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 4 July 1996."
"Statement by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, a year ago exactly, we heard the news of the fall of Srebrenica."
"The inhabitants of Srebrenica were trusting in the fact that in April 1993, as you will remember, their town had been declared a UN safe area."
"They were bitterly disappointed when the Serb forces, under the command of General Mladic, took the town in July 1995."
"In front of the United Nations soldiers, the Muslim men were then separated from their families and the women and children driven from the town."
"Since then, some 8000 people have been reported missing."
"They have probably been killed."
"It is now up to the investigations which are under way to establish the facts of the matter, amid the horrors of the mass graves."
"The massacre at Srebrenica is one of the most dreadful of the war in Bosnia - sadly, one among many others."
"The international community cannot rest until the facts of the massacre have been established and those guilty have received the punishment they deserve."
"We owe that to the victims of Srebrenica and their families. We owe it to justice, which the tribunal in The Hague is seeking to dispense."
"I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to join me in paying tribute to the victims of the massacre at Srebrenica by observing a minute's silence."
"(The House rose and observed one minute's silence)"
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"I occupy room 238 in IPE 2, from which I normally have the pleasure of observing the French countryside. However, I find that I now face a wall of concrete, about which the Quaestors appear to know nothing."
"Could you tell us whether all the other inhabitants of the second floor are to be subjected to this on a permanent basis, or would you recommend that we move to Brussels until we have a chance to have offices that again return us a view of the French countryside?"
"I have visited one of these offices myself, Mr Spencer, which as you say have practically been walled in."
"I think it is absolutely terrible."
"You ask if there are many offices in a similar position."
"Those on the first and second floors are affected, but the ones above do have a view."
"I think we need to investigate the matter, and I was intending to raise it at this evening's meeting of the Bureau."
"I cannot say any more than that at present, but I entirely share the feelings experienced by yourself and other Members in the same situation."
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"I just wish to say that I have had the same experience."
"Members of this House are kept in the dark and covered with manure like mushrooms, and it is about time it stopped!"
"I have no daylight in my office and it is an appalling insult!"
"I have just said what I think of the matter, and you have heard that I share the same feeling."
"We shall have to see what can be done."
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"I beg the indulgence of yourself and the House to ask you, Madam President, on behalf of this Parliament, to express our outrage at the capitulation by the British Government, the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the security forces in Northern Ireland in the face of Orange Order mob rule; also to express our outrage at the first bombing to take place in Northern Ireland in the last two years, which took place at the weekend."
"Fortunately, there were no fatalities."
"Furthermore, to express our outrage at the running down of a Catholic man by an RUC armoured vehicle during a peaceful protest in the city of Derry; to condemn the use of over 4, 000 plastic bullets by the Royal Ulster Constabulary against Catholic and nationalist people, as against 150 plastic bullets used by the RUC against the Orange Order when it flouted the rule of law; to express our outrage at the burning-out and the running-out of their homes of Catholic and nationalist families in Belfast and Derry whilst the security forces stood by; and call on all parties to get back to inclusive talks to ensure that we can restore not only the peace process but justice, equality and fair treatment for all citizens."
"It is an absolute disgrace the way that the RUC, the British army, the British Government and the Orange Order have decided that they are definitely going to make the six counties in the north-east of Ireland a Protestant State, an Orange State, for an Orange people, and forget about the human and civil rights of the nationalists and Catholics who are living there."
"I naturally note what you say, Mr Crowley."
"You will appreciate that we cannot start a debate now."
"As you know, this very serious situation will be examined in due course at this part-session."
"I would ask you please not to start a debate on the subject by means of a point of order."
"You will have ample opportunity to state your views, for example on Wednesday morning when the Irish presidency presents its programme."
"Madam President, I am not going to make this into a debate but since the question has been raised, I want you to confirm that it will be on the agenda and that we will have a statement from the presidency."
"Northern Ireland is demonstrably ungoverned and may be ungovernable under the present structures."
"The citizens of that state do not have equal rights."
"Yes indeed, Mrs Ahern, that is what I said."
"Order of business"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to stress that I am keeping to the agreement reached by the Conference of Presidents concerning the declarations to be made, and we in the Conference instructed a working party to try to produce a text on which a consensus can be reached."
"This is not exactly what has happened, but the objectives we are pursuing are still vitally important for this House, which has come under attack so often, particularly in recent times."
"I think it is absolutely crucial for the credibility of the House that we should reach a decision this week."
"As we see it, there is just one small problem left to clear up, which is that we need to define - and this is something the Bureau can do - exactly what constitutes a gift or benefit."
"I think the House can reach a consensus on this."
"Indeed, as we have seen in various Member States, including my own, it is easy to reach agreement on the principles governing declarations of assets, but far more difficult to put them into practice."
"We think the Bureau has an important role to play here in defining the text."
"It should also be possible to settle the issue of gifts and benefits very quickly - before the end of the year, in our opinion."
"In any event, I should like to confirm that we intend to stand by this agreement and that we are determined to reach a consensus."
"I think we should be able to adopt the text by a majority of more than 314 votes this week, on the understanding that the Bureau is to be instructed to produce a definition, which will be important when it comes to applying the agreement."
"This need not involve a delay, it is simply a precaution, and we really do feel that it is extremely important in the present circumstances for Parliament to reach a decision this week."
"I am taking a risk in proposing this, but I am convinced that we have to do everything we can to protect Parliament's credibility when it comes under attack."
"Various people in this House have been working hard for years to win greater power and influence for Parliament, and I think this has to go hand in hand with working to improve our image."
"That is why I think we have to decide to vote on the text this week."
"I would remind the House, if need be, that at this stage we are voting on the agenda."
"Let it be clear, therefore, that there is no question of opening a debate on the substance of the matter."
"Mr Martens has just explained why he wished this item to be reincluded on the agenda for this part-session."
"I have several requests to speak from group chairmen, and I think it is important for them to be able to state their views."
"As you know, the eyes of the media are upon us."
"We are dealing with a very sensitive issue."
"I shall therefore give the floor to Mr de Vries, who has asked to speak, then Mrs Green and Mr Puerta."
"Clearly, we are not opening a debate, but I think that before voting on whether or not to reinclude this item, it is essential for the group chairmen to express their views."
"Madam President, the House has spoken on behalf of the people of Europe in repeatedly calling for greater transparency in the operation of the European institutions, which are all too often seen as dark, secretive bodies, sometimes unfairly, but often also with a grain of truth."
"But if we want the Commission and the Council to be more transparent, we must also be prepared to make the workings of Parliament equally so, and an important element here is transparency in Members' financial interests."
"My group feels it is vital that we should vote on the Ford and Nordmann reports this week, and we support the Christian Democrats' proposal on the subject."
"But let me warn you: we are prepared to help the Christian Democrats obtain the majority they need to amend the Rules of Procedure, but not if it means sacrificing the principle that there is, and must remain, a ban on accepting gifts."
"There is absolutely no reason why this House should allow Members to accept gifts, and if we instruct the Bureau to draw up a definition of what constitutes a gift, it must take account of the spirit and the letter of the Rules of Procedure we adopt."
"What is banned is banned, and the only possible exceptions, as far as I am concerned, are bunches of flowers and cups of coffee."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, I should like to thank Mr Martens for reiterating his personal commitment to the agreement made by the group leaders to ensure that the Nordmann report passes through this House before the summer recess."
"I would also remind the House that agreement by the group leaders included an absolutely clear commitment that Members should refrain from receiving gifts, payments or benefits."
"It is important that the House understands that."
"It is important that the House understands the crucial nature of getting that agreement through this House if we are to demonstrate the transparency which Mr De Vries spoke about."
"My group will support putting the Nordmann report on the agenda as long as it is clear that, as far as we are concerned, that agreement holds."
"Last week it was not so clear as far as the Group of the European People's Party is concerned."
"Mr Martens has expressed his desire that it should hold."
"We will support him by putting our votes behind the clear commitment made by the group leaders earlier this year."
"Madam President, with the same degree of seriousness and commitment as the other group chairmen, I wish to express the concern of my group at the way in which the Nordmann report is coming before plenary."
"In our view, it is clear that the circumstances have not changed since last week."
"I would remind the House that the Conference of Presidents decided by a majority to withdraw the Nordmann report on Thursday afternoon. And it did so because the amendments that were to be presented raised serious problems regarding the gifts and benefits that Members would be able to receive."
"We did not agree beforehand, and we expressed our concern in the meetings of group chairmen or deputy chairmen that the formulas being used - whereby support in terms of staff or material would be permitted, though that support would have to be declared on the register and transparent - were very dangerous, notwithstanding the traditions of certain Member States in the regulation of this matter."
"Our opinion has not changed."
"We believe that this amendment - which some people now wish to interpret, and which leaves the distinction between gifts and privileges to the discretion of the Bureau - is extremely confused."
"I agree with the other group chairmen that there is a need to ensure complete transparency in the eyes of public opinion, that demagogy should not be permitted, and that the credibility of Parliament must not be undermined. And it is for precisely this reason that - in the same good faith as the other group chairmen, but on the basis of a different opinion and decision - we shall oppose the reinclusion of the Nordmann report on Tuesday's agenda, with a view to its possible adoption."
"Madam President, the Greens in Parliament are certainly in favour of debating the Nordmann report, provided that it is done with great frankness, such as we have already heard from Mr de Vries."
"Mr Martens came close, but he was still not entirely open."
"He said that he wanted to keep to the agreement reached in the Conference of Presidents, an agreement we thought was a minimalist approach, but which has now been thrown open by an amendment from the Christian Democrats."
"If the question is whether we agree that we should deal with this issue, then the answer is certainly yes, as far as the definition of gifts and so on is concerned, but it means that Mr Donnelly's amendment on behalf of the PPE Group which refers to gifts which are not likely to influence Members' views should be withdrawn, otherwise the situation will become as unclear as before."
"Madam President, I also wish to say that our group is in favour of the Nordmann report being debated during this part-session."
"Nevertheless, I should like to point out that we are only having to discuss the reinclusion of this report because the Conference of Presidents decided by a majority to remove it from the agenda, and that our group did not vote in favour of its removal - a decision which was adopted by a simple majority of the Conference of Presidents."
"The supposed conscience of the people of Europe is frequently invoked in this Chamber, as it was a short while ago."
"The fact is that the peoples of the various Member States expect their elected representatives, and especially those in the European Parliament, to adopt clear and transparent rules governing their own conduct."
"How can we fail to note the fear of a great many of our colleagues at the adoption of these simple rules, rules which concern the declaration of assets?"
"It is not a question - it should be emphasized - of referring to national legislations."
"The European Parliament is capable of adopting these rules."
"Certain colleagues do not wish their income to be transparent; they do not wish gifts to be prohibited."
"Our group is in favour of maximum transparency, since in order to be beyond reproach, elected representatives must adopt clear rules on these matters, which are very important in the eyes of public opinion."
"Madam President, the Union for Europe Group, like the Europe of Nations and PPE Groups, voted in the Conference of Presidents to maintain the Nordmann report on the agenda."
"We shall therefore remain consistent with that vote: we shall vote for the reinclusion of the report, because we too are in favour of complete transparency on this matter, whereas the amendment that was proposed introduced an element of doubt."
"We are thus in favour of transparency, without indulging in demagogy of any kind, and I therefore believe that it is right that the Bureau should exercise a kind of moral authority in deciding what should or should not be termed a 'gift' ."
"Furthermore, the solution proposed by Mr Martens does no more than make explicit what was implicit."
"Indeed, I recall that when we entrusted the task of mediator to Mr Cot, he himself proposed that it should be the Bureau which determines what constitutes a 'gift' and what does not."
"Consequently, our group has absolutely no hesitation - quite the opposite - in voting in favour of the reinclusion of the Nordmann report on the agenda."
"We hope that this report secures the 314 votes required and is adopted during the current part-session."
"Madam President, it goes without saying that our group is ready to debate and adopt the Nordmann report."
"However, in accordance with the procedural agreement reached by the group chairmen, we wish to vote on the compromise text without amendment."
"What has really confused matters is the amendment tabled by members of the PPE Group, in which the possibility of Members of Parliament receiving gifts is recognized."
"Let us hope that we have misunderstood it."
"In any event, whilst we are in favour of the Nordmann report being debated, we shall refuse to allow the fundamental nature of the report and its conclusions to be changed by such amendments, which ultimately recognize the possibility of Members receiving gifts - which is not what my group wishes at all."
"Matters must be made clear, and not complicated by last-minute amendments."
"Madam President, the rapporteur wishes his report to be reincluded on the agenda, not from personal vanity, but in the firm belief that postponing the debate on the report again would give the impression that the European Parliament is incapable of amending its Rules of Procedure to ensure the increased transparency that is essential."
"Consequently, I should like to indicate my personal readiness to work for a compromise."
"In the Rules Committee, we made progress towards a consensus."
"And we did so whilst remaining faithful to the guidelines drawn up by the working party set up for this purpose."
"The amendment, or compromise, referred to by Mr Martens implies either that new amendments will be tabled, or that a compromise formula will be proposed to the House in the form of an oral amendment at the time of the vote on Wednesday, if the report is replaced on the agenda."
"I believe that the correct procedure is to agree on a text which will secure an absolute majority of 314 votes."
"This implies that the text should conform to the spirit of the working party's conclusions: in other words, restoration of the ban on gifts and benefits, and provision for referral to the Bureau - if necessary - of the detailed points of implementation to which these rules may give rise."
"However, this provision for referral to the Bureau must not seem to negate immediately what has just been adopted."
"This, Madam President, is the spirit in which the rapporteur wishes to continue his work - with total readiness, I repeat, to reach a compromise, and recalling the words of France's most radical-socialist king: ' Paris is certainly worth a mass' ."
"(Parliament agreed to the request)"
"Madam President, I think that all Members will have read in their respective national presses the decision by the US administration to ban from American soil a Canadian company in application of the Helms-Burton Act reinforcing the embargo against Cuba."
"I think that this decision, apart from the protests which it has led to, could also affect large numbers of European companies. May I remind you that 45 % of trade with Cuba is carried out by European companies."
"I think that at various times we, in the European Parliament, have already demonstrated against the embargo on Cuba and all measures taken to enforce that embargo, both the Torricelli Act and the Helms-Burton Act. I think that once again we cannot stand by without reacting against this measure by the United States."
"Of course, the Council is meeting today, Monday, and is examining this situation and I would like to draw their attention to this novelty, as we might say. I therefore think that on behalf of my group it would be important to introduce a Council declaration on this matter."
"I know that our agenda for today's business is extremely overloaded. But I do think that we should do all we can and should call upon the Council to make this matter a special priority."
"If we leave this until later on, our September part-session, for example, we might miss the opportunity of getting the Council to do something."
"That is why I do not think that we can leave this matter until later on."
"Would you agree, Mr Novo, to this important question being covered in the statement by the presidency on its programme, or do you wish to have a separate statement?"
"Madam President, I think that our group could accept this suggestion by the presidency as long as the Council declares at this time that it will include this matter in the discussions for Wednesday."
"If that is the case I am entirely in favour but if it is not I think that we should deal with the question as a separate issue."
"Madam President, to be quite honest, this is because Mr Galeote has an unexpected and very urgent engagement elsewhere."
"As you know, Mr Martens, it is possible for rapporteurs to arrange deputies for themselves."
"Madam President, I would ask the House to accept Mr Galeote's apologies."
"His engagement is something which has come up quite unexpectedly."
"We would therefore ask that the item be removed from the agenda or postponed."
"Madam President, if the PPE Group were really so interested in postponing this report, it would present its reasons to the House."
"As we do not know its reasons, my group will vote against the request."
"Madam President, I am in favour of it being postponed, provided it comes back on a Friday morning as the last item on the agenda!"
"(Parliament decided to keep the report on the agenda)"
"Madam President, I wanted to raise something on Tuesday's agenda - not to change the agenda but to ask for clarification from you."
"We have the discussion on Tuesday morning on the Commission's information policy regarding BSE (mad cow disease)."
"There was an absolute demand from the Conference of Presidents that Mr Santer himself should address the plenary on this matter because this is not an issue for the agriculture Commissioner but concerns the Commission policy on information."
"Could you please inform us whether it will be Mr Santer?"
"I can tell you straight away, Mrs Green, that in view of the importance of this issue, which we all appreciate, both Mr Santer and Mr Fischler will be present."
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to welcome a delegation from the Japanese Diet, who have taken their seats in the Official Gallery."
"(Loud applause) This delegation consists of members of the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors, and is led by the former Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Tsutomu Hata."
"Our Japanese colleagues, who have our warmest greetings, are in Strasbourg today to take part in the seventeenth interparliamentary meeting between the European Parliament and Japan, co-chaired by Mr Bertel Haarder, chairman of the European Parliament delegation."
"On behalf of all Members of the House, I sincerely welcome you to the European Parliament, and I hope that our work together will be extremely successful."
"(Applause)"
"Major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0224/96) from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the common position established by the Council (C40222/96-94/0014(SYN)) with a view to the adoption of a Council Directive on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances (rapporteur: Mr Bowe)."
"Madam President, before I begin I should like to say that I come here as the rapporteur on this report at second reading."
"I took it over at the beginning of this Parliament, a lot of the work on it having already been done by a colleague of mine, Claude Delcroix."
"Before I go on to talk about it, I should just like to express my thanks for the work that was done by Mr Delcroix in the last Parliament and say that a great deal of the work that I offer you today and that Parliament has done was achieved under his guidance."
"We owe him a debt of gratitude."
"We have in front of us a directive up for a third revision, it having been thought necessary to review it in the light of experience, technical progress and operating knowledge."
"We should not underestimate just how important this directive is."
"Far too often many of the installations which this directive is designed to safeguard, operate quietly and unobtrusively without people realizing the great dangers that they pose."
"It is only when something goes dramatically wrong - serious explosions or fires and people injured or killed - that we realize how important this legislation is to ensure the safety of the people of Europe and that our industry can operate not just economically and profitably but also safely."
"The common position before us today is generally one which Parliament would agree with."
"It does not alter the general structures of the proposal."
"In fact it has certainly been improved by the addition of some of Parliament's amendments from first reading."
"But there are some areas where we believe that acceptance of some more of Parliament's amendments might improve the text further."
"We therefore offer the Council and the Commission second reading amendments to make improvements in the following areas."
"Firstly, we object to the scope of the directive being diminished by granting exemptions from obligations such as the safety report, the emergency plans and the provision of information to the public."
"We feel that seriously weakens the directive and should be improved."
"Secondly, we are concerned that certain installations are excluded from the directive, particularly military establishments, land-fill sites and certain intermediate storage areas such as those in rail depots, docks and other places."
"We feel further work should be done in that area."
"Thirdly, we feel that there is a lack of clarity with regard to the time limits to conform with the provisions of this directive and that insufficiently binding obligations are placed upon certain operators to ensure that they are fully adhering to the provisions of this directive within appropriate time-scales."
"In addition, there is the issue of land-use planning."
"As a principle, this has been weakened within the directive as compared with first reading, just when the problems of urban sprawl and the growth of cities around these dangerous and hazardous sites are becoming acute."
"We feel it is important that we, the Council and the Commission go back and re-examine these issues and ensure that the ordinary development of cities and towns does not threaten or create new dangers."
"It is also essential that there is proper public participation and that the public is informed and given full information about the planning and licensing procedures for these sites and for new installations in particular."
"We placed particular emphasis on this at first reading and we do not feel that enough of our concerns have been taken up by the Commission and the Council so far within the proposal."
"There are a number of other technical issues with regard to harmonization of certain reporting criteria and harmonization of certain aspects of the inspection of these installations."
"However, we recognize that this is the kind of legislation which grows incrementally, as it is now moving on to its third reading."
"It is legislation which grows as we learn of the greater dangers that are occurring around us, and which we would expect to see grow, perhaps as a result of future revision in years to come."
"However, that does not in any way exempt the Commission or the Council from guaranteeing the safety of the people living around these dangerous chemical sites and other dangerous, large installations that have the potential to create such cataclysmic damage."
"We would therefore appeal to the Commission and the Council to examine again this proposal and take on board more of Parliament's amendments to ensure that we continue to lead the world."
"We have been leading the world and are proud to lead the world in chemical plant safety and protecting public health and the safety of our citizens."
"We feel that is what should be being done now and into the next century."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we recently celebrated the twentieth anniversary of the Seveso disaster."
"This major accident occurred in 1976."
"Since 1982, there has been legislation in the European Union on the major-accident hazards of certain industrial activities. Minor amendments to this legislation were made in 1987 and 1988."
"As the Commission has ascertained, the provisions of this legislation - especially as regards the technical aspects, the prevention and tackling of accidents, and emergency plans - have proved very successful."
"Nevertheless, they have not managed to prevent some 130 accidents from occurring since 1982."
"In the past, the legislation has affected some 1866 undertakings."
"Following repeated requests from Parliament and the Council, technical progress and the benefits of more than ten years' experience of the existing legislation have led to the submission of the text that we are discussing today at second reading."
"It is not simply a question of the revision of the 1982 directive but, in substantial areas, of a completely new directive, as well as an entirely new approach."
"Mr Bowe, as rapporteur, has already said something on this point."
"In our view, the protection of people and the environment in the vicinity of potentially dangerous installations must be improved further."
"The top priorities are to prevent major accidents involving dangerous substances and, should such an accident occur, to limit its consequences for people and the environment."
"Our group supports this goal fully and absolutely."
"However, I have doubts that we are achieving it."
"These doubts are fed by the hitherto inadequate level of transposition and implementation of the directive in the Member States, as well as by certain basic considerations."
"I believe that it is important to bring this directive into line with other legislation on the same subjects."
"I therefore welcome the fact that, in its common position, the Council has finally taken on board some of the criticisms repeatedly made by Parliament - and, in particular, my group - in the sense that the content in at least some of the areas been brought into line with the provisions of existing directives."
"This includes the definition concerning the IPPC directive."
"Also in line with the IPPC directive, requirements for operators to provide information have been introduced."
"The rules concerning the provision of information have been brought into line with those contained in the existing directive on free access to information on the environment."
"My group is therefore opposed to some of the amendments which have been tabled, which might call this consistency into question."
"However, the main problem concerns the following: as yet, the Commission has failed to submit to Parliament appropriate proposals for the annexes, although, according to Article 9 regarding the security reports to be drawn up, these criteria have to be established."
"I regret the fact that they have not been submitted on time."
"I questioned the Commission on this matter in committee, but I did not receive a reply."
"Parliament and the Council are excluded from this decision: it is a matter for the Commission alone."
"I therefore greatly regret the fact that Parliament has not been included in this regard."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after seventeen months, the proposal for a directive concerning the revision of Directive 82/501, the so-called Seveso Directive, on the major-accident hazards of certain industrial activities, has returned to the House for second reading."
"We can only welcome the common position adopted by the Council, in that it reflects the basic thrust of the proposals made by Parliament at first reading, striking a satisfactory balance."
"Certain aspects could of course be developed further, especially those relating to the definition, at Community level, of the essential provisions to which inspection systems adopted by the Member States must conform, and to the adoption by the Member States of the measures needed to ensure adequate training for those who draw up external emergency plans, those who take decisions in the case of serious accidents, and for workers, contractors and subcontractors at high-risk establishments."
"Despite agreeing on the need to define the concept of major-accident hazard, for which there still exists no definition, we do not regard the rapporteur's proposal as satisfactory; moreover, we are strongly opposed to the inclusion of military establishments in the scope of this legislation which, it should be remembered, must respect the principle of subsidiarity."
"What is more, the rigid timescales proposed in the amendments rejected by the Council could hamper industrial activity and production still further, without achieving the desired results."
"Lastly, I believe that this directive must be finalized and implemented in the Member States as soon as possible, in order to improve the systems available to industry and to the competent authorities - limiting the risk of accident hazards and simplifying the criteria for implementation - thereby making it more responsive to industrial change."
"Madam President, at one time it would have taken a major disaster like Bhopal or Basle for this directive to be amended, but this time, I am glad to say, the revision is not the result of any serious accident."
"I think the Commission's proposal is sound, but there is still room for improvement, and it is now up to Parliament to put forward amendments to consolidate it."
"Having heard what the rapporteur has had to say, not just today but over recent months, I can tell you that the Liberals will support all the amendments he has proposed."
"I shall not go through them all, particularly on such a hot afternoon, but I would like to mention nuclear and military installations and storage facilities."
"The Liberals feel that it can only improve public safety if such installations are covered by the directive, and I therefore do not understand why Mrs Baldi says that for reasons of subsidiarity, military installations should not be covered, since they face the same risks as similar civilian installations."
"It seems inconceivable to me that the second should be covered, but not the first."
"And if we look at nuclear power plants, it is clear that although radioactive hazards are already regulated by the Euratom Treaty, the other hazardous substances found at nuclear installations need to be covered by the directive for the sake of public safety."
"We are therefore happy to vote for the amendments, and we would ask the Commission to support them, since they are designed solely to provide better protection for the public against the risks presented by concentrations of dangerous substances, particularly in urban areas."
"Mr President, I support Mr Bowe and his report and the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"I totally disagree with Mrs Baldi."
"It would appear that she is basically a spokesperson for the military and for industry."
"Parliament has a duty to support what the Environment Committee is proposing."
"It has a duty to increase the safety of citizens facing dangers posed by the concentration of hazardous substances in the atmosphere, particularly in urban areas."
"Parliament's duty should first and foremost be to the citizens, not to industry or the military."
"I support most of what other speakers have said regarding the twenty years since Seveso and also what have we learned from the Sandoz disaster."
"It is completely unacceptable that the military or landfill or any of these things should be exempt."
"Also, I would support Mr Bowe on public participation."
"That is vital."
"I come from Ireland where a recently published report by the Cork University Hospital - one of the two centres designated for treating victims of nuclear and chemical accidents - stated that there are no facilities presently available to enable it to fulfil this role."
"Basically, Ireland is very ill equipped for dealing with major accidents in the chemicals industry."
"It is lax in the extreme that the hospital which is located near the biggest concentration of chemicals factories in Ireland has no decontamination unit for treating chemicals workers or members of the public who fall victim to major accidents."
"In 1993 a fire in the Hickson plant in Cork raised public awareness about the threat from the chemicals industry but no lessons have been learnt by the Irish authorities since then."
"The authorities have been reckless in allowing the Norwegian multinational, Dinochem, to start construction of a glue manufacturing plant at Marino Point."
"14, 000 people live on the nearby island, and if there were to be a major accident, their only point of exit would be a bridge which is only 300 metres from the new plant."
"In such an event the possibility of so many people being marooned is alarming."
"There is already a need for EU legislation to make Member States take account of the need for the adequate separation of plants posing major hazards from population centres."
"The Irish authorities decided to play with fire when they set out to encourage industrial development by multinational chemicals companies in Ireland without looking at the long-term consequences."
"Mr Bowe has said that it is essential that the public should participate and also that there should be proper training."
"Most accidents occur as a result of human error."
"It is extremely important that emphasis be put on public training."
"Parliament should support what the Environment Committee is putting forward."
"It is our duty to put citizens' interests first and not the interests of industry or chemicals companies."
"People must come first!"
"If you look at what happened at Bhopal in India, people are still suffering."
"They have received no compensation."
"What has happened to those people?"
"Mr President, Parliament may remember that I tried to get an exemption for whisky bonds - almost all of which are in fields away from residences, though there are some older, smaller ones nearer residences - but I was not successful."
"I have never really been able to regard whisky as a dangerous chemical."
"Perhaps I am a little prejudiced, representing as I do almost all the Scotch whisky in the world."
"But I am happy to say there is an exemption for part of the procedural arrangements."
"There is nothing more secure than a whisky bond for the reason that it is guarded by the police because of the tax value of the whisky in the bond."
"It is a bit like going to Fort Knox to go to visit a whisky bond."
"So I am happy that there has been at least part exemption."
"Mr President, the Council adopted its common position unanimously, and incorporated a considerable number of amendments from the first reading."
"This is extremely good news."
"It was noticeable that the Commission initially refused to support some of the amendments which the Council accepted, but in any event the common position now before us is a considerable improvement on what we had before."
"The remaining points need not, in my view, present any insuperable problems for the Commission or the Council."
"I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the way he has handled this whole issue."
"His amendments have always taken a very clear direction, focusing firmly on safety and openness, and it seems likely that the new Seveso Directive will be a clear and easily implemented piece of legislation."
"The protection of workers and the public in general is important enough to warrant legislation of the very highest quality."
"I know that industrial safety is primarily the responsibility of the firms concerned, but there is still a need for a clear legal framework."
"We know that 90 % of serious accidents are the result of human error, so internal safety measures and worker training in firms are of vital importance."
"At first reading, Parliament adopted an amendment on compulsory information, training and equipment for workers, and I regret that this amendment has not been incorporated into the common position."
"Can the Commission explain why it did not include this amendment?"
"Many chemical firms already regard training, refresher courses and fire drills as important, but there are still far too many others which do not, and these are the ones that need to be put under a legal obligation."
"Loss of concentration, the gradual decline into lazy habits and becoming inured to dangerous situations are risks that workers face every day."
"One final point: there have been complaints that extending the scope of the obligations in the directive will impose too great a burden on industry, out of all proportion to the gains in safety."
"I should like to hear what the Commission thinks about this."
"Do we know how great this extra burden will be?"
"Mr President, the major accidents which have occurred in recent years have demonstrated the threat posed to human society by certain essential but dangerous industrial plants if stringent operational safety measures and accident contingency plans are not in place."
"To allow any recurrence of accidents like those at Chernobyl and Seveso would be unthinkable."
"This directive has as its specific objective the control of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances produced and used at industrial installations. It will replace Directive 82/501, also known as the Seveso directive."
"That directive was adopted in 1982 following a series of accidents involving dangerous substances and was amended following two major accidents, namely the one at Bhopal and the one at Basle which polluted the Rhine."
"Fourteen years on from the introduction of the directive, the wealth of experience acquired in the interim had to be incorporated into the legislation."
"This present directive draws on that more recently acquired knowledge and experience to provide a more effective future approach to major accidents involving dangerous substances."
"Speaking now, in this place also, I should like to stress the importance of the register of all accidents involving dangerous substances and the exchange of information at the European level."
"That is a vital element of this new directive, because the exchange of information, the general provision of information and the periodic review of the safety reports will facilitate an ongoing process of adjustment."
"Also important is our amendment defining the 'almost major accident' concept: that is to say, a major accident avoided owing to an intervention, whether or not planned in advance, or owing to a chance coincidence, the result of which was that the major accident did not occur."
"In our view, the registering of almost major accidents will provide important information which can further the cause of safety, for the simple reason that almost major accidents are more numerous than those which actually occur."
"In concluding, Mr President, I should like to commend the important work done by Mr Bowe and to urge the Commission to accept the amendments of the Committee on the Environment and Public Health, including those which introduce the concept of a near major accident, which were approved unanimously."
"Mr President, let me begin by thanking the Environment Committee and in particular its rapporteur, Mr Bowe, for the effort and attention which they have devoted to this proposal."
"This is a directive which has a serious background and is of great importance for the public and the environment, as the majority of speakers have emphasized."
"So there is no doubt that we are dealing here with a valuable proposal which gives the EU's citizens a guarantee that their safety is being ensured as far as possible."
"The proposed changes we are considering today are the result of a radical overhaul of the directive, as Mrs Schleicher also pointed out, and are based on the experience gained from the existing directive."
"The changes build on the principles which are already contained in the directive, but a number of important key areas have been extended and strengthened."
"These are concerned with land-use planning, safety monitoring systems, to a large extent freedom of access to information and public participation, and improving continuity in the implementation of the directive."
"I also have the impression after the debate today that, as regards the Seveso Directive and this amendment to it, Parliament and the Commission essentially agree on the political commitments which the directive represents, namely to increase the safety of the public and the environment where they are exposed to the risks associated with dangerous substances."
"We have the same goals in this respect."
"I shall now discuss the amendments which have been tabled and indicate the Commission's position on each of them."
"Many of the amendments improve the quality and clarity of the proposal, and the Commission can accept the following either wholly or in principle: Nos 1, 4, 5, 10."
"Amendments Nos 2, 29, 30 and 32 can also be accepted in part."
"However, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 31, 34, 35, 36, 38, 41 and 43."
"It has been pointed out that six of the amendments tabled express concern at the number of exemptions from the directive."
"I feel that these are entirely relevant concerns, and the Commission is trying as far as possible to meet them."
"The Commission is thus giving priority to activities which are in progress in this area."
"We have already begun a detailed study of pipelines, with regard to Amendment No 2, and of temporary storage in connection with transport operations, with regard to Amendment No 17, and we shall if necessary bring forward specific proposals for these areas, as was also indicated in the debate at first reading."
"Amendment No 15 concerns the exclusion of military establishments, and both the rapporteur and several other speakers referred to this question."
"I can appreciate Parliament's concern, but this matter does not fall within the area of competence of the Community."
"Amendments Nos 3 and 18 are aimed at bringing land-fills, i.e. waste disposal sites, within the scope of the directive."
"The Commission entirely agrees that there is a need for Community legislation on land-fills, and we are therefore in the process of drawing up a new proposal on waste disposal sites."
"It was also pointed out that seven amendments deal with the need to include so-called 'near misses' in the directive."
"These are already covered by Annex VI of the common position, but a number of these amendments have been accepted because they further improve the protection in this important area."
"As regards Amendments Nos 1 and 42, and in the light of the discussions which have taken place with the Environment Committee on the importance of effective cooperation with third countries outside the EU in terms of information exchange and warning systems, the Commission can accept these amendments in principle."
"It is recognized in this context that the UNECE convention on transboundary pollution is particularly relevant, and the Commission will try to put forward a more detailed text in the proposal after second reading, in order to reflect Parliament's concerns appropriately."
"Mrs Schleicher asked me a question concerning the annex to the directive on harmonized criteria, and here I would like to stress that, in the Commission's view, it is necessary to set up special groups of experts to compile suitable particulars for harmonized criteria."
"The most appropriate and effective way of establishing such criteria is through the committee procedure laid down in the existing directive."
"This approach has already proved its worth in the production of guidelines in various sectors, including accident analysis, safety reports and safety management systems."
"In conclusion, I would say that the amendments which have been accepted will further improve this proposal."
"And I am sure that all of us can look forward to this proposal increasing the protection we provide for both people and the environment against the dangers of major accidents which could have disastrous consequences."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Water, energy, transport and telecommunications markets"
"The next item is the report (A4-0022/96) by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Council Directive 93/38/EEC coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and telecommunications sectors (COM(95)0107 - C4-0162/95-95/0080 (COD))"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for the second time, Parliament is debating the Commission proposal amending the sectoral directive."
"The starting point for this proposal was the first GATT Agreement on Government Procurement, which the European Union signed at the conclusion of the Uruguay Round."
"The aim of that agreement is the increased liberalization and expansion of world trade."
"The new agreement goes much further than the previous procurement agreement and encompasses contracts which, according to the Commission, will be worth some ECU 350 billion a year."
"Parliament very much welcomes this agreement."
"However, the Commission itself stresses in its proposal that amendments to Community law are not necessarily essential for the implementation of the agreement by the European Union."
"An extensive debate has developed between, on the one hand, the European Parliament and, on the other, the industries concerned and the Commission, on the question of the extent to which the existing EU sectoral directive will have to be amended as a consequence of the new WTO agreement. Today, at the end of that debate, Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy is submitting to the House an almost unanimous recommendation to reject the Commission proposal at first reading."
"For over a year now, in a series of discussions with the Commission - but also following a hearing of the business associations concerned - Parliament has been striving to achieve a reasonable compromise."
"I am personally grateful to Commissioner Monti for repeatedly stressing the Commission's readiness - as regards any differences of opinion between Parliament and the Commission - to study Parliament's arguments concerning the content of the proposal."
"We only wish to see new legislation in the problem areas - such as threshold values, which must be adjusted - in which this is urgently necessary."
"We do not wish to see a comprehensive modification of the procurement directive which goes beyond the WTO agreement, especially as regards those sectors which are not covered by that international agreement, such as telecommunications."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy reached an agreement with Mr Monti that the Commission would endeavour to withdraw its proposal and submit a new proposal to the Council and Parliament."
"We are convinced that this is the only way to ensure that Parliament's proposals are adequately taken into account in the subsequent discussions."
"Mr Monti declared his willingness to support Parliament's position in this respect, as well as on the essential issues of content."
"For procedural reasons, however, he was unable to secure a majority for this position in the Commission."
"We are therefore more or less obliged to reject this draft directive today, so that in the autumn, following the conclusion of this stage of the procedure, the Commission can submit a new, modified proposal to which Parliament has largely agreed in advance."
"The discussions in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy pursuant to Rule 59 did not bring any new findings to light. Consequently, the committee is resubmitting today the report that has been on the table since 24 January 1996, when it was adopted by 47 votes to 1."
"There are differences of opinion - and a need for discussion - particularly with regard to the so-called 'technical dialogue' in the case of complex and technically demanding procurement plans."
"Parliament is opposed to the idea of undertakings which are involved in the preliminary stages of an invitation to tender - helping to draw up complex technical specifications - subsequently being prohibited from bidding for the specific contract."
"In our view, this will result in a significant restriction of technological progress, thereby leading to considerable competitive disadvantages for European industry, to which the directive applies."
"We take the view that the procedure adopted hitherto in this respect has proved its worth."
"Transposition of the GPA is of far-reaching importance for the competitive position of European industry."
"This is particularly true of the high-tech areas of the sectoral directive, where in order to secure its future as a strong global player, the European Community must remain competitive when markets are opened up."
"Administrative considerations such as the appropriate form of transposition, or other more or less formal legalistic arguments, should therefore not be a decisive factor in the transposition of the GPA into European legislation."
"In our opinion, what is important is to maintain strict reciprocity, as called for by Parliament a few months ago in its resolution on the G7 conference."
"To ensure the appropriate transparency, the GPA should therefore be transposed through a supplementary directive which will contain the exceptions and special arrangements and will refer to the existing EU directives on public tendering."
"We are trusting in the good sense of the Commission as a collegiate body, as well as in the promises that Mr Monti has given us."
"I should like to take this opportunity to thank Commissioner Monti for his constant readiness for dialogue, and thank my colleagues in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy for an excellent joint discussion of this draft directive. I hope that we shall be able to conclude the discussions and bring about the appropriate transposition of the GPA before too long."
"I would like to thank my colleague Dr Langen for all the hard work that he has put in on this issue and I think I can say on behalf of the Socialist Group that there has been a genuine bipartisan approach to this subject."
"The effects of implementing the proposals contained in this Commission document will be immense."
"Every company which deals with contracting entities in any of the utilities sectors will have to adjust its working practices to conform with the rules that we impose upon them."
"Before we do that, we have a duty to ensure that those rules are necessary, will work to enhance European business's rights and opportunities, and will serve their part in the opening up of global markets in our fight to improve employment and to create a level playing field."
"Even though this is an internal directive, it cannot be taken in isolation, just as the EU cannot be taken in isolation."
"The fact that these proposals are being introduced to eliminate disadvantages created by the implementation of the GPA demonstrates how we are all intertwined."
"So to evaluate these proposals as a whole, we should look at what we are competing against, to see what practice, or what common practice there is in the market-place."
"When we look at our major rivals - firstly Japan - the Japanese are making no attempt to draw up similar legislation to that put forward by the Commission."
"The United States - not only have the United States failed to introduce internal legislation to bring their home market in line with the GPA they have not even introduced the GPA itself, and what is more they do not have any intention of so doing before the election of this year, if at all."
"Secondly with regard to the United States: not only have they failed to introduce internal legislation to bring their market into line with the GPA, they have failed to eliminate the 'Buy American' Act."
"More than two years ago they promised to do this, yet there has been no action."
"They have had rulings in their courts that no foreign legislation can take precedent over domestic legislation, which legitimizes their protectionist trade regime."
"Now with the Helms-Burton Bill, we even have the American Government taking non-American companies to court over trading with Cuba."
"We do not condone this; we call on the Commission to actively pursue these matters and insist on the full implementation of all agreements signed at international level."
"We want internal legislation to eliminate disadvantages, albeit minor ones of threshold levels created by the GPA, and to set up controls to safeguard EU citizens and businesses against corruption in the awarding of government contracts."
"This is very important because taxpayers' money is involved here."
"We also need to ensure that, whatever measures are put in place, our businesses will be left as competitive as possible, both domestically and in terms of overseas competition."
"The problem is that at the moment we simply do not know what the right practices are."
"Representatives of all sectors of industry have indicated, at a public hearing, that they see huge problems with the Commission proposals."
"Unlike the Commission they did not consider these proposals as benefits but burdens, they were unanimous in their opposition."
"We have asked the Commission on more than one occasion to supply information on the practical effects of their proposals, they have not so done."
"I ask the Commission again, let us have studied consideration of the effects of each of the measures you wish to implement."
"Let us have costings."
"Let us have justifications."
"Let us consult on this."
"The Union pays out a fortune on studies every year."
"If ever there was a clear case for a study there is a case for one on public procurement."
"We have heard much from the Commission on the distortions in the internal market caused by bringing some sectors into the scope of the directive and leaving others out."
"That is one question."
"Another is that by changing the status of sectors, do we not distort the existing market?"
"The Commission has also proposed to bring the private sector within the scope of Directive 93/38/EEC: effectively in line with the GPA even though the private sector is excluded from the GPA."
"Does the Commission expect companies to run two systems, one for internal transactions and one for external, thereby increasing costs?"
"We have been told the Commission has a legal obligation to press ahead with this legislation."
"We do not know whether this is true."
"There is no proof that this has been put before the committee despite repeated requests on our behalf."
"We in the Parliament need to be cautious."
"We are dealing with matters which may be simple on paper yet have important implications for jobs."
"What we need is time."
"We have time to get this directive right because it does not have to be implemented until 1998."
"I would ask the Commission to listen to the concerns of Parliament and industry and let us have a new directive, then we can report on it, give our response and pass it through Parliament quickly."
"The Commission knows what we want and we can act fairly and effectively and as quickly as possible when we get that proposal."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our group will be following the advice of Mr Langen, rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy."
"Indeed, the Union for Europe Group cannot accept the manner in which the Commission has interpreted the content of the GATT agreements."
"What is fundamentally at issue here?"
"The negotiations on the extension of the GATT government procurement regulations of 1980 led to the conclusion, in December 1993, of the second GATT Agreement on Government Procurement, which forms part of the new WTO accord."
"The transposition of the GPA is vitally important to the competitiveness of the European economy."
"This observation applies in particular to the high-tech areas of the directive on specific sectors."
"In this context, the European Community has a duty - especially when it opens up its markets - to secure its economic future by maintaining its status as a strong and competitive global player."
"What is essential, in my view, is to maintain strict reciprocity, as already called for by Parliament - with regard to economic relations with third countries - in its resolution on the G7 conference, and hence to bring out clearly all the special practical features of tenders from GPA third countries."
"Since, with the system for which it provides, the proposal under discussion exceeds the scope of the GPA, it must be resolutely rejected."
"The Commission is proposing to amend Directive 93/38/EEC in such a way that all the proposed modifications, with the exception of the new statistical requirements, would apply to research and development services, public undertakings, and private undertakings operating on the basis of a special or exclusive right - such as a concession - in all the sectors covered by the directive, including the four referred to, which are not covered by the GPA: gas and heat distribution; extraction of oil and gas; transport by railway other than urban railway; and telecommunications."
"The proposed transposition of the GPA by amending the existing directive does not, in practice, make it sufficiently clear which areas are excluded from the GPA or what special features apply to contracts which have to be published and awarded in accordance with the provisions of the GPA."
"This was the conclusion of the public hearing of European companies and businesses held by Parliament on 31 October 1995."
"Consequently, if we wish to ensure an adequate degree of transparency, the GPA must be transposed by means of a supplementary directive which will both contain the exceptions and special arrangements and refer to the existing EU directives on public tendering."
"In other words, it should be made clear that implementation of the draft directive being proposed by the Commission would amount to granting foreign suppliers - and, above all, US suppliers - total access to the European market, whilst European suppliers would only be able to operate in the US public market."
"However, the public market in the United States accounts for only a fraction of the market as a whole."
"Mr Langen therefore has our support with regard to this matter. Mr Monti will have to go back to the drawing-board."
"Mr President, it is good that the Commission should be taking a constructive, serious view of the European Parliament's wish to examine more closely what the implementation of the WTO agreement will mean in practice."
"In general, however, the problem is that when market forces are given free rein and when the economy is deregulated the consequences are not necessarily clear at the time when decisions are taken."
"It is certainly the case that the WTO agreement has already been ratified and that it is in force, so that, from that point of view, there are no grounds whatever for cherishing hopes of protectionism as practised in the past."
"There is, however, every reason to adopt a cautious approach."
"The Green Group as well fully supports Mr Langen's conclusion that the Commission should submit a fresh proposal to Parliament."
"It would be appropriate for Commissioner Monti to explain briefly, for example during this debate, on what basis the Commission intends to draw up a fresh proposal."
"In that respect, the issues which concern us at least most of all are, firstly, which sectors will ultimately fall outside the scope of this agreement and, secondly, what problems will be caused by the fact that two systems are in force at the same time: the one we are discussing now and the directive by means of which equivalent rules have already been implemented within the European Union."
"Moreover, extremely large sums of money are involved: in the context of this agreement, some ECU 350 bn. will change hands around the world each year which will certainly create opportunities for the European Union, but the strict application of the principle of reciprocity is called for, and for that reason, I endorse the previous speaker's call for a little more time and a little greater clarity."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my main observation to the House regarding the Langen report concerns the clarification of the legal scope of the Commission's proposal."
"We are dealing here with two different legal orders: the international agreement on the one hand and the Community directives on the same subject on the other."
"In the natural way of things the international agreement regulates relations between the Member States of the European Union and third countries."
"The Community directives cover the rules applicable in the Member States."
"These directives cannot change the international order; nor can they confer on suppliers and contractors from outside the European Union rights which operate to the disadvantage of suppliers and contractors in the Member States."
"What the Commission has tried to do - and it has done it well - is to adapt the internal law of the Union to the international agreements while ensuring, specifically, that suppliers and contractors in the Member States have at least the same rights as those conferred on suppliers and contractors from third countries by the international treaties."
"The argument that the legal order worsens the situation for European businesses is mistaken and groundless, and the argument expressed against the Commission's proposals by suppliers and contractors should not surprise us."
"What else should we expect them to say?"
"Mr President, it is well-known that there are many other special problems in the public works and procurement sector."
"Corruption is very deeply rooted. We need only think of the 'tangentopoli' scandal in Italy and of the front page story in the Financial Times a fortnight ago about the arrest in Germany of 15 senior civil servants for allegedly colluding with contractors to defraud the German taxpayer in connection with the construction of the second terminal at Frankfurt airport."
"These things are happening all over Europe. In Belgium a general committed suicide some time ago in connection with a similar circumstance."
"The Commission's desire to tighten up the system is laudable."
"Its proposal will not, of course, be approved on this occasion, given that the two main groups in the House are recommending rejection, but it should at least be told that many of us consider this an excellent proposal that we can support."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Langen, and recalling the context in which we are operating."
"The Government Procurement Agreement, the GPA, forms an integral part of the Community's legal order, following the Council's decision of 22 December 1994 approving the agreements reached in the Uruguay Round negotiations."
"Consequently, the GPA entered into force in the Community on 1 January 1996, as provided for in its Article XXIV."
"Its implementation in the Community does not in itself require any transposition."
"The Commission has nevertheless proposed a series of amendments to this directive with a view to avoiding any discrimination against Community firms, granting them the same advantages as those enjoyed by third-country businesses under the GPA, and ensuring that the two legal orders are consistent, thereby simplifying implementation in practice."
"It should be made clear that these amendments do not represent a unilateral openingup of Community contracts to third-country businesses."
"The GPA governs the relations between the Community and third countries, so the rights of third-country businesses to participate in Community contracts are laid down and circumscribed by the GPA itself."
"The Community directives, on the other hand, whether amended or not, govern only intra-Community relations, in other words those between contracting entities and Community firms; they do not, therefore, grant any rights to third-country businesses."
"The purpose of the Commission's proposal is to guarantee Community businesses equal treatment to that given to businesses from third countries."
"Apart from some minor amendments which are purely technical in nature, the Commission has confined itself to proposing amendments to the directive only where this is strictly necessary in order to avoid discrimination against Community firms."
"In the present situation, even when Community businesses take part in the same calls for tender as third-country firms, they do not enjoy the same rights and advantages as businesses from third countries which have been signatories to the GPA since 1 January 1996."
"Community firms whose tenders are rejected have no right to be told the reason why, nor to receive information about the relevant features or advantages of the tender which is selected; they do not have the right of access at all times to qualification systems; they are not entitled to equal treatment in terms of the technical dialogue; they do not enjoy the advantages in connection with ways of submitting tenders; they do not have the benefit of the additional information which must be contained in the periodic indicative announcements; and they do not have the advantages relating to the terms that apply to the restricted or negotiated procedures."
"It may be, for the reasons mentioned by Mr Katiforis, that not all of these points emerged at the hearings."
"As things stand, Community businesses do not enjoy these rights and advantages; the negative consequences for them are obvious and serious."
"With this in mind, I regret that our efforts to find a compromise with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have not resulted in a report enabling us today to discuss the proposal's merits and any specific amendments to it."
"Clearly, however, the directive does need to be amended as soon as possible, so as to restore without delay a level playing field for third-country businesses and Community firms."
"These are the main reasons why the Commission is convinced of the need to amend the directive."
"Other concerns have emerged in the course of discussion."
"As I have already said, and as Mr Langen has been kind enough to acknowledge, the Commission intends to take account of these concerns, and to this end I have made known the details of our proposed amendments to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"I can therefore confirm that the Commission intends to present an amended proposal based on the suggestions made in the committee."
"In particular, it is a matter of clarifying further still that it is not by virtue of this proposal that thirdcountry firms will have access to public procurement in the Community; of rewriting the text of the provision on the technical dialogue to make it more flexible; and of re-examining some of the amendments in order to restrict them as far as possible to the scope of the GPA."
"In conclusion, I can summarize my position by saying that I intend to present an amended proposal for a directive, taking account of the concerns expressed in the course of the debate in committee."
"I hope that in this way, we shall soon be on the same wavelength as Parliament and thus achieve what I believe we all wish for: the restoration of a level playing field for third-country firms and European businesses, in a context of adequate legal certainty."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Wine products"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0210/96) on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 1601/91 laying down general rules on the definition, description and presentation of aromatized wines, wine-based aromatized drinks and cocktails aromatized with wine products (C4-0288/96-95/0287(COD)) (rapporteur: Mr P. Martin)."
"Mr President, for once, we are able to approve wholeheartedly the Council's common position, since it incorporates the amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading. We pay tribute to the Council for this very wise decision."
"Indeed, the Council has understood our concern to expand on the notion of traditional product - something which, in this and other areas, is of crucial importance to ensuring consumer confidence in our excellent quality products."
"With regard to wine, aromatized or otherwise, we hope that, with a view to good health, increasing numbers of consumers in all the Member States will consume wine products, which - as we know - have many physiological and organoleptic properties when drunk in moderation. These properties can be summarized as follows: wine is a food; it is a tonic; it calms your nerves; it is a digestive; it is a diuretic; it makes good mineral deficiencies; it is a bactericide and anti-allergic."
"It is therefore important to take this opportunity to say that the consumption of wine must be encouraged in all the Member States."
"I particularly welcome the fact that the Council accepted our views concerning the definition of 'Glühwein' , which must not be watered down when it is sold ready-made in bottles with the spices, sugar, and so on, already added. I have to say that I was surprised to learn that 'Glühwein' is on offer to the consumer ready-made in this way, with all these ingredients already added, so that all that you have to do is heat it up."
"Hitherto, I had only ever heard about or consumed freshly made 'Glühwein' , prepared in accordance with our grandmothers' traditional recipes. Things being what they are, it is clearly important to include a definition of 'Glühwein' in this Community regulation, in order to prevent its manufacturers from selling water instead of wine to the consumer."
"I should therefore like to pay tribute to our rapporteur, Mr Martin, for securing such a successful outcome for this draft regulation."
"Since the Commissioner is honouring us with his presence, however, I cannot resist taking this opportunity to express my regret at the fact that the Council has not yet established its common position on the reform of the common organization of the wine-growing market, which Parliament dealt with at first reading fourteen months ago."
"I hope that the Irish presidency will finally succeed in presenting us with a common position, something which the French, Spanish and Italians - the biggest wine producers in the Community - proved incapable of doing when they held the presidency."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by very sincerely congratulating our colleague, Mr Philippe Armand-Martin, on the magnificent work he has done on this report and that he has already done on other reports, whenever we have debates here on wine."
"In our Committee on Agriculture it is always Mr Philippe Martin who deals with this subject and that is because he is the leading authority on the matter."
"Once again he has demonstrated that authority which is why his recommendations and proposals, already approved by us in the Committee on Agriculture, were approved in full by the Council. That is why it is not difficult for us to support this joint position given that it is full of common sense and good reason."
"I think that wine-based cocktails and drinks aromatized with wine products are now being recognised as traditional in certain markets and for certain consumers."
"I think that for this reason this debate is positive since we are speaking about products which guarantee the use of wine and enhance it through a number of derived products."
"This is very important as long as the rules of the game are clear in terms of quality and discipline."
"I should like to conclude by echoing what Mrs Lulling said. I should like to remind the Commission that three years ago exactly, the Commission - the Commissioner was not in his post at that time but his job was held by his predecessor, Mr René Steichen - presented a working or study document on common organisation of the market in wine."
"Two years ago there was a respective proposal by the Commission."
"In the meantime the European Parliament, 18 months ago, approved a compromise proposal, a very interesting opinion, but the whole matter has been forgotten."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner: in which draw is the wine COM?"
"I think it would be good for us to discuss this."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, whether it is a matter of the wine-growing sector in particular or agriculture in general, I am committed to defending rural traditions, whilst avoiding the trap of social or economic regression."
"As Mrs Lulling indicated a few moments ago, we must welcome the fact that the amendments included in Mr Martin's report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have been incorporated into the common position."
"With regard to aromatized wines - for example 'Glühwein' , for which the possibility of adding water has been eliminated - our principal demands have been met, notably as regards the requirement of a minimum wine content of 75 %, the use of grape musts, and the need for a clearer classification and definition of products."
"I am thinking in particular of 'Fernet Branca' ."
"On behalf of my group, I would urge all colleagues to approve this common position, which reflects a consensus in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and which forms part of the efforts to strengthen our European agricultural identity."
"Mr President, I also wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Martin, for his report."
"Nevertheless, at second reading of this proposal, I should like to make one or two critical comments."
"We are discussing aromatized wines, wine-based drinks and wine-product cocktails."
"All these terms include the word 'wine' ."
"In accordance with all current foodstuffs legislation in Europe, wine is a drink that is produced from the fermentation of fresh grapes."
"We must bear in mind that, in using the word wine to describe a composite drink with a minimum wine content of only 75 % - aromatized wine, that is - we are to a certain extent undermining the significance of this natural process, which has been employed by man for over 5500 years."
"I believe that we must respond to this situation with clear rules governing descriptions."
"When consumers purchase and consume this product, they must be able to recognize clearly that it is a composite drink."
"They must be able to trust in the fact that they are not being offered a counterfeit."
"I agree with the opinion of previous speakers that we must adopt a common organization of the European wine market and find a joint solution as soon as possible."
"I believe that this will make an important contribution to ensuring the confidence of European wine producers and consumers, who have a right to be offered quality products."
"Mr President, Sweden is not a wine-producing country but we in Sweden are consumers of the wines and other drinks concerned in this report."
"The report deals with definitions, descriptions and presentations of aromatised wines."
"The main theme of the report is that traditional methods and traditional products, as defined in the respective Member States, should be respected."
"My contribution to the debate concerns precisely this respect for individual Member States' patterns of production and consumption and for their traditional policies on alcohol, for the two are connected."
"They are not the same in northern Europe as in southern Europe."
"If we in Sweden and the other Nordic countries respect the traditional methods of production and definition of the wine belt our social policies on alcohol and our stricter rules on the production, import, consumption and sale of alcoholic drinks should also be accorded respect."
"I do not believe that it is outside the remit of the report that we should demand respect for our stricter import regulations which limit the amounts which may be imported and for the stricter conditions we impose on the sale of wine, wine-based drinks and other alcohol and the system of selling alcohol only in special establishments - state off-licences - which we have in Sweden."
"I also consider it natural to respect the production of agricultural products and drinks in other Member States, on condition that other countries also respect the production, consumption and health policy requirements we have in Sweden, including for example the special provisions on the import of wines and spirits which we have today."
"We hope that these rules will continue to apply in the future."
"Mr President, this is more than anything a small reminder to the Commission and the Council and I hope that they will take note of the different rules on production and health policy patterns which exist in Europe and in the Member States of the EU and thus be able to see this report as providing support, as a matter of principle, for traditional decisions on rules for the production and consumption of alcohol which will also apply in respect of a country like Sweden."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we discussed the proposal now before the House at first reading, I was able - as you will remember - to accept all the amendments that were tabled."
"You will no doubt be aware that they have all been incorporated into the common position established by the Council on 29 April 1996."
"I am pleased to be able to say that we are also in agreement at second reading."
"The common position contains only a few new features and makes only a small number of changes, principally of wording."
"Parliament was informed of the Commission's approval of the common position on 23 May 1996."
"I welcome the fact that the unchanged recommendation of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and its rapporteur, Mr Martin, is now before us for second reading."
"This should enable the Council to adopt the proposal without delay."
"In conclusion, I wish to thank Mr Martin and the Committee on Agriculture for their work, which has made it possible to achieve a rapid solution."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Groundhandling at airports"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0229/96) on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of a Council Directive on access to the groundhandling market at Community airports (C4-0220/96-94/0325(SYN)) (rapporteur: Mr Seal)."
"Mr President, I should like to start by saying, as rapporteur, how unacceptable it is to be told on the Friday before the part-session commences that in fact the agenda has been changed on this item and it has been brought forward a day."
"It is not just because of my inconvenience, but many people were interested in this particular debate and have made arrangements to be here tomorrow."
"It seems to me very unprofessional of Parliament to make changes to the agenda at the last minute when people do not know and cannot change their arrangements."
"Having said that, I am extremely disappointed, as rapporteur, at having to recommend to Parliament rejection of this common position."
"I and members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism wanted to be positive about this draft directive."
"We wanted to improve the service given at airports for passengers, for the airlines, for everybody concerned with airports."
"We wanted to improve choice."
"We are not against liberalization."
"What we wanted was more choice, but choice which maintained safety and security standards for passengers."
"None of the committee or Parliament favoured complete deregulation with a free-for-all."
"That is why we felt that the Commission draft directive on groundhandling was indeed very poor."
"We felt it was incomplete."
"We felt it had not evolved from discussion with the interested parties."
"In fact, there had been negligible discussion with the interested parties, as I found when I started to meet them as rapporteur."
"I would like to compliment the members of the Transport Committee who worked on this report."
"They worked hard to change that draft directive; to change it into something that was acceptable and something that would work."
"We spent a lot of time doing that."
"As rapporteur I was very proud of the result."
"The amended draft directive was then accepted by all the parties: the airlines, the airports, the independent groundhandlers, the trade unions."
"Everyone felt that the amended directive was then acceptable."
"So what happened with the Council?"
"The Council then used an approach which I am afraid is becoming all too common."
"Not only did it reject most of our amendments, but its approach to Parliament was very much 'take it, or leave it' ; a very high-handed approach that it has also used on the trans-European networks and it intends to use on the environment."
"There was no discussion."
"Certainly, although this is a cooperation procedure, the Council would not even agree to informal talks with Parliament."
"And so what have we got?"
"Because of this we have a common position that is totally unacceptable."
"It is totally unacceptable to everyone, even to Mr Jarzembowski, who seems to have done a U-turn on this at the last moment!"
"Let me point out to you, Mr Jarzembowski, as well as everyone else, that the independent groundhandlers find it unacceptable. They want rejection."
"They do not want a 'Big Bang' change and they do not want existing contracts to be dropped, but that is what it says in the common position."
"The airlines are not happy."
"They want rejection."
"Even in the United Kingdom, to my amazement, British Airways and British Midland both feel that this common position should be rejected and have asked Members to do that."
"The airports are not happy with the common position."
"Not only does it remove much of their authority, but it will not allow them to manage in the way they need to manage as airports."
"I am afraid that the airports, however, are worried about a much tougher stance by the Commission if this is rejected."
"I certainly hope - and I say this to the Commissioner who has now arrived - they do not try to bypass Parliament if this common position is rejected."
"Finally regarding the workforce."
"The workforce is extremely unhappy with the common position."
"It too feels that Parliament ought to reject it."
"The user committee has been emasculated and the social safeguards that Parliament felt it very important to insert in the draft directive have been mostly ignored."
"Let me say also that the customers are not happy."
"I believe that, if they knew about the compromise on safety and security, the customers would be extremely unhappy indeed."
"In Parliament, we too should be very unhappy because not only were there not any informal discussions, but certainly as far as the Council is concerned, it wants to bypass Parliament and set up a completely different advisory body."
"It is entering into comitology and that is something that we certainly cannot allow."
"I feel that Parliament is willing to have more competition, it is willing to give more choice, but it is not willing to tolerate this unacceptable approach that has been put forward to us by the Council."
"I urge Parliament to reject this common position."
"Mr President, as the rapporteur said, this issue of groundhandling has been a long-running saga and, in fact, was initiated by the airlines themselves."
"When the committee of experts reported back it could only provide a majority report."
"There was not unanimity in their particular report."
"I appreciate the difficulty for the Commissioner because this is something that he inherited rather than instigated but I would have to support the rapporteur's view that there is something gravely wrong with the position which has been agreed at the Council of Ministers."
"The PES does not object to competition at airports in the area of groundhandling nor does it oppose liberalization just for the sake of it."
"But we believe that where there is liberalization there are certain matters that have to be taken into account."
"In this particular area of groundhandling, airports in peripheral areas, airports with seasonal traffic, and the social consequences to jobs and the conditions of services and safety, have to be paramount when deciding any legislation."
"Parliament recognized these problems at the first reading and amended the proposal accordingly, particularly in the area of social protection."
"However, the Council chose to ignore Parliament's view and agreed a common position that is unacceptable and something of a dog's breakfast."
"It is very difficult to find anybody who actually agrees or likes this particular common position with the exception of the group opposite."
"Member States, whose common position it is, even had the nerve to approach Members to see if they could slip in amendments to make it better."
"So what have we got with this common position?"
"We have something that the airports do not like; we have something, as the rapporteur has mentioned, that airlines do not like - and remember they are the ones that initiated the whole procedure; we have something that refuellers and groundhandlers do not like; we have something that trade unions do not like; and we even have something that some Member States do not like."
"So one has to pose the question in those circumstances: if there are so many people who do not like this particular groundhandling common position, why should we as a party vote for it."
"It appears to my group that only one course of action is open and that is rejection."
"I remember as a teacher, if a child produced work that was totally wrong, inappropriate or not on the task, then you would try and help them, but you would write at the bottom 'Start again and try and answer the question' ."
"These are words, I believe, that should be placed at the bottom of the Council's common position."
"My group supports the recommendation for rejection that has been put forward by the Committee on Transport and Tourism through its rapporteur."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I think you need to have a word with your British Labour colleagues on this occasion."
"I should simply like to say that, as the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy unanimously sought to ensure, the Council's common position proposes a cautious - in some areas even limited - opening-up of access to the groundhandling market at Community airports: in the case of self-handling, from 1998; and in the case of third-party handling, from 1999, with transitional arrangements until 2002."
"Mr Simpson, Mr Seal, I cannot understand you at all!"
"Naturally, I encountered the same problems: neither the airports nor the airlines were very happy with the proposal."
"They all said, however, that some kind of regulation is better than none."
"I can only say, therefore, that you are being unrealistic!"
"Without a common directive, both airports and the airlines would be totally at the mercy, so to speak, of Mr Van Miert and his officials, since then only the possibility of individual legal actions pursuant to Articles 85 and 86 would exist."
"I therefore support Commissioner Kinnock's call for the introduction of basic rules enabling airports and the airlines to adapt to the emerging legal framework and achieve security of planning - and this also applies to the workforce, Mr Simpson and Mr Seal, because employees also have to know which way the wind is blowing."
"As Christian Democrats, we are in favour of the liberalization of groundhandling services."
"Commissioner, perhaps you could give your Labour colleagues an individual tutorial on this matter!"
"I should like to indicate that, in my view, the Council's liberalization proposal represents a fair compromise between partly complementary and partly contradictory objectives."
"Those objectives include: the efficient use of airport installations through the existence of competition rather than monopolies; efficient, economic management by the airport undertaking, if necessary - and here I agree with my colleague, Mr Mann, of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment - with provision for socially acceptable adaptation measures; fair market-access opportunities for new groundhandling undertakings; most importantly, the possibility of airlines being able to choose whether to perform their own handling services or have them performed by the airport undertaking - as hitherto - or third parties; and, finally, high safety standards at airports."
"And I have the feeling, Mr Seal and Mr Simpson, that you forget that the objective is also to ensure the best possible service for passengers - since airports exist not for the benefit of the airlines, but for the benefit of passengers."
"Sensible liberalization, therefore, is what we must strive to achieve."
"Of course, there are a number of points with which we are not happy, and I hope that the Commission will take up the amendments that we adopt in tomorrow's vote."
"For example, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is calling for the exemptions provided for under Article 9 to be extended to include a special derogation for cases in which the managing body of an airport can show that further extension of the airport is not possible for relevant, objective and transparent reasons."
"As regards the choice of service providers, I think the major airlines should not be discriminated against: they must also have fair market-access opportunities."
"It should be made clear, moreover - and here I agree with Mr Seal - that this liberalization directive must not lead to new market restrictions or interfere with existing contracts."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I believe that this is a reasonably balanced compromise, and that if nobody is entirely satisfied or dissatisfied with it, then it is a good compromise which we should approve!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, in approving - with amendments - the Council's common position, or rejecting it, Parliament will have the choice of assuming its political responsibilities or, once again, bringing discredit upon itself."
"There is a great deal at stake in this proposal for a directive on groundhandling."
"We all agree that the text of the common position is far from satisfactory, since we all share the concern to ensure the highest possible standards of safety and service, whilst respecting social imperatives."
"I personally tabled a number of amendments at first reading expressing these concerns and, like all my colleagues, I deplore the fact that the Council has taken up so few of the nonetheless essential amendments we adopted."
"We are faced with a simple choice."
"Our first option is to adopt a principled stance and register Parliament's dissatisfaction by rejecting the common position."
"We must weigh up the implications of such action."
"If there is not unanimity in the Council, we shall have to start the entire process all over again - something which would take months, if not years."
"There would then be a legal vacuum."
"As you know, ladies and gentlemen, nature abhors a vacuum."
"There would therefore be countless long and complex legal disputes."
"Let us also not forget that if a directive is not adopted, the Commission will be at total liberty to decide and lay down rules pursuant to Article 90(3) of the Treaty."
"We must consider all the implications of this."
"Our second option is to amend the common position."
"In doing so, Parliament will display an attitude of constructive criticism, by defending the essential points that are inadequately taken into account in the common position."
"Personally, I prefer the second option."
"I shall therefore vote against rejection of the common position and in favour of the amendments which seek to ensure increased safety, improved quality of services and the maintenance of social protection."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate the Commission."
"It is quite clear that if no one is happy, you find a compromise so you are able to say that everyone can be happy, even though they are all unhappy."
"A considerable number of amendments have been tabled, a fact which speaks for itself."
"It also means that when the committee voted by a majority of one to reject the common position, it was already fighting a lost cause."
"I think this is an extremely dangerous situation for the dignity and position of the House."
"My group will not on any account support the rejection of the common position, nor did it do so in the committee."
"Mr Donnay's group is not prepared to do so, Mr Jarzembowski's group is not prepared to do so, so the common position will simply not be rejected."
"That is not to say that the compromise before us is exactly ideal, and I should like to hear whether the Commissioner is prepared, now that he has heard all the objections from both sides of the House, to examine how further improvements might be made, because I think - and the Commissioner knows - that the ministers were also not entirely happy with it."
"I would therefore urge the Commission to make use of its right of initiative, and I would also urge the House not to reject the common position out of hand, because it is surely better to have something than nothing at all."
"Mr President, the draft directive on groundhandling at airports, now before the House for second reading, does not take account of the principal amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading."
"The aim of this directive is to deregulate the sector in order to open it up to free competition."
"Thus, access to the groundhandling market will be granted to external players from whom no guarantees are required."
"Certain US companies - chiefly motivated by financial considerations - are stepping up pressure in all the Community's institutions for the adoption of this directive."
"In Parliament's debate on this subject in November 1995, I stressed the gravity of the likely economic and social repercussions of the directive, which have not been assessed at all by the Commission, and which concern the issues of employment, flexibility, the increase of job insecurity, the jeopardization of public services, the dismantling of staff regulations, the growth of subcontracting and the encouragement of social dumping."
"Besides being unacceptable from a social point of view, these repercussions are bound to have an impact on the most crucial aspect of air transport: safety."
"The Council's common position also fails to take account of the analyses and proposals put forward by trade union organizations, which have formed a united front on this issue. What a contempt for public aspirations and the most fundamental rules of democracy!"
"The Committee on Transport and Tourism - and I welcome the fact, since we contributed to this outcome - has delivered an opinion in favour of the rejection of the common position."
"This opinion must be endorsed in plenary, in order to send a clear message to the Council and the Commission: your proposal is unacceptable and must be fundamentally amended."
"Firstly, in drawing up any new proposal, the Council and the Commission must take account of the views of the trade unions."
"They must evaluate the social costs and consequences of implementation of the directive - as the Commission undertook to do before this House."
"They must provide for effective measures to combat unfair competition and social dumping, as well as ensuring that we meet the objectives of public service, the improvement of safety and the safeguarding of social gains."
"Consequently, Parliament will bring credit upon itself by rejecting this negative common position and encouraging the submission of a proposal which meets the common interests of users - who wish all aspects of air transport to be safe and reliable - and the workforce, who legitimately refuse to accept the deterioration of their working and living conditions, just a few years away from the twenty-first century!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Seal's report illustrates once again the interest that Parliament takes in transport issues."
"This interest was confirmed by the vote at the last meeting of the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"All the political groups mobilized their troops - both Members and officials - in an extraordinary case of lobbying."
"At the time, we in the ARE Group advocated abstention, since we believed that rejecting the Council's common position without having voted on the amendments tabled by the various groups was a very strong measure, in political terms."
"Now, the ARE Group has discussed this report and reached the following conclusions."
"Firstly, we regret the fact that a whole series of amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading - especially those with the greatest social content - have not been accepted by the Council."
"We therefore condemn the Council's socially insensitive attitude, which is perhaps the result of its excessive liberalizing zeal in dealing with this package of measures for the air transport sector."
"Secondly, we would have preferred to support the common position, had it incorporated our two amendments to Articles 4 and 5, concerning respectively the separation of accounts in the management of airports and the user committee."
"Faced with this impossible situation, we have no option but to announce our rejection of the common position."
"Nevertheless, we await with interest the political developments which may occur between now and voting time."
"Mr President, the Council's common position is, in our opinion, far from ideal, but we do not think this is sufficient reason to reject it, as Mr Seal has recommended on behalf of the majority in the Committee on Transport."
"The current situation regarding groundhandling does not meet the requirements of the single market, and does not allow airlines to obtain an adequate service at a reasonable price."
"Rejecting the common position will only prolong this undesirable state of affairs."
"Judges in any disputes which might arise between the airports and the airlines will have to rule on a case-by-case basis, resulting in a lack of any clear, consistent line."
"The common position has a number of shortcomings, not least of which is the possibility that the airlines might be completely excluded from the groundhandling market."
"But there are also various points where the Council has tried to accommodate Parliament's wishes, for example in providing protection for the rights of workers and its extremely cautious approach to liberalization, where it makes provision for a number of exceptions."
"In short, this is a cautious step in the right direction."
"By adopting a number of amendments, we can improve the common position further still, and only those who do not want to see the situation change could have any reason to reject it."
"Mr President, the common position established by the Council on access to the groundhandling market at Community airports is likely not to be approved."
"Mr Seal has rightly tried to make it clear that this common position did not appeal to anyone, in spite of the complexity of the problems, which are interesting in certain ways."
"Various committees were unhappy with it: first and foremost the committee responsible, the Committee on Transport, and likewise those consulted for an opinion: the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"I am in partial agreement with Mr Seal: the Commission's common position is unacceptable to the Committee on Transport and Tourism, which has worked very hard, while the Council has taken no account of the wishes of the European Parliament."
"Parliament did in fact attempt to improve the proposal for a directive by submitting various amendments, almost all of which were ignored by the Council."
"The Commission must pay due heed to the role of airlines in groundhandling and acknowledge the European Parliament's attention to social factors, which are of particular relevance in the case of groundhandling."
"Since the common position is not unacceptable in its entirety, it requires further amendment, and certain amendments must be accepted;"
"Parliament must therefore express its views on some of these aspects in plenary sitting."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again we are witnessing how, under the cover of comprehensive and sweeping liberalization which is claimed to be essential, important social and economic structures at airports with outstanding operational records are being called into question, thereby prejudicing both employees and the undertakings operating at those airports."
"Moreover, there are a number of negative aspects arising in connection with the procedure."
"The fact that the Council was not even prepared to discuss informally the improvements overwhelmingly called for by Parliament indicates a disrespect for this House."
"This is an outcome which the European Parliament can only note powerlessly."
"The majority of our proposed amendments have not been taken up, and if our proposal for rejection of the common position does not secure the necessary majority, that will no doubt also be the fate of the other amendments tabled."
"In comparison with the original inadequate Commission proposal, a number of changes and improvements have been made, but important elements are missing."
"Parliament's proposals for social measures, as well as those geared more towards making the measures workable, have been almost completely ignored."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists is therefore calling for the number of suppliers of one or more categories of groundhandling services in all or part of an airport to be limited, in order to safeguard the viability and profitability of airports' current investments and investment plans, if relevant, objective and transparent reasons make this necessary."
"Airports must thus be able to control the technical and operational management of infrastructure."
"Furthermore, we are calling for the establishment of user committees in which employees are also represented, and - as a supplement to the common position - for the job specification of aircraft handler to be expanded, thereby contributing to competence and safety."
"Finally, we are calling for workers' organizations to be supported in their defence of social protection and the criteria for participation in the event of structural change."
"As was made clear in the debates in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, the PSE Group totally rejects the accusation that the unions have been playing with marked cards."
"We support the unions' position, since realities and current developments are proving them, as well as our own stance, right: subsidiary companies are being set up; wages and salaries are being reduced; social protection standards are falling; and part-time jobs are replacing forms of employment which have been established for decades."
"These are realities which the PSE Group cannot accept."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, competition is a key element of our social market economy."
"Who would not be in favour of the liberalization of competition?"
"Who would be against curbing any domination of the market?"
"However, the details of what is acceptable in principle must also be correct."
"The conditions of competition must be fair."
"Dumping in terms of prices or conditions is unacceptable."
"The criteria for suppliers and their services must be quite clearly defined."
"With regard to groundhandling services at Community airports, the following must be taken into account: firstly, the different physical capacities of the Community's airports, which frequently cannot be extended because of limited space or for environmental reasons; secondly, the need to ensure quality, in the interests of both passengers and airlines; and, thirdly, the capabilities of suppliers, since not all suppliers are able to guarantee that they can meet the necessary technical, industrial and operational safety requirements and high environmental standards."
"The Council's common position incorporates only some of Parliament's proposals."
"These include express recognition of the fact that the Member States must guarantee a high level of social protection."
"Employees' rights with regard to training and occupational safety must be taken into account."
"The proposal to restrict self-handling for reasons of space and capacity is also included."
"However, the necessary balance in the safeguarding of the interests of users - passengers and airport employees - is absent from the common position."
"Further points must also be incorporated into the common position."
"Firstly, in any restructuring process, priority must be given to safeguarding existing jobs and guaranteeing the social protection of employees."
"Secondly, with a view to ensuring quality - a key element of industrial productivity in Europe - a higher level of training, conforming to the ISO 9000 standard, should be aimed at."
"It is in the interests of passengers that no mistakes are made in groundhandling, that precision is not the exception but the rule."
"A qualified groundhandler makes an essential contribution to maintaining the highest standards of safety."
"Thirdly, the concept of self-handler must be clearly defined."
"If parent and subsidiary companies simply provide groundhandling services for each other, then we must seriously ask ourselves whether competition is genuinely being ensured!"
"Fourthly, the planned user committee must include representatives of travel organizations and airport employees, with a view to protecting workers' interests."
"In order to ensure the committee's neutrality, its chairman must be independent of the airport and its users."
"I call on the Commission to support these views."
"If it backs us in the vote on these and other amendments tomorrow, there will no longer be any argument for rejecting the Council's common position."
"Our positions have moved closer together."
"Now the Commission must take the decisive step!"
"Mr President, in my opinion Mr Seal has done an excellent job, as regards both the approach to the subject and his proposal that the common position be rejected."
"In the circumstances, if Parliament does not reject the common position and ends up humbly acquiescing in a common position that no one here is satisfied with, it will essentially be abdicating its role and making a mockery of itself to the Council."
"The argument that we should accept this because it is less bad than the present situation is ludicrous."
"Rather than doing that, we would all be better off sitting on the beach back in our countries, I think, bearing in mind the time of year."
"This has nothing to do with being against liberalization and competition or with supporting the monopolistic and archaic situations which currently prevail at a great number of airports and everything to do with seeking to ensure, as other Members have already said, that the objectives are tied in with requirements relating to safety, service quality, the peripheral status of many of the airports and the social rights of employees."
"Mr President, if the common position is adopted in this form, it will lead to serious discrimination against airlines at their home airport."
"The draft directive will allow all airport managing bodies, from the outset and for an indefinite period, to provide unlimited groundhandling services without being required to undergo a selection procedure in the same way as the airlines."
"From the economic point of view, there is no real justification for airport managing bodies to receive better treatment than the airlines which use the airport in question as their home base."
"The airlines possess the necessary facilities and qualified staff at their home airport."
"They should therefore be fully allowed to utilize these staff, as well as to make optimum use of all these facilities, so as to be able to offer a complete third-party and self-handling package at their home airport."
"The destruction of current and future jobs within airlines can hardly be the Council's intention."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have before the House today a report which has been causing us a great deal of concern for several months."
"I should therefore like to reiterate that our main objective is - and must continue to be - to ensure that airports remain as independent economic bodies."
"At both readings, therefore, we have attempted to introduce stringent requirements for self-handlers."
"This is the only way to preserve the investment power of airports and to protect groundhandling services from market dominance by home airlines."
"I also believe that it is imperative for employees to be represented in the user committee."
"The thinking of management and labour must undoubtedly be incorporated into such important decisions."
"The harmonization of training and safety standards will be to everyone's benefit: airlines, passengers and employees."
"It is very rare that a common position is rejected by the committee concerned."
"However, we have been confirmed in our decision by the numerous comments of all the interested parties."
"It must be clear to everyone: the Council and the Commission have failed to achieve a balanced compromise between the interests of airlines, airports and employees."
"If the Commissioner is unable to assure us today that he supports our amendments, this House will have only one course of action: rejection of the common position!"
"The Council must finally take on board the fact that this House takes its work very seriously, and that - as is widely known - Parliament's proposals have met with the broad approval of the various interested parties."
"Mr President, I welcome the Commission proposal which attempts to introduce a degree of liberalization and competition in groundhandling services in airports from 1998."
"Regrettably, the common position dilutes the whole basis of the Commission proposal, seriously delaying the introduction of liberalization and competition."
"I would like to place on record the position as it exists today in the United Kingdom, where liberalization and competition exist in groundhandling services at airports and where airlines are allowed to self-handle."
"Why should British travellers not be allowed the same standard of service when travelling in France, Germany, Italy, Greece and Spain as is currently available in the UK?"
"I find myself in an extremely uncomfortable position since, in spite of all the work undertaken by the Commission, the Committee on Transport and Tourism (notably our rapporteur, Mr Seal), the airlines, the airports and all interested parties, the common position fails miserably to achieve the objectives of the original Commission proposal."
"I fear personally that Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty would achieve more in the way of opening up groundhandling services at European airports to competition, defeating national monopolies and ending the privileged and protected position enjoyed by many of Europe's flight carriers."
"I want the best for Europe's travellers, an excellent service at a reasonable price."
"Currently, travellers have poor service at a high cost."
"We must give the travellers choice and introduce competition."
"I want each and every one of us to stand up and be counted and to vote for competition, choice and lower prices."
"Mr President, I support the proposal of the Committee on Transport for rejection of the common position and I commend Mr Seal for recommending that."
"The Council's common position appears unable to resolve any of the problems created in the European airport industry by the whole air transport liberalization policy."
"As it spreads to Europe's airports this policy is assuming even more dangerous proportions."
"The Council has provocatively disregarded the European Parliament's amendments."
"It has ignored the consequences for service quality and, most importantly, the consequences for the safety of groundhandling services."
"It has ignored the social consequences and the proposals for worker representation on the user committee."
"Lastly, it has ignored the special interests of airlines which account individually for more than 25 % of the traffic at an airport and also the special factors affecting island airports."
"In the circumstances, I think that the only thing that the European Parliament can do is to support rejection of the common position."
"Mr President, the Council proposals liberalizing airport groundhandling services could actually have very serious consequences for jobs and safety at the airport in my own constituency, Dublin, and indeed at other major airports throughout Europe, as has been mentioned by other speakers."
"While I, like Miss McIntosh, welcome increased competition in principle, the proposals currently being put forward by Council are badly thought out and ill-considered."
"They would mean thousands of job losses throughout Europe in aircraft refuelling, servicing, cleaning, passenger handling and baggage registration."
"They would also lead to a serious deterioration in safety standards, a matter which we must all be very concerned about."
"The Council's suggestions have been rejected by everybody directly involved in the industry - in particular by the airlines and the trade unions - and this must tell us something."
"Aer Lingus estimates that up to 200 jobs would be put directly at risk if it is forced out of airport groundhandling services while the central representative Council of Trade Unions at Dublin Airport envisages a steep decline in safety."
"I really regret the way in which the Council has refused to discuss the matter properly with Parliament."
"It has refused to take up any of our suggestions to safeguard jobs and ensure safety standards are improved."
"The Council has even declined to discuss the matter on an informal basis with the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"I am sure that Mr Seal and his colleagues have noted this position."
"I will be urging Members to vote against the Council's common position and I hope that we succeed in getting the required number of votes."
"Mr President, the issue of liberalising access to the market for groundhandling services at Union airports can be compared with a number of other liberalisation proposals which have been debated by the European Parliament recently."
"Each time the socialists and other Members on the left have opposed and tried to prevent developments leading to a greater role for the market economy in the areas in question."
"The liberalisation of postal services is one example, groundhandling services at airports another."
"Socialists, Greens and others appear to want to keep us in a society governed by old-fashioned laws and regulations, a society where free enterprise is not encouraged and where the state regulates access to various markets."
"Until now I had always thought that Barry Seal's party in the UK, the Labour Party, wanted to put this image behind it and instead pursue more up-to-date and market-oriented policies."
"This is clearly not the case, which is particularly regrettable."
"The Commission's attempt to create greater competition at Union airports is a good and commendable one."
"If more parties are active in the market competition will increase and prices will fall."
"Airlines and ultimately passengers will benefit."
"In the long term those companies which are exposed to competition will also benefit, as they will be compelled to develop and improve their activities."
"Obviously it is true that there are also areas and sectors where it is difficult to open up the market, especially where services require a particular infrastructure, such as baggage handling and refuelling services."
"It is my opinion nevertheless that, by responding positively to the Council's common position, we must demonstrate our willingness to carry out the Commission's intentions."
"I believe that a gradual liberalisation in the manner proposed would be extremely positive."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to say first of all that the common position of the Council is clearly better than the Commission proposal."
"The Council has improved on the Commission's positions and recommendations, and I must also point out that a number of provisions approved by the European Parliament at the first reading have been accepted by it."
"However, I must ask this question: if the common position is rejected, what will the situation be afterwards?"
"That appears to be something that Members on the other side have not thought about, perhaps because they feel that in the end the common position will not be rejected."
"I say this because if the common position is rejected, no one can be sure that the Commission will want to bother with it again or that the Council will want to re-examine it."
"We shall be left, that is, with a situation in which groundhandling services market will be regulated by Mr Van Miert on the basis of the general provisions on competition, and that will mean having the same regime in European air transport as that which pertained in the United States after the liberalization of air transport during the Reagan presidency."
"On that basis I think that we should support the common position as it has come to us, after amending it as best we can."
"Members on all sides have already tabled amendments, and I feel that if the Commission - and I address myself directly to Commissioner Kinnock at this moment - can state that it accepts them, or tell us which it can accept, it will help greatly and serve as a powerful means of putting pressure on the Council to accept the amendments that we approve."
"That is what I wanted to say, and I think that we should concentrate on getting adoption for those amendments which genuinely improve the common position."
"Having the Commissioner as our helper and ally will greatly assist the achievement of that."
"Mr President, I see that a considerable number of amendments have been tabled by various groups, including those who are in favour of rejecting the common position."
"In deciding on whether or not to vote for rejection, a good number of Members will undoubtedly be swayed by the Commission's position on these amendments."
"I should therefore like to ask the Commissioner whether we can have the Commission's position on the amendments in writing before the vote."
"Mr President, over the years there have been many occasions on which I have agreed with Mr Seal and I find myself in a similar position again, certainly in respect of the remarks he made right at the beginning of his contribution this afternoon."
"Until last Thursday this debate was scheduled for tomorrow."
"Like several Members of this House, I consequently accepted important public engagements."
"The procedures of this House, however, apparently mean that important business can be changed at very short notice."
"In order to be able to attend this important debate on groundhandling, therefore, I had to cancel my engagements last Friday."
"I consider it important that the relevant Commissioner with a portfolio is in this House to respond on the business for which he or she is responsible."
"That is why I had to cancel."
"To say that I was infuriated and embarrassed by having to commit such a discourtesy to the very large number of people I had to let down is to make an understatement."
"I have to say that whilst I am not in the least bit concerned about my personal inconvenience - that does not matter at all - I must urge the authorities of this House to reform procedures both for the sake of the good name of this Parliament and out of respect for the general public, some of whom, of course, wanted to be able to attend this debate and had made arrangements to be here tomorrow and found it impossible to change them in order to be here today."
"Mr President, the Commission's proposal on groundhandling has, not surprisingly, as we have heard this afternoon, proved to be controversial and that - of course - is demonstrated by the recommendation of the Committee on Transport and Tourism that the common position be rejected by this House."
"I regret that."
"I like to be in agreement with the committee as frequently as I can and I certainly understand the reasons for the view of the committee."
"Nevertheless, I cannot avoid recognizing the reality that groundhandling services at most Community airports are still often the monopoly of the airport or of the dominant airline and that condition certainly does not meet the requirements of the single market."
"Nor can I ignore the fact that for some years past the Commission, the Council and, indeed, this House have emphasized the need to deal with the liberalization of groundhandling in the Community."
"The main objective of this proposal, therefore, is to introduce basic rules to ensure that air carriers are provided with a genuine choice of suppliers so that they are able to obtain services that meet their needs at a reasonable price."
"In an effort to ensure that liberalization takes place as smoothly as possible and takes into account the interests of all stakeholders, particularly airports and employees, the proposal is formulated in a balanced way."
"As with the airline sector, we are therefore proposing arrangements which give stakeholders a reasonable period of time for transition."
"We have heard this described this afternoon from some quarters as 'too reasonable' and 'too long a period of time' for transition, but we are doing this in order to avoid abrupt changes with significant social consequences."
"The gradual introduction of the new market organization and the possibility of granting exemptions in exceptional cases will allow Member States sufficient time to adjust to the new situation."
"Some airports will obviously be able to meet the requirements more quickly than others and some services will find change easier to implement than others."
"For that reason, the common position adopted by the Council provides for full access to the market and freedom to self-handle on the land side of the airport."
"On the air side, however, where services are clearly subject to greater safety, security, space and capacity constraints, it will be possible to limit the number of suppliers or of carriers that want to self-handle."
"In addition, under specific circumstances, exemptions can be granted by the Member State under the supervision of the Commission."
"The reason offered by Mr Seal and Mr Simpson and their colleagues for rejecting the common position refers to the dissatisfaction of the different stakeholders."
"I understand their view, since change will always provoke opposition from interests seeking to defend their established position whether they are representatives of employees or in some cases airlines or, in some cases, airports or suppliers."
"I must say, however, that by its very nature this proposal cannot give absolute satisfaction to any one group of stakeholders since it tries to take into account the problems of each relevant group."
"Indeed, if I were the teacher referred to in a speech by Mr Simpson I would have to take account of two factors when marking the work."
"First of all, the need to adhere to the competition rules of the Community and secondly, the diversity of interests involved in groundhandling."
"When, as a teacher, I took account of these two intractable and unavoidable questions I would give at least 8 out of 10 for content, 9 out of 10 for effort and 10 out of 10 for originality."
"The problem raised here is not a matter of conflict between airlines and airports despite the efforts in some quarters to use the vocabulary of the battlefield; the issue relates directly to applying the Treaty rules on commercial activities to monopolies or quasi-monopolistic situations, whether the holder of the monopoly is the airport itself or the dominant carrier of the airport."
"It also relates to the need to ensure that our airlines, which have Europe as their main market, are not hampered by competitive disadvantages by comparison with United States or Far East competitors."
"The Commission is keen to ensure that the opening of the market does not have negative consequences for employment."
"That is why we sought to provide for a phased implementation that is carefully adapted to circumstances."
"We bear in mind also that where groundhandling has been liberalized, the consequence has, in some respects, been an increase in employment opportunities."
"At Parliament's request, the common position includes the possibility for Member States to take measures to ensure an adequate level of social protection and respect for national social legislation."
"We could also accept the addition of some references to regard for, and defence of, social rights, especially in the approval clause or in the standards and technical conditions of the selection procedure."
"It is, of course, difficult to introduce special rules offering derogations for reasons of social protection for the groundhandling sector alone, or to insert amendments which would constrain the opening of the market and so reduce the scope of the Directive."
"In addition, the Commission is not in a position to change the scope of Directive 77/187 on the transfer of undertakings by making reference to its application in the groundhandling text."
"It is clear that Directive 77/187 will certainly apply in many situations."
"But its application in particular circumstances depends on the way in which they fit into the general principles established by the European Court of Justice."
"Against that background, I wish to respond to the amendments to the proposal that have been presented by different groups in this House."
"First, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1, 8, 9 and 39 in part, and Amendments Nos 27, 31, 34, 37, 38, 40, 42, 43 and 45 in full, since they have been accepted at first reading and they contribute to the improvement of the text."
"Second, the Commission can accept, in principle, subject to some redrafting, Nos 7, 11, 15, 17, 20, 21, 30, 33 and 36."
"The Commission cannot, however, accept parts of Amendments Nos 1, 8 and 39 or any of Amendments Nos 2, 3, 12, 13, 14, 18, 22, 23, 25, 26, 28, 29, 32, 35 and 44, either because they do not correspond to the scope of the Directive or because they reduce the scope too much."
"We cannot accept part of Amendments Nos 9 or 39 or any of Amendments Nos 4, 5, 10, 24, 41 concerning thresholds, dates, subsidiarity and comitology."
"It is very difficult to reach an agreement on these matters with the Member States in Council, and the Commission must resist reopening any of the issues since that would most certainly divert and delay progress with the legislation in a very negative way."
"Finally, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 6, 16 and 19, which are considered inappropriate in this context or are contrary to normal business practice."
"In answer to Mr Cornelissen's question: he can most certainly have the abbreviated explanations or reasons for acceptance and rejection of amendments and they will be at his disposal shortly after the debate."
"In general terms, the common position - which was, incidentally, adopted by a Council of Transport Ministers, including eight socialist ministers - corresponds to the balanced approach we have all tried to adopt in this issue of groundhandling liberalization."
"For a variety of sometimes differing reasons, the majority of airports and airlines now support it and prefer to accept the proposed text as it stands rather than find themselves in a state of continuing uncertainty."
"The Directive is needed in order to complete the liberalization process in the air transport sector."
"To underline that, I draw attention to the fact that the Commission has received a number of complaints over the years about the high prices and the quality of groundhandling services at many airports where these services are supplied in monopolistic conditions."
"It is therefore necessary to improve the situation with a broad measure that will ensure a degree of market liberalization in all Community airports for the benefit of users and passengers, while allowing the Member States the means to guarantee sufficient levels of safety and security and, of course, respect for employees' rights."
"The common position fulfils these requirements and I therefore urge the House to support it."
"That concludes the debate."
"I will ensure that the remarks that you made on the timing of business are drawn to the attention of the Conference of Presidents."
"Mr President, I am pleased that you made your last comment."
"I entirely support the criticisms by the Commissioner, and I think that what happened was extremely unfortunate, particularly for those trying to follow our debates."
"I also did not hear about it until Friday, since no one took the trouble to inform the chairman of the committee responsible."
"I asked the secretariat on Friday to telephone as many people as possible to warn them not to come tomorrow."
"I hope you will look into this, Mr President, and let us know what you decide."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at 12 noon tomorrow."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.09 p.m. )"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday evening a serious plane crash occurred at Eindhoven airport, seven kilometres from where I live, in which 32 people were killed and nine were injured."
"Hundreds of their relatives in Belgium and the Netherlands are now mourning their loss."
"On behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the Dutch and Belgian Members of this House I would ask you, Madam President, to send our condolences to the relatives of the victims."
"I shall be discussing with Commissioner Kinnock today whether the European Commission should be involved in the investigation into the cause of the crash, because it is extremely important that we should learn as much as we can from such tragedies."
"I am sure the House will join you in expressing sympathy and condolences, Mr Cornelissen."
"Madam President, I have a question concerning yesterday's order of business which was approved when the agenda was finally adopted."
"My question is this: how can a report - in this case the report on groundhandling services - be brought forward by a day?"
"It is one thing to expect us, as Members of the European Parliament, to be capable of preparing a speech in an hour and a half, but what about those members of the public who are catching an early flight this morning so that they can be here when we discuss groundhandling services this afternoon, and who have made a hotel reservation for tonight so that they can be here for the vote tomorrow?"
"This makes a complete nonsense of the effort we have all been making to ensure that our sittings are open and members of the public can participate."
"I take note of your comments, but this was a decision taken by the Conference of Presidents and confirmed by Parliament."
"Are there any other comments?"
"Madam President, I have to beg your indulgence for the error of my ways, since I failed to sign the attendance register yesterday."
"It is my own fault, but I was hoping that you could perhaps vouch for the fact that I was present, thereby correcting my mistake."
"In any event, I have to apologize, since it is my own fault."
"Madam President, could you express to the British Government the outrage of Members of this House at the treatment meted out to protesters in Garvaghy Road, Portadown, last week and the fact that small sections of the community should bring commercial life in Northern Ireland to a standstill."
"(Parliament approved the Minutes)"
"Decision on urgency"
"Madam President, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture, I would ask all colleagues to vote in favour of this urgent procedure."
"This measure is basically intended to rectify a situation which has been worsening progressively of late."
"In my report on agricultural prices, I proposed a 10 % reduction in setaside, which seemed at the time to diverge significantly from the Commission's proposal."
"Now the Commission is sensibly proposing 5 %, and that is what farmers are now expecting."
"But we must vote on the Gillis report this week, because the Council meeting early next week, on 22 and 23 July, will need to ratify our decision."
"I therefore strongly urge that this report should be adopted during this part-session."
"Is there anyone wishing to speak against?"
"There is not."
"(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)"
"Free movement of persons"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0095/96 by Mr Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive (COM(95)0348 - C4-0357/95-95/0202(COD)) amending Directive 68/360/EEC on the abolition of restrictions on movement and residence within the Community for workers of Member States and their families and Directive 73/148/EEC on the abolition of restrictions on movement and residence within the Community for nationals of Member States with regard to establishment and the provision of services; -A4-0219/96 by Mr Ford, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Directive (COM(95)0347 - C4-0468/95-95/0201(CNS)) on the elimination of controls on persons crossing internal frontiers; -A4-0218/96 by Mr Linzer, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Directive (COM(95)0346 - C4-0420/95-95/0199(CNS)) on the right of third-country nationals to travel in the Community."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, before I start, I should like to make a brief point concerning speaking time. We have come to a slightly different arrangement within our group, to the effect that Mrs Mosiek-Urbahn's speaking time will be split between Mr Nassauer and myself, so that I hope I shall have rather more than five minutes."
"It is a fact that the history of these three proposals goes back a long way."
"The old European Community Treaty already included provisions for the creation of a common internal market in Europe."
"Parliament has consistently expressed the view that this concept obviously includes the right of free movement without frontier controls between the countries of the European Union, or the European Community as it was then."
"For a long time, the Council failed to agree on the issue, and for many years the Commission also shied away from taking the initiative in any move towards practical legislative proposals to abolish frontier controls in Europe."
"The first consequence of this was that a number of Member States took the initiative themselves and, going beyond the Schengen Agreement, created a special set of agreements in parallel, as it were, to the European Treaties, with the result that this internal market goal - the elimination of frontier controls - has now been achieved de facto in at least part of the European Union."
"Several years ago, because the Commission had taken no action, Parliament initiated proceedings against it before the Court of Justice for failure to act."
"Thanks to the cooperation of Commissioner Monti, the new Commission - which was also the first to be confirmed, and to require confirmation, by Parliament - has clearly changed its stance on the issue and has submitted three proposals for directives that aim to finally abolish internal frontier controls within the European Union."
"I wish to make it very clear, at the outset, that we welcome these proposals from the Commission and support the action that it is taking on this issue."
"I have a number of comments on the three proposals. One of them - the subject of my own report - is a proposal from the Commission to amend two existing directives which flow from Article 48 and the following articles of the Treaty, that is to say from the rights of citizens of the European Union."
"The aim is to make provision within the existing legal system for workers and people who wish to exercise the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services, so that in future they cannot be subject to frontier controls when they wish to move within the internal market."
"The other two proposals concern the elimination of controls on persons, and freedom of movement for thirdcountry nationals who are lawfully in the territory of the European Union."
"This follows naturally because it is obvious that, unless they check identity documents, border officials cannot determine whether a person is a third-country national lawfully in the territory of the European Union or a citizen of the European Union."
"As regards my report, it may be useful to make the following additional points on the basis of the discussions that took place in the committees which contributed to it, in particular the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights."
"We have here a directive that is subject to the codecision procedure, a typical internal market directive over which Parliament's powers, since the Maastricht Treaty, are very far-reaching."
"And this is where my report differs from the other two reports that are before us today, because the legal basis of the other two directives is Article 100, and they must be adopted unanimously by the Council, with Parliament merely being consulted."
"We are therefore entitled to effective involvement in the decision on workers' freedom to travel and the exercise of their right of establishment and right to provide services."
"Because we welcome and support these proposals in principle, we should expedite our discussions in Parliament and let the Council have our vote so that a decision on the issue can be reached quickly."
"However, there has now been a new development: since last week, you will have been aware that the Irish presidency has made its own proposal for a draft joint action on the freedom of movement of third-country nationals in the European Union, on the basis of Article K.3."
"I believe this is directly at odds with the Commission's and Parliament's approach to the issue, as regards the legal basis."
"It is our view that the question of eliminating controls in the internal market is quite definitely an internal market issue, and that is why it belongs within the institutional decision-making framework of the European Union and cannot be decided solely by the Council of Ministers through a draft joint action."
"What has happened now creates a new situation, because it is clearly quite bizarre that, alongside the process of opinion-forming and decision-making here in Parliament and earlier in the Commission, the Council should have started to take action on its own initiative, as it were, and obviously with a full knowledge of what is going on elsewhere."
"We must consider how, as a Parliament, we are to react to this situation: whether we can, in fact, vote and decide the issue today, or whether we ought not to refer it back to the committees so that we can then get an opinion from the Council on these new moves by the Irish presidency."
"I should like to make one final comment on my report. A number of amendments have been tabled with a view to having freedom of movement for third-country nationals included in my report as well."
"In my view, this is not legally acceptable, because the legal basis for the Lehne report and the corresponding Commission proposal is Article 48 and subsequent articles of the Treaty, which define citizens' rights."
"For that reason alone, the report cannot be extended to cover third-country nationals."
"For purely legal reasons, the issue cannot be dealt with in this directive, but will have to be addressed by the other two directives."
"Madam President, I should like to say that I am pleased on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs to participate in this joint debate on the Lehne report, my own report on the Council directive on the elimination of controls on persons crossing internal frontiers and on the Linzer report."
"These reports arise directly from the Treaty of Rome which sets out very early a commitment to the free movement of goods, services, capital and people."
"Unfortunately in the European Union, while the first three flow freely, there has been much more resistance to the free movement of people."
"It is absolutely vital for the future of the Union that the people of Europe - if you want the prime group constituting the European Union - be allowed to move freely around the Union itself."
"The Commission has been very tardy in bringing forward proposals in this area; in fact so tardy that this Parliament, during the last Parliamentary session under the urging of Amédée Turner, the British Conservative Chairman of the Civil Liberties Committee, actually took legal action against the Commission because of their failure to act."
"The second result was that because there was a failure to act by the Commission we saw the Council set up the Schengen system, that semi-clandestine organization with no accountability, no reporting back to Parliament which means that free movement has not proceeded in the way that we would like."
"Then, on the very eve of the European Court taking action against the Commission, the new Commission and the new Commissioner, Mr Monti, brought forward these proposals."
"When I first saw them I had my doubts as to whether they constituted a genuine proposal because they were linked to a whole series of accompanying measures which threaten to act as a poison pill such that the proposals would never come into operation."
"Unanimity is required in these areas and the current British Government has said it will not vote in favour of these proposals so that they cannot be implemented."
"The current British Government can, of course, be changed and that is something that may happen in the future."
"But more importantly, in terms of the accompanying measures, the external frontiers directive is linked to the British/Spanish dispute over Gibraltar."
"Despite the clear legal position it is also very obvious that there is no easy solution to this problem."
"When the government and opposition of both Spain and the United Kingdom are so committed to their current position it is not obvious that the external frontiers directive will come into operation early."
"There are similar problems with the Dublin Convention."
"The Socialist Group wants a clear, unadulterated, uncluttered set of proposals that sticks to the fundamental principles of free movement and has no accompanying measures."
"The more the Commission's and Parliament's proposals vary from these clear principles the more difficulty the Socialist Group will have in supporting them."
"Yes, of course we agree that there are other measures that will have to be taken in order for these proposals to operate, but they should flow from an agreement and not precede it."
"We know that the Member States will very rapidly reach an agreement on security and other issues if they have to, but while they can use them as an opportunity to block the proposals we will see no progress."
"I also agree with Mr Lehne on the draft joint action proposal that has come forward in the last few days."
"This has clearly complicated matters and perhaps we need to take all three reports back to committee to see how the new proposal on the draft joint action programme impinges upon them."
"The people of Europe have a right to expect substantial progress in this area."
"The Commission has not given it to us in the clearest possible way."
"We look to the Commission and the Council to proceed, and the Socialist Group - and I hope Parliament - will vote accordingly."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I have the privilege of bringing before the House today a report from the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs on the right of third-country nationals to travel in the Community."
"The aim of the report is, at long last, to enable third-country nationals who are lawfully in a Member State, and family members of European Union citizens who do not have citizenship of a Member State, to travel more easily for short stays in the territory of other Member States."
"I have already established for my report that the Commission proposal will not, in effect, mean any significant change in the situation on the ground."
"Given that virtually no frontier controls are now carried out and, in fact, controls between the Schengen countries have generally been abolished, the real aim of this Commission proposal, which is based on Article 100 of the EC Treaty, is to create an appropriate legal context for a situation that already exists in practice."
"My report is based on one of three Commission proposals referred to the committee, which were drawn up with a view to fulfilling the obligations imposed by Article 7a of the EC Treaty."
"Article 7a deals with the establishment of the internal market by 31 December 1992."
"The internal market was to comprise an area without internal frontiers, in which the free movement of goods, services and capital, as well as what we are talking about today - the free movement of persons - was to be ensured in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty."
"I would remind you that this is 1996, and it is only now that the House is discussing these three Commission proposals for fulfilling the obligations to which I have referred."
"Although it has taken more than three and a half years to bring practical proposals from the Commission before the House, we are grateful that we now have them."
"The only reason that the proposals are now before us, however, is that as long ago as 1993, the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs of the European Parliament took the initiative and gave the Commission a practical incentive to submit proposals by bringing proceedings for failure to act."
"My report is primarily concerned with clarifying the situation and facilitating freedom to travel for third-country nationals who have entered a Member State with a visa and who wish, during their stay there, to make a short visit to another Member State; and also for third-country nationals who have a residence permit in one Member State and wish to visit another."
"In general, the fact that the right of third-country nationals to enter and remain in a Member State, even for a short period, is regulated by the Member States' national legislation - which is neither coordinated nor harmonized - means that individual citizens face further bureaucratic obstacles."
"The effectiveness of the directive therefore depends on removing the link between the exercising of the right to travel and the requirement of citizenship, and building on the principles that residence permits and visas should have equal status and that visas should be mutually recognized."
"I would take this opportunity to emphasize that people will measure the political credibility of the Union by the way the internal market operates, and particularly by the way the free movement of persons is implemented."
"A gap in the overall concept of the internal market will also mean a loss of confidence among the great majority of European citizens."
"Sometimes, however, I cannot help feeling that some of the institutions involved in creating the internal market fail to realize the full weight of their responsibility."
"The approach of the Commission and Council to completing the provisions for the free movement of persons indicates how important it is that the European Parliament should be more closely involved in the legislative process."
"I can only hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will bring Parliament all that it seeks in this respect."
"Who else but ourselves - the democratically elected representatives of the peoples of Europe - can bring the necessary energy to bear in looking after citizens' interests?"
"If, as has been widely reported over the last few weeks, the Commission is making full implementation of the freedom of movement of persons in the European Union contingent on the application of accompanying agreements and measures, particularly as regards asylum and visa regulations for third-country nationals, then its behaviour indicates to me that it has not yet learned the lessons of recent years."
"Clearly, the Commission cannot do without these accompanying measures if it is to have the support of the Member States, but in my view the two sets of issues should be considered separately."
"By approving these proposals for directives, which are intended to give people the right to move freely from one Member State to another, we shall remind the Member States of their duty to turn their attention more actively and effectively towards instruments for implementing these measures."
"Madam President, the proposals of the Commission in this area are to be welcomed."
"Article 48 of the Treaty of Rome laid down a fundamental right for free movement of its citizens."
"This was extended to free movement of persons and the Court of Justice has, in its case-law, extended the rights to free movement."
"This is a very important plank in the achievement of a single market. Therefore, I support the proposals in the Lehne report, which simply extend existing rights."
"I also want to support the Linzer report, giving rights to third country nationals to travel in the Community."
"This is a very new but important right and I know from my own experience in my constituency that this will enhance academic and professional links between the European Union and other countries."
"It has a humane face to it in that it will permit visits to families for weddings, funerals and illnesses."
"It also enhances the cultural links in the European Union."
"Many people want to come to Europe to see our cultural heritage and this I believe is an important part of our economy and also our links with the rest of the world."
"There are no problems for the Member States because this does not impact on employment or on social benefits."
"That is made quite clear in the text and therefore there should be no concerns for Member States."
"It also provides and stresses the right of Member States to remove people who are a public security threat. The safeguards are quite adequate and the words 'or to its international relations' should be excluded."
"Madam President, like other Members I welcome the Commission's three proposals to make a reality out of free movement."
"I see them as a genuine and realistic attempt to achieve long-held and cherished objectives of the European Community."
"I am speaking specifically on the Linzer report on the right of third country nationals to travel."
"The object of this proposal is to harmonize national provisions concerning the right of third country nationals to travel and remain within the territory of the Union."
"At the present time this type of journey is governed by divergent national provisions, most of which require third country nationals legally present in the territory of another Member State to obtain visas."
"This is an insult to third country nationals who are living legally and subject to the proper conditions in the Member State, and some of these nationals can be second or third generation third country nationals."
"For example, in my own country Pakistani and Indian citizens often prefer, for reasons of relations at home, to keep their Pakistani or Indian nationality."
"They will be living in the UK all their lives, yet they have to apply for visas to travel to some Member States of the European Union."
"This situation would be resolved by the Commission proposal, and they would be able to move across frontiers freely in the same conditions as other citizens of the European Union."
"As Ms Oddy has said, this proposal would not involve the right to work or other rights of establishment."
"It is simply a right to travel."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights has two concerns."
"We are worried that the Commission chose to add the words 'threat to its international relations' to the normal grounds for expulsion from a Member State."
"The Treaty has a formulation - which has been tried and tested through the European Court - which allows expulsion for threats to public order or public security, but we have never seen this expression 'threat to international relations' before."
"I hope the Commission will consider withdrawing that phrase as requested both by the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights."
"This would mean that third country nationals, for example, could be expelled simply because a third country complained about their presence in a European Union Member State's territory."
"The Council's recent initiative complicates the matter somewhat."
"On the one hand, we welcome the fact that the Council is showing an interest in this."
"On the other, we regret the fact that it is under Article K.3 and therefore a third pillar matter, weakening the rights of the European Parliament and the European institutions, but we believe it is worth looking seriously at the Council's initiative and we will probably support withdrawing these three reports and referring them back to committee."
"Madam President, I rise to speak as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment in connection with the Ford and Linzer reports."
"Our committee insisted, above all, that it should be made quite clear in the text of both reports that, whilst the Commission proposals on the abolition of controls on individuals at the European Union's internal frontiers are good schemes - the submission of which, though belated, our committee welcomes, since a happy event never comes too late - this does not mean that their provisions can be made subject to the adoption or implementation of accompanying measures relating to the external frontiers convention, or any other measures."
"And our committee welcomes the fact that the relevant amendments have made it quite clear in both the Ford and Linzer reports that the provisions in question constitute a clear obligation on the part of the European Union, which cannot in any way be made subject to such conditions."
"Secondly, the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment wished to stress that the abolition of all controls at internal frontiers must not be an isolated measure, and that - at least as far as the free movement of workers is concerned - other obstacles which continue to exist must also be removed: the failure to complete recognition of diplomas and professional qualifications; the lack of coordination of supplementary social security schemes and special social security schemes; and the absence of Community provisions relating to the direct taxation of migrant workers."
"Our committee has called on the Council and the Commission to adopt the necessary measures to eliminate these obstacles."
"Finally, the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment insisted that the implementation of these provisions be accompanied by an extensive information campaign."
"At present, the Commission is already carrying out an information campaign on the single market."
"It is essential for our citizens to know that these obstacles are being removed - and this requires more than just the publication of this information in the Official Journal."
"There is a need for all citizens to be made aware of these effective measures."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would remind us all of what we have promised, and of the great expectations aroused by Europe's undertaking to introduce freedom of movement for persons by 1 January 1993; it is now July 1996, and this free movement of persons has still not come about."
"This is in clear violation of Article 7a of the Maastricht Treaty, which was endorsed by the Member States; what is more, it is completely illogical in view of the cost/benefit ratio resulting from the lack of free movement for persons."
"It strikes me that our obsolete internal borders are now no longer able to stop anything whatsoever - not goods, not trafficking, nor crime - except poor, honest citizens, who find that they have to show their identity cards every time at our ridiculous, obsolete border checks."
"An additional element is that certain EU Member States have decided, in the form of the Schengen agreement, to go one step further than Article 7a of the Maastricht Treaty, which sanctioned this right to free movement of persons."
"This proves that, in effect, when the political will exists on the part of the Member States, there is indeed free movement of persons, whatever concerns and reservations one might have."
"The Schengen agreement, however, is certainly not a Community initiative, a European initiative; it is the initiative of individual Member States."
"Thus I believe that all the reservations and - let us be frank - the excuses being put forward about the question of accompanying measures should be cast aside."
"The package presented by the Commission goes in the right direction, but in my opinion the accompanying measures are still being used by the Member States as an excuse for their own serious lack of political will."
"I believe that with every day that passes by without the free movement of persons becoming a reality, we are dealing a perhaps irreversible blow to our citizens' hopes of having a real united, federal Europe without all these visas, permits, certificates and red tape which are in practice impeding its development."
"With regard to the opinion assigned to me by the Committee on Civil Liberties, concerning the abolition of restrictions on movement and residence within the Community for workers of Member States and their families, I believe that it is necessary to consider whether the proposal for a directive is comprehensive enough as regards the problem of free movement for nationals of non-member countries who are legally resident, whether they are directly or indirectly entitled; to consider the possibility of issuing a single list of residence permits on the basis of the four or five directives which already exist, duly published in the Official Journal and conferring the right of free movement of persons; to consider whether these entitled persons who are not nationals of a Member State will have the same rights as a Community national; and, finally, to consider whether to introduce an amendment to this end."
"In this context, I too think that the Irish presidency's joint action programme should be scrutinized by Parliament's Committees on Civil Liberties and Legal Affairs."
"Our group will not object if a proposal is made to refer this matter back to committee."
"But, I repeat, Europe cannot take shape without free movement of persons."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when it comes to people, freedom of movement in the European Union is a complicated business."
"Mr Caccavale was quite right to point out that all kinds of things can be transported within this Union, and all kinds of things can move unhindered across the frontiers - which indeed no longer officially exist."
"Only people may not move as freely in the European Union as we would all have wished."
"That is why I should like to remind you of something again today, namely that the European internal market began on 1 January 1993, with fireworks and celebrations throughout the European Union."
"And what were we celebrating?"
"Was it the fact that anyone may now take any product, service or capital holding and move freely with it in the Europe of Fifteen?"
"Yes, that was part of it."
"But we were not - at least my group was not - celebrating the fact that some essential preconditions for the implementation of people's right to move freely in the newly created Europe would still not be met almost four years later."
"So why has this right not yet been implemented?"
"It has not been implemented because a number of Member States - or rather their governments - regard with mistrust the fact that their citizens, and permanent residents in their countries who are not citizens, can move freely in the Union."
"We have heard all kinds of arguments this morning for curtailing this individual liberty."
"But one thing is crystal clear: the overwhelming majority of people who live in our Union - I do not know the exact figures, but we can assume that we are talking about well over 90 % of the population - are honest, upright, decent folk who ought to be able to travel freely from one part of the Union to another, whether they are passport holders of one of the Member States, or citizens of a third country with a permanent address in the Union."
"Why are the governments mistrustful?"
"Why do they continue to restrict these people's freedom of movement because of the criminal activities of a few small groups such as heroin and arms dealers and those who traffic in human beings?"
"Such groups undoubtedly pose real problems, but they cannot justify the continued restriction of freedom of movement."
"It is high time that we made progress - by creating a confidence offensive."
"After the delays which caused the conflict between Parliament and the Council and Commission, we are now debating these reports because of initiatives taken by the Commissioner, who is with us here today: initiatives which, though commendable, are insufficient."
"Now, in the midst of this process, we learn that the body representing the Member States, which are responsible for the delays - namely the Council - has clearly gone behind the backs of Parliament and the Commission once again, by initiating a procedure which seeks to replace everything that we are debating today and in which neither we nor, of course, the Commission will have any part."
"There is only one way for us to respond: we shall request postponement of the vote, pursuant to Rule 129, to give us the opportunity of reconsidering this latest development in committee, as provided for under Rule 60, because it is absolutely unacceptable that the right - and in particular Parliament's right - of democratic participation, which is not extensive at the best of times, should be further thwarted by an attempt, at this stage of our deliberations, to make a mockery of the consultation procedure, in the sense that the Council is ignoring everything that we say here in the House and producing a fait accompli behind our backs."
"In my view, this is something that we cannot accept."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the actual date by which freedom of movement in Europe ought to have been made a reality was 1 January 1993."
"Consequently, according to the Treaty that was signed by all fifteen Member States, what we ought to be doing today is not debating the introduction of freedom of movement, but instead, for example, receiving a report on how it has functioned and deciding what action to take, and how to achieve further progress if possible."
"But we are a long way from that."
"I am not saying that the failure so far to achieve freedom of movement is a breach of the Treaty, but it goes against the intention to which all fifteen Member States put their signature."
"The fact is that the idea was not just to create freedom of movement for services and capital: at this important time, people too should be able to experience Europe in the fullest sense."
"They should be able to travel freely in Europe and to see, as citizens, what they make of this European Union that we have entered into."
"That has not happened."
"And I am not saying that it is the Council, as such, which has prevented it from happening - we must cultivate the habit of taking a rather more critical look at things."
"There are certain Member States that are not fulfilling their obligations under the Treaty."
"It is only a minority of them which are in this position, and the arguments which they employ do not stand up."
"They say that freedom of movement cannot be created just like that, because the internal frontiers have played an important role in combatting crime, for example."
"That is a completely anachronistic position to adopt, ladies and gentlemen."
"It is an untenable position nowadays for any expert on the subject."
"It is quite ridiculous to claim that crime cannot be effectively combatted without frontier controls."
"If that were the case - if frontier controls were really necessary for combatting crime - we should have to reintroduce them between Bavaria and Hesse, for example."
"Such a thing is unthinkable."
"Nowadays, criminal activity needs to be tackled using quite different instruments - Interpol, for example, and the data bases that are to be installed there."
"That is the modern way to combat crime - and, amazingly, its implementation is being delayed by precisely the same countries that are denying us freedom of movement on the scale sought by the Treaties."
"One of the catchphrases is 'accompanying measures' ."
"It is true that the Council still has some homework to do before freedom of movement can become a reality."
"It is true that frontier controls cannot simply be abolished without putting some alternative options in place."
"The external frontiers must be secured."
"It must be clear, in future, that by crossing an external frontier into a Member State of the European Union, a person acquires freedom of movement throughout the Union."
"This means that the country which allows a person to enter across its external frontier also becomes responsible for that person's freedom of movement in the Union as a whole."
"It should be noted here that we seek this freedom of movement not only for citizens of the European Union, but also for citizens of third countries who are legally resident in the Union."
"There is really no other concept of freedom of movement."
"We cannot have a two-tier system of freedom of movement in Europe; freedom of movement must be enjoyed by everyone who is legally in the European Union."
"It seems strange in this situation that, just when the Commission is doing what Parliament asked it to do by submitting appropriate proposals - and Commissioner Monti's proposals have our unqualified support - and just when we are reaching a position on those proposals, some entirely new ideas should be published in Council circles."
"I do not intend, at this point, to discuss institutional developments, but it is very clear indeed that the first thing we need to know now is what the Council is actually seeking."
"That is why I am convinced that we cannot come to any conclusion until the Council supplies us with some information as regards what it is really up to with its new joint action."
"We wish everyone in Europe to have freedom of movement as soon as possible, and those whose fault it is that such freedom is not yet in place must now be called to account."
"Madam President, the three proposals for directives now before us are the Commission's response to the proceedings brought against it by Parliament in the European Court of Justice for its failure to act in the field of the free movement of persons within the European Union."
"Realizing that these proposals touch on important issues in the fields of immigration and internal security, the Commission has written into them accompanying measures which it regards as essential for maintaining a high level of security in an area without internal frontiers."
"However, the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs has not only rejected an amendment by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, the aim of which was to provide a list of these accompanying measures, but has also adopted amendments stating that the free movement of persons cannot be made contingent on the implementation of those measures."
"One could therefore be forgiven for wondering if these amendments are simply demagogic."
"The adoption of these proposals for directives requires unanimity in the Council."
"And certain Member States, for a variety of reasons, are not prepared to call into question these accompanying measures, which fall under the third pillar."
"Using the powers conferred on it by Article K.3(2), the Commission could have cooperated with the Member States - if Parliament had not served notice on it, as it were - to achieve the free movement of persons within a negotiating framework acceptable to all parties."
"Furthermore, in its report on the draft directive on the abolition of restrictions on movement and residence within the Community for nationals of Member States with regard to establishment and the provision of services, the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights proposes the deletion of Article 3(3), for the reason that it conflicts with Article 6 of the EC Treaty, which prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality."
"However, possession of an identity card may also be considered as a means of citizens' protection: it is proof of their entitlement to exercise a right."
"Possession of an identity card or travel document is one of the fundamental freedoms to which people living under the yoke of dictatorship aspire."
"Possession of an identity card is the best means of protection against arbitrary treatment for the Union's citizens."
"Madam President, this debate concerns one of the fundamental aspects of the European Union: the free movement of persons."
"As other speakers have pointed out, we should have had a completely open internal market with freedom of movement for goods, services, capital and people by the end of 1992."
"But this did not happen."
"We had freedom of movement for goods, services and capital, but not for people."
"You can see this if you go to the United Kingdom, to mention just one example, where there are still immigration controls under the old legislation, European Union or no European Union."
"So what we are talking about here is the move from a financial Union to a citizens' Union."
"It is absolutely ridiculous that it has taken us until now, in 1996, to hold such a debate, when the planned measures should have been introduced by 1992 at the latest."
"The previous Commission was wrong not to put any proposals forward, and the European Parliament was even forced to bring a case against it before the Court of Justice, which is the most serious step you can take under our European system of law."
"Now, at last, the present Commission has finally come up with some proposals, too late, of course, but now that we have them, the Liberal Group feels that they should be examined on their merits."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party supports the proposal for a directive on the right to travel of nationals of non-member countries who are legally established in the Union."
"Such people - many Turks and Moroccans, for example - currently need a visa to be able to travel within the European Union, causing them great inconvenience, and a solution to this problem is therefore most welcome."
"The proposed directive on the elimination of controls on persons crossing internal frontiers is really what this debate is all about."
"We know that the Commission's idea here is that the internal frontiers have to come down throughout the whole of the European Union, but that before this happens - and I am paraphrasing the Commission's argument here - we need to take a series of measures to deal with any unwelcome consequences, such as the spread of crime and illegal immigration."
"Then there are accompanying measures on improving the policing of our external borders, the division of responsibilities in asylum policy, a common visa policy and data exchanges through a European information system."
"The Liberal Group finds it entirely understandable that these various measures and the directives before us should be linked in this way, because people want to see border controls abolished, but they also want measures to be taken to prevent any increase in crime."
"As a representative of the people, I think that the national governments are at fault here."
"The Dublin Treaty on asylum policy has been in the pipeline for years and still has not come into force."
"Equally deplorably, the external frontiers convention has been ready for the last five years, but has not been introduced because of differences between the United Kingdom and Spain over Gibraltar."
"This is extremely regrettable."
"The ELDR Group feels that the European Parliament must adopt a clear position here."
"The Maastricht Treaty does not link the free movement of persons to any conditions, and there can be no question of introducing legislation to link the removal of the internal borders to measures to combat crime and illegal immigration."
"But there is a political connection between the two issues, and it is up to the national governments to take the necessary measures as quickly as possible."
"Today, Parliament must consider what it really wants."
"Do we want to haggle over principles, refusing to consider accompanying measures, but knowing that we will then end up with a decision that gets us nowhere, or do we really want freedom of movement to be introduced?"
"In our view, we have to be realistic."
"The Commission and Parliament must join forces in sending a message to the Council of Ministers that freedom of movement needs to be introduced, and it needs to be introduced quickly."
"If the Council then fails to do so, it will have to account for its actions in public."
"Madam President, I should like to make a number of comments on the three proposals for directives."
"The first is that Parliament's position has always been that, in order to make the free movement of persons a reality, all restrictions on travel and residence must be removed."
"In the particular case of workers and their families, the Member States have an obligation to eliminate controls at internal frontiers."
"However, the corresponding Commission proposal makes a right enshrined in the Treaties subject to new conditions, on the grounds that accompanying measures must be introduced in order to make possible the abolition of these controls."
"This is unacceptable, to the extent that it means, in practice, postponing the elimination of controls at internal frontiers - in other words, maintaining surreptitiously precisely that which we are purporting to abolish."
"Implementation of the Schengen Convention has demonstrated that it is quite possible to eliminate controls without introducing accompanying measures; and to promote such measures is to undermine the right to free movement."
"We are opposed to that."
"We must not acknowledge a legal link between the abolition of controls on persons and the accompanying measures."
"Turning now to other matters, the single market comprises an area without internal frontiers. This implies that the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is guaranteed."
"Consequently, anyone who is legally present in the Community must have the right to travel within it without any kind of restriction or discrimination."
"It should be borne in mind that Articles 3 and 7a refer to the free movement of persons, not of citizens."
"It therefore seems inconsistent to impose on third-country nationals who are in possession of a valid residence permit or travel document the obligation to report their presence."
"Such treatment is discriminatory."
"The Union must recognize the right of third-country nationals who are legally resident in the Community to travel within it under the same conditions as Community nationals."
"Otherwise, there will be an inconsistency between the free movement of capital and goods and that of persons."
"As a final comment, the proposals for directives make the right to free movement contingent upon preconditions which do not appear in the Treaty, although the abolition of controls is a clear and unconditional obligation on the part of the Union."
"Furthermore, the possibility of suspending application of the directives cannot be left to the discretion of the individual Member States - in particular, since matters concerning the free movement of goods and capital do not fall within their sphere of competence."
"Such an approach will undermine the Union's political credibility."
"The free movement of persons contributes to the meeting of cultures and the development of democracy."
"Whatever safeguards are needed must be implemented, not at the Community's internal frontiers, but at its external frontiers, by means of the instruments which are already available to us - and with a view to combatting drug trafficking and organized crime, not to harassing those who are legally resident in the European Union."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what we were promised was open frontiers, unrestricted freedom of movement, and no more controls."
"How often have we heard it said that Europe was a single territory?"
"But that was - and is - a lie."
"No other European promise has been broken so often as the promise of a frontier-free Europe."
"Now, as we consider three proposals for directives and we learn what the Council is getting up to behind the scenes, it is not the old idea of Europe that is becoming a reality, but the old lie."
"The fact is - and many speakers have made the point - that the crucial Article, Article 7a, states in black and white that as from 31 December 1992, the internal market is to be an area without internal frontiers: with no ifs or buts, no restrictions, no so-called accompanying measures, no delays, and no directives that seek to qualify the process or call it into question."
"It is now patently obvious that the order of priorities in Europe today is: goods first, then services, then capital."
"Those are the only priorities - or if people are a priority, it is only some people, not all of them."
"Is this a viable way for Europe to function?"
"No, it is not, because the frontier-free market must apply not only to prunes and potatoes, but also to people!"
"Since 1 January 1993, we have been bending an article of the Treaty."
"That article is becoming meaningless."
"Article 7a is being breached, because controls are still in operation, from London to Athens and from Stockholm to Munich."
"The governments of Europe have adopted a take-it-or-leave-it attitude to the old legal principle that pacta sunt servanda ."
"However, that cannot be our position, nor should it be the position of the Commission."
"But in the case of freedom of movement, the Commission has failed to perform its most specific task."
"Instead of being the guardian of the Treaties, it runs the risk of becoming nothing more than the Council's henchman."
"Moreover, if the collective might of the Council is now being brought to bear in an attempt to instil fear into Europe, if the fear of immigration outweighs the right of freedom of movement, then Europe's spell will be broken, and we shall pay dearly for that!"
"We are against referral back to committee, because we think it is high time that Parliament took a stand and made its position clear to the Council and Commission."
"Madam President, the object of this exercise is to determine, through examining the question of the free movement of persons, whether or not the will exists to build a genuinely united Europe - to act, that is, in accordance with the Treaty on European Union, which defines the Union as an area without internal frontiers."
"Following the legal episodes of which we are aware, the Commission has the credit of moving our endless task forward once again."
"I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Commissioner Monti for his prudence and courage, even if this initiative does not go as far as our group would wish."
"But let it be quite clear that, at present, the Member States, the national governments - or rather certain Member States and national governments which are not really in favour of European integration - would have us share their irrational fear of immigration, which is wrongly blamed for all the ills of our society."
"The need to safeguard the Union's security is put forward as an argument for restricting freedom of movement."
"But freedom and security go hand in hand."
"Let us take care to ensure that, following the example of a certain Middle Eastern country in which the obsession with security is resulting in the peace process being brought to a halt - a country which nevertheless remains a friend - the need to safeguard the Union's security is not allowed to serve as a pretext for those who do not wish the European Union to move forward."
"Lastly, I wish to express my support for Mr Ford's conclusions to the effect that, without banging its fist on the table, Parliament must be clear and unequivocal in its intention to defend the free movement of persons, and that no legal link must be established between the elimination of controls on persons and the accompanying measures, which must not become a barrier to the exercise of our most valuable asset, namely freedom."
"Madam President, this debate today is surreal."
"Just when the Member States are struggling to combat the problems of drug trafficking and illegal immigration, the European Parliament is dealing with a number of proposals for directives aimed at eliminating throughout the European Union all controls on persons at internal frontiers, whether those travelling are Community nationals or nationals of third countries."
"The Commission tells us bluntly that, whatever the circumstances, the elimination of controls is 'an unconditional obligation which derives from Article 7a of the Treaty' , and that it must dismantle all controls at internal frontiers, ' whatever their form, and whatever their justification' ."
"You heard correctly: ' whatever their justification' ."
"We are unable to agree with this extremist approach to the abolition of border controls, for a number of reasons."
"Firstly, Article 7a, which provides for the creation of an area without internal frontiers, was, like the Schengen agreements, conceived at a time when the pressure of economic migration was not as great as it is today, and moreover when the Union's eastern border was formed by the Iron Curtain."
"Secondly, within the Union itself, illegal trafficking - especially of drugs - has increased."
"And the fixed controls at internal borders have a part to play in stopping this trafficking, as the recent seizure of 106 kilograms of heroin at Calais, with the help of a French customs scanner - an instrument which is, by definition, fixed - has just made clear."
"Thirdly, the Member States must retain control of their territory, in order to be able to exercise the national rights which a number of Treaty articles - for example, Articles 36, 48 and 100a - rightly recognize them to have. And lastly, Article 7a is not entirely unambiguous - although, contrary to what Mrs Roth just said, it was accompanied by an explanatory statement - and in any event, it must be interpreted sensibly."
"No: freedom of movement is not hindered by appropriate controls at the Union's internal frontiers; on the contrary, those controls serve to protect our citizens' freedoms!"
"The proposals for directives which the Commission is presenting to us today are therefore totally inappropriate."
"Not only must the Council reject them, but the Intergovernmental Conference must rewrite Article 7a. Furthermore, the Member States must agree not to eliminate the controls at the Union's internal frontiers, but to improve them, supplementing the concept of fixed controls with that of a territorial filtering strip - as proposed, in France, in the recent report by Senator Paul Masson."
"However, today's debate seems even more surreal when we consider that it is taking place against the background of the 'mad cow' crisis, in the context of which the Commission stands accused of having sacrificed public health on the altar of the dogmatic objectives of free movement at any price."
"The situation with regard to these directives on the abolition of the Union's internal frontiers is exactly parallel."
"If they are adopted, they will give rise to a serious deficit in security - and, in ten years' time, Mr Santer's successor will come to this House to explain that is not the Commission's fault, since public security has always been its top priority."
"That is not true: it is clear from this debate that the Commission's priority is not safeguarding public health or security, but above all promoting the fusion of the peoples of Europe, notably by eliminating the Union's internal frontiers!"
"Madam President, do you by any chance have any explanation to give me about the request I made as Chair of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs for the Council to attend this debate?"
"I imagine that you have no explanation to give me because, of course, the Council did not even bother to answer our request."
"But it is a shame that it should not be here."
"Madam President, regardless of the fates which these directives might be reserved a word of thanks to Commissioner Monti and Rapporteurs Ford and Linzer on the excellent work they have carried out so far."
"Madam President, the situation which we are experiencing now in this House in respect of these reports and the initiative by Commissioner Monti on the freedom of movement is, thanks to the Council, quite awful from an ethical point of view and an attack on the European Parliament's rights from an institutional point of view."
"When finally after many years of doing nothing the Commission finally presented the European Parliament with three proposals for directives aimed at creating an internal market for persons and the European Parliament, as a consequence and following a number of months of debate, laboriously expressed its opinion, look what the Council did, on the sidelines of the legislative process enshrined in the first pillar, without letting the European Parliament know and without the slightest respect for the work it carries out: it has now taken a parallel initiative based on intergovernmental logic with scant regard for the efforts of the Commission and this House to achieve the first of all Community freedoms: the freedom of movement."
"In the corridors and without any transparency or any parliamentary control, both at European and national levels, the Council is preparing - in the very week in which our Plenary is taking place and dealing with hope and seriousness with a fundamental legislative package for European citizens - to empty of any meaning the Commission initiative and the Parliament opinion and offer citizens an empty charade of legislation packaged up in a joint action by the Council."
"Madam President, this incident is one of the most serious and gross violations of inter-institutional dialogue."
"That is why we will no longer take part in this farce and will not discuss or vote for anything at all since we know, farce and hypocrisy aside, that our work over lengthy months of discussions is destined quite simply for the rubbish bin."
"We refuse to take part in any legislative clowning of which Machiavelli himself would be proud without the slightest honour and very little glory, when the sole objective of the manoeuvre is to make legally ineffective the rights, enshrined by the Single Act, which the Commission and Parliament wish to offer citizens residing in the European Union."
"Madam President, the challenge has been thrown down and the accusation has been made."
"The Council has been acting behind the backs of the Commission and the European Parliament in bad faith."
"We are owed an explanation, a justification, a notice and some information. We are at least owed a posture of seriousness."
"Either the Council should do so very quickly and make all of its proposals quite clear or the European Parliament should use all political and legal means possible to denounce or to confront the Council and to make it assume its responsibility."
"We will wait as long as is necessary and until this takes place we think that trust has been broken in the very minimum of interinstitutional ethics. Everything in its place."
"The Council must show transparency in everything it does in its aims and responsibilities and, for our part, we know what we want: to abide by the rules and turn European citizenship into something practical while respecting the Treaty."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as other speakers have already said, there are four freedoms in the internal market."
"Three are geared to economic interests, whilst one is the focus of popular expectation in Europe."
"Three of them - the economic freedoms - have been achieved, but the free movement of persons has not become a reality."
"I wish to know why this should be?"
"We are told that freedom for people represents a greater risk."
"But is that really true, if one considers the environmental risks involved in freedom of movement for goods, in the explosive upturn in mobility, the waste of energy and the excessive division of labour in Europe?"
"Goods have to be given free access to markets, even if they do not meet the standards or conform to the traditions or safety expectations of the Member States."
"But we are told that it is people who represent the risk."
"On the contrary, we are facing much greater risks as a result of the free movement of goods, currencies and services."
"Many people are prepared to tolerate those risks only because of the promise to introduce free movement of persons."
"By delaying and failing to fully implement freedom of movement of persons, the Union is denying the rights of its own people."
"To restrict freedom of travel to citizens of the Union, and to continue to make it difficult even for them, is to deny Europe's openness to the world."
"It means that the fears of a Fortress Europe are being borne out by Union policy."
"This is a policy that is based not on people's needs but on fear of people, a policy geared not towards cultural openness in Europe but towards total control of the population, a policy that divides, rather than unites Europe."
"Madam President, freedom to travel is probably the most important element in creating the internal market as an area without internal frontiers."
"Implementing this fundamental freedom will meet the expectations of many citizens of the Member States."
"For several decades, the people of the former communist countries were denied the fundamental freedom to travel."
"It is therefore all the more important that no one - and particularly not those people - should be treated as a second-class citizen within the Union, not least at the internal frontiers."
"Amongst the measures needed to counter any possible increase in crime after the removal of all the controls, and to prevent illegal immigration by third-country nationals who are already in the Union illegally, are more intensive cooperation by police forces and social services, and the effective exchange of information through Europol."
"Madam President, only last month an elderly woman of 76 was, in my view, illegally arrested on a train from London to Brussels, held overnight in a cell and put back on a train the following day because it was alleged that she had not brought with her what was claimed by the Belgian authorities to be a necessary document, namely a passport."
"I believe that woman should consider very seriously taking action as an individual citizen for illegal imprisonment."
"That being the case, the key to free movement is probably going to be individual European Union citizens taking actions by themselves rather than relying on the Commission or Member States to ensure that we have free movement."
"I believe that free movement is not an objective of the Treaty but is a fundamental, constitutional right."
"That is something without which the European Union cannot operate."
"Therefore, if individual citizens are in a position to enforce Article 7a either directly or indirectly then the free movement will be enhanced."
"The court case against the Commission by Parliament was not so much a mistake but should have been carried through to adjudication because it was said that the Monti proposals which flowed from that court case were in some way a kind of compromise and a way forward."
"The so-called accompanying measures and the Schengen Agreement are both excuses for trying to avoid the central issue of Article 7a. If it is said that the so-called Monti proposals brought forward now will be vetoed in the Council of Ministers, that does not mean the end of all of this, that Article 7a somehow disappears."
"It remains an obligation under which the Commission has to work and it remains something on which the Commission has to take action."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has always adopted a very clear position on the issue of the free movement of persons, based on two principles to which other speakers have referred."
"Firstly, the free movement of persons is an obligation under the Treaty which should have been carried out by 31 December 1992 at the latest, without any preconditions."
"Secondly, when we talk about persons, we mean all those legally resident in the Member States, and this has to include the 13 to 14 million nationals of third countries who have been living and working here for years, because we will not tolerate discrimination, and in any case restricting freedom of movement to EU nationals alone would be a nonsense in practical terms."
"The Commission has, at long last, come round to our point of view and has produced these three directives, which are supposed to establish - three years too late - one of the few basic rights which people in the European Union have under the Treaty."
"But the same parties who included the free movement of persons in the Treaty - the national governments - are now increasingly fighting shy of it and turning the whole issue into one of national security, afraid of their own shadows."
"They are throwing more and more obstacles in its path, linking it to technical measures which then become legal requirements for the abolition of the internal frontiers."
"The House rejects this position."
"But now things really have gone too far, and this proposal from the Council for a joint action on the right to travel of nationals of non-member countries who are lawfully residing in a Member State, under Article K.3, the third pillar, is an extremely provocative one both for the Commission and for this House."
"Is Parliament supposed to be pleased that nationals of non-member countries are finally to have the right to travel?"
"We are far from happy, in the first place because this joint action institutionalizes discrimination once and for all between citizens of the European Union and those from non-member countries, and it implies that those referred to in Article 7a of the Treaty can apparently only be citizens of the European Union."
"Secondly, it also means the end for freedom of movement as a Community issue."
"The next step will be a Schengen protocol in the Treaty and the abolition of Article 7a after the forthcoming IGC."
"The Commission, the European Parliament and the Court of Justice will be completely sidelined."
"It is a slap in the face not just for this House, but also for the people of the European Union, who do not want to see either Parliament or the Commission being walked over in this way."
"Madam President, I am sure we will all support the aims and principles of these reports."
"But the difficulties that clearly exist in the European Union at the moment in relation to these matters are due to the fact that when Heads of Government get together on various occasions there are often hidden agendas, and what seems to be agreed on paper is not always what they really intend to do: the result is that the free movement of peoples is the one area in which we have made very little progress in relation to the other freedoms."
"I wish to speak mainly in relation to the Linzer report and I very much welcome some of the changes that have been made by way of amendment."
"In particular, I want to stress the importance of the amendment to remove the reference in the report and in the Commission proposals to the right of Member States to expel third country nationals, not only if they represent a threat to public order or public security but also if they represent a threat to Member States' international relations."
"This is a very dangerous proposal; it has been exploited by certain governments - including my own - to expel people who are protesting about the denial of human rights and the very serious problems in certain countries in the world which have obnoxious, racist and militaristic regimes."
"These people have been threatened with expulsion owing to their activities in drawing world attention to these problems because the country concerned fears that that will affect its trade, or some other aspect of its relations."
"That should not be a major factor, and I very much welcome these proposals."
"Finally, there are certain difficulties for the British Labour Members in relation to these reports, and we will have to await the outcome of the vote on the various amendments before deciding whether we can or not support them, or whether we may have to abstain."
"Madam President, I can understand that there are some people who are starting to become impatient to do away with the controls at the internal borders, but we have to realize that, for good reason, it is precisely this part of the internal market which is the hardest to put into effect."
"We need to be realistic."
"We cannot open the borders until passage across the external frontiers and the rules on asylum and visas have been settled."
"Borders are a sensitive matter."
"National frontiers are a central part of many people's consciousness."
"The population is simply not prepared to accept the consequences of the absence of border controls."
"Whether it involves trafficking in drugs, human beings or waste which is hazardous to the environment, things will not have to go wrong many times before the EU loses credibility and is accused of doing more harm than good."
"Furthermore, many people in Denmark are employed to carry out border controls, and we shall also have the problem of explaining things to them."
"I should like to see a Europe without borders or border controls, but I cannot accept it if the result is that there are simply more police on the streets carrying out spot checks to make sure that people's papers are in order."
"That is what the consequences will be if we do not remain calm, but plunge headlong into open borders in Europe."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by offering sincere thanks to the various parliamentary committees, and in particular their rapporteurs, whose work has highlighted the key aspects involved in achieving the objective of Article 7a of the Treaty."
"Reading the reports, one gains a sense of unfulfilled hopes and of frustration, together with an impatient wish for political decision-makers to ensure that the single market becomes a reality in terms of free movement for persons, as is already the case for goods, services and capital."
"I must say that when I arrived at the Commission in January 1995 and assumed responsibility for the single market, I immediately found it unacceptable that three of the four freedoms had been achieved - or nearly so - but not the one of greatest relevance to persons."
"That is why, back in July 1995, I had the Commission adopt the proposals now before Parliament."
"I can only share the feelings expressed by a majority in this House."
"What does an individual or society usually do when it wishes to take action?"
"It sets itself a goal, an objective, and decides on the means by which to achieve it."
"But what are we seeing today?"
"There is no certainty about the objective of Article 7a of the Treaty, nor is there agreement on the best means of achieving it; and this has been the case for nearly ten years now, in other words ever since the start of the work leading to the adoption of the Single European Act."
"Why has the Schengen agreement enabled progress to be made in this area, whilst the Union has been marking time?"
"Quite simply, because the countries belonging to Schengen agree both on the objective and the appropriate means of achieving it."
"In our case, the objective itself is rejected by at least one Member State."
"As to the means, opinions differ widely: the question of the legal basis is endlessly discussed, but the reality is that one detects certain fears regarding the institutional foundations of the first pillar - the involvement of Parliament and the Court of Justice, and the role of the Commission."
"Could it be that these foundations, so vital for democracy and the rule of law, are irreconcilable with the safeguarding of public order and security?"
"Certainly not, in my view."
"This does not mean to say that I cannot understand the concerns which have been expressed by the Home Affairs Ministers."
"The free movement of persons inevitably raises questions of security and public order which must not be underestimated."
"But having listened to you, and having participated in the initial discussions in the Council - in its 'internal market' and 'justice and home affairs' configurations - I have become convinced that the Commission's chosen approach is indeed able to meet the various requirements."
"I would make an appeal to the House, if I may, as it comes to vote on the amendments to the Commission's proposal."
"Let us concentrate on the essential points in that proposal, those aspects which are designed to send a strong message to our citizens: yes, Article 7a can and must become a reality; yes, the means that are proposed are reasonable; yes, the legal bases of the so-called first pillar are relevant; and yes, the accompanying measures are appropriate, but any further delay in adopting them is unacceptable."
"For this reason, the Commission will accept only those amendments whose purpose is to safeguard the legal basis of the proposals, in the Community's best interests, and to improve or clarify the wording in keeping with the logic and discipline of the proposed texts."
"With regard to the proposal for a directive on the elimination of controls on persons crossing the internal frontiers, the Commission was concerned, as I have already said, to make it clear that it did not intend to promote freedom to the detriment of security."
"So I deny that there is any intention to make the accompanying measures and the actual elimination of intra-Community controls contingent on one another."
"There is a link, however, and it is more political than legal in nature, since our citizens do have concerns about security."
"The Commission therefore cannot accept those amendments which eliminate all links between these two aspects: freedom on the one hand, and security on the other."
"I fear that by removing this link, we would not actually be doing anything to help achieve freedom of movement."
"The Commission can accept four of the other five amendments, in other words Amendments Nos 1, 2, 5 and 6, since they are aimed at consolidating the legal basis of the proposal."
"With regard to the proposal for a directive on the adaptation of secondary legislation applicable to EU citizens and members of their families, this is a technical adaptation which can be introduced once internal border controls have been abolished."
"The only amendment contained in Mr Lehne's report seems to me to overstep this particular mark, and I am unable to accept it."
"Finally, as regards the proposal for a directive on the right of third-country nationals to travel within the Community, the Commission intends to accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 5, 9 and part of Amendment No 10, as well as Amendments Nos 15 and 18."
"There is no need to remind the House that this proposal has been subject to particular scrutiny in the Council, no doubt for two reasons: firstly, the part of the proposal for a directive concerning the equivalence between residence permits and visas, for people who are resident in a Member State of the Union, could be adopted and enter into force even before internal border controls have been eliminated; and, secondly, this is the proposal which best lends itself, in terms of its legal basis, to being transferred from the first to the third pillar."
"Here we should be careful not to detract from the traditional objectives and instruments of the Treaty, and even from the Schengen agreement which - let us not forget - already confers an absolute right to travel."
"I think that all the legal and political implications of this very sensitive problem need to be assessed carefully."
"I shall conclude by recalling once again what I hope goes without saying for all of us: free movement within the Union must be indistinguishable from free movement within our countries."
"Like goods, services and capital, persons too should be able to move around freely."
"We are duty-bound to achieve this goal, but we shall only be able to do so if all internal border controls are eliminated."
"Let me end, Madam President, by referring to what has been highlighted by various speakers, namely the initiative by the presidency."
"In the course of Council business, the presidency put forward an initiative of its own at the meeting of Steering Group I on 8 and 9 July."
"It should come as no surprise that the College of Commissioners has not yet had an opportunity to adopt a position, and that I am consequently unable to inform you of the Commission's stance on this matter."
"However, in view of the importance which I attach to this problem, I admit that this new initiative worries me personally for more than one reason."
"In fact, my concerns are threefold, and relate both to the link with our proposal for a directive on the right to travel, and to the content of the initiative and its legal basis."
"Starting with the legal basis, I would recall that the Commission has always felt that the proposal on the right to travel is so inextricably linked with the question of the single market that the only appropriate legal basis is Article 100 of the Treaty."
"I believe Parliament shares this point of view, especially since that legal basis is the one which preserves its prerogatives."
"I admit that I am concerned about the content of the presidency's initiative, and above all about its scope: the joint action programme is in fact confined to facilitating movement and does not confer the right to travel."
"In reality it will merely allow a third-country citizen to present himself at the border, armed with a residence permit but without a visa."
"This will not confer upon him the right to enter the territory of the other Member State; thus he will run the risk of arbitrary expulsion and, what is worse, without the grounds for refusal of entry being subject to legal scrutiny by the Court of Justice."
"Furthermore, this is a step back from the Schengen Convention, which already confers this right to travel."
"In addition, the absence of the right of entry implies a need to maintain controls at internal borders, in order to check whether entry onto that territory can be authorized."
"So, from a proposal for a directive whose purpose is to abolish controls at internal borders, we are moving to a legal instrument which will make it essential to keep those same controls in place."
"In conclusion, I wish to stress that the thoughts which I have expressed thus far about this presidency initiative commit no one but myself."
"Nevertheless, I shall not hesitate to make my concerns known to all my fellow Commissioners, inviting them to determine as soon as possible the strategy to be followed."
"For my part, I would invite you, the European Parliament, to determine your own clear position on this problem."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was suspended at 10.40 a.m. and resumed at 10.50 a.m.)"
"Commission statement on BSE"
"The next item is the statement by the Commission on its information policy on BSE since 1988 and measures it has taken to ensure compliance with the export ban and eradicate the disease."
"I give the floor to Mr Santer, President of the Commission."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, BSE is a serious matter."
"The Commission has treated it as such from the outset, and I myself have resolved to treat it as such."
"Since March, I have personally involved myself in this matter."
"You know my position, and that of the Commission."
"Public health is our prime concern, and scientific evidence is our only guide."
"It is on the basis of this approach that the Commission defines its measures, and that on 27 March it adopted a strategy for confining the disease."
"This strategy has been clearly endorsed by both the European Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance."
"By rejecting the British Government's appeal for the lifting of the ban, the Court explicitly confirmed the Commission's steadfast position."
"It clearly underlined the fact that the export ban forms part of a strategy in which overwhelming importance is attached to the protection of public health."
"I would add that the general action plan to eradicate BSE, which was proposed by the Commission and made an agreement possible in Florence, also establishes a direct link between any resumption of exports and the elimination of all risks to human health."
"In addressing this issue, the Commission has never concealed its guiding principles."
"I see absolutely no reason why it would have carried out a policy of disinformation on such a sensitive issue."
"I admit that the discovery of the note by a Commission official of October 1990, which appeared to lend credence to the theory of a disinformation strategy, did cause me great concern - a concern which I made clear to you, moreover, at the time of my last appearance before the European Parliament, in Brussels in May."
"Rather than over-reacting and indulging in conspiracy theories, however, I immediately sought an explanation, since what this note suggests is directly at odds with what I have observed since I have been at the head of the Commission."
"As you requested, Mr President, I am prepared to submit the results of our investigations to the House today."
"In this way, I hope to be able to demonstrate that the various reports which Members may have read or heard recently give a totally distorted image of the Commission's action."
"What is the situation, therefore?"
"Mr Castille's memorandum was an unrecorded note for the file."
"Furthermore, it was not a minute of the meeting, but a personal opinion."
"It was not addressed to either the Commissioner with responsibility for consumer protection or - with all the more reason - to the Commission as a whole."
"In his note, Mr Castille refers, and I quote, to 'the representatives of the Commission' ."
"The Deputy Director-General responsible for veterinary services, who attended the meeting of the Standing Veterinary Committee on that day, has confirmed to us that he personally said nothing at that or any other meeting which could be interpreted as the outline of a disinformation policy to be conducted by the Commission."
"He has also said that he never heard any of his colleagues make remarks along those lines. In order to be absolutely clear, moreover, at the last meeting of the Veterinary Committee, we asked the Member States' delegations - since the committee is composed of representatives of the Member States - to give their version of events."
"The Danish delegate, the only delegate to have been personally present at the meeting of October 1990 - six years ago, that is - stated that at no time did the Commission ask the United Kingdom not to publish the results of its research."
"She also stressed that the interpretation contained in the note by Mr Castille is totally contrary to the substance and spirit of the Standing Veterinary Committee's discussions and does not reflect the Commission's approach."
"The Danish delegate's comments are borne out by the notes of the Irish delegation."
"The other delegations stated that the BSE issue has never been addressed in this way, either by the Commission or by the Member States' representatives in the Veterinary Committee."
"The Italian delegation went so far as to say that if such an approach had been proposed by the Commission, it would have been forcibly rejected by the Member States."
"That much is clear, I believe."
"That is the extent of the information which I have been able to obtain concerning a meeting which took place six years ago."
"In any event, the Commission should be judged on its actions."
"In fact, less than a month after the infamous meeting of the Veterinary Committee in 1990, the Commission organized a scientific conference of an unprecedented size, at which 200 of the most illustrious members of the scientific community from throughout the world were gathered together, precisely in order to examine the problem of BSE. And this conference gave an undeniable boost to research into BSE."
"If we are now starting to have adequate scientific data at our disposal - some of which gave rise to the current crisis, and some of which are enabling us to find solutions - it is partly thanks to the impetus provided by this conference."
"Does organizing a conference of this kind and publishing its results in their entirety, ladies and gentlemen, constitute a disinformation strategy?"
"I do not intend to review at present what has been done since 1990 to combat BSE."
"The Commission has systematically based its proposed measures on the best available scientific advice."
"And whenever new elements have appeared, the Commission has taken them - and will continue to take them - into account."
"I would stress that we are faced with a complex and complicated problem, with regard to which there are - unfortunately - still no absolute scientific certainties."
"I come now to a second matter which has caused a great deal of concern."
"I refer to the suspicions regarding the illegal export of British beef."
"It goes without saying that such exports would be fraudulent."
"Consequently, this matter must be taken extremely seriously."
"In this context too, however, we must not be carried away by emotion."
"We must get to the bottom of things."
"And that is what the Commission is doing."
"We have written to Mr Seehofer, the German Health Minister, to ascertain his reasons for notifying the ministers of the German Länder ."
"We have written to all the Agriculture Ministers in the Union, calling on them to exercise increased vigilance."
"We have also asked them to carry out inquiries and forward all useful information on this subject to the Commission."
"My colleague, Mr Fischler, has interceded with his British counterpart in order to make sure that the UK authorities are ensuring full compliance with the export ban."
"Lastly, we have instructed our own antifraud unit, UCLAF, to investigate any possible irregularities."
"To date, the only written replies which the Commission has received are those from Mr Seehofer and the Italian Agriculture Minister."
"I place them at Parliament's disposal."
"You will see that they contain no information which might justify, at present, the serious fears provoked by the numerous press articles which followed Mr Seehofer's action."
"This does not mean that the Commission should not examine these allegations closely."
"It will continue to do so, and if there is found to be fraud, the perpetrators will have to be severely punished."
"The Commission will insist that the Member States assume their responsibilities."
"Indeed, the customs and veterinary services, which fall within the jurisdiction of the Member States, must do their job."
"As for the Commission, it is doing its job."
"Next week, moreover, a new veterinary inspection team will be going to the United Kingdom, and I have asked it to pay particular attention to ensuring strict compliance with Community legislation and the strengthening of physical controls in ports."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in addressing this issue, we shall not allow ourselves to be diverted from our approach: public health is our prime concern, and the latest scientific evidence is our only guide."
"Any kind of information - however improbable - will be examined."
"We shall take no risks, and we shall act with transparency."
"We shall assume our responsibilities."
"It is in this way that we shall serve the public's interest."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, the internal note by a Commission official of October 1990 condenses in a single page everything for which the Union's bureaucracy is criticized by the public."
"Added to the revelation of this note - why such agitation on the Commission's benches? - are the rumours of illegal circumvention of the ban on exports of British beef."
"Since this last matter is now before the Italian courts, I shall not dwell on it."
"The impact of these revelations is devastating!"
"Admittedly, the Commission of which Mr Santer is President is not responsible."
"Admittedly, the official responsible in 1990 may well be in retirement."
"Admittedly, it is probable that no Commissioner saw the note in 1990."
"However, none of this excuses us from drawing the necessary lessons from what happened in 1990."
"It is because we respect the Commission's work, and because the Commission must be above all suspicion, that we wish things to be that way."
"What does this note reveal?"
"It reveals, firstly, an attitude which is frequently condemned by the Socialist Group, but which rarely appears in such a cynical form: the attitude that the market is the paramount consideration - which is equivalent to saying that anything else, in this case the protection of public health, is of secondary importance."
"This attitude was born, in certain countries, of the triumphant economic liberalism of the 1980s."
"The creation of the single market - in which attention is focused on the economic dimension at the expense of the social and environmental dimensions - is the extension of this attitude at European level."
"Secondly, it reveals an incredible blindness to the concerns which had already been expressed at the time by the parties involved."
"I shall cite no more than the written question on this subject submitted by my colleague Mr Happart in May 1990, and the Agriculture Commissioner's subsequent bland reply."
"Lastly, it reveals a wish to create a lack of clarity in the provision of information, or even to misinform: a refusal to ensure transparency which is absolutely scandalous in a modern democratic institution."
"What lessons must we draw from this matter, therefore?"
"The first is that it is not a question of apologizing swiftly and turning to the business at hand, but of undertaking to bring about a profound change in attitude and approach."
"The fact is that if a Commission official was able to produce such a document in 1990 - whether the politician responsible at the time knew about it or not - it is because the preconditions existed for him to do so."
"In other words, giving priority to the demands of the market, a lack of responsibility with regard to the protection of public health, and the desire to deal with such matters behind closed doors must all be common currency for such a document to be produced without giving rise to questions at any level."
"Furthermore, if such an attitude coincides at Member State level with very significant economic interests, lax veterinary controls and disregard for Community regulations, one can imagine the scale of the disaster, the extent of the permanent concealment of the facts, and the level of disregard for all public health and consumer protection concerns, for the benefit of economic interests."
"That, Mr President, is the real scandal."
"If the Commission now wishes to safeguard its credibility with the general public, it must show proof of a desire for absolute transparency and rigorous respect for the requirements of public health. It can defend itself by pleading not guilty a hundred times, but the general public will see only the permanence of the institution and not the succession of individual officials."
"The Socialist Group will examine very carefully and calmly the explanation which the President of the Commission has just given to Parliament."
"I should like to thank him for that explanation, since I believe that it is extremely important that he has provided the House with this very precise information."
"We shall, of course, be adopting a resolution, but that is not enough: our group will be considering the appropriateness of calling for a committee of inquiry."
"In any event, it could be said that if there were ever a case in which, pursuant to Rule 136, a committee of inquiry should be set up, it is this - in order to investigate whether there has indeed been an instance of maladministration, or even negligence, in the treatment of this matter by the Commission and the Member State in question."
"It is in everyone's interests to ensure maximum clarity, in order to restore confidence in the European and national authorities: the confidence of farmers, but above all the confidence of the Union's citizens and consumers."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as early as 1988 the Southwood Commission, a group of independent British scientists, said about BSE: ' We do not believe that there is a risk for man, but if we are wrong, the risk will be extremely high.'"
"In the debate in this House on 12 June 1990, I called for all BSEinfected herds to be destroyed."
"My experience of the continuing saga of BSE is that what we have to deal with here is not only the question of disinformation, which is actually of secondary importance, but something else."
"We have to deal with the fact that the Commission, the Council and the trade organizations, as well as some sections of this House, have in a sense failed to appreciate the situation and were not prepared to give priority to consumer protection in the interests of prevention."
"Of course, we have to see this in the light of the scientific advice, because the scientists' findings have emerged only in a piecemeal way, and as yet we have no definite conclusions."
"In this respect, it is not just a question of the note by Mr Castille - and I also heard the smug remark being made at the time in various quarters that if the whole thing was so dangerous, it was best to say nothing at all!"
"Not only the scientific dimension, but also the impact of consumer reaction, was simply underestimated."
"Mr Santer and Mr Fischler, you have been in office now for a year and a half, and I would ask just one thing of you: do not make the mistake of seeking to cover up any past omissions and possible misconduct by Commission staff, or misconduct by the Council."
"You have been right to bring pressure to bear through the decisions you have now taken."
"I should like to stress that point in particular, and to express my approval."
"However, there has also been a series of gaffes, such as the failure to implement in good time the standards for disposing of animal carcasses."
"The decisions taken in 1990 should have been implemented by December 1991, and you know what has happened up to now."
"In my view, a number of factors justify continuing with internal inquiries within the Commission to determine to what extent the officials who were involved and responsible really acted on behalf of the Community - or failed to do so."
"But I would also say this: as far as I am aware, a committee of inquiry would bring nothing new before the House."
"As regards animal-based meal and monitoring, we are discussing facts which have been available to everyone concerned with the issue since 1990, 1991 or 1992 at the latest."
"A committee of inquiry could provoke another over-reaction by consumers and the media, and in the end that would mean the farmers affected having to pay dearly for this a second time."
"For that reason, Mr Santer, I would ask whether you can give the House an assurance that, as well as the internal inquiries which you have made about the written note, you will also examine whether the Commission staff have actually done all they could in recent years to secure implementation of the directives and regulations that have been adopted, and to what extent the necessary controls have been carried out in the Member States."
"I would also ask for your assurance that the programme of culling is being carried out systematically, and that the interim research results will be made available promptly to the parliamentary committee responsible."
"I believe that this would be the best means of making good past omissions."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, we were expecting a great deal from your statement, since we have the somewhat distressing feeling that, in the past, the Commission has not always fully appreciated the extent of the political catastrophe represented by the problem of mad cow disease."
"On the one hand, there are bewildered and panic-stricken consumers, who believe that part of the truth has been concealed from them - something which helps to maintain a devastating climate of fear."
"On the other, there is a whole economic sector, from breeders to processors and distributors, which is on the verge of despair because its very survival is under threat."
"Indeed, there are regions of the European Union - in Ireland, Scotland, the massif central in France, the mountainous areas of northern Italy - in which cattle farming is the predominant, if not the only economic and human activity."
"Today, the European Parliament - which has been drawing the attention of the Commission and the Council to the gravity of the situation since the years from 1988 to 1990 - is angry, because it believes that the answers it has been given hitherto fall far short of what is required."
"It has the feeling that the matter is still being treated as a sectoral problem, when in fact it is the whole functioning of the Community institutions which is at issue."
"Two recent incidents give us cause for concern."
"Previous speakers have referred to Mr Castille's note."
"We welcome the fact, Mr President, that you have held an inquiry within the Commission. Nevertheless, we are not satisfied with what you have told us, since in order for an inquiry to be credible, both sides must be heard."
"However, as far as I am aware, you did not give a hearing to the author of the note, Mr Castille, who is now in retirement, but who could have supplied some very useful information."
"I, for my part, took the trouble of telephoning Mr Castille and asking him some questions, and he told me that the note had indeed been forwarded at the time to the office of the Commissioners."
"We are therefore surprised that your predecessor, Mr Delors, and even the Commission's current spokesman, should have attempted to discredit the author of the note, the intention of which - and certainly, it was a personal opinion - was to draw attention to the seriousness of the problem which mad cow disease already represented at that time."
"Subsequently, I found in my records an article which appeared in the 'Science and Medicine' column of 'Le Monde' of 30 May 1990, which is around the same time as Mr Castille's note, and in which two female professors - one at the Maisons-Alfort veterinary school, and the other at the Saint-Louis hospital - drew attention to the risk of infection posed by the use of meat-based meal."
"However, we had to wait until 1994 before legislation prohibiting the use of meat-based meal was adopted at European level."
"We believe, therefore, that the Union's institutions did not function as they should have."
"We have the impression that, at the time, everything happened as if the watchword were 'don't make waves' ."
"The result today is that everything is being swept away by a tidal wave."
"Consequently, Mr President, following these events which in our view are totally and exceptionally disturbing, we are calling on you to assume your responsibilities in full: firstly, in particular, by expediting an internal inquiry - but one in which both sides are heard - in order to establish exactly what happened in 1990 and draw the necessary conclusions, not least in disciplinary and political terms, if current or former Commissioners are involved."
"Secondly, by setting up with the Member States an emergency committee to ensure compliance with the health rules currently in force, in order to guarantee that the ban on the export of British beef - as well as that on the use of hormones - is respected."
"For we know that in this sector too, the Member States' controls are inadequate."
"Thirdly, by taking the initiative of proposing stringent regulations for the production of meat-based meal and its use in animal feeds, taking your lead from the restrictive legislation recently adopted by the French Government."
"Fourthly, by enacting common rules making the identification of carcasses compulsory throughout the European Union, with a view to increasing the transparency of marketing networks."
"Fifthly, by making available the financial resources that are necessary, on the one hand to eradicate the disease and, on the other, to rescue operators in the beef and veal sector."
"It is only by restoring consumer confidence - by applying in full the principle of transparency - and not by the Commission and the Member States persisting in passing the buck, with the sole aim of justifying their lack of action, that we shall emerge from this crisis."
"Mr President, the Commission's first objective must be to restore consumer confidence in beef, but it will never do that if documents keep emerging which cast doubt on the Commission's position."
"I therefore agree with what other speakers have said in this debate, that there must be an internal investigation and an internal report published to put an end to all these rumours."
"We need to be open and honest."
"My group will wait to see this report before it decides whether to support the calls for a committee of inquiry to be set up."
"The second question is what the Commission should do next."
"There are still so many unknown factors associated with BSE, and more research is needed."
"What role should the Commission play here?"
"What role is it already playing in coordinating all the research that is currently being done in Europe, and what will the financial implications of this be?"
"The third point my group feels is important is to restore the balance in the market for beef."
"This could be a difficult process, but one of the things that might help would be the introduction of a European quality mark for beef."
"Customers need to know how beef is produced, and for this a German, Dutch or Bavarian quality mark is not enough, we need a European quality mark to ensure that there is fair competition throughout the Union."
"There must also be fair competition with other measures."
"Germany has now announced that it will not abide by the Commission's decision concerning the export of certain products from the United Kingdom."
"What does the Commission intend to do about this?"
"What does it think about France's decision to ban the use of meatbased meal in cattle fodder?"
"We need to have fair competition everywhere."
"Mr President, this statement and debate were motivated by the revelation of the existence of the now infamous internal Commission note - or, if you like, note by a Commission official - concerning the disinformation strategy to be pursued with regard to the issue of mad cow disease."
"However, the main problem is not the note, but the fact that at the same time, the inspection missions by the Office of Veterinary Control were suspended and the Commission failed to exercise its function as the initiator of legislation."
"That situation continued for four years, during which almost 75 % of the declared cases of BSE were recorded."
"If risks existed, it was during this period."
"If legislation was necessary, it was during this period."
"If there was a need for inspections, it was never so acute as during this period."
"The Commission must explain the reasons for its lack of action during the period from 1990 to 1994."
"If we wish to avoid the word disinformation, we must talk about transparency, and it cannot be argued that the Commission's conduct has been transparent."
"The scientific basis for lifting the ban on gelatine is unclear, and the Commission has not provided us with the information requested in paragraph 6 of Parliament's resolution of last June."
"It is essential to compare the report submitted by the European Association of Gelatine Manufacturers, on which the Commission based its proposal for the partial lifting of the ban, with independent scientific opinions."
"As long as the impression exists that decisions are based on information supplied by interested parties rather than on independent scientific data, and that the European Parliament's requests for information are not being met, it will not be possible to restore consumer confidence."
"We must learn from experience: deregulation and the pursuit of competitiveness by the intensification of farming have created this problem."
"Experience has shown that when decisions are determined by economic - or indeed political - considerations, the consequences are grave."
"In the past, important decisions have been determined by the will to complete the single market or ensure the success of a summit."
"The public is aware of this, and we cannot expect to restore consumer confidence with such a record - even less so if the suspicion exists that economic interests have been put before public health in the taking of certain decisions."
"We must not fall into past mistakes."
"In all future decisions, the slightest risk must be eliminated."
"In this affair, there are interests, winners, losers and economic costs - but above all, risks to public health."
"And there are also responsibilities."
"In the view of the European United Left, there is a need to set up a committee of inquiry to establish responsibility for the creation and development of this problem, and especially to ensure that the decisions taken in the future safeguard public health."
"Some might say that the work of a such committee will produce new headlines in the press which have a damaging effect on consumption."
"However, we already have experience of what happens when decisions are postponed or adopted in a half-hearted way."
"Moreover, the long incubation period of this disease and the dangers already recognized will ensure that the press will continue to be provided with headlines in the immediate future."
"For all these reasons, the European United Left will support the setting-up of a committee of inquiry which focuses on the political decisions adopted, with a view to safeguarding the public interest."
"I am coming to an end, Mr President."
"As Mr Fayot said, we wish to contribute to ensuring that the market is made subject to the laws of democracy and the need to protect public health."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner Fischler, the BSE disaster is a chain of misconduct, political misjudgement, and failure to assume political responsibility."
"This is not a plague; it is a disaster brought about by mankind, namely by the British Government's decision to change the temperature and pressure at which animal-based meal was manufactured."
"We all know what the result was for the cattle."
"However, there was also a failure of judgement on the part of the Commission in thinking that this disease would not take on such proportions, but would gradually die out."
"It is true that the Commission has now taken action - and I acknowledge Commissioner Fischler's consistent approach - but it has been an emergency response rather than a policy of prevention, because some two million infected animals had already entered the food chain before the Commission intervened."
"Animal-based meal that was manufactured at temperatures too low to halt BSE infection is still in circulation, and animalbased meal is also continuing to be used as fodder while it is still unknown whether temperature can, in fact, halt the infection."
"According to you, Mr Santer, the Commission had no official line, and the Italian Government said that if the Commission had made the proposal in question, it would have rejected it."
"In saying this, you are either making a joke or being cynical."
"If you had come clean about it, we would not have needed a committee of inquiry."
"The problem is that you did not come clean."
"What is at issue now is not only a cure for this disease, but the reputation of the European Parliament and the reputation of European politics, which has been tarnished by all this sloppiness."
"It is important that the European Parliament, which has been consistent in its approach, is not lumped together with a Commission which failed to recognize the signs when it should have done, which relied on scientists who minimized the danger, and which played along with the strategy of minimizing the danger."
"That is what matters now, and that is what must be resolved."
"And if we are unlucky and this disease proves to be transmissible to humans, we shall have to ask ourselves why, even at this stage, we failed to draw the necessary conclusions."
"The question of a committee of inquiry is also a question of how rigorous future measures will be."
"What matters is not just that amends should be made for past errors, but that the House should use the powers it has recently acquired in relation to agriculture, and that it should be incorporated in the Treaties that the House can have its say and require you to take action if we believe it to be necessary."
"That is what matters, and that is why our group is in favour of setting up the committee of inquiry."
"And the flabby line taken by Mr Böge, on behalf of the PPE Group - ' Go ahead and investigate it yourselves, it's all right by us' - is not the stance of the European Parliament."
"We must do our duty, Mr Böge!"
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, this week, Parliament will decide - or at least I hope so - to set up a committee of inquiry to shed light on certain aspects of the issue of so-called mad cow disease."
"For whatever the merits of your statement, Mr President of the Commission, there is a need for persons outside the Commission to carry out an investigation - and through a procedure in which both sides are heard."
"Today, Parliament is beginning to respond in the manner that is required."
"It was necessary for an internal Commission note of October 1990 - published by a number of newspapers - to reveal what are seemingly astonishing cases of negligence within the Commission for it to do so."
"This note reveals what is, to say the least, the inefficient organization of rules and practices within the Commission, and in the Commission's relations with the Member States."
"Quite rightly, the public wants to know, and it wants transparency."
"I was Minister for Consumer Protection for three years, and I know very well that once consumer confidence has been lost, it cannot be restored unless consumers are convinced that they are dealing with competent, honest and impartial officials."
"That is why stalling tactics used to delay inquiries or limit their scope are based on a complete misjudgement."
"If we wish to protect the breeding sector - and especially the quality breeding sector, in which animals are fed on grass or cereals - there must be transparency, identification of the origin of animals, quality labels, and controls carried out by services which are independent of the farming industry and which represent consumers."
"If we wish to protect the wholesale and retail distribution networks, there must be effective supervision of the whole chain from producer to consumer."
"And if we wish to maintain the credibility and authority of the Commission - and our group very much wishes to do so, Mr President - it is essential not only for an inquiry to be carried out to investigate past events, but also to provide for reforms within the Commission and in the Commission's relations with the Member States, in order to ensure that similar cases of negligence or mistakes do not occur again in future."
"Mr President of the Commission, Mr President of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, for the third time since 27 March, we are required to debate in plenary the problem of mad cow disease and its consequences."
"In her speech on 27 March, my colleague Mrs Poisson read out an extract from Sir James Goldsmith's book, which was written in 1992, and in which all the evidence that BSE could be transmitted to humans was already described."
"And Mrs Poisson asked the Commission a single question: what has the Commission done since 1990?"
"The reply was unequivocal: your predecessor, Mr Delors, had said that the Commission was not well informed on the subject and could do nothing."
"On 3 June, my colleague Mr des Places made a call for genuine solidarity with cattle breeders, and for those responsible - in the cattle-feed manufacturing industry, in governments and in the Community institutions - to be identified."
"Commissioner Fischler did not furnish him with a reply on this point."
"The Commission's planned measures will cover only 20 % of the losses suffered by our cattle breeders."
"In France, for example, losses in the beef and veal sector are currently in excess of FF 15 billion, but the planned compensation amounts to only FF 3 billion."
"Who will pay the difference?"
"When I lodged a complaint before the European Court of Justice, with the support of a cattle breeders' union, I was told: ' No, the Commission is not responsible; it did everything in its power' ."
"However, in the now infamous internal Commission note of 12 October 1990 - which, as Mr Pasty has just told us, was forwarded to the Commissioners' office, so to the political authorities as it were - it is written in black and white: ' This issue must be played down by exercising a policy of disinformation' ."
"Earlier, President Santer, you said that this document was no more than an internal note written by an official now in retirement, and that its contents were belied by the Commission's actions."
"No, Mr President, it was not an insignificant note."
"We all know - from being familiar with the mysterious workings of the Commission - that such internal papers indicate the broad outlines of policy."
"In conclusion, Mr President of the Commission, in the face of these failures to reply, you oblige me to assume my responsibilities."
"Pursuant to Rule 34, entitled 'Motion of censure on the Commission' , I shall therefore begin, this very afternoon, to collect the 60 signatures required, so that Parliament can vote on such a motion of censure at the September part-session."
"Of course, you will say that the Commissioners responsible are no longer the same. I would point out, however, that Commissioners are responsible for the actions of the Commission as a whole, and that if there was a breakdown in the operation of the Commission, then the College of Commissioners currently in office is responsible."
"The Europe of Nations Group will call for a parliamentary committee of inquiry to be set up, but Parliament must assume all its responsibilities..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, Commissioners, you are, at the very least, accused of a crime."
"In your defence, you describe to us what you have done since March 1996."
"The problem, Mr Santer, is not what you have done since that date: it is what you did not do before that date - and with a full knowledge of the facts."
"At the political level, as long ago as September 1990, here in this Chamber, Mr Happart and I warned Commissioner MacSharry of the dangers, after we had spoken to all the international experts, including Mr Prisuner."
"On 11 June 1990, an issue of the National Front's newspaper carried the headline: ' The disease spreads to humans' ."
"It was impossible for you not to know!"
"Why would we have done that?' However, Mr Santer, if the public had known the truth in 1990, if, in 1992, it had known that free trade, the unrestrained pursuit of productivity, was resulting in contamination, it would not have accepted the GATT agreements and the Maastricht Treaty."
"That is your motive."
"You concealed the contamination by meat-based meal in order to conceal the contamination by your ideas."
"Above and beyond the infection by meat-based meal, the public was being poisoned by your ideas, Mr Santer!"
"And, in terms of the Vienna Treaty, you violated the people's right of consent."
"You secured the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty by invalidating that right of consent."
"Naturally, we agree with Mr de Villiers."
"It is not a question of setting up a committee of inquiry, but of the Commission assuming its political responsibilities."
"In other times, history's great poisoners suffered a different fate."
"Mr President, I do not know why I always draw the short straw and have to speak after speeches like that - but there you are."
"Having been here since 1988, I have been trying to get the Commission and MEPs alike to take the threat of BSE seriously."
"We must all be worried that the Commission was so concerned about the reports of the disease's existence that apparently it decided to deny it altogether."
"More importantly, at some level within the Commission we are told it was decided to keep all the information away from the public domain or as far away from the public domain as might be possible."
"On the other hand, I have to say that although it might be in the interests of some people in the Community to blame the Commission for this, it has actually had a very good record by comparison, for example, with the behaviour of the British Government, which has been trying to sit on information on BSE for at least as long."
"It also had the information pointed out to it at that time and managed to keep it out of the public domain."
"Even when the pressure for information became overwhelming on 20 March 1996 and every newspaper, television station and radio programme in Europe carried news of nothing else, the British Government never showed any signs of being willing or able to give us the information that the public had a right to know all along."
"It is not surprising, therefore, that there is very little consumer confidence in the beef industry across Europe."
"That is true not just in Britain but elsewhere as well, in Germany, Italy, France and so on."
"Therefore, we need to have a coherent European-wide ban to tackle this disease and that is why we are in the position we are in now."
"We need to have the plan in place and after that we can begin to tackle the question of consumer confidence."
"There is no point in lifting a ban if no one is going to buy the stuff anyway."
"It is perhaps unfortunate that the so-called Mother of Parliaments is unable to hold its own government to account for the series of blunders that is the BSE crisis."
"If, in this Parliament we have to have a committee of inquiry, that would be helpful."
"However, we must be careful that committee does not turn into some kind of witch hunt."
"It has to be a serious committee of inquiry and not simply an attempt to pin the blame for what appears to be an essentially British disease on other people or institutions."
"The committee of inquiry, if it is set up, must be seen as a positive contribution to a European solution for this whole crisis."
"Mr President it is not often I share a short straw with my colleague, Ken Collins, but following the previous speaker, I not only contradict him, but I contradict some of the points that Ken Collins has been making."
"But first of all may I, contrary to some of my colleagues, thank the President of the Commission for his statement, thank him for the work that the Commission has been doing and is doing at the moment in trying to deal with the many problems that have arisen as a result of this whole beef crisis."
"We have to look where we are and, following the agreement that we were relieved to receive from Florence on the framework programme, there has been considerable progress."
"We should be encouraged by the fact that the issue is back where it belongs, that is at scientific and at veterinary level."
"Many Members may be interested to hear what is actually happening at the moment and to note that nearly a quarter of a million cattle under the 30 months scheme have been slaughtered since the scheme began, a quarter of a million cattle, and they are still moving at the rate of 30 000 per week."
"In addition every effort is being made to carry out a selected cull among the dairy herds that have suffered from BSE."
"This of course has had a devastating effect on cattle farmers, cattle farmers throughout Europe, and the clean beef prices have been dramatically affected in the market place."
"The fact that such action has been taken, together with the quite substantial reinforcement of existing legislation on the composition of feed and the exclusion of any tissues that may be contaminated, should start to satisfy customers, should restore confidence amongst consumers, that beef is as safe from infection as many other foods we consume."
"Irrespective of this of course we have seen - and reference has been made to this by almost every speaker - that assertions on the existence of an internal Commission paper from October 1990, referring to existing health risks concerning BSE, appeared in the media of several Member States, as well as reports on illegal exports of beef from the United Kingdom."
"The President of the Commission has given us a very firm answer from the Commission on these two points, and therefore I would not wish to dwell on them."
"It suggested that the United Kingdom should not publish the results of research."
"Well as the President of the Commission said, quite clearly, that could be regarded as a joke but certainly it was not a paper that was received by the United Kingdom Government."
"So the present crisis and the slaughter of thousands of cattle to restore confidence has proved perhaps how wrong that advice, if it had been given, would have been at that particular time; but it was a file note, merely a declaration to the Veterinary Committee and not a formal recommendation to the government."
"So I would like to thank the Commission for doing all in their power to show financial solidarity with farmers, particularly those farmers who have been hardest hit by this crisis."
"I would like, if I may, to thank Commissioner Fischler for his contribution and in particular, if I may say so on a more personal basis, for his contribution at our Royal Agricultural Show a few weeks ago, when he was able to meet many farmers and was able in meeting them to restore some confidence among them about what the Commission was doing."
"The additional intervention measures which have been taken are helpful, and the funding of research is crucial."
"Indeed, if scientists could find a foolproof test to diagnose the disease, then it would be a major breakthrough in animal science."
"Perhaps I might ask Mr Fischler if there is any progress made in this direction."
"He might also care to comment on the availability of the rendering facilities since much of the product is presently going into cold storage."
"I support also those who call for a European quality assurance scheme on beef and I support the call for the full identification of all animals."
"Mr President, I have followed this matter since March of this year."
"I represent the biggest beef-producing constituency in England and the area with the highest number of BSE cases."
"I sometimes wonder if excessive concentration on detail is not turning our brains spongy."
"Clearly we must have tight controls on the export of meat and meat products from the UK."
"Clearly it is likely that some would have been in transit at the time of the ban, perhaps to third countries, and may have escaped those controls."
"I am pleased that the Commission has asked the anti-fraud unit to investigate any cases of fraudulent trading."
"But on the overall issue and the question of the cover-up, we need to take a wider view."
"This issue in a sense has been the United Kingdom's Chernobyl."
"Our failure to act at the first warning signs meant that the problem became worse."
"It got out of control."
"We do not know its effect on human health if any."
"But clearly there is substantial public concern and that public worry has been affecting us all."
"As a result, safety procedures have been improved."
"Measures have been put in place to eradicate the disease."
"But what some people have still not realized is that this is truly a European problem."
"If we want our beef market to recover we must match our resolute deeds with reasoned words."
"You said, Mr President, that we must not get carried away with emotion."
"I am pleased that you have written to Mr Seehofer to question him about his actions."
"Yes, let us have an internal inquiry in the Commission."
"That is surely only proper."
"But let us not blow up the problem, let us clear it up."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, dura lex sed lex ."
"When it comes to tackling a disaster such as the BSE crisis which has afflicted the United Kingdom, especially when this disaster affects a community as large as Europe, one must disregard one's own interests and be resolute, mature and worthy of living in a civil and democratic environment, especially when that community - in a spirit of cooperation - has attempted to assist the Member State concerned, albeit somewhat late in the day."
"That has not been and is not the case."
"Time does not permit me to tell the tale of the so-called mad cow; I would merely remind the House that, way back in January 1995, the president of the Alleanza Nazionale , Mr Muscardini, asked the Commission what was the truth about the disease affecting cattle in the UK."
"This question received an evasive and untruthful reply from Commissioner Fischler."
"So what can we say?"
"Should we play cat and mouse?"
"That is no use to anyone."
"The lack of proper information - as stated in an internal, not to say secret Commission document, which concluded that the problem should not be aggravated - and the lack of controls are fuelling doubt and suspicion."
"I would point out that the worldwide embargo on British beef is being circumvented by illegal, clandestine exports of beef from that country and, furthermore, that Parliament is still awaiting the outcome of the Commission's inquiry into these accusations."
"All these accusations create a climate of distrust in the public authorities whose duty it is to regularize this immensely difficult situation, which is affecting all of us and not just the Member State most directly concerned."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, firstly, I should like to say that we welcome this morning's statement."
"With the benefit of hindsight, however, I believe that it is clear that the Commission's approach should not be imitated in the management of this issue."
"The public has the impression that we have continually been dragged along by events, and certain information seems to confirm this - in particular, the note from the Consumer Policy Service which we are now discussing."
"To suggest that not talking about BSE would prevent unfavourable market reactions is quite simply to show contempt for Europe's citizens."
"To ask the United Kingdom officially not to publish the results of its research, or to implement a policy of disinformation with regard to BSE, is quite simply to commit an act of madness that is totally out of place in the community based on the rule of law which is the European Union."
"However, the solution must not lie solely in rectifying matters for the future."
"There is also a need to look back and provide political remedies for the mistakes of the past."
"We can express our regret at the situation in the beef and veal sector, the growth of stocks by 600 000 tonnes and the 11 % fall in consumption."
"However, any measures taken will be useless if consumers believe that they are being deceived by the Community authorities."
"Whoever drew up this note considered that market imperatives were more important than public health."
"Today, six years later, and in spite of this policy - the duration of which, and who was responsible for it, must be established by the inquiry for which we are calling - we are faced with a much worse situation."
"The disinformation measures have only served to aggravate the problem."
"The only thing which can truly restore balance to the markets is the confidence of consumers in the fact that those markets are governed by specific rules, and that the products - beef or otherwise - are not harmful or dangerous to public health."
"The content of the note in question amounts to turning immorality into a commercial rule."
"Let us hope that this unfortunate episode will enable us to ensure that, in future, the protection of public health is placed before any other consideration."
"Mr President, very briefly, I should like to respond to a number of the speeches which have been made and first of all to thank those who took part in the debate, since even if their remarks were highly contentious, they at least had the merit of making clear Parliament's current feelings."
"Commissioner Fischler will answer shortly on the more specific aspects of this issue."
"This is now the fourth time that I have appeared before Parliament to talk about the so-called 'mad cow' crisis."
"In all my statements, I have been guided by a single consideration: the need to protect public health on the basis of the scientific information currently available."
"It is in this spirit that we have encouraged the British Government to propose a set of measures designed to eradicate BSE - essentially so as to restore consumer confidence, which is necessary before a progressive lifting of the ban can be considered."
"That is the approach which this Commission - and the previous Commission - has always followed."
"I say this quite plainly, because if certain documents may perhaps bring discredit upon the Commission's actions, it should be clearly understood that those actions are quite different from the kind that would result from a note by an official."
"This statement can be backed up, moreover, by some very specific facts."
"The note in question dates from October 1990."
"As I said earlier, less than a month afterwards, a conference which brought together 200 scientists from throughout the world was held in Brussels, with a view to determining the implications of the BSE crisis."
"It was following this conference that the scientific research was started."
"The Commission has contributed financially to this research, and it was the research centre in Edinburgh - partly financed by Commission funds - which initiated the crisis of 20 and 21 March this year."
"Furthermore, a number of measures were taken by the previous Commission in this respect."
"Parliament itself endorsed these measures, and here I would only refer to Parliament's resolution of 22 January 1993, which contains the words: ' having regard to the numerous Community legislative acts concerning Spongiform Encephalopathies, in particular Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy' ."
"I believe that I am able to say, therefore, that the previous Commission did everything in its power to curb the crisis, given the scientific information available at the time."
"Moreover, Parliament itself states in the resolution which I have just mentioned that it considers that there is a need to continue manufacturing medical products for human and animal use from the brain and spinal cord of cattle."
"It is in Parliament's resolution, not in an internal Commission document, that these words are to be found."
"Let us turn now to the document in question."
"It was, as I said earlier, a note from an official."
"Mr Pasty said that perhaps we did not conduct an inquiry in which both sides were heard. However, I should like to draw the honourable Member's attention to the fact that it was the chairman of the BSE interdepartmental working party who, on our instructions, carried out the inquiry."
"His investigations led him to contact directly the author of the document, the persons to whom it was addressed, colleagues in the Consumer Policy Service and DG VI, as well as former staff of the private office."
"My statement was based, therefore, on the results of the inquiry carried out by the chairman of the BSE interdepartmental working party, on our instructions."
"It will therefore be clear to the House that we desire transparency."
"Nobody has anything to gain from a lack of transparency in this matter."
"Mr Fayot was right to call for openness and to say that it is the credibility not only of the Commission, but of all the Community institutions which is at stake."
"As a result, it is in all our interests - Parliament and the Commission - that there should be as much transparency as possible on this issue, in which the Commission genuinely has nothing to hide."
"We would urge you - as Members of Parliament, and leaving aside your contentious speeches here - to display the same trust with regard to this matter as you have demonstrated in respect of the Commission's actions."
"With your permission, Mr President, I shall now give the floor to Commissioner Fischler, who will go into detail on certain matters which concern him more particularly."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking you for today's debate, because I think that we urgently need to clear this matter up completely."
"We cannot effectively discuss ways of regenerating consumer confidence while that confidence is being shaken by unresolved suspicions."
"I have taken all the measures available to me to help resolve matters."
"As regards the suspected breach of the export ban, President Santer has already told you that we wrote to all the Member States asking them to inform us of any suspicions of which they were aware and, in particular, to let us know if they had anything stronger than suspicions."
"So far, no Member States have informed us of anything more than suspicions."
"However - and I think this is important - I have also asked UCLAF to investigate the suspicions and, in particular, I have asked the British Agriculture Minister to look into the suspicious circumstances once again."
"You know, too, that on previous inspection visits to Great Britain - on which the Member States have also been invited - we have already been investigating how the export ban is being observed on the ground, and there will be another of those inspection missions next week, when our programme will again include such investigations."
"Turning now to the second accusation, about the note by a Commission official, I would say that both the holding of a major conference one month later and the fact that between 1990 and 1992 the Standing Veterinary Committee and the Scientific Veterinary Committee dealt with BSE-related issues on more than twenty occasions are indications that the Commission could not have intended to take the approach which has been suggested."
"You yourselves are also aware that in the Council's conclusions and the Commission's decisions it has been stated clearly on every occasion that health interests have absolute priority."
"I should like to make a further point in this context, because it concerns something which often causes confusion among the public: the fact that the committee is known as the Veterinary Committee does not mean that it is solely concerned with animal health issues: the vets have a worldwide responsibility for ensuring meat hygiene and, consequently, public health."
"Finally, I should like to point out that our Scientific Veterinary Committee includes not only vets, but also representatives of other branches of science, particularly human medicine."
"I shall be glad to take up the suggestion that was made today of pursuing the internal investigations and reporting back to the House."
"Indeed, I am firmly convinced that it is high time we produced a coherent document about what has been done in this area, so that everyone can be convinced about all the steps that we have taken."
"However, I also believe it is important - as was said earlier - not just to resolve what has happened in the past, but to concern ourselves with the future."
"And here too, top priority will again be given to health measures."
"With your permission, I shall deal briefly with a fact which was reported in the media today and which concerns our decision on gelatine."
"Mr President, I should simply like to point out that the decision reached by the Commission was based on the scientific documentation available at the time, and the Scientific Veterinary Committee also delivered its opinion on that basis."
"In the meantime, on 26 June, we received a new, additional report."
"I immediately forwarded the new report - which differed on certain points from an initial report that played a part in April's decision - to the experts and, in the interests of safety, I have also arranged for the whole question of gelatine to be discussed once more by the newly established multi-disciplinary committee."
"It will be considering the issue in depth tomorrow. Meanwhile, the Scientific Veterinary Committee has already discussed this question many times."
"Clearly, we can only have the latest scientific basis available at any given time, and we have to base our decisions on that."
"One further important point is the reorganization of our rendering industry in all the Member States."
"A decision has been taken on this too, and the rendering industry throughout the European Union will have to be reorganized by 1 April 1997 at the latest - so all plants which process animal carcasses will be affected."
"Measures have also been announced for the transitional period to ensure that no potentially hazardous animalbased or bone meal can find its way into human food or animal feed."
"Another very important step, in my view, will be the improvement of our stock identification systems as soon as possible."
"We know that there have also been some major scientific breakthroughs."
"Yesterday, I gave the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development a comprehensive report on the Commission's deliberations, and in order to save time, I should therefore prefer not to cover that ground again now."
"It is quite clear that we have an extremely long way to go with research into the transmissibility of CreutzfeldtJakob syndrome between different types of animals and between animals and human beings, and also with tests on living animals."
"And for that reason, I have invited one of the world's leading scientists, Professor Weissmann, to submit a comprehensive research plan in which the individual research projects will complement one another."
"We are due to receive a proposal from his research group in the early autumn."
"This will allow us to demonstrate quite clearly that the Commission's promise holds good - health is the priority - and that we are acting on that basis."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"I have received eight motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Votes"
"Mr President, we welcome the approach that Commissioner Monti has just outlined."
"We agree that the Commission should submit a new draft on the basis of the discussions that have taken place, and I should like to express my thanks for this constructive cooperation."
"Mr Langen, as rapporteur, do you now wish to vote to reject the draft legislative resolution?"
"If I understand it correctly, we have just rejected the Commission proposal."
"That quite clearly means that the vote has taken place, and it would be mistaken to call another vote."
"In my view, the issue has been dealt with."
"The Commission is going to submit a fresh proposal, and our vote was quite clear."
"Mr President, the Commission proposal has been rejected: our vote on it was quite clear."
"We have heard that the Commission will submit a new proposal, based on the discussions which have already taken place."
"As I understand it, the procedure here in Parliament has therefore been completed, since we have rejected the Commission proposal and are now waiting to receive a fresh proposal."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to refer to the vote on the reports by Mr Lehne, Mr Ford and Mr Linzer."
"By agreement with those gentlemen, as the rapporteurs, with Mr Marinho, as chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, and with Mr Rothley, as acting chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I wish to request referral back to committee pursuant to Rule 129(1)."
"Under that rule, I can make such a request before the final vote."
"Let me explain briefly why I am doing so."
"All three of these reports deal with the implementation of freedom of movement in the European Union, which has been a fiasco and requires a great deal more discussion, though unfortunately we have no time for that discussion now."
"However, what is scandalous - and it is a slap in the face for the Commission and for Parliament - is the behaviour of the Council in the last few days."
"While Commissioner Monti has taken some welcome initiatives to expedite the implementation of freedom of movement, and while Parliament has been involved in consultations and produced reports on the subject, the Council, in the midst of this consultation process, is about to embark on a procedure under Article K.4 of the Treaty on European Union which is intended to replace parts of the present Monti initiatives."
"This is simply outrageous because, to quote Mr Monti himself, speaking this morning, ' There is a danger...' - we are not familiar with these Council documents, or just a few of us are, so I can only refer to the words of the Commissioner, who apparently knows the documents - ' There is a danger that internal frontier controls will become compulsory again' ."
"It is his opinion - and I quote - ' that the Council initiative which is now being taken threatens to damage progress towards the implementation of freedom to travel' ."
"If that is the situation, how can the House take a meaningful decision on the Monti initiatives which it knows about, when at the same time we learn from the Commissioner that the Council is unwilling to acknowledge everything we decide here, and plans instead to take its own measures, as it pleases, on the basis of Article K.4 - in other words without the Commission and Parliament?"
"We cannot allow that."
"The Council must be told here and now that democracy means the rule of the people."
"Rule by secret cliques is called bureaucracy, and we must reject that unequivocally."
"That is why we wish to have the opportunity of postponing the decisions on these reports until the September part-session: we would then have the chance, on 9 and 10 September, at a joint meeting of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, to ask the Irish presidency what it intends to do and whether it will drop this outrageous plan."
"I would ask you to support my motion."
"Mr President, I should like to support Mr Schulz's motion to refer the three reports back to the committees responsible."
"It really is surprising, to put it mildly, that just when Parliament is dealing with an opinion on a particular issue as a prelude to a Council decision, the Council is embarking on an entirely new procedure about which it is clear that the Commission and Parliament know nothing."
"This is no way for us to deal with one another!"
"We shall therefore ask the Council to explain its motives, and to deliver that explanation where it is required - in the committees responsible."
"For that reason, we would ask you not to vote today but, by referring the matter back to committee, to give us an opportunity of putting some urgent questions to the Council - which may prove embarrassing - about how it came to embark on this procedure."
"Mr President, I agree with the two previous speakers that what the Council of Ministers is doing here is wrong."
"It is not right that the Council should be brewing up its own little schemes while we are still debating a directive as part of the procedure."
"What should Parliament do?"
"We must not panic."
"We must realize that postponing a decision today will not help at all, since the Council will simply go ahead with its plans, and we must not give it the chance to do so."
"Instead, we must seize this opportunity to confront the Council with a joint position adopted by both the Commission and Parliament."
"Sometimes you have to show that you mean business and take your responsibilities, and the Liberal Group feels that we should therefore simply proceed to a vote."
"(Parliament decided to refer the reports back to committee)"
"Directive 82/501/EEC concerning major accident hazards - the socalled Seveso directive - has been amended on numerous occasions by the Commission and the Council without their having paid proper attention to important factors and parameters relating to the hazards posed by industrial plants and to accidents involving dangerous substances. The inadequacy of the directive, as regards the protection it gives to workers in the event of an accident, to residential areas in the vicinity of installations and to the wider environment, has been highlighted in the most dramatic fashion by the serious and often fatal nature of the accidents which have occurred."
"In the Thriasos plain area in Greece, where there is a concentration of large and dangerous installations in centres of population, there have been major accidents with many fatalities. Thousands of local residents are exposed to danger on a daily basis and the environment is being damaged terribly."
"The numerous exclusions provided for in the directive render it ineffective and incapable of providing an adequate response to the seriousness of the problem."
"The directive does not apply to installations engaged in the manufacture of explosives and weapons, military bases and military storage installations at which, by definition, large quantities of hazardous substances are concentrated and there is a high level of risk. As a result, such installations are exempted from having to submit a danger study and a major accident emergency plan, even though they are not covered by any other Community directive."
"Despite the fact that even some urban areas have been turned into virtual powder kegs as a result of the concentration within them of installations using dangerous substances, with incalculable risks for the safety of their inhabitants, the Commission proposal makes no provision, in the framework of the control and planning of land use, for establishing perimeter safety zones around high risk installations for the purpose of protecting local residents, or for prohibiting the siting of new installations or for promoting the removal of hazardous installations from urban areas and centres of population."
"The drawing up by each operator of a document setting out an effective major accident prevention policy is of the utmost importance."
"The establishment and implementation of high safety standards and the putting in place of credible preventive measures and technical systems are vitally necessary, as are strict and regular checks to ensure that all such measures to protect employees, local residents and the environment are being implemented and the imposition of heavy penalties for non-compliance."
"Operators of high-risk installations must be obliged to provide their employees with the information, training and equipment that they need in order to respond adequately to the special demands of their work in normal and abnormal conditions."
"They must also be obliged to provide local residents with full and clear information about the hazards to which they are exposed and on how to react in the event of an emergency."
"Recommendation for second reading by Mr Seal"
"Mr President, Mr Seal's report on groundhandling at airports raises two serious problems: a social problem and a safety problem."
"Once again, the ill effects of unrestrained deregulation and liberalization have been underlined."
"At the airports of Paris alone, 3000 jobs are under threat."
"In the name of the reduction of costs, airports are resorting to employing outside security firms and getting rid of professional policemen."
"Airport security is now the responsibility of young men who are more used to dealing with shoplifters than international terrorists, and this raises a problem of passenger safety."
"The reduction of social protection will lead to a reduction of protection, full stop."
"Security firms are already employing migrant workers without papers."
"This means that terrorists will be able to infiltrate them at will."
"So let us not hear from the Commission tomorrow that they did not know."
"After the scandal of contaminated meal, we shall soon be seeing aircraft falling from the sky."
"We abstained in the vote to reject the Council's common position intended to open up groundhandling at major airports within the Union to competition."
"We did so because we feel that competition in ticket and baggage handling at airports will benefit consumers."
"Experience in those countries, such as Sweden, which have opened up groundhandling to competition has been good."
"Those who wish to prevent competition sometimes maintain that workers' rights and employment are at risk."
"This argument does not hold water."
"Legislation governing workers' rights is not at all affected by increased competition."
"Jobs have never been created by the preservation of monopolies which serve no social purpose."
"Those who will ultimately have to pay if monopolies are preserved are the consumers, through more expensive air transport."
"Last November, Parliament delivered its opinion at first reading on the Commission's proposal for a directive on the liberalization of groundhandling services."
"That proposal was, in our view, unacceptable, since it did not take account of the realities of this sector - not to mention the absence of social provisions."
"In its common position, the Council of Ministers has totally ignored our views."
"I shall therefore be voting for the rejection of that text."
"I simply wish to ask the Commission to consider the possible consequences of the liberalization of this sector."
"For example, the safety of aircraft, and above all that of passengers, will be called into question."
"And what can be said as regards the situation of airport employees? There is the possibility of social dumping, redundancies, the replacement of qualified jobs by insecure jobs, and so on."
"Such an employment policy will not meet the aspirations of Europe's citizens."
"This is not our policy, and it is not my idea of employment."
"The Green Group is disappointed that the European Parliament has decided not to reject the common position established by the Council on groundhandling in EU airports."
"The Committee on Transport voted recently that the position should be rejected and in our view Parliament should have voted likewise."
"The Council has shown itself to be completely unwilling to take on board the concerns which Parliament expressed during the groundhandling debate last year."
"As a result, the proposed directive is vague and weak from the point of view of social protection of workers and non-committal in terms of guaranteeing uniform safety standards."
"Market liberalization for groundhandling services is not an idea which originated with users of airports or from workers but from the larger transport companies who are eager to reduce costs and operate more flexibly."
"The rights of workers are playing second fiddle to the interests of employers."
"As a bare minimum, it is necessary that workers are consulted before decisions affecting them are taken."
"However, the Council does not guarantee such consultation."
"It proposes that each Member State set up a user committee to oversee implementation of the directive in each airport affected but there is no provision for workers in groundhandling services to be represented at that committee."
"Moreover, the directive could become a charter for low pay and unsatisfactory job conditions."
"Third party handling licences could be limited for a small number of years after which they may be retendered."
"Workers would therefore have no job security and no safety net to stop them falling into the dole queue once their contractor's licence has expired."
"Market liberalization also cannot be allowed to usher in a more liberal safety regime in EU airports."
"If costs are to be cut, then safety standards must not be one of the areas affected."
"From my contacts with workers in Dublin Airport, I have heard of instances where they have been put under undue pressure by some of their employers and expected to undertake tasks for which they were not strictly qualified."
"One trade union representative has told me of his fears that workers would not be equipped to deal with emergencies such as an engine fire while an aircraft or another vehicle was on the terminal."
"For that reason uniform safety standards must apply."
"The Council, however, simple states: ' the provisions of this Directive in no way affect the rights and obligations of Member States in respect of law and order, safety and security at airports.' ."
"It is patently obvious, therefore, that vital issues such as safety and protection of workers have not been addressed by the Council."
"We need to reach a common position on groundhandling that is efficient and good for all involved in the airport system."
"I know there is great concern felt by many working in the industry in the areas of cleaning, baggage-handling and maintenance."
"They are right to be concerned and we must ensure their concerns are heard."
"We need a balance between all interests, but security and safety should not be overlooked or diminished in any way by any proposal that is eventually adopted."
"We agree entirely with the proposal by the rapporteur, Mr Seal, to reject the Council's common position."
"Deregulation does not generally result in greater effectiveness."
"Rather the consequences of deregulation are poorer terms of employment and reduced wages for those employed in the deregulated sector."
"In Sweden we have many good examples of sectors which were previously state monopolies and in which we were highly innovative and competitive on the international market."
"Langen report"
"I have voted against this report because I do not believe that the option of local and regional purchasing and procurement for local needs is sufficiently provided for."
"This option must be provided for to a greater extent than it is in this report."
"In this report, Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy is recommending the rejection of the Commission's proposal to amend the existing directive coordinating the procurement procedures in the water, energy, transport and telecommunications sectors."
"It should be emphasized that this recommendation does not stem from a rejection of the principles of the Government Procurement Agreement concluded in connection with the Uruguay Round."
"Nor is it due to a rejection of the basic principle of the Commission's proposal, which is aimed at countering discrimination between undertakings and sectors that must be seen as rivals, regardless of whether they are covered by the provisions of the GPA."
"The committee's recommendation is solely based on a wish to make it entirely clear which undertakings and sectors have to respect the guidelines on procurement proposed by the Commission, without being covered by the GPA."
"This wish seems a legitimate one in every respect, and the recommendation should therefore be followed, with the Commission being called upon to bring forward a proposal for a supplementary directive which will specify the exemptions and special arrangements in connection with the implementation of the GPA and will refer to the existing EU directives on public tendering."
"That concludes voting time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.45 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Trans-European transport network"
"The next item is the report (A4-0232/96) by Mr Piecyk, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council Decision (C4-0364/96-94/0098(COD)) on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network."
"Mr President, with the trans-European transport networks, a number of the Union's basic ideas and fundamental policies are being brought together and translated into action."
"Firstly, there is the Maastricht Treaty, which explicitly provides that the trans-European networks are to contribute to the strengthening of the Community's economic and social cohesion."
"Then there is Jacques Delors' White Paper on growth, competitiveness and employment, with its idea of creating jobs and making a major contribution to the fight against mass unemployment in Europe through a large-scale Community effort - particularly in the area of transport infrastructure projects."
"The Heads of State or Government have addressed this issue at numerous summits, although they have never gone beyond the stage of issuing declarations."
"In positive contrast to this, there is the example of the Øresund project, which is fully underwritten by the governments of Denmark and Sweden, and is creating more than 50 000 direct and indirect jobs."
"And, by no means least, there is the idea - which has become self-evident - that today, transport policy can simply no longer be drawn up without taking the environment into account. Indeed, a fundamental change of approach - including investment in the more environmentally friendly transport modes of rail, inland waterways and combined transport - is absolutely essential."
"I am convinced that practical policies designed to achieve the three goals of strengthening economic and social cohesion - and thus the consolidation of the internal market - establishing a pro-active employment policy, and developing a transport policy in which environmental policies are seen not as a necessary evil, but as an essential component of a modern transport policy, will secure the approval of Europe's citizens, for whom our work is frequently something abstract and impenetrable."
"During what is now almost two years of negotiations on the transport networks, Parliament has endeavoured to make these ideas prevail. And I wish to stress that the Commission has always been a very cooperative and helpful partner in this effort."
"In contrast, therefore, the attitude of both the Council and the European Council has been all the more disappointing."
"Numerous summits - most recently, the Florence European Council - have failed to rise to the challenge of combatting unemployment."
"And, in my view, the role played by the Council in the conciliation procedure has been pitiful."
"Our experience of the Council in the conciliation procedure was of an institution which has an aversion to environmental policy like that of the devil to holy water."
"And instead of embracing the spirit of Maastricht, it concentrated on jealously guarding national competences."
"No one should be under any illusions as regards the discussions over the Intergovernmental Conference."
"For the Council, codecision remains a negative concept."
"However, Parliament can be proud of its achievement in the negotiations."
"We secured the insertion of a specific article on the environment."
"Hence the entire network will be subject to strategic environmental impact assessment by the Commission, and the practice of corridor assessment is being developed."
"We have established that inland waterways are the most environmentally friendly form of transport, and combined transport and new traffic management techniques are taken into account in a new article."
"The toughest negotiations concerned Annex III, containing a list of priority projects."
"The Council was fundamentally opposed to such a list."
"The compromise reached consisted of the inclusion of the fourteen Essen projects."
"After the conciliation procedure had finished, Parliament's delegation was therefore amazed to find, in the conclusions of the Florence summit, that two Member States wished to modify project No 8 on the list."
"Our annoyance was dispelled by an unequivocal statement by the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Dini, before Parliament in Brussels."
"He explained that it was not a question of a unilateral modification by the Council, but of the notification of a proposal for modification, and that of course the procedure for any amendment would be codecision."
"I believe that this is an adequate explanation, and that with this proviso, we can approve the joint text as a whole tomorrow."
"So we must weigh things up and make an assessment."
"Following the conciliation procedure, my personal view is that the glass is half full."
"Let us not throw the water out. We are aware, however, that the construction of the networks is only just beginning, and that year by year, in the course of the budgetary procedure, Parliament must resolutely seek to translate its ideas into action."
"I have already mentioned that the negotiations lasted a total of two years, and at this point, therefore, I should like to offer my heartfelt thanks to all those members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism who took part in this effort."
"I wish to thank Parliament's delegation in the conciliation committee, and especially Mrs Fontaine, who in my view did an excellent job of chairing the delegation."
"I should like to thank Mrs Albani, Mr van Haeren, Mr Miller and Mr Betz, from Parliament's services, and my collaborators Michael Hoppe and Jürgen Aschmutat, without whose help this two-year task could not have been accomplished."
"If, as I hope, we approve the joint text tomorrow, then this will certainly not be the last time that we discuss these networks."
"That is in the very nature of the conciliation procedure and its results, and we shall undoubtedly be receiving one thing or another from the Commission by way of a postscript."
"I simply hope that, in the meantime, the Council will display a little more consideration and cooperation as regards matters falling under the codecision procedure."
"This, at least, is what the minister indicated that it would do at today's meeting of the committee."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Parliament's rapporteur, Mr Piecyk, our cochairmen, Mr Imbeni and Mrs Fontaine, for their work within the conciliation committee, which was very much appreciated, and the Commission, because it worked extremely hard in trying to get an agreement that we can vote on tomorrow."
"It is very unusual for me, as I am sure you can appreciate, to congratulate the Council and, in this instance, it is the Italian Minister Mr Burlando, who worked extremely hard and was a very important figure in reaching an agreement."
"One could argue that if the Council had shown Mr Burlando's willingness to get an agreement perhaps relationships would be on a far better footing than they are at the moment."
"My group will support the conciliation agreement reached after long, tedious hours of negotiation."
"These included all-night sittings, which I thought were reserved for national parliaments, which just shows how wrong I was."
"We have, as the rapporteur says, an environmental article that was important to my group and to Parliament."
"We have the priority projects, something else that was important to my group and to Parliament - and the indicative list of other projects that the Commission will consider in the other annexes."
"It is absolutely true that Parliament did not get everything it wanted from conciliation, but I would suggest that conciliation is not about getting everything that you want: conciliation is about that very word 'conciliating' !"
"Parliament was very keen to get an agreement and the Commission helped in this."
"We see the importance of the TENs, not only in transport infrastructure terms but also in terms of job creation for the people of the European Union."
"The Council's attitude at times left a lot to be desired."
"I would say to the Council that in future it is important that it works with Parliament rather than going off at a tangent and doing its own thing."
"Relationships with the Council at the moment, whilst cordial, are fragile."
"The Council should be aware of that and should also be aware that Parliament has its rights under codecision and expects those rights to be respected."
"We have to be practical; we have to be aware of the need for TENs, in infrastructure terms and in job-creation terms and in getting people and goods moving throughout the European Union."
"We have an agreement that we can live with. It is not perfect, it is the best deal in town and, therefore, my group will support that deal that we gained at conciliation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the common position which the plenary is being asked either to approve or reject tomorrow contains certain positive elements which the European Parliament delegation to the conciliation procedure, under the excellent chairmanship of Mrs Fontaine, succeeded in prising from the Council after a hard struggle."
"I must mention the substantial assistance to the promotion of Parliament's positions provided by the Commission, and by Commissioner Kinnock in particular, and the Italian Minister of Transport in his capacity as President-in-Office."
"However, ladies and gentlemen, the question facing us in tomorrow's vote is not whether the common position is good or bad, or rather not just that."
"The fact is that the common position as finally formulated creates a serious institutional problem which is harmful to relations between Parliament and the Council, given that via the common position the Council is refusing, in breach of the letter and spirit of Article 129 of the Maastricht Treaty, to grant Parliament the right of co-decision in the establishment of priorities for the major projects of the trans-European network."
"In the joint text the word 'priority' appears only in the recitals."
"In the common position the Council has gone back on its word and thrown out of the window the political commitment entered into by the heads of state and government at the Essen European Council in 1994 concerning the 14 top priority projects."
"It has agreed only, after much pressure, to an historical reference to the Essen conclusions."
"However, ladies and gentlemen, the Council's credibility or lack of credibility is its problem."
"The determination of the governments to act and conduct themselves politically as true heirs and standard-bearers of the ideals and methods of the Congress of Vienna in 1915 is, likewise, their problem."
"It is not ours."
"Our problem is the diminution of a right conferred on us by the Treaty."
"They are depriving us of the right of co-decision with regard to whether or not particular large projects are priority projects."
"That is the situation that you are being asked to accept or reject tomorrow."
"You will thus be asked, ladies and gentlemen, to decide according to your consciences and to take responsibility for approving or rejecting the common position in the full understanding that the European Union must not become an inter-state alliance, I repeat, an inter-state alliance , of economic interests in which the voice of Parliament, which expresses the expectations and interests of the peoples of Europe, can be neutralized by the presumptuousness of each and every government."
"The European People's Party, for which I speak, will decide on its voting intention this evening."
"Mr President, Mr Piecyk worked very hard for a long time in collaboration with us, with the Members of the European Parliament, that is to say, and before being sent to the conciliation committee the final text of his report achieved the impossible in that it was deemed satisfactory by nearly all sides."
"It set new horizons with regard to the political, economic and social criteria for the trans-European networks and accorded particular importance to protection of the environment."
"I therefore wish to offer Mr Piecyk very warm congratulations."
"Then the Council changed it all."
"At least, it has left nothing of Mr Piecyk's initial report as far as the general tenor of that report is concerned."
"There were - I remind you, ladies and gentlemen - 78 points of dispute, 78 differences between us and the Council."
"And what have we ended up with?"
"Of the 78, the Council has conceded only on 28, so how can the European Parliament be satisfied?"
"Is that what they mean by compromise?"
"That is not a compromise, ladies and gentlemen: it is the product of yet another act of political blackmail by the Council against the European Parliament."
"That, rather than a satisfactory compromise, was the outcome of the conciliation."
"And the explanations given - and Mr Sarlis is absolutely correct - both by Commissioner Kinnock, who did what he could, and we thank him and commend him for that, and by the new President-in-Office have reinforced our anxieties instead of alleviating them."
"Because, in fact, the Council can change the order of priorities without consulting anyone, and the money it gives - and Mr Sarlis stressed this point - is not from its own pocket but from the pockets of the peoples of Europe, and the Council, together with the two other institutions, ought to be representing them rather than representing a group of economic interests!"
"Because that is what it is doing with the changes that it has brought about in the trans-European networks."
"Its reasoning was not political or social, or concerned with the environment or with the development of the European Union's networks."
"It was purely a representation of the economic interests of a specific group within the European Union."
"Mr Piecyk, I personally congratulate you sincerely on your efforts, on the spirit of cooperation that you have displayed and on the wonderful report that you have drawn up."
"However, for reasons of political principle I shall vote against the report."
"I will make no concession of political principle for the Council of Ministers."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating the delegation to the conciliation committee, represented by its chairman, Mrs Fontaine, and Mr Piecyk, on their excellent work."
"Two years elapsed between the first Commission proposal on the trans-European networks - in which time Parliament and the Council expressed their views and discovered their differences - and the meetings of the conciliation committee which resulted in the adoption of a compromise text, albeit with some gritting of teeth."
"The text we have before us today certainly does not live up to the expectations of Parliament, which could perhaps have achieved more and pushed through the proposals it considered best for the territory and the citizens of the Union which it represents."
"Nevertheless, in keeping with the principle of the half-empty glass, I too am pleased that the final text emerging from these lengthy negotiations refers to the environment and to Annex III on the priority projects, even though its legal status remains questionable, to say the least."
"Article 20, on combined transport and new traffic management techniques, is particularly welcome."
"I believe, in fact, that we must now move towards new solutions, such as the use of inland waterways, which will give a boost to regions such as northern Italy, to which I am particularly attached."
"Although the final text is not quite what we would have wished for, largely because of the lack of cooperation from the Council, which is reluctant to accept the new role of the European Parliament and is not adjusting to the codecision procedure, my group will vote in favour of this project, since we believe it is important that Parliament should support this joint decision."
"Voting against, which would block all the TENs, would not only make the House responsible for the failure in the eyes of public opinion, but would deprive us of the possibility which we now have of making a positive contribution to solving the problem of employment and to building a better Europe."
"Mr President, this Parliament quite rightly demanded that binding environmental provisions be introduced in respect of the trans-European transport networks."
"This has come to nothing, however."
"All that has been introduced are the, in my opinion, usual old paragraphs which, as we have seen often enough, are in no way binding."
"The trans-European transport networks are also a mixture of national and transnational projects, a mixture of positive and negative projects."
"I should like to take the opportunity here to give an example of one of the most unnecessary and worst projects: the Øresund bridge between Denmark and Sweden."
"In terms of cost, the bridge will be an inescapable burden on generations of Danes and Swedes; moreover, it could become an absolute disaster in environmental terms if things go badly."
"I should also like to mention employment."
"I believe that those who advocate trans-European networks as a means of solving the unemployment problem are wrong."
"In my view this is a very old-fashioned way of thinking."
"When we built roads in the 1930s it was individuals with spades that were involved."
"However, my experience today, in Sweden at least, is that road building involves five machines and three men."
"We construct a motorway at enormous cost but without creating an especially large number of jobs."
"There has been a great deal of talk about responsibility."
"The Council has refused responsibility for the environment."
"The Nordic Green Left accepts that responsibility."
"We intend to vote against the compromise tomorrow."
"We hope of course that there will be many who do the same, because the environment is the future, whether we like it or not."
"Mr President, a great deal has already been said about the institutional implications of how we deal with the networks, and I have to say that the Council's behaviour in this codecision procedure has been an absolute disgrace."
"It is also too ridiculous for words that Parliament is now being led like a lamb to the slaughter and will tomorrow simply approve the compromise that has been reached."
"I have to say that Commissioner Kinnock has played a remarkable role in all this."
"At the beginning, he was firmly behind a number of Parliament's demands, but now he is putting tremendous pressure on us to agree to the compromise that he has come up with."
"However, I do not wish to talk only about procedural matters, since the TENs are far too important for that."
"The inclusion of an article on the environment was initially an extremely important point for Parliament, which took the view that corridor analyses and strategic environmental impact reports should be compulsory, so as to ensure that the solutions chosen would damage the environment as little as possible."
"Article 8 now instructs the Commission to develop methods of analysis for this purpose."
"This may create some work for a few officials in Brussels, but it will not do much for the environment, unless the Commissioner can tell me - and this is an extremely important question to which I should like an answer - whether, once these methods have been developed, they will be used to readjust the TENs in any subsequent review."
"I would like to hear what the Commissioner has to say about this."
"The Council has promised to implement the habitats directive and the MER directive."
"I wonder whether this means that it has not been doing so up to now, even though these directives have been in force for some time."
"Does this mean, Commissioner Kinnock, that now that the Member States have brought this matter up again, you are now going to oblige them to implement the two directives, and that no more money will be paid to countries which fail to apply the directives in carrying out certain infrastructure projects under the TENs?"
"I think it is important to have an answer from you on this."
"I should also like to say a few words about the employment myth."
"Research has repeatedly shown that there are many projects which provide more employment than major infrastructure projects, particularly if you also wish to achieve certain environmental objectives such as reducing emissions and meeting the CO2 targets that we have agreed on."
"So it is sheer madness, as every right-minded person agrees, to scrape together billions and billions of ECU just to turn them into concrete and asphalt for more and more cars to drive on."
"Creating jobs in environmentally friendly sectors and shifting taxes from labour to the environment will create long-term employment, and at the same time provide us with a more pleasant society in which to live."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have finally reached the end of this lengthy and complex conciliation procedure."
"I should like first of all to pay a sincere and heartfelt tribute to my colleagues Nicole Fontaine and Renzo Imbeni for their handling of the conciliation committee, and for having enabled Parliament to conclude this procedure at long last."
"Thank you so much for your organization of our work."
"Having said that, we can adopt one of two attitudes today."
"The first is to put a brave face on it, and to point with satisfaction to what Parliament has achieved."
"The second is to admit - and I should like us to discuss this among ourselves - that we have been left empty-handed, as the saying goes, and that - to use the language of the Commissioner and the Council - this whole business greatly resembles Shakespeare's 'Comedy of Errors' ."
"I think that Parliament wished to flex its muscles, in the belief that the decisions regarding some of the fourteen priority projects, including the one at Malpensa, were within its gift; by acting in this way, however, it further heightened the concerns of the Council, which immediately ran for cover as soon as it saw these rather overambitious aims on the part of the Committee on Transport and Parliament."
"The result is that we have practically nothing to show for all our efforts!"
"I think that we should learn an important lesson here."
"To my mind, we have discovered the limits of codecision and, above all, of our wish to take on powers which were not, seen objectively, ours to exercise."
"We could easily have realized the impossibility of doing this."
"We might perhaps have adopted a more prudent strategy, without referring back specifically to the political decision taken at Essen; doing that - in my opinion - allowed the Council to adopt its position, with the result that for a moment we actually believed the words of the President-in-Office, Mr Dini."
"Mr Dini is a liar: he lied to us as he has done in so many other matters of domestic policy, and as President-in-Office; unfortunately we can only note our lack of success."
"Even though our group will vote in favour of the Piecyk report, it recognizes that we have achieved very little."
"I rise on a point of order because I am becoming a little concerned about the number of Members going over their speaking time."
"Furthermore, I really would ask Members to think very carefully before they stand up in this public chamber and accuse anybody, never mind a President-in-Office, of being a liar."
"That is what came through my headphones."
"That is not the type of parliamentary language that I am used to, and I would also assume it is not the type of parliamentary language that this European Parliament is used to."
"There are ways and means of objecting, there are ways and means of expressing your objection."
"Calling somebody a liar is not one of them."
"Thank you very much for your comment, Mr Simpson. Coming from you, as one who defends his opinions with great vigour in this Chamber without going over the top, it is especially pertinent."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur deserves thanks for his efforts to achieve a compromise in the conciliation committee, and thereby take the construction of the trans-European transport networks forward."
"However, the question arises of whether Parliament can approve the Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network when Parliament has had little say in the matter, when not even 30 % of Parliament's amendments have been accepted by the Council, and when the compromise reached gives precedence to the large number of projects listed in Annexes I and II over the fourteen most important projects selected by the European Council at the Essen summit of 9 and 10 December 1994, thus applying the principle of giving everyone a slice of the cake."
"Indeed, the legal character of Annex III, which deals with these priority projects, is seriously undermined by this new approach."
"Thus the Brenner Tunnel project, which is so important to Austria, is also called into question."
"By virtue of Article 1(2), moreover, the common guidelines totally ignore the basic financial requirements of both the public and private sectors."
"And in addition, Article 2(1) refers to the achievement of the objectives up to the year 2010."
"Ladies and gentlemen, without agreement on financing, these guidelines have no concrete significance, since they will be impossible to implement on time, if at all."
"In the case of the Brenner Tunnel, for example, this means that fundamental preliminary work, such as test drilling, is not being carried out."
"Such work is essential, however, in order to be able to make statements as regards the amount of financing required."
"Without specific financial estimates, it will be virtually impossible to attract private investors."
"Private investors are vital, however, since the Brenner Tunnel cannot be financed by public money alone."
"Because of this, the realization of the trans-European networks will meet with further delays, and the Commission's desired effect of job creation through the construction and rapid completion of the TENs is seriously called into question."
"Mr President, my main reason for asking for the floor was to make a comment of a political and institutional kind. First, however, I too - like Mr Simpson - wish to express my appreciation of the conduct of the Italian presidency."
"I do not in any way mean this ironically, since - however strongly we in this House might criticize the Council - we cannot ignore the role of the President-in-Office, without whom we should probably not have reached a conclusion; my thanks also go to Commissioner Kinnock for having acted as a shrewd mediator and played a perhaps even more important role throughout this phase."
"The Council and the Commission found themselves confronting a parliamentary delegation which was authoritative, intelligently led by Mrs Fontaine and - in my opinion - determined; it was thanks to our determination, admirably displayed in particular by our rapporteur, Mr Piecyk, that we achieved certain results."
"However, these results were not entirely satisfactory, not least as regards the environment and various amendments."
"Whichever way we choose to put it, the final result is unsatisfactory for Parliament, and our opinion on all aspects of the matter remains unchanged: it was our impression that the Council did its utmost to provoke the European Parliament into voting against the trans-European networks."
"This was my impression, at least, when the Council first refused even the slightest change to the list of fourteen priority projects, and then let it be known at the Florence European Council that two countries wished to change that list."
"I do not believe that this House should change its mind according to the mood-swings in the Council."
"The European Parliament must insist on the need for real codecision on the priority projects of common interest."
"Personally, I am deeply disappointed by the conduct of the Council and the negative outcome of the Florence summit."
"But on no account - and I would invite colleagues to consider this point - should our disappointment be turned into a vote against, which could serve as a pretext for the Council to shift onto us the blame for its own difficulties and divisions."
"The problem now for the Irish presidency and the Intergovernmental Conference is that codecision cannot continue in this form."
"Although codecision is a procedure between Parliament and the Council, the Council - to our minds - understands it as being between Parliament and COREPER, and this means that a certain irritation becomes apparent at Council level."
"It would therefore be helpful if those within the Council were to read the Maastricht Treaty thoroughly; if they have not yet done so, it could be pointed out at the forthcoming summits, and at the special summit in Dublin, that we cannot go on accepting codecision between ourselves and COREPER."
"That is not what the Treaty stipulates."
"Mr President, I should briefly like to explain to my colleagues the thinking behind the conciliation over which I had the honour to preside."
"In our experience, it was certainly one of the most difficult conciliation procedures ever."
"This was because it was essential for two objectives to be reconciled: protecting the legitimate prerogatives conferred on Parliament by the Treaties as regards codecision, whilst at the same time completing work on the trans-European transport networks, which our citizens rightly hope will provide jobs."
"And, as the negotiations proceeded, it was hard to reconcile these two objectives."
"After months of wrangling, I now have to congratulate Mr Piecyk, the rapporteur, and Mr Cornelissen, chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on their admirable work, as well as all our delegation on their dedication and determination."
"No effort was spared so that the major works expected by our fellow citizens could be authorized as quickly as possible."
"Whether or not we have been successful is a matter for debate, as we have already heard from several colleagues."
"On the positive side, our environmental concerns have been broadly taken into account, since we now have a text that refers extensively to the Commission's responsibilities."
"Progress has also been made on certain technical amendments to Annex I and on the situation with regard to ports, although it is a pity that we were unable to extend the network towards the east as far as Budapest. We have secured Annex III."
"However, despite being formally attached to the legislative text, its precise legal value remained unclear until Commissioner Kinnock enlightened us in his letter of 1 July to Mr Cornelissen, chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, in which he wrote: ' I believe that the European Parliament should be involved in any changes to the list of priority projects' ."
"Mr Dini, in plenary sitting on 3 July last in Brussels, confirmed Commissioner Kinnock's assurance in the following terms: ' Any change would naturally require a new codecision with the European Parliament' ."
"Nothing could be plainer, and I wish it to be known that I have every confidence in Commissioner Kinnock. Without his help, we would never have completed our task, and I thank him for giving so unstintingly of his time."
"I also have every confidence in the President-in-Office, who has addressed the House and who, I am sure, will resist any pressure from administrative sources as regards the undertakings given to us."
"On a more general note, I should like to take advantage of this occasion to join my colleague, Mr Imbeni, in expressing the hope that those with political power, namely the ministers, will participate in future conciliations."
"That would certainly be in keeping with the spirit of Maastricht and would help to save a great deal of time."
"Be that as it may, however, to return to the transport networks, we shall be vigilant as regards what we have been promised and will use our budgetary powers, should this become necessary."
"It is in this spirit that I hope Parliament will approve the joint conciliation text that we laboriously concluded on 17 June."
"By so doing, we shall show our fellow citizens that Parliament is both responsible and alert."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, previous speakers have recalled the events leading up to this decision on Community guidelines on the trans-European transport network, as well as the lengthy discussions that preceded the compromise agreement."
"I commend the rapporteur and our colleagues who took part in the many meetings of the conciliation committee on their dedication and their excellent work."
"Like all compromises, the text before us today is satisfactory in some respects and less so in others."
"Like everyone else here, I feel aggrieved that many of the amendments we approved were not adopted by the Council."
"It is particularly disappointing that the ports issue has not been dealt with in this document and that we will have to wait until 1997 for a specific proposal on this from the Commission."
"Meanwhile, our group will do its best to ensure that the Commission has a text ready within the agreed timeframe."
"However, in view of the complexity of the issue, this is a satisfactory compromise overall, and one that should be approved by Parliament."
"We cannot let this develop into an endless process."
"Instead, we need to establish a firm legal base so that we can tackle the crucial issue of financing the network."
"At a time of economic slowdown, the stakes in terms of jobs are considerable."
"It is a pity that this important element has all too often been underestimated by the Member States and that projects which have been in the pipeline for several years have not progressed further."
"We therefore need to attract public as well as private investment, so that work can begin as soon as possible, thereby giving a definite signal to the socio-economic players concerned."
"As a first step, it is vital that these guidelines are approved."
"I shall therefore be voting in favour of the joint text drawn up by the conciliation committee, and I hope that many others here will do the same."
"I see from the list that at least ten speakers have only one minute, and I must tell the political groups yet again that I consider one minute's speaking time to be unacceptable."
"They must arrange things so that their speakers have at least two minutes. It is quite disgraceful."
"No one can express a set of opinions in one minute. It is only enough for the basic courtesies."
"And there are ten Members with only one minute."
"For goodness sake!"
"Mr President, I shall try to say what I have to say in a minute, even though you have already taken part of that time."
"I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Piecyk, and the chairman of the conciliation committee for their efforts in securing a satisfactory outcome."
"It is good that the discussions on the trans-European networks should finally have produced an outcome, although I am not satisfied with the various stages of the process and, in particular, the Council's decision taken at the Florence Summit, to step back from financing the trans-European networks."
"In addition to the codecision procedure, we must also remember that in the sparsely populated Nordic countries in particular due note must be taken of the subsidiarity principle when determining communications and transport needs."
"I endorse the conciliation committee's decision to approve also Finland's route 5, the lifeline for the whole of Eastern Finland."
"In truth it must be said that Finland should itself have taken a more active line on this matter in the Council."
"It is ironic that route 5 was included on the list only thanks to the determined efforts of the Swedish Government."
"Fortunately, the Finnish Government at least understood that it should jump on the bandwagon, although once again independent action was beyond it."
"On the basis of the above, I endorse the outcome of the conciliation procedure."
"Mr President, as has already been underlined, criticism must be made of the lack of balance in the conciliation committee between Parliament and the Council."
"Nor are we entirely satisfied with the conciliation committee's joint text."
"We are aware that some Member States will have to reappraise or review the conditions in which the projects will be carried out, particularly as regards the environment. All the environmental impact assessment directives - which, in many cases, have not even been transposed into national law - must be complied with."
"Despite these shortcomings, however, we must pay tribute to what is, in many respects, the historic impact that this joint text will have on many countries and regions."
"In the Iberian peninsula, for example, infrastructure deficiencies which we have been suffering since the nineteenth century will be made good."
"Many human lives will be saved as a result of these road and rail infrastructure projects."
"We must take account of the overall significance of the joint text, and this obliges us to try to ensure that the environmental requirements - and all the others, including the institutional requirements - are complied with."
"In view of this overall assessment, therefore, and whilst respecting and understanding the reasons of those who will be voting against, many members of the Group of the European United Left will be voting in favour of the conciliation committee's joint text."
"Mr President, as my colleague Nel van Dijk has already said, we Greens are opposed to this conciliation agreement, both because of the short shrift given to environmental protection and because it has not been possible to discuss the priorities currently being attached to the various projects which have been proposed."
"But the situation has changed since the Essen Council took its decision, and several countries have already proposed substantial changes, or at least variations, dictated by political, economic, social or financial changes in those countries."
"The high-speed rail network between Munich and Verona is a case in point: the cost and the environmental impact of the Brenner tunnel are such that this project is not feasible, even according to the governments of the countries concerned, Germany, Austria and Italy."
"But there are other ways of linking northern and southern Europe."
"Clearly, then, the intention is to approve a text which we already know to be impracticable."
"However, there is no desire at all to guarantee the European Parliament any real role in deciding on the changes."
"That would be a dangerous departure from the codecision procedure laid down at Maastricht, and I would ask for some assurances and clarification from Commissioner Kinnock in this respect."
"Mr President, Commissioner Kinnock, ladies and gentlemen, the problem of the guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network has come before this House once again, thanks to the efforts of Mr Piecyk and the conciliation committee, which has arrived at a decision potentially acceptable to everyone - although quite frankly I have my doubts."
"Everything has its price."
"Is it possible to amend all fourteen priority projects?"
"Mr Dini did indeed say that the whole package must be subject to codecision with Parliament."
"All of Europe is involved; but the various Member States, the main players and the principal advocates of the priority projects, need to do their sums. Whatever can be done must be done."
"In my opinion, the priority projects should not be changed on any account. What happens subsequently will of course depend on the timescales, and on national and European exchange rates."
"So when this problem is discussed in the House, I shall urge that the priority projects should be respected."
"The rest will come later."
"Mr President, are we not considerably further ahead with the development of the common transport policy than today's debate would seem to indicate?"
"I believe that the Council has been somewhat isolated."
"It has essentially been the Commission and Parliament which have taken this matter forward since the beginning of the 1990s, whilst once again, the Council has had to be dragged to the ball."
"Clearly, the construction of the trans-European transport networks is an essential precondition for the further development of the Union."
"We are assuming that we are finally reaching the design and development stage and will soon be able to take the next step: making firm statements on financing."
"Indeed, all the talk about private-sector financing and so on will not take us any further until hard and fast investment and implementation plans are drawn up, on the basis of which we can gradually make further progress and move towards a common objective in respect of the various forms of transport."
"This is the message which must go out from today's debate."
"I received the impression from the conferences in both Prague and Crete that there is a common will in this respect."
"At both conferences, the common desire to move forward was expressed and emphasized."
"We must create the financial base and then address this matter again at the Helsinki conference next year."
"We must discuss once again the trans-European transport networks, the possibilities of financing and the steps which have to be taken. And that conference may in turn represent a milestone."
"In the budgetary procedure for 1997, Parliament will have to consider carefully whether it is again prepared to allocate 75 % of the overall budget for transport policy to the trans-European transport networks or the fourteen priority projects."
"I believe that this will become extremely difficult, and that we must create an additional financial framework, in order to contribute to the realization of the networks."
"Mr President, the essential thing today is to highlight the political importance of the fact, in itself, that Parliament and the Council have reached an agreement in terms of the future of our transport policy and our policy on cohesion and solidarity."
"I should like to set out the four reasons why, in my view, we need this agreement."
"Firstly, if we had not reached this agreement, we would have to start the process of laying down Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network all over again, without any guarantee that, in two or three years' time, Parliament would not be required to approve an agreement which is similar to, or worse than, the one we have at present."
"It goes without saying that the enormous political and public relations cost of such a delay would be borne by Parliament, since our citizens would not understand why, having repeatedly stressed the need to build this network and insisted that it would lead to the creation of countless jobs, this House should now decide to reject the agreement reached or, in other words, to perpetuate the infrastructure deficiency, which in some Member States is very great, thereby delaying the creation of jobs."
"I should like to give the House a statistic regarding the job-creating potential of transport infrastructure construction - and I would say this to Mrs Eriksson, who maintained that this was something from the last century: for every 2 500 000 euros invested, 100 jobs will be created."
"And that is today, not in the last century."
"And it is not counting indirect jobs."
"If Members calculate the infrastructure needs, they will see that many millions of jobs can be created."
"Secondly, our transport infrastructure deficiencies and associated costs are enormous."
"In this context, the competitiveness of our economy, faced with the increasingly tough challenges of the international market, is at stake. And this requires immediate action - action which cannot wait for a hypothetical perfect future agreement between Parliament and the Council."
"Thirdly, we are all convinced that besides improving our competitiveness, the trans-European transport networks will help to strengthen the Community's cohesion and rectify its obvious territorial imbalances, thereby facilitating the future enlargement of the Union to include other European countries."
"And fourthly, on a pragmatic level, given the present and future budgetary constraints of the Union and the Member States, and with the knowledge that nothing is more elusive than money, the European Union and its Parliament need this agreement today, because at the least sign of hesitation or differences of opinion over criteria or objectives between our institutions, the private capital which we unquestionably need to finance the development of the trans-European transport networks will go to fund projects in other parts of the world which are or will become our competitors."
"I was able to verify this on a recent visit to China."
"For all these reasons, ladies and gentlemen, I would urge you to vote in favour of the agreement reached by the Parliament and Council delegations on the Community guidelines for the trans-European transport network, in the secure knowledge that, in doing so, you will be rendering a service to the cause of European integration."
"Mr President, we shall say yes, tomorrow, to the work of the conciliation committee, in the spirit of someone closing a major chapter of that book of dreams entitled 'trans-European routes' ."
"But the story is not complete."
"Who will write the next chapters?"
"This is where there are grounds for concern, and although it is true that we should be celebrating this outcome - albeit with the reservations already voiced by colleagues - we are also rightly concerned about the future."
"Commissioner Kinnock has confirmed today that the priority attached to the famous fourteen projects of Essen is not set in stone; and that is quite right, because it can happen that someone who feels too secure becomes lazy during the second phase, that of implementation, which is the more sensitive one, Commissioner."
"That is why I would remind you of the need to take action, in terms of launching the work programmes and the financial plans."
"The partnerships so far tested between Member States, regions and private operators are becoming nothing short of cattle markets, where the rules are continually being changed and promises retracted."
"Such is the case with the Munich-Verona route."
"A few days ago, just as Italy and Austria were launching the EEIG, the European interest group which was to plan the entire funding scheme, Germany announced that it was no longer prepared to pay its share of the Brenner base tunnel."
"So here is an indication that we also need to make arrangements for the second phase, which could compromise everything."
"You, Commissioner, said to us one day: ' Tell your fellow citizens that joining in a partnership could well turn into a business' ."
"I repeated this sentence at various seminars on the Munich-Verona route."
"I must say, quite frankly, that I did not encounter much enthusiasm, mainly because some people suspect - or fear - that this freedom being granted to Member States, regions and private operators might just be hiding certain pitfalls."
"I wish you every success in your work!"
"Mr President, the matter has to a large extent been covered. Allow me simply to say that we are at just about the same point as we were at yesterday on the subject of groundhandling."
"The co-decision and conciliation mechanism has led us into an impasse."
"Either Parliament accepts the position formulated by the conciliation committee, which will mean relinquishing, if not all of the amendments, at least the two main positions, namely on the environment for all of the projects and on the priorities and their alteration via codecision, or it rejects the position of the conciliation committee, which will mean that it will risk losing some of the compromises that it has won, or that those projects will be delayed or that the Council's decision may finally be imposed in its entirety."
"I have to say that although the Commission appears to be supporting Parliament up to a point, it is playing the role of the wise teacher at the last minute and trying to get the Council's position approved."
"At the same time, even the governments - including mine - which largely accepted Parliament's positions are pressuring us to support this common position of the conciliation committee for the sake of delaying the projects."
"It is an extremely difficult position."
"Parliament has fallen into a trap again, and I feel that the situation must resolved via the intergovernmental conference."
"Having said that, however, and as far as the issue in question is concerned, if we wish to be true to ourselves and to the positions that we have set out, and if we want a Parliament with genuine powers, I think that we should take up the recommendation of Mrs Eriksson and others and reject the position of the conciliation committee."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we must not allow ourselves to be annoyed by the discreditable events at the Florence summit, however difficult this may be for many of us, especially our excellent rapporteur."
"For indeed, the plans for the trans-European transport network have opened a new chapter in the history of European transport policy."
"The launch of this project will represent a first attempt to create, at European level, a sustainable transport infrastructure for the whole of Europe."
"The investment made to this end will have a twofold benefit: the development of a more environmentally compatible transport infrastructure; and the creation of new jobs for Europe's citizens."
"Nevertheless, our work on this project will not end with tomorrow's vote."
"Following the Council's display of ignorance and arrogance, it must be made clear that we shall continue to pursue our aims with all means available."
"In particular, it will be up to the members of the Committee on Budgets to ensure that what is now the indicative stipulation that the fourteen Essen schemes are priority projects is actually adhered to, and that Community resources are used to secure a new trend in favour of environmentally compatible forms of transport."
"Furthermore, we shall be required to check carefully that the environmental requirements set out in Article 8 are complied with by all the Member States."
"I wish to stress the fact that I and the other Austrian social democrat Members regret the deletion of the ParisVienna route as a priority project. Nevertheless, in view of the planned swift commencement of work on the Munich-Verona route, I shall be supporting the compromise reached, since this project is of the utmost importance to the Länder of western Austria."
"With regard to financing, I should like to draw attention to the fact, in conclusion, that the Austrian Parliament recently decided, on the initiative of the social democrat Transport Minister, to invest some ÖS 60 billion in transport infrastructure in the near future."
"This is a measure which should set an example to all the Member States of the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the outcome of the conciliation procedure can be viewed in various ways."
"For me, the glass is not half full: it is more than half empty."
"An overall assessment must be made, and I believe that, for a number of reasons, the legitimate expectations of the citizens of Europe have not in the least been fulfilled."
"The listing of the priority projects in Annex III is partly not meant seriously by the Council - please listen, Mr Farthofer - partly overtaken by events, and partly incomplete."
"It is partly not meant seriously because neither the Austrian nor the Italian Government is prepared to provide the necessary resources for the genuinely European project of the Brenner Tunnel in the next few years."
"They will not provide the resources!"
"I agree with you, however, that it is a disgrace that the European Union has not included the extension of the West-East high-speed train via Karlsruhe to Munich and Vienna, with a continuation to Budapest."
"That is why I regard this listing as completely unacceptable."
"It is no surprise, however, that it has been incorporated in the text in this way, since the Council was not prepared to negotiate seriously with Parliament about the list of priority projects and to take a joint decision."
"As previous speakers have already explained, the Council simply said that we should refer to the Essen list."
"Unfortunately, the majority of Parliament's delegation was satisfied with that."
"In my view, that is completely unacceptable, firstly since the Council - or at least the majority in the Council - has denied Parliament the right of codecision conferred upon it by the Maastricht Treaty, and failed to agree to a single paragraph of Parliament's relevant amendments and additions."
"And, secondly, the Council has failed to provide the citizens of the Union with a clear and honest decision as to which are, in that case, the priority projects that are soon to be launched."
"According to the statements by the President-in-Office of the Council, the Essen list is henceforth fixed and immutable, and thus we have allowed ourselves to be deprived of the right of codecision on these essential projects."
"However, let us move on from the institutional questions."
"A second point of criticism concerns the fact that, at the recent Florence summit, the majority of Member States made it clear that they have no intention of following up their fine words with deeds."
"The Member States' governments neither agreed to make additional resources available for the development of the transport network through the redeployment of funds in national budgets, nor even took the fundamental decision to release further resources through the transfer of funds in the Community budget."
"Whilst we repeatedly remind our citizens that 95 % of the finance for these European transport projects will come from national budgets, including loans and private-sector transactions, and that only preliminary studies, interest rebates and small subsidies will be funded from the Community budget, it is becoming clear that the Member States' governments wish to content themselves with merely designating priority projects - on the basis, moreover, of the 1994 evaluation."
"Parliament should not lend this political manoeuvring by the Council the appearance of success through its consent in the conciliation committee."
"Our citizens are expecting that, following the decision on the transEuropean transport network, work will now actually begin on the construction of the genuinely priority European projects in the near future."
"Only in this way will it be possible to combat the impending collapse of transport systems, enhance the safety of transport users, reduce environmental pollution and contribute to job-creation and growth."
"However, none of this is contained in the compromise, and I can therefore only agree with those colleagues who say that it should be rejected."
"Mr President, it is now almost two years since the Essen European Council meeting."
"Little, if any, progress has been made in the development of the trans-European transport network which, as we understand it, forms the backbone of the European transport infrastructure into the next century."
"I am thinking of my own constituency of Connaught/Ulster in which five of the counties are border counties where we require a much improved infrastructure."
"In view of the fact that in those peripheral areas we depend very much on an improvement in our road infrastructure, it is vitally important that this work should commence at a very early date."
"I welcome the appointment by the Irish presidency of a former Director General of Fisheries, Eamon Gallagher, who has been appointed by the presidency to break the deadlock over funding of the trans-European networks."
"I believe his experience as a negotiator at the highest EU level will bear fruit."
"But while we speak of TENs, I would also like to refer very quickly to the responsibility which we have for all parts of the Union."
"I am thinking in particular of the west and the northwest of Ireland where we require a major investment to bring our road networks up to an acceptable level."
"Until we have this, we will not be in a position to provide much-needed jobs in those areas."
"Mr President, there are four comments that I should like to make."
"I should first of all like to congratulate Mr Piecyk on his powers of endurance, together with all those who have provided their political and administrative support."
"Secondly, I would point out the simple fact that once this procedure is concluded, the TENs will finally have been adopted."
"I think it will still take a long time before we get the genuinely lasting and coherent European transport policy that we want."
"It will take a good deal of hard work and there will be many barriers to bring down, barriers between countries and regions, and also between transport techniques and in the way people think, because transport affects more than just economic growth."
"My third comment concerns the conciliation procedure, which I think would certainly benefit from being given a little more substance and weight, particularly in the informal phase."
"The parties involved, the Council, the Commission and Parliament - but in this case particularly the Council - need to have more confidence in each other and put their arguments forward in open debate."
"Once this happens, the formal conciliation procedure can be kept purely as a safety net and will really hardly be needed, which will be a great advantage when you think of how much trouble it causes, not to mention how much it all costs."
"Finally, I would just say that I think there is no point in voting against at the moment, since that will not help anyone, nor indeed the environment."
"If we do vote against, the world will not stop and wait while we go away and think again."
"The compromise should, in my opinion, be the start of a whole new approach with the emphasis on policy rather than procedure, because we still have a great deal more to do."
"Mr President, when Parliament votes tomorrow on the joint text from the conciliation committee on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network, a long legislative process will come to an end."
"This will provide proof that the codecision procedure is workable, even for the most difficult issues."
"We all know that it is in the very nature of a compromise that, in many areas, solutions will be reached which do not completely satisfy everyone concerned."
"As a Member of the European Parliament, I am certainly not happy with the way in which the Council acted."
"The European Parliament must not be excluded from participation in decision-making on transport issues."
"However, we must not forget our responsibilities with regard to these projects or, in particular, with regard to the citizens whom we represent in this House."
"A quick decision will mean, I hope, the rapid start of construction - and with it, an important boost to the labour market. And in view of the fact that there are 18 million unemployed people in Europe, the Union is urgently in need of such a boost."
"In the case of Austria, two projects are very much to the fore. Firstly, the extension of the Brenner axis - the importance of which cannot be stated often enough or overemphasized - is essential for our country."
"In the interests of our hard-pressed neighbours, a rapid start to construction is vital, to say nothing of the environmental problems which can to some extent be resolved by the building of this route and the introduction of combined transport."
"I would draw attention once again in this context to the special problems hitherto involved in long-distance transport and the particular geographical situation of the Brenner pass."
"The transalpine Munich-Verona route must be a matter of concern to the whole European Union, not only to the countries immediately affected."
"Of equally great importance to Austria is the construction of the high-speed route for combined transport from Paris, via Munich, to Vienna and Budapest."
"This project does not figure among the fourteen Essen priority projects, but must be dealt with as a matter of urgency."
"At a time when the enlargement of the Union to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe is taking concrete form, infrastructure projects which bring this region closer to the existing Community must be particularly encouraged."
"I would point out in this respect that Austria has only been a Member of the European Union since 1 January 1995, but that its legitimate demands must be taken seriously."
"If we are to be able to pursue effectively the objectives laid down in Article 2 of the EC Treaty in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, there is an urgent need for a modern, fast and economical transport network with appropriate capacities, which also reflects the modern attitude towards the environment."
"The trans-European transport network represents a great challenge to the European Union, but also an opportunity: through targeted investment, projects which are urgently needed can be realized."
"In this way, Europe will grow a little closer together and become more competitive, and jobs will be created."
"The decision on the trans-European networks can be a major step towards the further development of the Union."
"Let us seize the opportunity offered to us!"
"Mr President, I have two comments."
"Firstly, there is the institutional side."
"Many Members have congratulated one another today on the result we have produced and will be voting on tomorrow."
"To my mind, the praises should be muted."
"On the other hand, that is how things are: this is a compromise, and I shall naturally vote in favour of it."
"At the weekend, I had the pleasure of visiting a trans-European project from the old Roman Empire, the first road from Rome to the Adriatic, and touching the wall built by Caesar Augustus out on the Adriatic coast."
"One cannot help thinking of the Treaty of Rome and the trans-European networks when one visits such a historic monument."
"One cannot help thinking about what we decided at Maastricht."
"And I cannot help thinking how we spent time doing battle with each other over our own projects, the so-called 'imby' projects - in my own backyard."
"We were not thinking in a very European way, and the same thing happened in the Council."
"These 14 projects have been created to bind Europe together and to sell the scheme."
"So, ladies and gentlemen, let us now stop flexing muscles which perhaps we do not have."
"That was my first point."
"My second point is that the trans-European networks are also connected with employment."
"It is not just a question of building a road or a tunnel, or whatever it may be, but of binding Europe together, just as in the Roman Empire, but in rather different terms."
"I do have my own pet project, though it is a European one."
"I am pleased that in this discussion, we have succeeded in raising the profile of the maritime sector."
"I know that the Commissioner and the Council agree that the maritime sector is an area of potential in the development of the trans-European networks."
"Let us build on that together."
"It has the environmental angle, it has the right element of European policy."
"We should take the decisions together - Council, Commission and Parliament."
"My wish is that the increase in traffic should benefit Europe, and not just individual countries."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this conciliation will leave a bitter taste in the mouths of all those who have taken part in it."
"We believe that codecision is an essential instrument for reducing the democratic deficit, but one that means little or nothing to the Council or the Commission - which sadly, in this case, has been its over-enthusiastic follower."
"We are not going to pull our punches here. The Council has repeatedly tried to wreck the codecision process by imposing an unreasonable number of conditions for identifying projects of common interest, thereby depriving the agreement of any substance."
"I would also take the Commission to task for being, in the words of an illustrious British stateswoman, the Council's lap-dog."
"Barely a fortnight ago, Commissioner, on 1 July, you sent a letter to the chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism in which you said, firstly, that Parliament should be involved in any changes made to the list of priority projects; secondly, that your intention was to consider whether such an amendment to the guidelines for the network would be appropriate - which means, if that last phrase makes any sense at all, that you wanted to consider whether or not an amendment to the list of priority projects was required; and, thirdly, that this amendment should be approved by codecision."
"Now you tell us, in your letter of 12 July, that in the event of any possible changes to the Essen list being proposed, you would ascertain whether or not these had been identified in Annexes I and II."
"If this is indeed the case, then any changes to the list would be carried out without Parliament's involvement."
"What kind of a joke is that!"
"Mr Simpson said that we must not call you a liar."
"I have too much respect for parliamentary customs in Britain not to comply with his request."
"Instead, I will talk about hypocrisy and lack of integrity."
"But in spite of everything, we shall vote for this text because we know that too many people are waiting to castigate us for our lack of commitment to the networks, with a view to opposing any extension of codecision."
"But in voting for it, we cannot forget the humiliation to which we have been subjected."
"I am a Christian Democrat and, to quote François Mauriac, ' I forgive trespasses, but I remember the dates' ."
"Mr President, Parliament wanted a binding clause on environmental protection in this legislation, as reflected in our second reading amendments."
"I want to thank Mr Piecyk and Commissioner Kinnock for their help in winning this clause."
"We want an emphasis on rail and water networks rather than massive motorway building and we want rigorous environmental impact assessments."
"It was astonishing to meet such blinkered resistance on the part of the Council on this crucial issue."
"We have ended up with just the bare minimum which can be accepted."
"Having sat through all those long nights of negotiations, I have to say that it is a grudging and minimalist concession on the part of the Council."
"It is not as good as we would have liked but, in the spirit of conciliation, it is much better than what we started with."
"It does not guarantee that Member States will necessarily choose the least environmentally damaging option and therefore it will require extremely tight vigilance on the part of European citizens and environmental NGOs as these networks begin to be planned and implemented to make sure that this happens."
"It will be up to this Parliament to ensure that there is no backtracking on the environment article, which we have won under such difficult circumstances, by the Member States and we will continue to watch the trans-European networks very carefully."
"In the spirit that we have ended up with much more than we started with, this House should approve the networks."
"Then let us get on with trying to find the money to build them and to create the jobs which we so sorely need in this Community."
"Mr President, in this connection I should like to thank Mr Piecyk and the other Members who have succeeded in achieving this compromise."
"The development of the trans-European transport networks is essential because the networks will further European integration and boost employment."
"From Finland's point of view, the proposal concerning the trans-European transport networks has got better and better."
"All the important parts of the network, from the point of view of our country, have been incorporated into the proposal."
"Due note has also been taken of our speciality, icebreakers."
"The list of priority measures includes the Nordic triangle, which in Finland involves the construction of the corridor comprising high-quality railway lines, motorways and harbours between Turku and St. Petersburg in Russia."
"We thank Parliament for its understanding of our special situation."
"The Union must now resolve the problem of the funding of the transport networks in such a way that the required investment is not withheld for fear of adding to State deficits."
"The system for calculating public finances should be changed in such a way that when the productive investment in connection with the trans-European networks is calculated, account is taken only of the costs which give rise to interest and amortization."
"This would mean that at present those investment costs would represent only one-twentieth of the public investment costs under the current system."
"Because account would only be taken of 5 % of the cost of such measures, in the form of annual amortization, and because at present full account is already taken of interest-rate costs, the issue is the current focus for the development of the transport networks."
"Mr President, according to Article 129b, the trans-European networks must contribute to the strengthening of the Community's economic and social cohesion."
"The Union's actions in this field are required to promote, firstly, the harmonious development of the Community as a whole, and secondly - and in particular - the linking of the island, landlocked and peripheral regions with the central regions of the Community."
"From the point of view of the coastal regions, this second requirement was not at first given adequate consideration."
"In the end, the Committee on Regional Policy managed to ensure that it was taken more into account."
"The joint text now provides for the sea-side continuation of transport infrastructure, in accordance with the 'road to sea' concept, which includes the integration of seaports and short-sea shipping."
"From the point of view of regional policy, this is a success."
"These two aspects of the guidelines must now be translated into action."
"If just the major projects are implemented, only the economically strong regions will be interlinked."
"That will mean that the economically weak and peripheral regions will miss out on the economic boost that is intended to result from the development of the trans-European transport network."
"Furthermore, provision must be made for an adequate number of stopping-off, approach and departure points."
"This is the only way to prevent a large number of regions from becoming purely transit areas."
"In the view of the Committee on Regional Policy, this is a classic conflict between transport policy and regional planning policy, which can only be resolved by means of solidarity between the regions."
"However, there is also a need for solidarity with regard to the codecision procedure."
"The impression has been strengthened that the Member States need to be shaken up in this respect."
"Parliament will no longer allow itself to be deprived of the democratic rights conferred on it by the Maastricht Treaty."
"Mr President, first of all I endorse the hearty thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Piecyk, who has guided us all for so long on this very complex and challenging issue."
"I would also like to welcome in the most positive terms possible trans-European networks."
"They are, in my view and that of my group, a clear rejection of the laissez-faire approach to transport policy in Europe which has resulted, as we all know, in record congestion and pollution and cost ECU 100 billion a year in delay costs alone."
"In its place now, because of trans-European networks, we have the framework for a planned, coordinated attempt to switch traffic from the roads to the railways, the maritime sector and to inland waterways."
"We are doing that by harnessing the resources of both the public and private sectors."
"I would like to welcome all of that."
"Secondly, I condemn the resistance of some Member States to our positive proposals to put our environmental concerns at the very heart of the trans-European network guidance."
"But I would, in so doing, like to thank the Commissioner for his positive contribution to this very issue."
"I think he would agree with me that its a real pity that some Member States at least say one thing in public about the environment, but do another when it comes to Council meetings."
"The debate today represents real progress, a real attempt to take the environment into account."
"For the first time ever we are committing ourselves as a European Union to a strategic environmental assessment."
"Yes, it will take three years to influence the revision of the guidelines, but that major progress which was resisted for so long by the Council should be welcomed by us all."
"Yes, we must all remain vigilant, but we must also all work together positively to make sure TENs meet our objective of ensuring we have environmentally sustainable transport policies to pass on to future generations."
"Mr President, how can we fail to greet with optimism the launch of the fourteen projects now under discussion?"
"Without doubt, the trans-European transport networks will represent the main arteries of a modern, competitive and job-creating European Union. At present, there are few such arteries, and they are relatively congested."
"Transport is an economic, social and political factor of the utmost importance, and not only is there a need for transport networks that are geared to realities, but those networks must function at a European level, with the interoperability that is necessary and only logical."
"Furthermore, we should not dismiss the result of this trial run of the codecision procedure."
"I have to say that my personal observation of the Commission leads me to believe that it has been engaging in double talk on this issue."
"According to its discussion partner, it has been using double talk - although, of course, in the wake of the relative failure of the conciliation procedure, Parliament does not have the best possible perspective."
"Financing, Commissioner, is another key aspect of the trans-European transport network project."
"The financial perspective is inadequate: it lacks balance in terms of the priority given to the objectives that we are setting."
"And this will have to be put right, if we do not wish to fall into the kind of rhetoric and populism which talking a great deal and failing to provide the necessary resources ultimately represents."
"Let me end with a warning, however: the Community's infrastructure policy, Commissioner, its trans-European networks policy, is not contributing to the strengthening of economic and social cohesion which is required by the Treaty."
"According to the Treaty, all policies are to contribute to the strengthening of economic and social cohesion."
"I have to say to you today - and I hope to be able to speak with you at greater length on another occasion - that this policy is not helping to strengthen the European Union's economic and social cohesion."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for my part I should like to congratulate our rapporteur and the Members of the European Parliament who are members of the conciliation committee chaired by Nicole Fontaine, for the competence, balance and good political sense demonstrated in these difficult negotiations, bearing in mind that the agreement reached was overall a positive one and that we now have the conditions for making decisive progress in the process of constructing the trans-European networks in the transport sector, something which is vital for the proper functioning of the internal market, for strengthening economic and social cohesion and for creating new jobs."
"The achievement of these projects constitutes an important contribution to efficient and diversified links between the peripheral regions and the centre of the European Union, a vital condition for the existence of equal opportunities for all the citizens and undertakings in the Community."
"Some aspects of this issue have to be emphasized, however: first of all the financing of the trans-European networks must be carried out outside the structural funds and the Cohesion Fund which had already been allocated for other purposes."
"For us it is quite clear that we should now earmark extra credits and add those to the ones which have already been agreed upon."
"Secondly, the priorities to be given to the projects must be borne in mind within a perspective of political dynamics and we should also apply the philosophy proposed in the report which we are now analysing."
"In the case of Portugal, the proposal presented at the last European Council in Florence to integrate the project for a motorway from Lisbon to Valladolid into the inter-modal links between Portugal and Spain seems to us far more in keeping with the philosophy approved by the European Parliament and will actually contribute to a more balanced development of this region."
"I therefore think, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that we should vote in favour of this agreement and I call upon the Commission to put it swiftly into execution."
"Mr President, it is not easy to shape a policy of economic and social cohesion."
"Sometimes we take several steps forward, at other times we go through a phase of stagnation; in this case we have taken a small step forward."
"That is my assessment of the conciliation procedure."
"Nevertheless, we should commend the successful work of the Commissioner and the rapporteur, as well as the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the technical teams supporting all their efforts."
"Our task now is to find the financial resources to ensure that this document can be appreciated by our citizens, so that economic and social cohesion can become real and tangible."
"In spite of the meagre resources, we have to fight an important battle: the continual references to private funding could in some ways be ideologically inspired, in that to my mind, major infrastructure networks linking areas which include some on the periphery have a real need of public resources, and these can be made available through joint efforts from the EU budget and national policies."
"There is much that we can do in this respect, I believe, to invest in jobs and take due account of the environment."
"Planning decisions have been made: for the first time, we have projects which are defined as being of common interest, whether they are priority projects or not, and they are binding on the national governments."
"In this context, I welcome the statement by the Commission that it wishes to prioritize projects with a lesser impact on the environment and which promote combined transport."
"Here, I think that certain projects to link north and south would correspond with the Commission's principles."
"I wish you every success in your work!"
"Mr President, the conciliation procedure on the trans-European networks has produced little in the way of results, particularly on the subject of priority projects."
"Despite all its fine words, the Council has done its best in this particular case to flout the codecision procedure agreed at Maastricht, and we shall now have to consider very carefully whether we can accept the poor results which have been produced."
"In order to do so, we must look at the political implications."
"Firstly, rejecting the compromise would mean postponing the implementation of the networks and thus delaying the anticipated benefits for the economy and employment."
"This is certainly not what people want."
"Secondly, it would seriously damage the attempts being made to find more funding for the networks from the Union's budget and other sources."
"I therefore think that it would be better to hold the Council and the Commission to their promise to involve the European Parliament in an appropriate way if the priority projects are to be substantially amended."
"I would refer to the statement made by Mr Dini during the debate on 3 July, I think it was, and to Commissioner Kinnock's letter of 1 July, both of which are quite clear on this point."
"I would point out that the budget procedure offers us a very practical way of ensuring that these promises are carried out to the letter."
"I should like to make one further comment about the air crash at Eindhoven."
"The President of the House this morning sent his condolences to the families of the victims who were killed or injured when a military aircraft crashed at Eindhoven airport."
"I hope the relevant authorities will carry out a detailed investigation into the causes of the crash, and I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he thinks that the Commission should be involved in the investigation, simply so that we can learn as much as we can from this tragedy in which 32 people lost their lives."
"I should like to end by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Piecyk, and Mrs Fontaine and Mr Imbeni for all their hard work in the conciliation committee, and of course our thanks also go to Commissioner Kinnock for his tireless efforts to find a compromise."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by supporting Mr Cornelissen, speaking on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, in offering the condolences of the Commission to those bereaved by and injured in the appalling air tragedy in Eindhoven yesterday."
"In response to the question raised by Mr Cornelissen I have to say that I confirm that the Commission does not have the legal competence to undertake investigation."
"However, he can be absolutely certain that, as on all occasions, we seek to secure the fullest possible information and analysis in order to learn any lessons to be drawn from air disasters of any description."
"On the issue of the trans-European transport network guidelines, I would begin by expressing my appreciation for the constructive efforts made by Mrs Fontaine and other members of the conciliation committee from all parts of the House on this important piece of legislation."
"As rapporteur, Mr Piecyk clearly had a special responsibility - and I commend him for his work - over a time span that turns out to have been two months longer in total than the gestation period of an elephant."
"I know that he has produced something which, in the European context at least, is not as beautiful but is certainly more functional than the average elephant."
"The process of adopting the guidelines for the trans-European transport network is now moving towards its conclusion and, as the House may know, the Council gave its agreement yesterday."
"I am sure that everyone who has had direct involvement will share my view that, quite apart from the significant interinstitutional issues, efficient trans-European transport networks - as several Members have said in the course of the debate - are vital for jobs, growth, competitiveness and economic and social cohesion."
"They must be developed systematically and in the interests of the Union and, indeed, the whole of our continent, as some Members also reminded us in the course of this and other debates on the guidelines."
"It is no exaggeration to say that the adoption of the guidelines is a significant event in the history of our Community."
"For the first time and in accordance with the Treaty, the Community has established, legislated policy for the medium and long-term development of the overall international transport infrastructure network."
"That will prove to be a practical binding process for our Community, as Mr Sindal suggested."
"In addition, this is the first occasion on which the Member States, through the Council, have considered transport infrastructure networks in a codecision process with the European Parliament."
"I am certain that will prove to be an important development in the relationship between the democratic institutions of the Community and, as several Members have suggested, this should be regarded as the beginning of the evolution and not in any sense the end."
"It is a matter of fact that in general the Member States have to secure the provision of over 90 % of the funds needed to undertake projects and the codecision process only covers the guidelines for the TENs, not their implementation or financing."
"It is also clear that subsidiarity is properly secured by the provision under Article 129 of the Treaty that guidelines and projects of common interest which relate to the territory of a Member State shall require the approval of the Member State concerned."
"The task of codecision, therefore, had to be undertaken against the background of those legal, economic and political realities."
"And whilst that naturally increased the complexity of the work, the joint text on the guidelines, as it now stands, is a satisfactory result for the whole Community."
"In the course of achieving that joint text, there have been significant changes, as Members reminded us, in the course of the debate."
"First, the principle of specifying environmental considerations in the guidelines has been achieved in a new article, and that provision opens the way to the development of two new means of ensuring adequate environmental safeguards: strategic environmental impact assessments and corridor assessments."
"Naturally, the Commission takes these provisions seriously and will strive to ensure their useful implementation."
"In answer to Miss Eriksson and Mrs van Dijk, under Article 7 of the Financial Regulation I have to remind them that the projects financed under this regulation shall comply with Community law and Community policies, in particular in relation to environmental protection, competition and the award of public contracts."
"Of course, the habitat Directive, which was referred to by Mrs van Dijk, is the law of the Community and must be complied with on pain of prosecution."
"In both respects, therefore, and whilst I would not claim an immaculate provision to save the environment in the context of the TENs guidelines, very significant progress was made, thanks largely to the work of Parliament so far as the safeguards for the environment are concerned."
"The second change concerned the identification of projects of common interest and the amendments to the maps in Annex 1 and the specifications and criteria of Annex 2, where the Council accepted 18 further amendments in the conciliation procedure, in addition to those accepted after first reading."
"Third, on the remaining amendments, the Council and the Commission made a joint declaration with Parliament that they take note of projects supported by Parliament in second reading with a view to the future development of the trans-European transport networks."
"In addition, the Commission has declared that it will examine the projects voted for by Parliament in second reading and that examination will be undertaken as part of the revision procedure which is set for July 1999."
"On the subject of ports, which I know rightly exercise several Members of this House, there are clearly very real questions of competition between these essential parts of the maritime infrastructure and, for that reason, it has not yet been found possible to achieve an approach to ports which is similar to that established for airports."
"The Commission intends, therefore, after consultation with the interested parties and naturally the Member States, to present a report next year to identify eligible ports and consider whether it is appropriate to make a proposal that is comparable to that relating to airports in the Community."
"Parliament also achieved changes in another area, where there was significant contention: the so-called 'priority projects' and Annex III."
"It is obviously well-known that Member States objected right from the beginning to the setting of priorities for projects in the guidelines decision."
"They were convinced that the setting of priorities for projects of common interest is strictly a matter for national governments."
"I know that Members of this House understand that view when more than 90 % of the costs of these major infrastructure developments have to be financed through the action of Member States."
"Through negotiation in the conciliation procedure, Parliament succeeded in including a special provision - Article 19, referring to Annex III and the 14 projects of common interest to which the Essen Council attached particular importance."
"Another provision - Article 20 - is directed towards projects of common interest in combined transport and new traffic management techniques."
"As Members will know, they can take satisfaction from those developments and from the joint declaration by Parliament, the Council and the Commission calling on Member States to give the greatest importance to the implementation of these projects."
"Members of the House will know that at the recent Florence European Council the new Portuguese and Spanish Governments proposed modification of Project No 8 on the Essen list."
"No-one will need to be told that this is a multiple development and it is clear that consideration of the issue must be undertaken with strict observance of the letter and the spirit of the compromise achieved in the conciliation committee and now recommended to this House."
"We in the Commission will naturally be examining the project further and clearly we do not yet know what the political orientation of the European Council will be."
"If some modification of Article 19 and Annex III of the guidelines decision was to appear to be appropriate the Commission would have to consider whether to make a corresponding proposal."
"The procedure for amendment in that event, as Mr Dini for the presidency has already suggested, would be codecision."
"I heard Mr Bourlanges' contribution on this point."
"Indeed I took a note of it."
"I think the kindest thing that I can say about his rather immature intervention is that the name-calling that he indulged in did nothing at all to enhance his reputation."
"All it did, indeed, was to demonstrate that in politics at least, it is possible to be both heavy and empty at the same time."
"In conclusion, I think that the work involving Parliament, the Council and the Commission has produced an outcome for the trans-European transport network guidelines that is generally positive, economically realistic, socially responsive and helpful to the needs of the peripheral regions and to environmental protection."
"Clearly the guidelines are, as I and Members have said - wisely in my view - in the course of this debate, a first attempt for the Community and no doubt there is capacity for improvement as policy evolves."
"When we undertake the first revision of the guidelines over the next three years - indeed we shall be reporting in three years' time - I am certain that the lessons from this initial experience will offer valuable instruction."
"Meanwhile, for the sake of the Community in all its parts, I believe that we must make progress with the implementation of the transEuropean transport network."
"I therefore strongly commend the guidelines to this House as worthy of strong support."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Biology and medicine (Bioethics Convention)"
"The next item is the report (A4-0190/96) by Mr Pelttari, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the Draft Convention on the protection of human rights and the dignity of the human being with regard to the application of biology and medicine (Bioethics Convention)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the planned Council of Europe convention also has implications for research within the European Community."
"Research will be made subject to legal limitations, especially in areas in which social or third-party interests might be given priority over the protection of the dignity and rights of individuals."
"Consequently, as long ago as last April, Parliament's Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy delivered its almost unanimous opinion."
"The committee responsible has agreed to all the most important aspects of the Research Committee's proposals, and considers it essential for the European Parliament - partly in view of its role in the allocation of research funds - to monitor critically the work on this Council of Europe convention."
"The European public has been taking an increasingly lively interest in the development of this text."
"It is therefore all the more regrettable that access to it has at times only been possible as the result of indiscretions."
"In response to this situation, the Committee on Research is calling in its opinion for the broadest possible public debate and participation in policy-making, as well as the holding of public hearings and the establishment of publicly accessible data bases."
"This request has been incorporated into the report of the committee responsible."
"It will be further emphasized in an additional amendment tabled by my group."
"The present draft convention represents a considerable improvement on the 1994 proposal."
"Nevertheless, it still covers only a small proportion of the issues that need to be regulated, and it will have to be supplemented."
"Care must be taken to ensure that this process of adopting supplementary protocols does not undermine the actual objective of the convention, however."
"There is also a need for a stricter legal framework for research on persons who are incapable of giving consent, and to ensure that such research is permitted only if it is closely linked to the illness of the person concerned and likely to benefit his or her health."
"Finally, with regard to in vitro embryo research, the draft convention represents a compromise - a compromise which is less stringent than the legislation in force in Germany and other European countries."
"In any event, at least the production of human embryos for research purposes will now be prohibited."
"The European Parliament should call for a ban on any type of consumptive embryo research, as well as for more precise rules on embryo protection in the case of in vitro fertilization."
"The report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights makes an important contribution to the debate on this issue, and Parliament should adopt it by a large majority."
"In conclusion, I should like to point out for the record that I was not amongst the signatories of Amendments Nos 16 and 18, as is wrongly indicated in Document A4-0190/96."
"Mr President, the draft Council of Europe convention on human rights and biomedicine has rightly met with criticism from associations for the disabled and the Church, as well as many parliamentarians throughout Europe."
"I welcome the fact that the European Parliament is examining and delivering an opinion on the draft convention, even if the legal situation is far from clear."
"Mr Pelttari has submitted a good report."
"I should like to thank him for his work."
"His report uses clear wording and undoubtedly gives greater emphasis to the protection of human rights than does the Bioethics Steering Committee's draft convention."
"It is to be regretted, however, that Mr Pelttari's own group wishes to remove some of this clarity, and has tabled a number of amendments which would water down the report."
"As regards the content of the report, the PPE Group supports it in the form in which it was adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights."
"We believe in clear wording and the absolute primacy of human dignity."
"Firstly, I should like to address the controversial issue of modification of the germ cell line."
"It is to be welcomed that the Steering Committee has pronounced itself against intervention on the germ cell line. However, in my view and that of my group, the necessary clarity is lacking."
"The European Parliament must declare its clear support for a ban."
"We do not wish to see a moratorium - which may be technically justified - but a ban based on fundamental ethical considerations."
"Modification of the germ cell line is not a question of therapy but of the breeding of humans, and under no circumstances can we accept the vision of humanity which underlies this."
"The technique itself must also be rejected, since research into modification of the germ cell line requires embryo research in which embryos are consumed on a massive scale."
"And the Steering Committee's draft is also insufficiently clear on the question of embryo research itself."
"Reference is made to adequate protection, but consumptive embryo research is not unequivocally prohibited."
"I ask myself: what sort of protection is it when the object of that protection ultimately dies?"
"How we can talk about adequate protection then?"
"We therefore wish to see clear wording here as well."
"Nevertheless, the rejection of consumptive embryo research - and on this point we are agreed - requires consistency."
"We must take care to ensure, I believe, that surplus embryos are not produced."
"These would then either be used for research purposes or - and this also raises ethical problems - would have to be allowed to die."
"Many universities are currently faced with the dilemma of what to do with the hundreds of thousands of frozen embryos on their hands."
"A number of Member States have rules designed to address this problem, and these rules have not met with the opposition of women's movements - at least, I have not heard of any such opposition, although I have asked colleagues to provide me with evidence of it on several occasions."
"Consequently, I believe that the wording of paragraph 12.5 - as adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs - is extremely important."
"As regards research on persons who are incapable of giving consent, I wish to say that the original 1994 version of the draft convention rightly gave rise to protests."
"I also ask myself why it was not made clear from the outset, by means of a ban on discrimination against disabled persons, that no abuses would be permitted in this respect."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs is calling for such a ban, and I believe that we should endorse that call."
"The PPE Group is not opposed to a ban on research per se , but we wish to see strict rules."
"That also applies with regard to persons who are incapable of giving consent."
"Indeed, if we were to advocate a total ban, research in the fields of childhood diseases or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, for example, would not be possible. In my view, therefore, we should adopt the report in its present form, with a few changes of wording, but no changes of substance."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution which has resulted from the committee's work is a clear step backwards in several respects compared with the draft convention."
"Firstly, in the area of scientific research, the resolution envisages the setting of absolute limits before any new research work is undertaken, in other words an obscurantist moratorium on science."
"The majority in the committee thus believes that there should be no further research into genetic diseases until the convention has been adopted and then ratified by a majority of the states concerned."
"This would mean a delay of five or six years in combatting diseases."
"All advanced research would come to a halt, and we would lose out to Japan and the United States, not least in the field of patents."
"With regard to in vitro fertilization, the text approved in committee is unacceptable, as has already been stated."
"It imposes theoretical limits on the production of embryos for reimplantation, when in fact it is still not possible to avoid over-production of embryos. Above all, however, it imposes a virtual ban on the conservation of embryos by deep freezing, except where there are medical grounds for doing so."
"All research on embryos is also prohibited."
"I should like to ask one simple question."
"Who are we, the legislators, often geographically far removed from the people we serve, to say what is good and what is bad with regard to what most intimately affects a person, namely his or her sex life and reproductive activities?"
"At a time when, quite rightly, we are calling for equality of the sexes, how can we simultaneously deny women control over their own bodies?"
"If there is a surfeit of embryos, then we should let women have the choice of whether to preserve or destroy them, or donate them to science."
"Lastly, the almost complete ban on tests for predicting genetic diseases is also unacceptable. The possibility that such information might be misused could be avoided by authorizing such tests for medical or research purposes, and with the consent of the person concerned."
"In fact, this opinion contains two serious defects."
"Firstly, instead of devising a framework for controlling research, it seeks only to prohibit it."
"To put it simply, those who are afraid because of some of the horrific experiments carried out during the past 50 years should remember that these only took place because they were authorized and even encouraged by inhuman and perverse policies."
"But in today's political democracies, controls exist, research is done openly, new discoveries are published and medical ethics committees abound."
"So we need have no fears concerning research, which is a source of progress, as long as there are clear markers to prevent abuse."
"Secondly, would 626 Members of Parliament seriously claim they had the right to define what is morally correct private behaviour for men and women?"
"When establishing general rules to ensure the smooth running of a liberal society, there should be no interference in individual choice, when it evidently does not conflict with the established social order."
"Like the two previous speakers, I would say that if the amendments which we in particular have tabled are not taken into account, that will be what the European Parliament has done."
"In which case, I hope the Council of Europe will reject Parliament's opinion."
"Mr President, one can easily concur with the central theme of Mr Pelttari's report."
"The development of biology and medicine demands that certain borders be drawn within the legal system for the protection of human dignity."
"Great caution is necessary in dealing with genetic material."
"People must have the right to be different."
"We should today be directing much more of our efforts towards changing society to enable people to live life as fully as possible in spite of their individual illnesses and disabilities."
"However, arbitrary limitations should not be placed on discovering the origins of diseases and disabilities, and on curing and preventing them."
"Paragraph 12.10 of the report is in my opinion ill-considered."
"This paragraph proposes that tests which are predictive of genetic diseases or which may identify genetic predispositions to disease or disability should only be authorized for life-threatening conditions for which effective treatment is currently possible."
"What tests are being referred to?"
"If the proposed wording were adopted, would many existing tests have to be discontinued?"
"For example, it is already possible to predict certain conditions by means of blood tests, and thus to prevent the person developing symptoms even if only by changing his or her lifestyle."
"For example a predisposition to adult (II type) diabetes is highly hereditary as is a predisposition to many other diseases."
"It is already known that if one parent has diabetes, the child has a 40 % chance of having II type diabetes."
"If both parents have diabetes it is known that the child has a 60 % chance of having diabetes."
"However, this form of diabetes is not regarded as life-threatening although if untreated it can, like many other diseases, lead to premature death."
"Such hereditary diseases are frequently the result of 'genetic defects'."
"In this way, it has been possible to eradicate many diseases from the world."
"They have caused a great deal of suffering, and much still remains to be done."
"Should the use of insulin have been forbidden 75 years ago?"
"Was not the administration of bovine or porcine insulin to human ethically dubious? Would it be permitted today?"
"Fortunately it was permitted then."
"These questions require deep consideration."
"I hope that Parliament will not adopt the first sentence of point 12.10 but will adopt, for example, Mr Pelttari's amendment instead."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, upholding and protecting the universal validity of human rights is one of the political priorities of our times."
"The difficulty of this task lies in the fact that this validity is not only global and horizontal, but also individual and vertical: it extends from the Nobel Prize winner to the totally defenceless embryo, from the brain to individual body and gender cells."
"Whatever form this protection takes, it must satisfy a fundamental requirement: the task of our society, which lives with the realities of nuclear physics and molecular biology, is not to establish a new code of ethics, but to confirm and clarify the consensus on the absolute validity of human rights - reached in reaction to the barbarity of world war and genocide - in the area of biotechnological research and therapy."
"This draft convention on human rights and biomedicine contains exemption clauses in the areas of the right to consent, research on persons incapable of giving consent, germ cell line and embryo research, and organ transplants. These exemptions jeopardize the physical and genetic integrity of the persons concerned."
"Furthermore, in comparison with the European Convention on Human Rights, the draft convention is characterized by a striking lack of actionable binding force, in that it confines the jurisdiction of the Strasbourg Court of Human Rights to supplying preliminary opinions."
"Biologists, doctors, lawyers, philosophers and theologians have a great deal of work ahead of them to uphold the horizontal and vertical validity of human rights in the area of biomedicine."
"Mr President, Mr Pelttari's report deals with an extremely important and sensitive subject, namely bioethics or the ethics of life sciences."
"More precisely, this report constitutes an opinion on the draft convention currently being drawn up by the Council of Europe."
"I should first of all like to comment on the working methods of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights."
"It carried out its work on the basis of a preliminary draft text of the Council of Europe dating from 1995."
"Since then, the Council of Europe, through its Bioethics Steering Committee, has carried out further work which, on 7 June this year, appeared as a new text differing somewhat from the previous version."
"It is a pity that the European Parliament has carried out its own work on the basis of an already largely outdated text."
"In particular, the June 1996 text, which marked the conclusion of the work of the Steering Committee - before it goes to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, probably next autumn - to a large extent takes account of the criticisms which had been made, for example in Germany, where translation errors had distorted the debate."
"The misunderstandings have now been cleared up, and the June text was adopted almost unanimously by the Steering Committee consisting of experts from all the Member States of the Council of Europe and representing all shades of opinion."
"My second comment deals with some fundamental issues."
"Clearly, Mr Pelttari's report or, more precisely, the amendments adopted in committee, represent a certain moral standpoint which is not shared by all of us here."
"This applies to some of the provisions concerning the very sensitive subject of embryos."
"It also applies to protecting people who are incapable of giving their consent to research."
"And, finally, it applies to genetic therapy and interventions on the human genome."
"On all these points, Mr Pelttari's report appears more restrictive than the 1995 version of the draft convention."
"Naturally, we must protect human rights and exercise caution, but the report appears too restrictive, not to say a step backwards."
"I regret this, just as I regret that the report criticizes the Council of Europe's intention of preparing additional protocols on those issues which could not be included in the convention itself."
"The Council of Europe knows what it is doing."
"It knows that when dealing with such difficult matters, one has to move forward slowly, so as not to rock the boat."
"A basic convention with additional protocols is the best approach."
"Mr President, research in the fields of biology, biotechnology and medicine and the applications of this research offer untold possibilities, while at the same time confronting us with fundamental ethical questions."
"It is therefore most welcome that the Council of Europe should be working on a convention for the protection of what is referred to as human dignity."
"We must not say yes to every possibility: science, research and medicine must have their limits."
"The proposed Council of Europe convention offers an excellent opportunity to establish the necessary legal framework for this, but it appears from the draft text that the Bioethics Steering Committee has wasted this opportunity, since the provisions on crucial points such as the protection of those who are unable to give their consent, the protection and use of embryos and the question of genetic therapy are entirely inadequate."
"We are pleased that the European Parliament is stating its position in this report by Mr Pelttari."
"However, we do not think that the European Union should accede to such a convention, since this must be a matter for the Member States to decide."
"The Pelttari report makes substantial improvements to the draft convention, working on the basic principle that the direct protection of the dignity and rights of the individual must come before the interests of society or third parties, whatever they may be."
"The report does not have all the answers, but certain clear limits are established as matters of principle."
"Human dignity must be the first consideration, in acknowledgement of the fact that man is a unique creation of God."
"This means that every life is entitled to total protection and respect from the very beginning to the very end, irrespective of whether or not it is perfect or able to give its consent."
"I would therefore urge the House to adopt the Pelttari report as it stands, and to vote against the amendments which restrict the protection provided."
"Mr President, in the final version, the term 'Bioethics Convention' has been replaced by 'Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine' ."
"It thus becomes clear that the draft under discussion is based on the primacy of the human being, excluding techniques relating to animals and plants."
"The fundamental principle of the patient's welfare, in the broadest sense, in any kind of intervention is generally welcomed, but on this note we would recall, firstly, that no medical intervention may be carried out without the free and informed consent of the person undergoing it; and, secondly, that no research may be carried out on a person incapable of giving consent, unless it is for that person's certain and direct benefit."
"This position is in conflict with legislation and current practice in many European states, where the majority opinion is that the requirement for direct benefit would make it impossible to carry out a great deal of basic research on conditions relating to child development, childhood diseases or mental illness."
"In any event, we do not consider these systems to be strong enough to permit any major advances."
"Genetics is the most promising discipline with regard to combatting disease, in particular cancer."
"For this reason we maintain that an intervention on the human genome may only be undertaken for preventive, therapeutic or diagnostic purposes, and only as long as there is no intervention in the human germ cell line."
"Although some consider that this prohibition is based on fundamental ethical considerations, for others it is an elementary precaution in view of the fact that we are a very long way from possessing sufficient expertise to ensure acceptable safety conditions."
"Having said that, we are broadly in favour of the draft convention for the protection of human rights and dignity of the human being with regard to the application of biology and medicine."
"We particularly welcome two passages: recital L, which reads 'convinced that such forms of treatment should be prohibited because no technical controls on their effects are possible for the foreseeable future, there is no possibility of securing the consent of future generations and such forms of treatment would finally push open the door to eugenics - using humans for specific purposes' ; and paragraph 11: ' considers that the direct protection of the dignity and rights of individuals is of absolute priority as compared with any social or third-party interest and that the results of human genome research work must be freely available' ."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Question Time to the Commission (B4-0681/96)."
"Question No 29 by Maren Günther (H-0529/96)"
"Subject: EC humanitarian aid to Iraq in the light of Iraqi oil exports to finance humanitarian aid"
"The Commission spends an annual sum of approximately ECU 22 million on humanitarian aid to Iraq."
"Further amounts are set aside for 1996."
"Does the Commission intend to release these resources in view of the fact that Iraq has now been authorized to export oil to the value of $ 2 billion per half-year in order to finance humanitarian aid for its suffering population?"
"The Commission is following the steps taken towards implementing resolution 986 of the UN Security Council which permits the sale of petrol in order to allow the purchase of food and humanitarian products."
"The implementation of this resolution will require that all conditions, such as establishing purchase programmes and setting up adequate structures, are fulfilled several months in advance."
"With this in mind the Commission will maintain its humanitarian aid to Iraq throughout 1996."
"ECU 9m has been allocated in the first budget and the second amount of ECU 14m could be allocated, if needed, depending on the availability of ECHO funds."
"When resolution 986 actually comes into effect the Commission will examine the need to revise the programme and Member States and Parliament will be informed."
"The question arises of what will happen to the humanitarian aid in that case, Commissioner. Since Iraq will now have far greater sums of money at its disposal, the resources could be made available for other international emergencies."
"Or are there plans to take much more specific action, in view of the fact, for example, that the rate of child mortality in Iraq is alarmingly high?"
"For the moment the money is not in place and, as I have said, there are quite substantial conditions that have to be fulfilled."
"When those conditions have been fulfilled the moment will come to consider re-ordering the programme whether in Iraq or elsewhere."
"Question No 30 by Gerard Collins (H-0560/96)"
"Subject: Europol"
"Can the Commission indicate the amount of financial support it is making available to Europol, the amount of funding Europol is receiving from the Member States and when it expects this agency to become fully operational as an information resource on the illegal drugs trade for the national authorities charged with direct responsibility for combatting international drugs smugglers?"
"Mr President, neither the Europol Convention nor the joint action on Europol's extended mandate, which was adopted in March 1995, provides for financing from the Community budget."
"On the contrary, both these documents state explicitly that the expenses of both EDU and Europol must be borne by the Member States, in proportion to their Gross National Product."
"The Commission has no information on exactly how much each Member State is paying."
"That question must be put to the Council."
"The European Parliament has created a special budget item in the 1996 budget for EDU."
"The reason for this is that at the Essen summit the Heads of State and of Government expressed the wish that the EDU mandate should be extended to cover not only drugs but also trafficking in human beings, radioactive material and stolen vehicles, plus associated crime."
"A decision to this effect was also taken at the Council of Ministers of Home Affairs and Justice which took place on 9 and 10 March 1995."
"The amount that the European Parliament has set aside for EDU's new areas of responsibility comes to a total of ECU 7.5 million, half assigned to the budget item and half placed in the reserve."
"In accordance with the Treaty it is the Council of Ministers that is to decide whether these resources should be used or not."
"No such decision has as yet been taken."
"I naturally welcome the fact that a solution to the jurisdiction question was found at the Florence summit."
"I now hope that the Member States will ensure that the Europol Convention is ratified as quickly as possible, as this will determine how soon Europol will be able to start working seriously."
"I thank Commissioner Gradin for her answer."
"This clarifies the situation very considerably for me."
"Question No 31 by Graham Watson (H-0397/96)"
"Subject: Uniform electoral procedure for elections to the European Parliament"
"What measures is the Commission taking to ensure that the undertaking given by the signatories to the Treaty of Rome on the establishment of a uniform electoral system will at last be honoured?"
"In its opinion for the Intergovernmental Conference, the Commission underlined the fact that, in its view, the introduction of a uniform electoral system for the European Parliament was an important matter."
"But the procedure laid down in Article 138 of the Treaty is quite clear that it is Parliament and not the Commission that exercises the legislative initiative, and that has been done, as the House knows."
"After that, the Council has to take a unanimous decision after receiving the assent of the European Parliament."
"Unfortunately, the necessary unanimous agreement in the Council is not at present forthcoming."
"I am grateful to the Commissioner for his answer."
"I realize that the Commission recognizes, firstly, that the current balance in this House is skewed by the operation of the electoral system in just one Member State, so that we do not reflect here the will of the people of Europe when they vote."
"I am sure that the Commission also recognizes that we may well go into the next European election with 15 Member States and 16 different electoral systems."
"I am grateful to the Commissioner for his assurance that he recognizes the de Gucht report as Parliament having exercised its initiative."
"Will the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, consider taking action against the Council for its failure to act on this matter?"
"I do not necessarily agree with every comment the honourable gentleman has made in the supplementary question, but it is the case that Parliament has exercised its right and functions as prescribed."
"I am not persuaded, however, that there is any legal obligation on the part of the Council of Ministers that has not been met."
"It has simply failed to reach an agreement by the necessary provision of unanimity."
"That is not unique."
"If every time the Council failed to have unanimity and a proposition was not agreed to, it was taken to court, we would have to have a hundred courts sitting every day of the week."
"I wonder if the Commissioner could clarify what is meant by uniform electoral system."
"Is it the intention to have exactly the same system in every Member State, which is clearly neither achievable nor desirable, in which case it will probably be best to amend the Treaty of Rome?"
"As for Mr Watson's point about the balance of the house being skewed by the electoral system in one Member State, would the Commissioner agree that there is no proportionality across the European Union as a whole, nor any intention of having proportionality, because smaller countries get proportionally more seats than bigger countries, in which case the position in the United Kingdom is not the main factor skewing the balance of the House?"
"I did not say anything about skewing the balance of the House, I merely said that there was a commitment and belief that there should be a uniform electoral system."
"As to what a uniform electoral system is, there may be some room for argument but the Parliament put forward a proposal which certainly we recognize as containing a uniform electoral system."
"The question of over-representation or under-representation of particular countries seems to me to be a wholly separate matter."
"It does seem to me to be extraordinary that this Parliament, which keeps making a song and dance about having more powers given to it, fails to address the fundamental democratic deficit at its heart, which is that it does not represent properly the political views across the continent of Europe."
"I take issue with my colleague there from England, who seems quite complacent about this, and I do trust that the Commission does not share this complacency, that frankly it does not matter very much."
"I suspect there are those in the Council of Ministers who do feel that, who feel that the less democratic legitimacy Parliament has the better, and one way of demolishing our democratic claim is to point to the fact that there is not this spread of opinion."
"Nor equally in those countries which do not have any kind of territorial aspect of the electoral system is there any fairness built in, because it is quite possible that the French delegation would not contain a single Breton or single Corsican."
"It is only now for example that French Guiana has representation in this House because of membership of that list."
"I cannot believe that this is in the interest of Parliament, but I would like the Commission's reassurance that it is not complacent about this democratic deficit."
"When electoral matters come to be discussed by parliamentarians the temptation to range wide and far is irresistible and I can certainly plead guilty to not having resisted it on various occasions in the past, but as far as the Commission's position is concerned, we have not taken up broad positions relating to every aspect of the points that have been raised by the honourable gentleman who has spoken, but have underlined our view that, on the simple question on the introduction of a uniform electoral system, we think that that is desirable."
"It does not deal with all the problems that have been raised and it has been difficult enough to get agreement on that one, so let us focus on that and see how we get on, if necessary, in the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Question No 32 by Luciano Vecchi (H-0520/96)"
"Subject: Revision of the medium-term social action programme"
"What are the Commission's plans for revising the medium-term social action programme on an annual basis?"
"What form will the action programme take?"
"What consultations has the Commission entered into and what procedures have been followed for revising the action programme?"
"The process of updating this programme, which was adopted in April 1995, is currently under way in the Commission."
"The Commission welcomes the views of interested parties as contributions to this work."
"That includes the views expressed by the other European institutions, for example, in their respective opinions and debates on the programme and of the social partners."
"The views of CEEP, ETUC and UNICE in this respect have already been communicated to Commission officials and I understand that contacts on the matter are in progress between my colleague Mr Flynn and the Committee on Social Affairs, Employment and the Working Environment."
"The outcome of this process will be published after the summer."
"I take it from your laconic reply, Commissioner, that the Commission is not yet in a position to provide a substantive answer to my questions, that only consultations are under way, and therefore no decisions have been taken as yet."
"I am sorry if I was laconic."
"By some standards I was rather lengthy."
"But the position is very simple."
"It is exactly as the honourable Member understands it."
"We are in the process of taking people's views for this updating and, when we have heard them and considered them, will come to a conclusion and announce it."
"Question No 33 by Juan Colino Salamanca (H-0517/96)"
"Subject: Dismissal of a senior Spanish official"
"Can the Commission explain the reasons for the dismissal of Mr Fernando Mansito, a senior Spanish official?"
"Has his dismissal anything to do with the 'mad cow' crisis?"
"A restructuring of the responsibilities of the deputy directors-general in the Agriculture Directorate-General is under discussion."
"It is not linked to the current discussions on BSE."
"No decision has yet been taken by the Commission on the position of Mr Mansito."
"Notwithstanding the Commissioner's answer, I should simply like to point out that this matter has hit the headlines not just at any time, but precisely when the Standing Veterinary Committee is discussing the 'mad cow' crisis."
"Until his dismissal, Mr Mansito chaired the Standing Veterinary Committee, and now he is being replaced by a new official, without any kind of explanation being given."
"Consequently, we cannot avoid connecting Mr Mansito's dismissal with the 'mad cow' crisis."
"In any event, I welcome the fact that a wide-ranging restructuring of DG VI is under discussion. Naturally, we hope to receive more detailed information in this respect."
"The proposed new organigram has been sent to Commissioner Liikanen who is responsible for staff matters."
"It has not been finalized."
"When this has been done it will be announced in the normal way."
"Question No 34 by Irene Crepaz (H-0567/96)"
"Subject: WTO"
"There is some movement on the issue of child labour, in so far as the United States (see Financial Times of 13 June 1996) has now also proposed to extend the rugmark label to sectors in which the problem of child labour continues to exist."
"Does the Commission think this should be interpreted as a sign that the United States will take a positive view on discussion of the social clause at the WTO Conference in Singapore?"
"The United States is amongst those countries advocating discussion in the WTO framework of this issue and the setting up of a working party."
"Their proposals on this point are quite close to the Commission's ideas, that is to say, the need to promote internationally recognized labour standards in order to bolster every country's economic performance in the long term and the link between trade liberalization, economic development and social progress, as part of an open and nondiscriminatory trading system."
"Thank you for your answer, Commissioner."
"I should now like to ask you what form the Commission believes the treatment of social issues at the WTO Conference in Singapore might take, and whether the Commission intends to advocate the establishment of minimum social standards - for example on the question of child labour - within the framework of the WTO agreement."
"There is a proposal for a Council directive on a four-year scheme for a generalized system of preferences."
"This proposal provides for the possibility of granting preferential treatment to third countries which endeavour to protect workers' rights, prohibit child labour, and so on."
"What measures is the Commission taking to secure acceptance of this social clause at international level, for example in the framework of the WTO?"
"The Generalized System of Preferences is, of course, something that we apply autonomously."
"The European Union has the right to decide on what principles it will confer preferential treatment of a unilateral kind to developing countries, and the broad principle that account should be taken of their observance of labour standards of that kind is certainly one of the common features of such an arrangement."
"Within the WTO, however, what we are talking about is the discussion of a link between trade and the observance of fundamental labour standards."
"We do not regard low pay as an unfair trading practice: it is a natural advantage of poorer countries."
"But, on the other hand, observance of internationally agreed norms with regard to such matters as child labour is a legitimate subject for discussion in the WTO."
"It is a very sensitive question."
"The European Union as such has not formulated its position; it was discussed in the Council of Ministers only this morning."
"The Commission will, in due course, put forward its views."
"We hope then that the Council of Ministers will adopt them and that that will be the basis for the position taken by the European Union in the Singapore Conference."
"Question No 35 by Wolfgang Nußbaumer (H-0570/96)"
"Subject: Protection of intellectual property"
"The danger that protection measures for intellectual property will be circumvented persists, particularly in developing countries."
"What measures does the Commission have at its disposal to protect the intellectual property of European enterprises?"
"What sanctions can the Commission apply to countries which do not respect European intellectual property rights?"
"Following signature of the Uruguay Round, how much progress has so far been made in reducing tariff rates and removing non-tariff barriers in the developing countries?"
"European industries and enterprises can complain to the Commission pursuant to the trade barriers regulation in relation to alleged obstacles to trade which involve the protection of intellectual property rights."
"Then, after investigation, commercial policy measures can be taken vis-à-vis the third country in question."
"Such measures must, of course, be compatible with existing international obligations and procedures, but they may include the suspension or withdrawal of concessions resulting from commercial policy negotiations, the raising of customs duties and the introduction of quantitative restrictions."
"Individual problems of European industries can also be brought to the attention of our trading partners during bilateral meetings with the Commission, and we have negotiated cooperation agreements with a substantial number of countries containing special provisions relating to the protection of intellectual property rights."
"In the framework of the WTO we can launch formal consultations and request a panel if there has been a breach of the TRIPS agreement."
"It should also be underlined that European industries are granted protection of their rights in third countries through the existing network of international conventions."
"And, of course, the individual enforcement of property rights as private rights is something which the rightholder himself can undertake by appropriate judicial or other action."
"With the conclusion of the Uruguay Round negotiations, developing countries undertook significantly to extend the part of their tariffs subject to bindings and also to reduce duties applied to imports."
"The reduction commitments will be implemented by stages over a period of five years, starting from January 1995."
"Two-fifths of the reductions have already been made on non-tariff measures."
"Adoption of the results of the Uruguay Round meant that all developing countries adhered to all the codes and became subject to the stricter WTO disciplines, so that the majority of non-tariff measures were addressed."
"The position is very simple."
"There is no obligation to commence negotiations with regard to agriculture until roughly the turn of the century, and we have no intention of doing anything before then."
"On the other hand, it means that we cannot expect other countries to lower their barriers in relation to our industrial products over and above what they have already agreed to in the Uruguay Round unless we are able to make some kind of special arrangement with them in a particular sector which is regarded as mutually beneficial."
"I do not think we should exclude that possibility because it might be in our interest to do so."
"As far as intellectual property is concerned, China is not a member of the WTO."
"We seek to make China a member of the WTO to negotiate that, and then the full obligations will have to be kept."
"Nonetheless, China is committed to the protection of intellectual property and at every meeting that I have with the Chinese, whether in Europe or in China, I underline the importance of their complying with the agreements that they have entered into."
"In addition to stressing and repeatedly stressing the importance of compliance with what they have agreed, we also have to help them."
"I myself signed an agreement giving them technical assistance for complying with intellectual property rights, which is not always easy for developing countries, and I hope that, too, will ease the situation."
"If the honourable gentleman has in mind particular complaints with regard to the chemical industry, it may be that those are ones that we are already familiar with."
"If by any chance he thinks we may not be, I would very much like to have the details so that we can take the particular complaints up if we have not really done so."
"Question No 36 by Magda Aelvoet (H-0587/96)"
"Subject: Low-level military flights over the territory of the Innu people in Canada"
"Various Member States of the European Union - Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium - take part in low-level military flying over the territory inhabited by the indigenous Innu people in Labrador, Canada."
"In so doing, they cause noise and air pollution that is a serious threat to the way of life of this indigenous people."
"Has the Commission ever considered this matter, and have alternatives to low-level flying over this area been sought?"
"The Commission has no jurisdiction to deal with this matter."
"It is solely for the national authorities concerned."
"I was afraid that would be your answer, Commissioner."
"However, I would draw your attention to the fact that the EU Treaty clearly provides for protection and respect for human rights to be one of the aims of the common foreign and security policy."
"Later this morning, we shall be debating the report by Mr FernándezAlbor, which states - and the entire Committee on Foreign Affairs is in agreement with him - that the Commission is taking far too few measures in this particular field, and I think this is a perfect example of what he means."
"Everybody is entitled to their own views, but I find it very difficult to believe that the decisions of individual Member States, as part of their defence arrangements, to engage in flights of this kind over a nonEuropean Union country is something which the Commission has jurisdiction over."
"We are not normally accused of being lacking in ambitions to extend our competence, but I think this one really goes beyond what we could be expected to do."
"We turn now to questions to Mr Liikanen."
"I shall be reasonably indulgent because we are running ahead of time because of the excellent and short answers by Sir Leon."
"As the author is not present, Question No 37 lapses."
"Question No 38 by MaLou Lindholm (H-0568/96)"
"Subject: Equal treatment of men and women"
"The Union says that it wants to achieve equal treatment of men and women and that the Member States should improve their legislation."
"Does the Commission think that the EU's own institutions, which can take independent decisions, meet the standards that the Commission requires of the Member States in this respect?"
"If not, what does it intend to do to improve the situation?"
"The Commission regards promoting equality as a very important objective and wishes to promote it in its recruitment policy too."
"The situation has not been good as regards the number and position of women officials."
"The proportion of women has been particularly low in category A. To remedy this situation, the Commission decided in 1995 to set annual targets for increasing the number of women in category A and particularly in leading positions."
"The targets related to both the new and the old Member States."
"I am glad to be able to state that since the beginning of last year there has been clear progress."
"There were far too few women directors-general. There are still too few of them."
"At the beginning of last year, there was only one - now there are three."
"At the beginning of 1995 there were five women at director level (A2), now there are thirteen."
"At middle management level, that is heads of department and senior experts, there were around 10 % of women."
"The new Member States have brought about a notable improvement in this situation: 41 % of those selected as heads of department and/or central advisers were women, whereas the old Member States only achieved 15 %."
"The reason is that the appointments had to be made from those officials who were already serving."
"The percentage of women among the applicants was only 10 %."
"In the new Member States, on the other hand, it was possible to hold a competition open to all, and in these countries the position has been better than in any of the original Member States."
"The position has improved most of all for young officials."
"By this I means officials in A7 and A8 positions and it is at this level that recruitment has been busiest."
"The proportion of women from three new Member States among the staff recruited was 51 %, more than half."
"The proportion in the old Member States was 28 %."
"All in all we can say that the trend is clearly in the right direction as regards the recruitment of category A officials, officials in the A grade pay bracket, but it will take some time before the overall figures change because recruitment has of course taken place over several decades."
"The Commission will monitor the achievement of the targets closely and will continue to promote equality in its recruitment policy to enable the proportion of men and women in various career brackets to continue to be evenly balanced."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Commissioner Liikanen for that exhaustive reply."
"There has certainly been an improvement in recent years, not least since the accession of the new Member States."
"This issue is an old one, however."
"Equality has long been a priority issue in the EU."
"The question of positive measures to promote equality between women and men was taken up as long ago as the 1980s."
"I wonder somewhat whether it is intended that these measures should be more specific and whether there might be some positive discrimination - in the broadest sense - as regards the appointment of women in the future?"
"It is our intention, in addition to recruitment, to promote other measures to facilitate women's recruitment and career development."
"I wished to deal only with the recruitment of officials into A grades because I know that the low proportion of women among these officials (only 15 %) has been an uncomfortable fact for the Commission and that it is this situation which must be changed first."
"We are currently discussing with the staff organizations and in the Equality Committee what special measures would be appropriate to enable equality between women and men to be improved at all levels."
"It is also characteristic of the Commission that the proportion of women in C grades - secretaries and auxiliary staff - is 85 %, which is also a negative feature."
"We must go on thinking."
"We must promote the position of women among officials with a degree, while in the C grades, for which A levels or equivalent, are mostly required, we should try to increase the number of men, so that both sexes are in an equally favourable position in all categories."
"I am sure that to support these measures as a whole, the Commission will also have to draft a new equality promotion programme when the last one is finished and that it will wish to find the best means of putting it into practice."
"I should like to thank the Commissioner for fighting - despite the Kalanke ruling - for positive measures and firm quotas."
"I am also familiar with the figures, and I know of course that for women, the glass ceiling will be reached at some point, and that despite the Commissioner's efforts, not everything has yet been achieved."
"There is another source of bitterness which I would ask the Commissioner to address."
"There are age limits for recruitment to the Union's institutions, and those age limits should undoubtedly be abolished. Considering that the retirement age is being raised from 60 to 65 in virtually every Member State, I believe that we must also eliminate these age limits for recruitment to the Union's institutions."
"The question of age limits is extremely tricky."
"The first problem is that when we last arranged a general competition for A grade officials, there were 50 000 applicants in all the Community languages in spite of the age limits, of whom a couple of hundred could be placed on reserve lists."
"When the next joint competition is held for 15 Member States there may be even more applicants and even fewer posts available."
"We must rethink the whole competition seriously."
"I am prepared to reconsider the age limit openly."
"It is however notable that there is not necessarily any direct correlation between the age limit and equality between the sexes."
"When we looked at the recruitment policies in the new Member States it appeared that slightly less than half of those recruited were under 35 and slightly more than half over 35."
"On examining these figures it appeared that the majority of the under-35 group were women whereas, disregarding the age limit, the majority were men."
"This is because in these societies the position of young women is clearly completely equal."
"On average, indeed, women are slightly better educated than men."
"When we look at the older age groups the social equality situation is not quite the same."
"Question No 39 by Lis Jensen (H-0601/96)"
"Subject: Relations between the Commission and the Court of Auditors"
"On 14 November 1995 Commissioner Liikanen made the following comments in Plenary with regard to the Court of Auditors' annual report: ' .. relations between the auditor and the auditee are never easy."
"With the European Union they are particularly sensitive.. the new Commission has made it an immediate priority to improve relations between the two institutions."
"Improvements were required in style as much as in substance' ."
"Can the Commission explain what is meant specifically by the terms 'style' and 'substance' in this context?"
"According to a report in the Danish newspaper on 12 March, at a meeting on 11 March 1996 the new President of the Court of Auditors and the Commission apparently agreed a type of code of conduct based on the idea that 'in future the Court of Auditors will write its reports in such a way that the figures cannot be distorted for political ends as at present' ."
"Does the Commission not think that its influence on the conduct and report writing of the Court of Auditors is unacceptable both morally and in terms of the Treaty?"
"At the beginning of 1995 the Commission and the Court of Auditors agreed on the Court's initiative, the main substance of which was, as I see it, how to improve the dialogue on the Court's annual report, known as contentious proceedings (procédure contradictoire) between the two institutions."
"The objective was to develop an approach based on expertise and impartiality."
"For this reason both the form and the content of the Court of Auditors report and the Commission's reply were examined."
"A joint effort was thus made with the aim of giving the authority granting discharge, in this case Parliament, more precise documents concerning the Commission and the Court of Auditors."
"The honourable Member also asked in particular what I meant by 'style' and 'substance'."
"By 'style' I mean that only two or three years ago there were considerable tensions and perhaps too much sensitivity in the opinions and exchanges of letters between the Commission and the Court of Auditors."
"This was not a natural relationship between an authority exercising public power and an external auditor."
"We have tried to remove this tension and create a businesslike cooperation."
"As regards the substance we tended sometimes in the past to defend everything irrespective of whether it was defensible or not."
"Now we have tried to ensure that the failings and shortcomings which have appeared in our activities are acknowledged and we will try to remedy them in future."
"If we consider that the Court of Auditors report contains political views, we will defend the Commission's - and the Parliament's and the Council's - right to decide on political guidelines."
"These are the changes relating to the substance."
"I should like to thank the Commissioner for his rather unspecific reply."
"I am obliged to ask whether what the Commissioner calls initiative is the same thing as entering into a kind of code of conduct?"
"To my mind, that is a central issue."
"I would also draw the Commissioner's attention to Article 188b(4) of the Treaty, which reads: ' The members of the Court of Auditors shall, in the general interest of the Community, be completely independent in the performance of their duties."
"In the performance of these duties, they shall neither seek nor take instruction from any government or from any other body.' I have to ask the Commissioner if he does not regard the Commission as another body?"
"I should like to state that my aim has been to make the Court of Auditors' position easier."
"For example, the Court proposed cooperation in order to obtain all the information it needed in the most appropriate form."
"We are prepared to help it in this matter."
"The matter is currently under discussion."
"Concerning the discussion on procedure held at the beginning of the year I can say that if the Court of Auditors wishes to add its remarks to the preliminary comments and discuss the matter with a Member of the Commission, we will arrange a meeting at which it can put forward urgent questions and additional explanations."
"It is up to the Court of Auditors' what it writes in its own report."
"It is of course important that all the facts put forward are accurate and that both sides are heard."
"Conversely we are entitled to write what we ourselves see fit by way of comment on the Court of Auditors report."
"It is to the advantage of both sides that there should be no errors of fact either in the report or in the comments."
"Such errors can be avoided by holding this kind of discussion."
"I can assure the honourable Member that the President and Members of the Court of Auditors are sufficiently independent and reliable that we cannot influence their reports."
"They decide what they write, but it is of course important to them to be able to avoid errors of fact in advance."
"Question No 40 by Vassilis Ephremidis (H-0426/96)"
"Subject: Funding of an unplanned conference centre in Liberty Park (Parko Eleftherias), Athens"
"The Commission intends to fund an 'Athens Conference Centre' under measure 7 of the culture and tourism programme of the second Community support framework, with the Organismos Megarou Musikis as the organization responsible."
"The measure includes the construction of a multi-purpose hall for conferences and ancillary rooms to support conferences, etc. The aim is to upgrade conference tourism with an attendance of 190 000 delegates a year."
"Is the Commission aware that the last Presidential Decree on the subject (Official Journal 1061/95) does not make provision for the conference centre in question and the Greek authority responsible for tourism policy (EOT) has not received any application to fund or approve the operation of a conference centre in Liberty Park (as also stated in parliamentary answers on the subject made by competent ministers)?"
"Does the Commission intend to fund a project which is not envisaged, whose creation and operation has not been approved, for which the source of national funding is unknown and which, as local organizations and inhabitants complain, will have a catastrophic impact on the environment and congestion in the centre of Athens."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission confirms that it intends to co-finance the building of the cultural centre referred to in the Presidential Decree mentioned by the honourable Member, within the framework of the culture and tourism operational programme."
"The Commission's contribution will serve exclusively to fund the equipment and facilities necessary for the holding of conferences."
"This function is explicitly provided for in the Greek law on the founding of the 'Athens Concert Hall' organization."
"According to our information, the approval of the EOT is not necessary."
"Greece's financial contribution to the project, moreover, will be funded from the budget of the Ministry of Culture, and not from the budget of the Greek authority responsible for tourism policy."
"With regard to the project's environmental compatibility, it should be said that the relevant Community provisions are being applied."
"Furthermore, the underground car park that is currently under construction will contribute to relieving traffic congestion in Athens city centre."
"Madam Commissioner, you have said that the Commission confirms the funding of this project."
"When we speak of co-financing we have to be sure that there is a source of national funding for you to co-finance with."
"In my question I say, and I will say it again in case you have not fully understood, that over the course of these developments two competent ministers have stated categorically in the Greek parliament that they are unable to lodge any document on the matter because there is no provision for the creation and operation of this project and that there is absolutely no funding."
"I request you to give a precise answer to this question: are you planning to fund a project for which Greek legislation makes no provision?"
"Moreover, when the project has provoked great resentment in the specific area of Athens because it will destroy..."
"(The President interrupted the speaker) ... give a precise answer because the whole of Athens is up in arms about it."
"I should like to make two comments on the honourable Member's remarks."
"Firstly, Greece's financial contribution will be funded from the budget of the Ministry of Culture."
"The honourable Member did not say if the Greek Minister of Culture has stated otherwise."
"If that is the case, we shall have to investigate the matter - and I shall see to that."
"Secondly, with regard to the question of traffic problems, I have already indicated that the co-financing of the construction of an underground car park will undoubtedly help to resolve some of these problems."
"Question No 41 by Hugh McMahon (H-0539/96)"
"Subject: Delays in agreement of the URBAN initiative"
"With the exception of Northern Ireland no URBAN projects have been agreed for the UK."
"Can the Commission inform Parliament when agreement will be reached? What advice does it give to local authorities which are awaiting URBAN funding, in order to implement community projects for the long-term unemployed and socially excluded in many cities and large towns?"
"Will the Commissioner seek on urgent meeting with Minister David Curry in an attempt to ensure that local authorities are not impeded in implementing projects by Eurosceptic attitudes within the UK administration?"
"Mr President, there have indeed been certain delays in the approval of the URBAN initiative in the United Kingdom."
"Initially, this was because the British authorities had to decide which towns and cities should be chosen for the initiative, and what funding those towns and cities should receive."
"In the subsequent negotiations on the individual programmes, the Commission sought to ensure above all that the latter would concentrate on the needs of the disadvantaged towns and cities themselves."
"We therefore endeavoured to make sure that the local authorities concerned would themselves be able to decide on the use of funds."
"The Commission and the British authorities are at present discussing the establishment of administrative rules that will make possible both a new approach to decision-making and adequate control of the spending mechanisms."
"The Commission is endeavouring to secure an agreement on these rules, so that all the URBAN programmes can be signed as soon as possible."
"I thank the Commissioner for her answer."
"I think the Commission is being very leisurely in this."
"After all, given that the final discussions, between the Commission and the Scottish Office were in November 1995 and they were perfectly satisfied with the scheme, and as I understand the Welsh Office are also satisfied with the Swansea scheme, would the Commission be in favour of allowing those schemes where there has been agreement between the local authorities and the civil servants to go ahead?"
"Scotland and Wales should not be dragging behind because in certain areas of England there have been problems between the UK Government and the Commission."
"Would the Commission treat this matter with some urgency, given that Parliament did increase the amount of money for Community initiatives at a recent plenary session in Brussels."
"Mr McMahon, the problem lies in the fact that we must of course also reach agreement with the British Government, and there was indeed an extended exchange of letters on this subject, during which, in the interest of the inclusion of the local authorities, amongst other things, the Commission requested changes."
"On 22 April, the Commission once again made its position clear."
"At the end of July, further discussions took place, and we hope that the British Government will now give a swift answer, so that the programmes can finally be approved."
"Nevertheless, I would ask the honourable Members to appreciate the fact that we also wish to ensure that the local and regional authorities and local partners are included in the implementation of these programmes as far as possible."
"I too want to thank the Commissioner for the work that she has done in this area."
"Indeed I think other Members of this House, if there were any here, might want to know whether there is a fundamental cultural problem with the UK Government's attitude to structural funds and regional policy?"
"Is this another aspect of the policy of non-cooperation?"
"I think it is very difficult for many people in our inner city areas to understand why they cannot get access to money - over 120 million pounds - which is very badly needed."
"I have just come from a committee meeting where we voted on the principle of partnership and involving local partners."
"I would like to encourage the Commissioner in her work in this area, but of course the reality is that in inner-city areas it is the voluntary sector, the community groups which are taking the strain of the government's lack of commitment to urban areas."
"For us it is not just the principle of involving the local partners - it actually makes good sense because they know the issues on the ground."
"So I would like to encourage the Commissioner to ensure that we get a speedy agreement."
"I also think it is rather bizarre that last week the DTI produced a press release celebrating the massive amount of funding they would be getting from Objective 2 - a bumper share of funds - when in fact they seem incapable of spending it."
"This kind of behaviour in spending funds strains subsidiarity to the limit and, because of the inaction of Member States, inner cities are not benefiting from funds."
"It strains my belief in the principle of subsidiarity."
"I can only express my thanks for the support for our position."
"I do not believe that this has anything to do with the general political climate, but that we have problems agreeing on a procedure which will include local representatives in such a way as to ensure that they are able to promote their main interests in the implementation of the programmes, whilst guaranteeing, above all, that the neediest sections of the population and the urban areas gain the greatest benefit from the programmes."
"We shall continue with our efforts in this respect."
"Taking up what the Commissioner has said in the last few moments, the problem seems to be not so much with the Scottish or Welsh Offices which have both agreed to the projects submitted."
"On the other hand she mentioned that in the interests of the local bodies, the Commission would be asking for changes."
"I would hope there would be no request for changes with the Swansea or the Scottish submissions."
"In other words it is an English responsibility."
"I am unable to give a direct answer to your specific question at present."
"However, we shall look into the matter and, in keeping with the views expressed by the honourable Members today, continue to seek a reasonable settlement. I hope that we can achieve such a settlement in the near future."
"Question No 42 by José Apolinário (H-0540/96)"
"Subject: Bureaucratic delays on the part of the Commission in transferring Community funds to Portugal"
"In the first few months of 1996 there was an intolerable delay in transferring Community funds to Portugal, for bureaucratic reasons."
"One of the most badly affected programmes/initiatives was INTERREG."
"What is going on?"
"How does the Commission justify this situation?"
"Mr President, generally speaking, this criticism does not hold good for Portugal."
"On 15 July 1996, Portugal was the chief beneficiary in the commitment of funds for Objective I regions, and in the front rank in terms of payments."
"Hence the payments to be arranged by DG XVI alone amount to more than ECU 1 billion."
"That is a considerable sum, in my view."
"However, the transfer of funds is subject to numerous requirements."
"As far as INTERREG II is concerned, the amounts indicated in the requests for payment submitted by the Portuguese authorities are not yet sufficient for the 1995 tranche of the programme to be opened and for payment of the first and second advances for 1995 to be effected."
"For these payments to be made, spending for the programme as a whole - and this means for Portugal and Spain - must reach the amount required in the current regulations."
"In general terms, the Commission is currently examining the possibility of speeding up its internal checking procedures, so that in cases where all the requirements are met, payments can be made more quickly."
"This forms part of our joint efforts in the context of SEM 2000 - although it is also a general matter of concern, since we naturally wish all funds to be transferred as swiftly as possible, once all the checks have been carried out."
"Madam Commissioner, thank you very much for your reply but we should look here at three political points."
"First of all, there are delays in transferring Community funds to Portugal."
"In respect of the second Community support framework the processes should be unblocked after two months and at this moment in time there are processes involving around 109 million ECU, in other words 21 billion escudos, processes which have been pending before the Commission since July 1995."
"Secondly, and again in respect of the first Community support framework, there are at this moment in time processes still pending worth around 35 million ECU and that first Community support framework was concluded in 1993 - yet the process for presenting some of them was meant to be completed in 1994 or 1995."
"I acknowledge the efforts made by the Commissioner and her departments in speeding things up but I think that the Commissioner must understand that unless there is a further speeding up of processes in DG XX, the Commission will have to be responsible for the lesser use of Community funds and the lower rates of execution in the second Community support framework."
"I hope that we can manage to resolve the problems which exist without engaging in mutual recriminations."
"During Mr Cravinho's last visit, we explained when the next payments could be expected."
"However, I must ask the honourable Member to appreciate that in managing the enormous amounts of money involved in the Structural Funds, we give priority not only to flexibility and speed, but also to rigorous financial control."
"The Commission and Parliament cannot, on the one hand, constantly attach importance to the necessary checks being carried out with the utmost care and, on the other, complain about those checks when amounts are owing."
"We are endeavouring to speed up our procedures but, unfortunately, careful checks sometimes take longer than we would wish."
"We acknowledge the problem, and we have discussed the outstanding difficulties with the Portuguese Government. In these talks, moreover, I had the impression that there is complete understanding for our position."
"Question No 43 by Mihail Papayannakis (H-0546/96)"
"Subject: Diversion of the River Acheloos"
"The diversion of the River Acheloos is one of the 'major projects' which will be financed in Greece from Community funds."
"In response to a number of questions I have tabled over the last seven years regarding the environmental compatibility and economic usefulness of this project, the Commission has systematically postponed giving a definite answer, stating that its assessment would depend on the findings of successive studies, ongoing negotiations with the Greek Government and even the final form of the project which is sometimes presented as an irrigation project, sometimes as an energy project and sometimes as a water supply project."
"It has been announced over the last few days that the Greek Government is at the last stage of the decision-taking process concerning the final approval of the project."
"Can the Commission say whether it considers that all the legal procedures concerning the drawing-up and approval of the project and the awarding of the construction contract have been respected, what this project consists of exactly and what (sustainable...) development strategy it forms part of, whether the overall assessment of its environmental consequences is positive and, finally, whether its economic profitability is ensured, both at national level and as regards the development of the regions concerned?"
"Mr President, I am afraid that I must disappoint you once again, Mr Papayannakis, since the Commission still does not have a complete file on this subject, and therefore cannot make a definitive statement on the possible co-financing of the River Acheloos project under the second Community support framework for Greece."
"This concerns in particular the results of the comprehensive environmental impact assessment commissioned by the Greek Government and a cost-benefit analysis of the project."
"I must ask for your understanding, therefore, since these are first and foremost matters which the Greek Government has to clarify."
"Then the Commission can adopt a position, and not the other way round."
"You say, Madam Commissioner, that you have absolutely nothing to hand which permits you to judge the project. I take note of that, but just for your information I can tell you that in Greece we are hearing that everything is ready and that the project will shortly be presented to the Greek parliament for approval."
"It is one of the major projects. I should like to ask you whether, in view of the fact that the amounts provided for in the older plans for the Acheloos which were discussed with the Commission are enormous and roughly equal to the amounts that the Greek Government is unable to find for completion of all of the major projects of the Community support framework, you would agree that it would be a good thing to abandon this project, for which no one wishes to assume responsibility, so that a healthier level of funding can be provided for the other major projects?"
"Mr President, it is indeed true that there are a host of unanswered questions with regard to this issue. And I am quite unable to say when those questions will be answered, let alone whether the answers will be satisfactory."
"That is why we have asked the Greek Government to reconsider the priorities for the second Community support framework."
"I would underline the fact, however - and this is the point the honourable Member is making - that the Community support framework is, in any case, at present totally oversubscribed."
"This means that, one way or another, we shall have to reconsider which projects are most important and must definitely be carried out."
"The honourable Member will be aware that the two major motorway projects - Pathe and Via Egnatia, as well as certain others - are still unresolved. Consequently, I believe that the right approach is to establish the priorities and determine what can be funded successfully up to the end of the support period, and what needs such careful clarification that it is perhaps no longer feasible."
"We are currently engaged in such discussions with the Greek Government."
"Question No 44 by Sören Wibe (H-0550/96)"
"Subject: Changing regional support arrangements"
"Administering the structural funds and Community initiatives will require considerable changes in Sweden's regional policy arrangements."
"The fragmentation of structural fund programmes, among three funds and one financial instrument (fisheries), has led to a corresponding fragmentation between various authorities at Swedish national level."
"These authorities have yet to achieve the coordination of their activities."
"It is to take place at regional level (county authorities)."
"This however brings its own complications, as our objective areas do not coincide with administrative borders."
"At the same time we are attempting to avoid creating new administrative structures."
"I believe that the EU's regional policy arrangements are far too complicated."
"Would it not be simpler if the Member States were granted a sum of money allocated on the basis of per capita GNP, taking account of levels of unemployment, population density and climatic conditions?"
"It would then be for the Member States to apportion it among what they regarded as the most appropriate purposes and regions."
"Would this not be a much simpler arrangement than the present muddle?"
"Mr President, administering the Structural Funds is undoubtedly far from easy: firstly, the Structural Fund system has developed over a period of time; secondly, what are sometimes very different problems in the various Member States have to be addressed by means of the Funds; and thirdly, the Structural Fund regulations represent a political compromise and must be adopted unanimously by the Council."
"The aim of Community structural policy is to promote sustainable regional development."
"This requires an analysis of the economic situation of the different regions and their endogenous development potential, as well as concerted action on the part of the European, national and regional authorities."
"That is why the Commission attaches such great importance to the participation of local and regional players and the representatives of the social partners in the planning and implementation of structural measures in the advisory committees."
"Simply equalizing the budget, as advocated in the honourable Member's question, would not achieve this aim and is not wished for either by the Commission or Parliament."
"Furthermore, the legislation in force would not permit it."
"In the new Member States, moreover - and this is also true of Sweden - the Commission's structural policy experiences have been absorbed in a very positive way: they have been felt to enrich national regional policies and transposed to local conditions - although creating appropriate national and regional structures for this purpose has certainly given rise to problems on occasion."
"However, I am convinced that it is in our common interest to simplify the administration of the Structural Funds."
"The Commission is currently trying to simplify and speed up its own procedures."
"We should all be aware, however, that in view of the large amounts of money involved in the implementation of structural policy, there is a fine line to tread between simplification, transparency and flexibility on the one hand, and optimum financial management, efficient control and effective evaluation on the other."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for her answer."
"I must say that the Commissioner's answer was both concise and to the point."
"I am not really used to that but I consider it a good thing in this context."
"There were two considerations which gave rise to my question."
"Firstly, I have seen at close quarters how the Structural Funds are operating in my country and have thus witnessed the enormous administrative burden imposed on our authorities."
"I believe in fact that the administrative costs could amount to a large percentage of the support received by Sweden."
"Secondly, there is the analysis of the effectiveness of the Structural Funds which was recently presented in the Committee on Regional Policy, which concluded that their effectiveness was exceptionally poor; with the exception of Objective 1, the resources involved did not to any great extent go to regions of high unemployment or regions with a low per-capita income."
"I believe the funds need to be reformed and I also consider that they should be reformed in the manner that I have suggested, that is to say that they should be brought closer to those who manage the money."
"My question to the Commissioner is thus the following: should the simplification which you are now talking about and which you are endeavouring to achieve not go in the direction I have outlined, that is to say ensure that those most directly involved in decisions are given a greater say in how resources are used?"
"In the first place, the Structural Fund regulations are valid until 1999."
"They were approved by all the Member States and cannot by changed by a stroke of the pen from the Commission."
"Secondly, the new Structural Fund regulations have been in force since 1994: in other words, they only recently came into full effect, after a difficult period of approval."
"I believe that is important to gather experiences first, before making changes on the grounds of initial difficulties or problems of adaptation."
"Thirdly, it is indeed our aim to integrate the local and regional levels into structural policy to a greater extent."
"In this respect, however, there are problems within Sweden which we cannot resolve, but which can only be sorted out by the Swedish Government, in partnership with the local players."
"As far as any administrative muddle is concerned, we must always bear in mind that there are two kinds of muddle: that caused by the Commission, which we are now trying to clear up within the framework of the regulations currently in force; and the muddle at national level."
"After all, nowhere is it stipulated that, for example, four ministries must be involved in managing a Structural Funds project."
"There is clearly room for simplification at national level in this context too."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"That was certainly a specific and convincing reply, but there is a minor sticking-point in this respect: there is the tendency of the Member States to work out precisely what each of them can get - and this is circulated in the form of lists - and act as if it were their share of the money."
"Would it not be appropriate to take a further step in this direction and, after 1999, to develop the principle of partnership in such a way as to introduce direct cooperation between the Commission and the regions concerned, without the various Member States setting up yet another special intermediate body?"
"That is possible in theory. In practice, however, I doubt that the majority of Member States would allow structural policies to be agreed between the Commission and the regional or local authorities alone."
"The interpretation of the subsidiarity principle hitherto has, of course, principally concerned subsidiarity between the Commission and the Member States."
"However, we have always laid great stress - admittedly, not always with success - on the need to extend application of the subsidiarity principle from the level of central government to the lower levels, and to establish a genuine, practical partnership in the implementation of the Structural Funds."
"And this is not because the Commission is interested in bypassing anyone, but because our experience has shown that the more the people on the ground for whom these policies are devised become involved, can contribute their ideas and also help to monitor efficiency, then the more success we achieve."
"Question No 45 by Edgar Schiedermeier (H-0551/96)"
"Subject: Future of the Structural Funds"
"What are the prospects of support from the structural funds for the post-1999 period?"
"Mr President, I wondered whether I should say that we had a very intensive discussion on this matter at the last meeting of the Committee on Regional Policy, since this is indeed an issue which would warrant a statement of at least an hour."
"Leaving aside the discussion in the Committee on Regional Policy, however, I would simply say that the Commission's proposals for the future of the Structural Funds can certainly not be expected before the end of 1997 or early 1998."
"Naturally, this applies to the financial issues as well as demarcation of the assisted areas."
"For the moment, the Commission will produce its report on economic and social cohesion in the European Union in late autumn of this year, thereby creating a basis for further discussions at national and Community level."
"I am sure that we shall debate this report extensively in the Committee on Regional Policy - and possibly also in plenary - and that we shall be able to take the necessary elements from these debates and incorporate them into structural policy for the period after 1999."
"Mr President, I readily admit that I enjoy listening to the charming Commissioner, as well as seeing her here."
"When I tabled this question, however, I was unaware that she would be speaking on this subject in the Committee on Regional Policy."
"I should like to put a very specific supplementary question: will the Commissioner seek to ensure that, when the Structural Funds are reorganized, the Objective 1 regions lose some of their spare fat?"
"I come from an Objective 5b region, and I am concerned that those regions sometimes lose out because all the other regions insist on keeping what they have."
"Mr Schiedermeier, if by the 'spare fat' of the Objective 1 regions you mean support for achieving or surpassing the goal of having a GDP which is 75 % of the Union's average, then I believe that we must examine very carefully how we are dealing with these regions. Indeed, the aim of structural policy is clearly to help the disadvantaged regions - and one way in which we define being disadvantaged is in terms of a percentage of the Union's average GDP."
"If this criterion is to be retained in future, then we must draw the necessary conclusions."
"I believe that we must have a far wider-ranging debate on this subject."
"This is one element of that debate, and we shall have to discuss it further."
"Question No 46 by Joan Vallvé (H-0563/96)"
"Subject: Cohesion funds and public deficits"
"The failure by Member States to comply with the convergence criterion laid down in the Maastricht Treaty concerning public deficits as a percentage of GDP will entail a suspension of Cohesion Fund aid as a means of mitigating the adverse effects thereof."
"How does the Commission intend to introduce this measure?"
"Will it temporarily halt the aid which comes under this fund until the criterion is complied with once again?"
"Mr President, the legal situation is clear."
"Pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation 1164/94, decisions on the continuation, suspension or resumption of Cohesion Fund payments are taken on the basis of the yearly targets for public deficits recommended by the Council under Article 104c(7)."
"It should be pointed out that the Council addressed corresponding recommendations for 1995 to the governments of Greece, Portugal and Spain."
"The Commission examined the budgetary situation for 1995 in the Member States concerned, and established that the public deficits of all three lay within the targets for 1995 recommended by the Council."
"Consequently, the Commission is continuing to authorize new Cohesion Fund projects or project phases in Greece, Portugal and Spain."
"A new assessment of the public deficits of the Member States concerned will be made in autumn 1996, and subsequently every six months."
"I thank you for your answer, Commissioner, but my question went a little further than that."
"It did not refer so much to the legal situation as to the criteria which the Commission is currently applying for the suspension of Cohesion Fund aid, if Member States fail to comply with the criteria for convergence."
"Mr Vallvé, the payments will only be suspended if the reference values laid down by the Council in its recommendations are exceeded."
"For 1995, those values were - as a ratio of public deficit to GDP - 10.7 % for Greece, 5.8 % for Portugal and 5.9 % for Spain."
"All three Member States stayed below their respective reference values, and it was therefore not necessary to block the funds."
"However, the Cohesion Fund regulations do contain an element of conditionality, and so we have no choice but to act accordingly if the reference values are exceeded."
"The Commission has no other decision-making options."
"Question No 47 by James Nicholson (H-0574/96)"
"Subject: Special support programme for peace and reconciliation"
"Is the Commission satisfied with the progress of the Peace and Reconciliation Programme for Northern Ireland?"
"Is it satisfied with the financial controls and monitoring of the programme?"
"Mr President, the Commission takes the view that the progress of the Peace and Reconciliation Programme for Northern Ireland has been satisfactory."
"Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the political aspect of the peace process."
"It is true that the programme approved by the Commission on 28 July did not give rise to a great deal of expenditure in 1995."
"This slow start was mainly due to the fact that a network of decentralized bodies had to be set up to distribute the funds."
"Not until December 1995 was the Commission able to sign the corresponding contracts with the intermediate financing institutions and, as the honourable Member will be aware, agreeing on the composition of the partnership committee for Northern Ireland and the regional partnerships was also far from easy."
"According to our estimates, ECU 70 million of the total ECU 240 m of Community funding for the programme for Northern Ireland should be disbursed in 1996."
"A further ECU 28 m out of a total ECU 60 m should be disbursed in the Irish border regions."
"So we believe that almost a third of the total funding for the programme will be committed by the end of the year."
"Apart from the figures for expenditure effected, the Commission is satisfied with the progress of the programme's implementation on the ground."
"Thus the progress made with regard to the 26 partnerships is particularly encouraging, in the sense that people who were previously unaccustomed to discussing and taking joint decisions on the future development of their region are now working together in this context."
"With regard to the financing, I would underline the fact that the bodies appointed to run the programme have carried out numerous financial controls."
"The quality of these controls has been satisfactory."
"The ability to carry out adequate financial management was, moreover, a key criterion in the selection of these bodies."
"The Commission and the relevant governmental departments are providing those who are less familiar with the Union's financing methods - the intermediate financing institutions and the partnerships, for example - with technical assistance where necessary."
"I wish to thank the Commissioner for a very full response on this particular fund."
"Of course, when I tabled the question a number of weeks ago, Commissioner, times were different."
"However, I would prefer to deal with this at this moment of time."
"You would probably agree with me that it has taken a long time to get the fund up and running and for it to be seen as real finance that is coming into the province."
"It also seems to me that there is excessive officialdom and red tape."
"Some of that is the responsibility of the United Kingdom Government, but some of it is also the responsibility of Brussels."
"There appears to be a difficulty in arriving at a meeting of minds which leads to a tremendous degree of confusion, and projects are slowed down as a result."
"Will you ensure, as the Commissioner, that European officials - which is your responsibility and my responsibility - do not make unrealistic demands on projects, ultimately rendering them useless?"
"Is the Commissioner further aware that substantial amounts of the funds are going to consultants to prepare glossy brochures and reports?"
"Surely this is not the aim and object of the exercise?"
"Mr Nicholson, you will be aware that I personally have been pressing strongly for swift action, and that I also take great pains to ensure that we actually decide on projects."
"I therefore regularly ask to see the lists of approved projects, which then lead to corresponding payments."
"When I look at the host of activities that are now being initiated - and I asked to see a schedule of the decisions once again today - my feeling is that we have been making considerable efforts. I would even go so far as to say that we are acting more swiftly in the case of Northern Ireland than in the case of other regions."
"A short while ago, we were discussing the implementation of the URBAN initiative in United Kingdom, where the approval and implementation of the programme for Belfast, for example, is viewed with some envy. You will see, therefore, that there is a considerable difference between the normal procedures and the efforts being made to implement the programme for Northern Ireland."
"Nevertheless, I shall continue my endeavours, and I should be grateful to the honourable Member for any specific indications as to where snags may be occurring."
"And if he thinks that these snags are the fault of the Commission, then he must let me know directly."
"With regard to the question of consultants, we are, of course, frequently faced with the problem that those who do not know their way around so well depend on the help of consultants."
"I would stress, however, that enlisting technical help does not necessarily mean employing consultants and spending part of the funds on consultancies and similar bodies. On the contrary, the local partnerships and community groups, for example, can use the technical assistance which is available to help them draw up their proposals."
"I listened to the Commissioner with interest and of course to Mr Nicholson beforehand."
"Today like other Members I received a copy of the priorities for the Irish presidency."
"There are chapters in this entitled 'A Europe based on Equity and Tolerance' and 'A Europe contributing to International Peace, Security and Solidarity' ."
"Like Mr Nicholson's question, this was written before the recent developments."
"Does the Commissioner feel that greater priority ought to be put into the peace initiatives in Northern Ireland by the Irish presidency than hitherto and will the Commission lend its support to specific programmes to assist the situation in Ireland as a whole?"
"Mr Evans, you will be aware that the Commission's programme for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the border regions of Ireland is geared to rapid help and support for the peace process."
"We know that the people of the region want that process, and that with the help, amongst other things, of the Commission's programme, they are learning to cooperate with one another."
"And even if it has sometimes taken rather a long time for the funds to become available on the ground, the process of bringing together groups from different religious and cultural backgrounds to engage in joint discussions has already helped to create a substantial part of the structures which the funds are designed to support."
"I shall therefore greatly welcome it if the Irish presidency - and, in view of the events of last week, I am sure that it will do so - places a new, additional emphasis on these initiatives and gives them its full political support."
"Question No 48 by María Izquierdo Rojo (H-0579/96)"
"Subject: Specific support and advice for human resources projects for women in disadvantaged regions"
"Although there is a clear will to extend the application of the equal opportunities principle, women in disadvantaged regions in practice receive less favourable treatment with regard to benefiting from regional support policies; a lack of entrepreneurial tradition, a climate of social precariousness and a lack of knowledge of complex procedures between different administrations are some of the major obstacles which make it difficult or impossible for many European women from disadvantaged areas to benefit from these support measures."
"Would it therefore be possible to provide specific technical support, direct advice services and simpler administrative procedures?"
"What action could be taken?"
"Mr President, access to information and services is indeed very difficult for undertakings in the Union's disadvantaged regions, which are the priority target of Structural Fund assistance."
"In these regions, women as a whole participate in working life to a lesser extent than in other parts of the Union."
"In rural areas, moreover, they are included to a lesser extent in agricultural groupings and professional associations."
"In Spain, for example, the supply of financial services and services for undertakings is particularly limited in rural areas."
"However, the entrepreneurial tradition is not necessarily less pronounced in the countries of southern Europe than in the north."
"The proportion of self-employed women in the southern Member States - Spain, Greece, Portugal and Italy - in the agricultural and services sectors is actually higher than the Community average."
"In Denmark, for example, only 3 % of working women are self-employed, compared to 21 % in Portugal, 20 % in Greece, 18 % in Italy and 16 % in Spain."
"So with a view to incorporating the equal opportunities dimension into all Community policies, Structural Fund assistance must be geared to harnessing this potential, by encouraging and helping women to set up businesses or become self-employed."
"The support measures in favour of women are aimed at bolstering their entrepreneurial spirit and providing incentives for business initiatives."
"Hence in the regional development programmes, as well as at inter-regional level, there is provision for specific measures to facilitate women's access to information."
"In certain countries of the Union - for example, Sweden - this is already more or less a reality."
"Experience with such advice centres in Sweden - as well as in Ireland and Spain - has shown that specific advice is especially important in the startup phase, and that the dissemination of positive experiences has an encouraging and motivating effect."
"The Commission is endeavouring to identify and encourage practices whose effectiveness is proven."
"It therefore recently published, for the first time, a brochure on women as players in regional development, so as to demonstrate what can be successfully achieved in the various countries and regions of the Community."
"The Commission's guidelines for the new Objective 2 period refer for the first time to equal opportunities as one of four key goals of support policy."
"Furthermore, in the context of pilot projects, the Commission will promote the setting-up and expansion of regional information and business centres for women."
"In the URBAN pilot projects, under Article 10, there is provision for specific measures to promote equal opportunities through the strengthening of partnerships and involvement of the public."
"The URBAN II Community initiative includes support measures for the promotion of equal opportunities and the creation of jobs for women."
"And although equal opportunities are not specifically referred to in the pilot projects under Article 10 in terms of regional planning, I have instructed my services to take this criterion into account in the process of selection and evaluation."
"In future, consideration could also be given to promoting, through the Euro-partnerships, the development of commercial cooperation between undertakings owned or run by women, and placing particular emphasis on these businesses in the list drawn up for such arrangements."
"I believe that over the last few months, we have demonstrated that we are not simply using the concept of 'mainstreaming' as an embellishment for our policies, but also wish to translate it into practice."
"I should like to thank the Commissioner for her positive answer to my question."
"Indeed, the problem with which we are faced is how to make this support for women a reality."
"I agree with what the Commissioner said, but I should like to draw attention to something else: in these very disadvantaged regions - those covered by Objective 1 - there is a prevailing culture of 'machismo' ."
"The situation of women in these regions cannot be compared to those of women in Denmark or the other Nordic countries, where 'machismo' is less pronounced. Furthermore, they live in the poorest regions of the poorest Member States."
"Everything is stacked against these women, who are in need of this support."
"So I believe that the Commissioner's answer will pave the way for a joint effort - an effort which, as far as the regional aspects are concerned, the women of Andalusia must carry out jointly with the Commission."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your positive reply, which makes clear your readiness to promote the situation of women."
"I should like to make one specific comment: the extent to which a region is disadvantaged is naturally taken into account in deciding the amount of Structural Fund aid to be provided, and Andalusia - which the honourable Member mentioned at the end of her speech - therefore rightly receives a large proportion of the support funds."
"If I see things correctly, however, there are many very enterprising women in Andalusia - not least at the political level - and I have come to the conclusion that it cannot, in general, be said that the women of the southern Member States are less active in certain fields than those of the northern Member States."
"I believe that in terms of the Union's support policy in this area, the important thing is to create networks so that women can learn from one another."
"This also facilitates exchanges of experience as regards successful projects and the ways in which the activities of women in quite different situations in both rural and urban areas can be supported."
"If the honourable Member looks at the brochure to which I referred, she will see that it contains some good examples not only from the northern, but also from the southern Member States, and we shall continue to take advantage of this situation to promote these policies and support women in their endeavours."
"Question No 49 by Inger Schörling (H-0598/96)"
"Subject: Support for businesswomen"
"In connection with Commissioner Wulf-Mathies' visit to Sweden, there have recently been reports in the Swedish press of a promise of fresh support for businesswomen."
"The scheme was to be set up this autumn and the aid paid direct to women's networks by the Commission."
"What form will this support take?"
"Who can apply, and what amounts will be involved?"
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for her reply."
"Unfortunately, I was unable to attend the conference in Luleå but I understand that a great many exciting issues were discussed there."
"As I wrote in my question, various reports have appeared in Swedish newspapers concerning the promised support."
"As a parliamentarian and former advisor to small businesses and cooperatives and to businesswomen and women's networks I receive many questions concerning what kind of support exists and now of course also about this new support."
"I have been unable to provide any correct answers as to what support exists."
"I must therefore have a clear answer: is there new support?"
"Has new money been made available or has 'old money' been reallocated and turned into a new form of support?"
"If so, should this money be paid out directly by the Commission and not through the Member States?"
"The funds for the specific pilot projects to which I referred are resources which are at the Commission's disposal in the context of Community initiatives and pilot projects."
"They represent new resources for the Member States in that they have not been distributed hitherto, but have been released in tranches."
"However, in view of the fact that we have at our disposal around ECU 170 billion for the period 1994 to 1999 for the Union's structural policies overall, they do not represent new resources as such."
"In any event, they do not form part of the established programmes for the Member States; the Commission will publish invitations to tender for these resources in the Official Journal of the European Communities, which will then make it possible to apply directly to the Commission."
"Biology and medicine (Bioethics Convention) (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report (A4-0190/96) by Mr Pelttari, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the Draft Convention on the protection of human rights and the dignity of the human being, with regard to the application of biology and medicine (Bioethics Convention)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, some people have questioned whether the European Parliament should become involved with the draft Bioethics Convention on which the Council of Europe has been working for so many years."
"Some people have also said that we could save ourselves a great deal of time and unnecessary work, since the convention will, in any event, have no legal force."
"Both these views are wrong."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights did not undertake to produce this report lightly."
"On the contrary, despite our different experiences of life and our different political standpoints, we all agreed that Parliament has a certain responsibility in this area."
"The Bioethics Convention establishes certain pointers and guidelines in important scientific and medical fields."
"Many people have placed great hopes in these fields, so we must ensure that the pointers and guidelines are the right ones."
"As the only directly elected representatives of 370 million people in the European Union, it is our duty to say what we think about protecting human rights and human dignity in applying biology and medicine, and to try to influence what a convention like this actually says."
"This is why this detailed report by Mr Pelttari is so important."
"My group will be voting for the report, provided one thing is clear: that human dignity is paramount."
"It will not do to leave fundamental questions open."
"It would be criminal if we allowed for even the possibility of unscrupulous human testing."
"Consider the question of tests on people who are unable to give their consent."
"They could be sick, disabled or young children."
"Let me give you an example from the past."
"In my home town in Germany, there is a children's home run by the Church."
"At the beginning of the 1940s, 50 gypsy children living there were tested to identify any special racial characteristics."
"When the doctors were satisfied with their results, the children were taken to a concentration camp and killed."
"There are various points in the Council of Europe's draft Bioethics Convention where the possibility is not entirely ruled out that such terrible things might be repeated, and Mr Pelttari has not come down on these points heavily enough."
"Some of the amendments he proposes even take a more moderate line, and the Group of the Party of European Socialists refuses to go along with this."
"We have tabled amendments with three basic objectives."
"We wish to see unconditional protection for human dignity; we wish to prevent life in any form from being treated as a commodity; and we want a public debate on forward-looking ethical issues in the fields of biology and medicine."
"What does unconditional protection for human dignity mean in practice?"
"It means, for example, that we will spare people terrible pain if it is of no benefit to them."
"It is therefore right that we should allow medical tests to be carried out on those who cannot give their consent only in certain clearly defined and exceptional cases, as specified quite clearly in paragraph 12.1."
"Parliament must make it quite clear to the Council of Europe that there can be no way round this."
"Next, what do we mean exactly when we say that human life must not be allowed to be treated as a commodity?"
"I am thinking here, for example, of in vitro fertilization, which places an enormous physical and psychological strain on women."
"This is where we need to tighten up Mr Pelttari's proposals."
"We must make it quite clear that the embryos produced are only to be used for the treatment of the individual woman concerned."
"This should not mean, however, that a woman has to go through the whole medical procedure every time she wants to attempt an in vitro fertilization, which is why it must be possible for as many embryos to be created as are necessary to complete the woman's treatment."
"If we do not specify this, there is a risk that any embryos left over will be used for tests, so we must make it clear that this is not allowed."
"The third of my group's demands is for a public debate on the Bioethics Convention."
"The people of Europe must be allowed to have their say on matters of such importance."
"The secrecy which has surrounded the work on this convention in recent years is extremely suspicious, and we, as the elected representatives of the citizens of the European Union, must make this point quite clear."
"There will then be a good chance that the Bioethics Convention produced will be one to which the European Union is prepared to accede later."
"My group has proposed amendments to clarify the commendable work already done by Mr Pelttari, and I would ask you to support them."
"Mr President, it is important that the Council of Europe is drawing up a convention on the protection of human rights and human dignity in the application of biotechnology."
"It is also good that the European Parliament is taking up a position on this matter."
"Biotechnology is an up and coming area of science, research and industry."
"We must support its development in the interests of increasing Europe's competitiveness in its fight for markets with Japan and the United States."
"In this connection it is important to take account of the common European ethical viewpoints and the respect of human dignity, because biotechnology combines both ethical and economic interests."
"I should like in this connection to thank Mr Pelttari for his very good report and for the amendments which he has made."
"This reflects the Finnish ethical view which quite unambiguous and transcends party boundaries."
"At the same time it also generally reflects the views of my own EPP Group."
"The Council of Europe's conventions acquire the force of law when the States have ratified them."
"They create guidelines for worldwide activity and in my opinion they have an important role in laying down the foundations and the framework for the way in which legislation in this area should develop."
"The European Union cannot accede to this convention as a legal entity, but this could still be changed, for example at the IGC."
"In my opinion the Parliament should stress this possibility, as Mr Pelttari mentioned in his speech today."
"The drafting of legislation on biotechnology is currently a topical and indeed urgent subject, because the applications of biotechnology are arising at an ever increasing rate both in medicine and in other areas of research which make use of biotechnology."
"Similarly in many countries, including Finland, legislation is currently being drafted on this subject."
"Applications of biotechnology, for example genetic technology, are used in medicine to help people, e.g. cancer patients."
"One of the best known applications is in-vitro fertilization or artificial fertilization outside the womb."
"It has helped many childless families to overcome their problem."
"Biotechnology has also opened up many new prospects for the early diagnosis of particular diseases at the embryo stage and for treatment at the same stage."
"This possibility must not be overlooked."
"Biotechnology, when used in accordance with legal and ethical standards, is a great boon to humanity, and benefits mankind in many ways."
"Used in the wrong way it presents many threats, which at worst could lead even to the manipulation of the human genome."
"This gives rise to fears among the general public and must be prevented without delay."
"We know that, in accordance with the Hippocratic oath, doctors on the whole have high moral and ethical standards and accept their duty to protect human life and promote health by all possible means."
"But there are those working in biotechnology who are not bound by that oath."
"That being so, common standards must be created."
"The Council of Europe's convention and the opinion being drafted by Parliament are founded on an ethically and morally sustainable basis in contemporary form."
"However, they do not go so far as to hinder, for example, the applications of genetic engineering from being used to prevent and treat diseases."
"That being so, from a medical point of view, this proposal provides a basis inter alia for the work of doctors and at the same time it protects patients and society from the abuses they fear."
"In my opinion, this reflects the opinion of the EPP and public opinion in Finland."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group, I too should like to congratulate Mr Pelttari on his work in conjunction with this report on the Bioethics Convention."
"In committee, we voted in favour of this report, because we believe that certain crucial aspects of it deserve our full support."
"I shall mention some of these: trading in human embryos, foetuses or foetal tissue must be forbidden by law, as must research into human embryos and production of them for the purposes of research; only as many embryos should be produced as are required for transplanting, and not more than three; the preservation of embryos by deep freezing should be permitted only in exceptional circumstances for medical reasons; intervention in the human genome for the purpose of changing, or bringing about a change in, the germ line must be forbidden by law; any transmission of the findings of genetic tests should be prohibited; predictive tests should only be authorized for life-threatening conditions for which effective treatment is currently possible; research on persons who do not have the capacity to consent should only be permitted in exceptional circumstances, if the legal representative has given his assent freely and in full knowledge of the facts, if the person concerned does not object, if the research is closely linked to the subject's illness, if the research cannot be carried out on persons able to give consent and if the research is likely to benefit the health of the person concerned."
"Further, the protection of the dignity and rights of individuals is of absolute priority as compared with any social or third-party interest, and the results of human genome research work must be freely available."
"Finally, as the report states, it is desirable to establish publicly accessible data bases containing details of the legal texts and revealing the existence of research."
"My group fully agrees with all these points; therefore, just as it did in committee, it intends to vote in favour of these principles in plenary too."
"Naturally, much will depend on which amendments are adopted: in fact, our group disagrees with some of these."
"In conclusion, I would commend the rapporteur once again and thank him on behalf of the Union for Europe Group for all his hard work."
"Mr President, I should firstly like to say that the Confederal Group of the European United Left-Nordic Green Left supports this report in principle, provided certain amendments which seek to safeguard human dignity and the right of women to decide for themselves with regard to this issue are adopted."
"Secondly, we believe that this report represents a step forward."
"However, two sets of considerations have to be balanced: on the one hand, the interests of the biotechnology industry, which wishes to patent genes and a whole series of processes - and here we can set an example to the United States as regards respect for human dignity, taking the United Nations as a reference point; and on the other, the need to safeguard the right of women, of human beings, to decide their own future, without being subjected to tyranny of any kind."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is worth reminding ourselves that we are discussing an own-initiative report, and hence a resolution with no legal value whatsoever."
"In other words, there is no legislative procedure under way; this House is not commenting on a proposal from the Commission."
"No, this is merely an opinion offered by the European Parliament to the Council of Europe, which is drawing up a convention on bioethics."
"What prompted Parliament to express its views?"
"Was it perhaps to encourage the Council to conclude its work without delay, in order to have the convention as soon as possible?"
"Unfortunately not."
"If one reads the text approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs, despite the dissenting votes of the PSE Group - to which I have the honour of belonging - the Greens and the United Left, and the abstention of the ELDR Group, including the rapporteur, the spirit of this resolution becomes crystal clear."
"The intention is to place a series of restrictions on scientific research, focusing in particular on artificial insemination: limitations and restrictions inspired by a moral code which not all of us share."
"The Council of Europe will follow its own course; it will, in its wisdom, leave in the protocols anything which cannot easily be accommodated in the convention itself. The convention will be approved - as soon as possible, we hope - and, like all conventions, it will undergo the usual signatures and ratification by various Member States."
"In the meantime, what purpose will this resolution have served?"
"Unfortunately, if it is approved, and especially if drafted as at present, it will merely serve to lend weight to attitudes which I do not hesitate to describe as reactionary, and to die-hard attempts to reopen the debate in our countries regarding legislation on abortion - for which women have fought long and hard - and to limit access to artificial insemination."
"If that is the case, with the greatest respect and esteem for the rapporteur, Mr Pelttari, and above all for the commitment and passion of Mrs Gebhardt, it will be far better if this resolution, especially in its present form, is not adopted."
"Mr President, the Pelttari report is a good one: it is just as rigorous and thorough as the European Parliament's previous resolution of 16 March 1989."
"In this field as no other, ladies and gentlemen, the texts of the European Parliament and the Council of Europe are taken as guidelines for national legislation."
"In fact, the sensitivity and difficulty of the subject, scientific uncertainty, the unprecedented nature of the moral questions confronting us all, and the risk of restricting and sacrificing research, confer on the two European parliamentary assemblies an extra degree of responsibility and trust, for the very reason that they are broadly representative of different cultures, diverse sensibilities and the richest, widest-ranging ethical values."
"Mr Pelttari's report has the merit of not avoiding the most insidious question: might not this convention and its protocols place too narrow a strait-jacket on medical research, in view of the purpose of such research, which after all is beneficial to mankind?"
"The answer is no."
"The age in which we live, so rich in achievements in every field, confronts us with an alarming discrepancy between what is technically possible and what is ethically acceptable - namely what does not damage human dignity, rightly defined by the rapporteur as indivisible."
"There is of course no intention to halt scientific progress, just as science was not halted by the Nuremberg Code or the Helsinki Declaration."
"It is a question not of pitting ethics against progress, but of preventing the misuse of technical potential from rebounding against mankind."
"That is why, in most countries, ethics committees are drawing up what are real ethical protocols and - as in Italy within the past few days - a legal statute of the embryo, which at last is no longer ambiguous, setting out the need for the legal protection of embryos, equal to that for each and every one of us."
"We know that a parallel humanity exists in refrigerators the world over, which is waiting to be welcomed into our midst."
"It is difficult to come to terms with an entity so tiny and complete as an embryo."
"But only if we acknowledge the human wholeness of the embryo, a purely scientific and thus objective concept, will we be able to define its human dignity, the legal protection to which it is entitled and, ultimately, the respect which it deserves from all of us, including researchers."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is the human embryo a fully-fledged human being?"
"The Italian bioethics committee has declared that the embryo is one of us."
"So there we have it: it is a form of life and deserves protection, rights and respect."
"The committee has produced and published a document entitled 'Identity and statute of the human embryo' , and for the first time, we in Italy can state decisively that the embryo - or the female egg fertilized by male sperm - is not a thing, but forms part of humankind, and that its personal identity exists from the moment of fertilization, in other words as from conception."
"As always, the question arises: when does an embryo start to be one of us, a European citizen in fact, and in what ways can it be used?"
"Once again, the committee repeats that a human being becomes one at the moment of conception, and allows science to work only with dead embryos."
"Although many people think that an embryo is human as from the fourteenth day, the document drawn up by this Italian committee of experts states that the various nuclei of life which precede the formation of the single embryo are themselves already individuals and are therefore untouchable; right from the moment of conception, that is to say."
"I think that the Pelttari report merits a good deal of attention: in a very responsible and capable way, it outlines the arguments for life and the need to protect the embryo; for my part, I shall vote in favour of it as it stands."
"Nevertheless, we have to catch and run with this ball once and for all, go beyond the bounds of this report, and resolve to draw up a statute and a law designed exclusively to protect the embryo."
"Again and again, of course, we are confronted by the problems of industry which, in championing the cause of human health and our right to treatment, urges us to come out in favour of the directive which would make it possible to patent living and non-living beings, including man, by enticing us with arguments about increased employment and raising the spectre of an invasion, in the field of biotechnology, by American and Japanese multinationals."
"Yet again, however, the European Parliament is refusing to face the facts, namely that in the UK 9000 embryos - 9000 human beings - are soon to be slaughtered like mad cows, if no one comes to their rescue."
"I did ask for an urgent resolution on the subject at this part-session, but my request was completely ignored."
"What is certain is that we must come to a final decision, in all consciousness, as responsible citizens."
"Certainly, once we decide that embryos are human beings, we shall have to revise our attitude to abortion and - why not - begin to clamp down on all moves towards euthanasia."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Pelttari report looks, amongst other things, at the dilemma of freedom of research and the ethical restrictions imposed on it."
"The question remains as to whether everything that is technically possible in biological terms is also desirable, both from the point of view of protection and the rights of the individual."
"The report contains two points, paragraphs 12.5 and 12.10, from the opinion of the Committee on Research and Technology, both of which place the rights of the human embryo above those of the individual, in other words the genetic parents."
"In my view and that of the Liberal Group, this is going too far."
"Paragraph 12.5 states that the preservation of embryos by deep freezing should be permitted only in exceptional circumstances, and only on medical grounds."
"This means that women will be forced to undergo further painful medical treatment unnecessarily even where multiple fertilization has occurred."
"A clear case of male morality."
"If we approve biomedical techniques such as in vitro fertilization, then we also have to accept the consequences and give parents the right to self-determination when it comes to the preservation of embryos."
"Paragraph 12.10 denies future parents the right to have genetic tests to detect serious congenital defects, and we have to wonder whether this is really in the interests of the unborn child."
"Mr President, the idea of establishing a regulatory framework for biomedical research applications which will ensure that, as they are developed, the rights and dignity of persons are taken into account, undoubtedly represents a step forward."
"The aim of the convention which is the subject of this report is to remove from the discretion of the major pharmaceutical and health industries the ability to set the limits of those applications, on the grounds that they may be tempted to do so on the basis of their own interests."
"However, there are still some loose ends, to which attention should be drawn: for example, the encouragement of technological research and development is not made totally subordinate to the need to protect the rights, independence and freedom of choice of persons."
"Certain amendments would severely restrict that freedom of choice - and especially the freedom of choice of women - as regards the ability to benefit from scientific progress."
"Moreover, not enough consideration is given to the harm which may be caused by genetic engineering, and this concern cannot be dismissed with the argument that technological backwardness which is damaging to industry must be avoided."
"Science is a means, and not an end."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking in my personal capacity, but reflecting on a very intense discussion of this report within the delegation of the Partito Democratico della Sinistra to the Socialist Group."
"I must confess that I feel a deep sense of unease."
"It is my impression that we, the European Parliament, have embarked on a road which could lead to a hasty and inadequate result, and which with no doubt at all will bring us face to face with a complex set of issues and questions which are in all our minds."
"As I see it, at least, these are issues and questions which do not and cannot have any immediate, easily identifiable, clear-cut political or legal value."
"One cannot discuss these matters without bearing in mind, in general terms, the current state of scientific research, without taking account of the moral dimension, of religious and philosophical beliefs, and of our culturally determined, intrinsic sensibilities and points of view, which caution us all to be circumspect and respectful in a Europe made up of religions, sensibilities and points of view, and which has not one but many cultures, many outlooks, to cherish and protect."
"I wonder, then, if it might have been more worthwhile to await finalization of the draft currently being drawn up by the Council of Europe, and then to subject it to careful appraisal."
"Is it a good idea to become involved here and now, on the basis of a draft which has not yet gone before the Assembly?"
"Is this a good idea, given that a Parliament might take - or believe that it has taken - highly complex decisions on the basis of political alignments or votes, cast perhaps without full knowledge of the facts, or in any event in ways which leave inadequate scope for personal conviction?"
"I believe that full freedom of conscience should be allowed in the vote on the report which is before us, bearing in mind - as far as the so-called statute of the embryo is concerned - that nothing can be done while some claim that embryos are mere clusters of cells, to be produced and used at will, and others recognize them to all intents and purposes as persons, with a statute and rights equal in all respects to those of fully-formed individuals."
"In any case, we must be aware that our vote will not put an end to this debate, which will remain open and which is above all a matter for cool and reasoned appraisal."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow draftsman for the PPE Group in the Committee on Research, I should like to comment on some of the amendments which secured a majority."
"The Bioethics Convention is the first international agreement to give a clear definition of the limits of research and medical intervention in humans and to confirm the rights of the individual in relation to science."
"It also guarantees that medical and scientific ethics are respected."
"But although every country might be calling for a proper balance between human rights and scientific progress, the different philosophical and cultural sensitivities involved make it very difficult to produce rules which are universally acceptable."
"This is evident from the very fact that the title of the convention has been changed to the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine."
"Biomedical research is not an end in itself, it is for the benefit of mankind."
"The preservation of health and the reduction of suffering are high ethical values which form worthy objectives."
"It should be made clear that these ethical values are being upheld."
"Biomedical research on humans is normally carried out only on those who have been clearly informed about what is involved and have expressly given their consent."
"Only in exceptional cases does research have to be carried out on those who are unable to give their consent, mainly in paediatrics, psychiatry, neurology, and in the case of research into age-related diseases."
"In such instances, it is often not possible to use people who are able to give their consent, so the tests must be carried out on those who cannot."
"If we want to help those suffering from Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease in the future, for example, we need to be able to do tests on patients with these diseases."
"They may be just blood tests, a computer tomography or simple psychological tests, and these really should be allowed."
"The problem here is how to distinguish between ethically justifiable tests and improper tests in a legal document which is necessarily very general and inflexible."
"Would it not be better for the wording of the convention to be more liberal, and to have implementing provisions which go into possible abuses in detail, rather than for the convention alone to be formulated so inflexibly?"
"These are considerations which I have covered in my amendments."
"On in vitro fertilization, the motion for a resolution says that no more than three embryos should be implanted into a woman in a single menstrual cycle, and that the preservation of embryos should be permitted only in exceptional circumstances if the planned implantation within the cycle is not possible for medical reasons."
"This is the same wording as is used in Germany's Embryo Protection Law of December 1990, which Germans have found entirely acceptable."
"I would also stress in this context that only research which is for the direct benefit of the embryos concerned is justified, and that consumptive research of any kind using living embryos should be totally prohibited."
"We support Mr Pelttari's report and his motion for a resolution."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have the opportunity to say a few words on a subject as important as bioethics. In particular, I should like to thank Mr Pelttari and Mr Tannert for having raised the issue on which I addressed the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights at the end of April."
"This subject calls for reflection on our part as the scope of biological technology is extended."
"These new technologies are already bringing us - and promise to bring in the future - many new products in the health and agri-food sectors."
"As a result of advanced research, our industries are already having a decisive influence on the quality of life of European citizens."
"Together with the advent of information technology, the developments in this sector are amongst the most important of the late twentieth century."
"We must take account of all their implications in order to keep abreast of them and control them effectively."
"In particular, this means considering the ethical questions which they raise and monitoring them continuously."
"The European Parliament has always devoted the utmost attention to these difficult issues."
"When required to do so, it has also helped the Commission and the Council to take account of this aspect of our society."
"The fact that there have been several initiatives by the Union in this field is largely due to Parliament's prompting."
"There are two main points I should like to make in respect of your motion for a resolution on the forthcoming Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine of the Council of Europe, first of all on the accession of the Community to the convention and, secondly, on the way in which the Commission always seeks to incorporate the demands and basic principles of bioethics in its measures."
"As its title clearly states, the draft Council of Europe convention primarily deals with human rights."
"At present, however, the Community does not have the competence to accede to the Convention on Human Rights."
"The Court of Justice has just reminded us of this quite clearly in its opinion of 28 March 1996."
"However, your motion for a resolution asks us to state our position on the possibility of accession."
"All I can say today is that the issue is currently being examined by the Commission's legal service."
"The delay caused by this essential move will not interfere with the timetable, however, since the draft convention still has to be approved by the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly."
"I would add that the Intergovernmental Conference may also cause some changes to be made to the Treaty."
"I shall move straight on to my second point."
"There is no need for formal accession to the convention for the Union and the Commission to be guided by the important principles it contains."
"This has been their practice for several years, particularly where scientific research is concerned."
"I would remind the House that the framework programme and the specific programmes on biotechnology and biomedicine are explicitly required to respect the provisions adopted internationally in these fields."
"To make the situation quite clear, any research aimed at changing the germ line or on the cloning of embryos is specifically forbidden."
"All the research programmes in life science and technology under the fourth framework programme allocate a substantial portion of their resources to the ethical, social and legal issues to which they give rise."
"The same concerns are also reflected in the Union's regulatory measures, which are increasingly taking account of the main principles of bioethics."
"Before leaving the subject, I would stress that, since 1991, the institutions have been able to seek the opinion of the group of ethical advisers set up by the Commission."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, bioethics-related issues are both very important and complex."
"Their complexity increases as one tries to deal with them on a Europe-wide basis."
"We have to take account of cultural differences which can result in different approaches to the problems."
"Consequently, our perceptions are not always the same."
"For all these reasons, the draft convention of the Council of Europe certainly represents progress from which we should all benefit."
"It should enable us to establish common reference points which we are currently lacking in certain areas."
"I therefore congratulate the European Parliament for having organized this debate, and would end by thanking you for inviting the Commission to take part in it."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Annex I of the Rules of Procedure - Lobbying"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0177/96 by Mr Nordmann, on behalf of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, on the amendment of Annex I to the Rules of Procedure concerning transparency and Members' financial interests; -A4-0200/96 by Mr Ford, on behalf of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, on lobbying in the European Parliament."
"Mr President, here we are, or rather, here we are again, since this is in fact the second report of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, following my request last January for referral back to committee because of the problems raised by Mr Ford's report."
"Since January, work has been done: a working party made up of representatives of the various political groups and chaired by Mr Cot, whom I should like to thank, drew up guidelines for our committee."
"In fact, a broad consensus is what is required for this kind of discussion, since we shall only be able to reform our Rules of Procedure and introduce greater transparency if we obtain 314 votes tomorrow!"
"We therefore need the support of the groups and, to make the point quite clearly, the support of the two large groups whose vote will determine this majority."
"The Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities has carried out its work with this end in view and on the basis of the guidelines that were presented to us."
"I think I can safely say that it has respected the guidelines drawn up by the working party and even improved their wording, since some of them were rather obscure in places, not to say contradictory."
"Firstly, the scope of the declaration should be extended, not only to cover professional activities, but also any support from which Members might benefit, whether financial or in terms of staff or material, provided by third parties not belonging to the institution; both the support and its origin should be disclosed. Secondly, there should be a ban on accepting other gifts or benefits."
"These are the essential ingredients of this report and its conclusions."
"I am aware that these proposals present difficulties for some people, particularly as regards the ban on accepting gifts other than declared income."
"Some of them, whose opinion I respect, wonder if it would be appropriate to establish a threshold above which the ban would take effect."
"We did not wish to become involved in a debate that has been the source of Mr Ford's difficulties, and we have therefore settled on a more general form of words."
"Yesterday, during the kind of mini-debate which marked the reintroduction of my report, some people called for the Bureau to be responsible for resolving any difficulties."
"To this effect, I have tabled a proposed form of words which could extend the powers of the Bureau provided for in our report."
"That proposal is now on the table, its only purpose being to secure the support of the two major groups."
"In Rules 162 and 163, provision has been made not only for changes, but also for ways of applying and interpreting the Rules should anyone try to reduce the proposals to absurdity, for example by evoking the famous case of the cup of coffee that it would no longer possible to offer one's visitors."
"But let us not go into that tonight."
"While our proposals are too tame for some people, for others they go too far."
"No doubt they strike a happy medium."
"I would therefore appeal to the House's sense of collective responsibility."
"If we fail to achieve a positive result, Parliament's image will be seriously tarnished."
"That is why I hope we can forget ulterior motives and wrangling between political groups."
"Above all, I hope that in tomorrow's vote each Member will at least have the courage not to abstain!"
"Mr President, as my partner in crime, Mr Nordmann, said, the Ford and Nordmann reports are back!"
"They have returned to this House after Parliament shied away from making a decision in January."
"This time Parliament generally is agreed that we cannot afford to fail again."
"We are now under the scrutiny - and rightly so - of the media and, more importantly, through the media, of the people of Europe who expect us not only to have a House that works properly, but one that is seen to work properly."
"Let me make it clear that we do not need these reports because there are any great scandals in this House."
"There are no problems, like in the United Kingdom, of cash-for-questions or anything else."
"Maybe there is the odd resolution for a trip, but the worst you can say here is that 98 % and more of the Members conduct themselves in a perfectly fit and proper manner."
"But what we have seen is this institution evolve from the first direct elections back in 1979, when the argument that it was a talking shop had some merit, to become a legislative arm of the European Union that actually helps and assists the Commission and the Council in preparing legislation."
"The Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty have given Parliament real power in a number of areas: single market legislation, environment, research and social affairs."
"As we well know, the Commission accepts the majority, 80 % I have been told, of our amendments, in whole or in part."
"As a result of Parliament's growing influence we have become the focus of increasingly intensive lobbying."
"It is not our intention to stop this process."
"After all, it is our job as Members of the European Parliament to listen, to engage in dialogue with representatives of consumers and producers, employers and employees, environmental and public interest groups."
"We are here to give an ear to those people."
"But what we must do is to make sure that this process is open and transparent and that dialogue is not in any danger of turning into ownership."
"My report is very simple indeed now."
"It is essentially a framework document that establishes a public register of lobbyists."
"It is founded on the elements agreed by this House in January - because most of my report, as you will recall, was voted and a large number of elements were accepted."
"In my view, Parliament should have no difficulty in approving it."
"If Parliament does not bring itself to approve my report and that of Mr Nordmann, we are in danger of bringing the whole House into disrepute."
"For without it the follow-up reports already demanded of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities by the Conference of Presidents, will be meaningless."
"As members of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure are aware, we are already committed to further reports on intergroups, where we will lay down, I presume, appropriate criteria for recognition."
"These should include a public list of Members and an annual report on resources and finances received from outside this House."
"There should be a report on assistants to make a distinction between those who devote their full-time work to a Parliamentarian or Parliamentarians and those supernumary assistants - collaborators maybe - who combine Parliamentary work with working for lobbying organizations, in my wide definition of the term, ranging from professional bodies through to voluntary bodies."
"Then the other report that has not yet been started on a code of conduct for lobbyists will have to be undertaken."
"This I hope will stop the coldcalling on Members' doors, as if you are canvassing in a British by-election, going down the street and knocking on doors one-byone, and the harassment by organizations like the Iranian National Resistance, who appear to be unable to take no for an answer."
"With respect to the Nordmann report, it has our support."
"Firstly it makes it clear that this will be a public document with no hidden codicils, that there will be no declaration of assets in sealed envelopes, and that what is not declared is fundamentally not acceptable."
"Things will be open and public."
"In addition, it enables the Bureau of Parliament to interpret any points of contention."
"We hope that tomorrow we will have the support of the vast majority of the House, not only for my report but for the Nordmann report as well."
"If this institution wants to be taken seriously, if it wants to have more power - I am very much in favour of that - then we not only have to do things properly, they have to be seen to be done properly."
"Mr President, in an opinion which was unanimously adopted, the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment declares itself in favour of the regulation of the activities of pressure or lobby groups, on the basis of the following points."
"It should be stressed that these groups enhance the fundamental role of mediation and political representation played by the political parties, by providing Members with information and helping to bring Europe's citizens and the European Parliament closer together."
"Consequently, the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment does not a have a negative attitude towards these groups, which contribute to the dialogue to which Mr Ford has referred. However, it wishes to underline the fact that increasing the transparency of the activities of these groups is essential to ensuring that their contribution is a genuinely positive one."
"By the same token, our committee emphasizes the need to facilitate the activities of non-profit-making lobby groups, not only for reasons of equal opportunities, but because it is right that these groups should be able to operate in this House."
"It recommends a gradual approach to the issue - starting, that is, with the establishment of certain basic rules regarding conduct, identification and movement, which will make it easier for the activities of Parliament, its Members and officials to be carried out and ensure that the lobbies themselves behave responsibly."
"This is the approach advocated in the report submitted today by Mr Ford, whom I would congratulate on achieving a result that will enable the first steps to be taken down a long road: namely, establishing a register of natural and legal persons who wish to have permanent access to the premises of the European Parliament in order to provide Members with information, and making those persons subject to a code of conduct."
"The Committee on the Rules of Procedure is asked to draw up that code, so that it enters into force at the same time as this new text."
"In this way, the activities of the lobby groups will be made subject to serious and responsible rules."
"The Committee on Social Affairs and Employment likewise supports Mr Nordmann's report on transparency and Members' financial interests, which is also being debated in plenary for the second time today."
"Both reports must be adopted, since they adequately reflect our committee's views, which I have expressed as draftsman in the firm belief that the European Parliament must take this step towards increased openness and transparency."
"Furthermore, this decision cannot be postponed."
"We have all made a great effort to achieve formulas which are capable of securing a broad consensus."
"Now those formulas must be applied."
"Time will tell if they are suitable or if they have to be improved."
"Like all rules, they will probably need to be supplemented - as indicated by Mr Ford a few moments ago - and improved and adapted."
"But that is not the main point."
"The main point, Mr President, is to begin taking steps down the road that will ensure Parliament's credibility and moral authority."
"Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, I would point out that in recent years there has been an enormous increase in lobbying of the European institutions, with some 3000 to 10 000 lobbyists now said to be working around the European institutions in Brussels."
"Clearly, if there are no rules, this kind of thing is bound to mushroom, and that is why my committee feels that regulation is urgently needed."
"On behalf of the committee, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ford, for the solutions he has put forward and all the hard work he has done."
"His second report meets all the objectives our committee had in mind and takes account of criteria we felt should be met."
"Lobbyists must now be entered in a public register, follow a certain code of conduct and carry a personal pass."
"There are three comments I should like to make here."
"Firstly, the cornerstone of this entire set of rules is, of course, the code of conduct, which needs to be drawn up as quickly as possible, otherwise none of the rules can be put into practice."
"I therefore think we must aim to reach a decision on this by the end of 1996."
"Secondly, if these rules are to work they must be applicable and enforceable in practice, and there must be checks on how they are applied."
"These are three aspects that are going to have to be organized here in the House."
"Thirdly, it is absolutely essential that parliamentary assistants should be given a proper status, but the question is whether this should be extended to include lobbyists."
"I think this is something else we shall have to look at very carefully."
"I should like to turn now to the Nordmann report."
"The proposed amendment to the Rules of Procedure concerning transparency and Members' financial interests is, I think, a successful compromise, on which I should like to congratulate Mr Nordmann."
"I wholeheartedly support this compromise."
"I feel it is essential that there should be total clarity as regards the professional activities and all other paid functions of Members of the European Parliament."
"Secondly, Members must also refrain from accepting gifts or other benefits in the performance of their duties."
"And thirdly, it is absolutely vital that a careful record should be kept of all these details in a register."
"Then there is the declaration of assets."
"Pending the introduction of a uniform statute for all Members of the European Parliament, we have, I think, no choice but to go on declaring our assets in accordance with the national rules."
"It should be pointed out here that the Belgian Council of State has taken a different view of this matter, but I hope that the Belgian legislation currently in the pipeline will make this possible."
"Speaking for myself, I shall certainly be making my declaration of assets in accordance with this forthcoming legislation."
"Like earlier speakers, I too would point out that this is the moment of truth for the European Parliament."
"We cannot afford a second postponement."
"This is our chance to let the people of Europe see that we want nothing to do with corrupt practices, and that as Members of Parliament we wish to stand up for the general interest, not for the interests of pressure groups."
"Some people have said that there are still details to be worked out, but this is no reason to vote against the proposal."
"There may not be rules covering bunches of flowers or bottles of wine, but the most important thing is that these reports we are discussing today lay down rules on everything else."
"Mr President, it is finally beginning to look as if we are at long last going to have an official register of lobbyists and a code of conduct for them, seven years after I first proposed this to the Bureau."
"As it stands, however, the Ford report does not provide very much more than a framework."
"The code of conduct needs to be spelled out in detail in another report, but this is not such a great problem, since we can carry on using the unofficial register and code of conduct that the quaestors have introduced for the time being."
"The next report needs to tighten up the existing code and establish a legal basis for it."
"In my view, it should cover at least what is desirable and what is unacceptable behaviour for lobbyists, with an absolute ban on the use of excessive pressure, with or without material inducements."
"Lobbyists should also be required to submit an annual report in order to have their passes renewed, giving details of who they have lobbied, on whose behalf and using what financial or other means."
"Although there is to be another special report on parliamentary assistants and intergroups, certain rules already apply here too."
"Registered assistants are required to declare at least any secondary activities they carry out, such as lobbying, and other assistants will be classified as lobbyists and must be registered as such and agree to respect the code of conduct."
"Unfortunately, this is a very relevant requirement, since it appears that untold numbers of assistants are being paid by interest groups."
"I myself do not think that this is a very desirable development, but introducing transparency could at least help to restrict such practices."
"As regards the intergroups, the group chairmen have already ordered that each intergroup must declare whether it has external sources of funding, and which Members from at least three groups are its sponsors."
"This should shed some useful light on the situation, since intergroups are currently degenerating into a kind of institutionalized lobby within Parliament."
"Unfortunately, the register is not yet working exactly as the group chairmen agreed, and needs to be improved."
"We are quite happy with the Nordmann report as it stands."
"Firstly, the register of Members' interests is to be public, without any appendices which then undermine the public nature of the information it contains."
"Secondly, it is to be updated annually, rather than letting the information become outdated."
"But the most important thing is, of course, what the register contains, since all paid functions and activities and any financial, personal or material support from third parties will have to be declared."
"Finally, all other gifts or benefits are prohibited, and thus, in one fell swoop, the European Parliament is exchanging a set of weak and unsatisfactory rules on Members' interests for the most far-reaching rules of any parliament."
"This seems to me to be a sound basis on which to clean up our image and to tighten up the rules governing assistants and other third parties."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the two rapporteurs, not merely on the excellence of their reports but on the patience and tenacity with which they have gone about their work."
"I sometimes have the impression that in certain delicate matters such as that which we are discussing today the European Parliament provides 626 rapporteurs for reports coming from the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities."
"While contributions from outside are always very enriching and welcome it makes the coming to consensus a little more difficult."
"But I am quite confident that tomorrow we will have come to the end of this particular long road and I think it will be to the great credit of all involved."
"I should like to begin by referring to Mr Ford's report and I am sure he will not be offended if I describe it as the less controversial of the two."
"It is, as he has said, little more than a recapitulation of elements that were already voted earlier in this year and that is the basis on which they will be coming forward tomorrow."
"We in the EPP have some residual doubts about the appropriateness of referring to assistants in this particular report."
"But in the interest of bringing the matter to a successful conclusion we will be voting for the totality of Mr Ford's report."
"We point out that Mr Janssen van Raay will be producing a separate report for the Rules Committee precisely on the question of assistants."
"We look forward to that very much."
"Turning to Mr Nordmann's report I should begin by underlining that as Mr Nordmann himself said, he has faithfully and honourably transposed and implemented the conclusions of the working group set up by the Conference of Presidents."
"For that reason, if for no other, his report would have the greatest possible claim to be voted tomorrow."
"I personally will be voting for it even without amendment though I did put down an amendment."
"I wish to speak briefly about the reasoning behind that."
"What has worried me and a number of colleagues in the EPP and other groups as well has been the particular phraseology of Mr Nordmann's report: ' that Members of Parliament shall refrain from accepting any other gift or benefit in the performance of their duties' ."
"I have spoken to a number of individual colleagues and in some cases they might regard a book given to a Member who has spoken in the constituency of another Member as being a gift and therefore potentially unacceptable."
"Others would say 'No, it is not a gift."
"It is simply a courtesy which is offered to a friend within the European Parliament.' I regard that as being potentially undesirable."
"I have had put to me two possible ways of tackling this problem, one of which has been referred to by Mr Nordmann already: a compromise amendment which would ask the Bureau to set down guidelines as to how this particular proscription is to be interpreted."
"If that receives a lot of support then I will happily withdraw the amendment which I put forward, which went more in the sense of saying that only those gifts that could potentially compromise the independence of the Member should be regarded as unacceptable: two ways of getting to the same goal."
"I repeat, even without either of these amendments, I shall personally be voting for the Nordmann report tomorrow but I think it would be a little clearer and a little more precise if we could find some way of making more exact what the Nordmann report has in mind."
"In conclusion, let me say a word about transparency."
"I agree very much with Mr Ford that the enormous majority of colleagues in this House behave honourably, conscientiously, and that what is important is to convince the European electorate that is the case."
"I do not regard there as being enormous skeletons in the closet, terrible secrets to be uncovered."
"But we rightly in this European Parliament demand transparency of the Council."
"We regard the Council as having the obligation to be seen to be acting fairly and constructively."
"In demanding more transparency of the Council we are not accusing the Council of corruption."
"We are merely saying that that is something which all the electors of Europe have a right to see and to have firmly established."
"What is right for the Council, it seems, is right for the European Parliament."
"That is why I and my group support the general underlying philosophy of the Nordmann report."
"One final thought, if I may."
"Oscar Wilde once said that when two people had the same opinion, one at least of them is superfluous."
"In agreeing with the philosophy and opinions of Mr Nordmann, I hope very much that I will render neither him nor myself superfluous, but I wish him all the best of luck for tomorrow and I am quite confident he will get the majority he deserves."
"Mr President, we have never concealed the fact that we thought the consensus that was reached on transparency, which proved later to be a far from general consensus, was wholly inadequate."
"We felt that if you want to exercise political control to ensure that political office is not used for personal enrichment, you basically need to know two things: firstly, what other income the Member receives from other functions or activities apart from his parliamentary income and, secondly, exactly what assets he possesses."
"In the report as it now stands, the activities, functions and so on have to be declared, but not how much the Member earns from them."
"For declarations of assets, reference is made to national legislation, but we know that thirteen of the fifteen Member States do not have any rules as regards Members of the European Parliament declaring their assets, so in other words the whole thing will be shelved and nothing will happen."
"With regard to gifts and benefits, the original text says that these are automatically banned, and I hope that this remains the case and that the PPE amendment is rejected."
"However, alongside the prohibited gifts and benefits, this second version of the Nordmann report creates a new category of income not provided for in the earlier version, namely financial, staff or material support granted by third parties in connection with a Member's political activities."
"How can you tell the difference between a gift and financial support?"
"In our opinion, this is deliberately designed to blur the issue so as to make it possible to receive financial, staff or material support from third parties, which is totally unacceptable."
"The Ford report as it stands is clearly simply a framework which outlines relations between lobbyists and Parliament in general."
"We agree that it should be supported, since it specifically states that a code of conduct for lobbyists must be adopted in the current parliamentary term;"
"Parliament may not exactly be helping things along, but it would be disgraceful if we could not draft the code of conduct during this parliamentary term."
"Secondly, we can see from the statements made by various Members - just as was the case in committee - that the political will exists to introduce rules for assistants and the intergroups."
"If all these things are to be sorted out in this parliamentary term, the Ford report is the launching pad, and we are happy to give it our support."
"Mr President, the Europe of Nations Group will vote in favour of the Ford report, which regulates the activities of persons and groups from outside Parliament and does not present any special problem."
"On the other hand, the Nordmann report, which deals with Members themselves, seems to us to be clearly inadequate, for two reasons."
"The first is that our group takes the view that, under their mandate, MEPs cannot accept gifts, nor financial support, whether in terms of material or staff."
"How can one remain independent or claim to be combating corruption if, at the same time, one is in receipt of largesse, obviously with strings attached?"
"It is a question of ethics which, for us, is a fundamental issue. We cannot accept that certain gifts or benefits may be permissible, nor financial support allowed."
"The second reason for our dissatisfaction is the complete lack of any real obligation concerning the declaration of assets."
"Amendment No 3 states that while we are waiting for a statute for MEPs to be introduced - which has now been postponed indefinitely - Members are subject to the obligations imposed on them by the legislation of the Member State in which they were elected as regards the declaration of assets."
"Admittedly, my group, which has frequently had cause to state that national identity must not be ignored in the building of Europe, might, just this once, be content to say that it was now up to national governments to do something constructive."
"But how, in all honesty, can one fail to denounce the hypocrisy of a proposal which shows such a blatant lack of courage?"
"Given the wording, it might as well not have been written at all."
"In this particular case, our own Rules could have gone further than the provisions in force in individual Member States."
"As has been quite rightly stated on page 19 of the annex to the second Nordmann report, the thinking behind the arrangements in the Member States is aimed at enabling the situation of MPs in terms of assets to be judged from the time when they begin their parliamentary duties to the time their mandate expires, in order to ensure that, while they are in office, they do not make excessive profits as a result of the positions which they hold."
"That is the approach we should be adopting."
"We should be guided by the same thinking that produced the first Nordmann report and inspired the working group."
"Mr President, we often make anodyne statements, but seldom take decisive action."
"This new debate on financial interests presents a challenge, which the Nordmann report in its present uncontroversial form does not meet."
"Our group, however, is ready to do so."
"Mr President, broadly speaking, the amendments to the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure proposed in the two reports under discussion today are designed to guarantee the necessary transparency in the activities both of Members and of people interacting with them, in other words lobbyists and assistants."
"As far as Members of Parliament are concerned - as other colleagues have already said - they will, in essence, be obliged to declare any sources of funding of their political activities, and must refrain from accepting any gifts that could potentially influence their actions or positions."
"As for lobbyists, their names must be entered in an appropriate register, they must abide by a code of conduct and must identify themselves by means of a pass, to be worn visibly at all times on Parliament premises."
"Such is the matter under discussion."
"Two questions need to be asked in this context: are these new rules a positive move, yes or no?"
"I would not hesitate to answer the first question in the affirmative."
"Despite the difficulties caused by the coexistence of differing penal and fiscal legislation in the various Member States, the European Parliament is taking the lead in establishing rules on transparency by laying down moral provisions such as the ban on the acceptance of gifts, so as to increase the citizens' trust in their elected representatives."
"In my view, however, these new rules cannot be regarded as adequate, but merely as a first step towards a more comprehensive and coherent set of provisions in this area."
"We are aware that opposition from certain parliamentary groups prevented the introduction of more restrictive rules, especially with regard to the provisions governing lobbyists and Members."
"Unfortunately, we must take account of this and try to remedy the situation in future; to that end, however, those measures capable of obtaining the necessary qualified majority of Members must be approved now."
"In our opinion, the reports by Mr Ford and Mr Nordmann, as approved by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, represent a framework which, in the circumstances, is sufficient and satisfactory;"
"I therefore believe that this House would be well advised, tomorrow, to reject all the amendments seeking to alter or distort these two sets of rules, which can now be approved at last, sending out an important signal both within this House and, above all, to our electorate and to public opinion."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Austria is to hold its first direct elections to the European Parliament on 13 October, and there is currently a great deal of debate as regards what Parliament can achieve, what individual Members can achieve, and who are the winners and losers in the European Union."
"There is also some discussion in Austria of how Members are paid and who pays them, both of which are, in my opinion - and let me make this quite clear - entirely legitimate topics."
"He who pays the piper calls the tune, as the old saying rightly has it."
"So financial transparency is an important issue when people come to consider who is best able to defend their interests."
"Both the reports before the House today suggest ways of guaranteeing our citizens the financial transparency that is required."
"They both have a lengthy history, which has already been discussed."
"I would simply say here that there were important and objective reasons for the problems that have arisen in drawing them up."
"The different legal traditions in the fifteen Member States have made it almost impossible to persuade the necessary number of Members to commit themselves to a common solution."
"Now, however, we have found a common solution, but I have to say that it is far from perfect, not because the main ideas present any difficulties, but because there are still certain side-issues concerning problems of definition."
"We hope that the compromise will produce sound, workable and transparent solutions for the future."
"We also hope that over the coming weeks and months in Austria and Finland - where elections are also to be held - and indeed throughout the Union, people will judge the work done by Members of the House not just on financial criteria, but also on other issues, such as the central question of who best represents their interests."
"Mr President, after so much reluctance on the part of so many Members, the Nordmann and Ford reports, determining rules of conduct and further improving the work and the role of MEPs, have finally reached the plenary."
"I endorse these reports, the aim of which is to achieve clarity and transparency in the way politicians perform their duties; I believe that they should be supported, and perhaps amended to make them more explicit."
"I am in favour of the proposal to establish a public register listing assets, and I think that what is said in certain dubious amendments - that this instrument of transparency could be exploited by illintentioned people - is not a good premise for demonstrating to public opinion our good will and the propriety of our procedures."
"For all too long, our citizens have been waiting for us, the politicians, to make a move; for our part, these minor disciplines will allow us thoroughly to rebuild our image as upright politicians, an image all too often tarnished by corrupt or ill-intentioned colleagues in this Parliament or other institutions."
"I believe that the additions to Rule 9 and to the provisions governing its application must be as clear as possible, and that these reports do in fact serve this aim."
"But that is not sufficient; I would emphasize the need for us to equip ourselves as soon as possible with a detailed statute of the MEP."
"Obviously, in view of the time taken to bring these two reports before the House, I do not harbour too many illusions that such a statute could be drawn up within the near future."
"If we wish future generations to consider that Members of Parliament perform a socially useful role, worthy of emulation, let us set an example now by voting in favour of these reports."
"I fully subscribe to my group's recommendation to express a favourable opinion by roll-call vote."
"Mr President, basically, the issue we are now debating concerns our credibility as parliamentarians."
"We are elected to represent those who voted for us."
"It is vital that we act always in the interests of the voters, using political programmes and our own views as tools."
"If we allow others to affect or guide our actions, we offend against the spirit of the task we have undertaken."
"The same can be said if our own economic interests guide what we do."
"Two things are needed for us to retain our credibility here: the first is openness."
"Our financial conditions must be accounted for openly."
"The lobbyists who try to influence us must also act openly."
"The second requirement is that gifts from lobbyists, to us, towards our equipment or to our staff, cannot be accepted."
"Bearing this in mind the draft reports from Mr Ford and Mr Nordmann are a disappointment."
"The Ford report does not mention the important issue of gifts from lobbyists."
"This is not good."
"It should be established here that in order to obtain access to Parliament lobbyists must undertake not to offer gifts."
"We have submitted an amendment to this effect."
"The Nordmann report also has serious flaws."
"It proposes in practice that the payment of parliamentarians' staff and payments for their equipment by lobbyists should be legalised."
"This is unacceptable and incompatible with our independence as parliamentarians."
"Moreover, we already receive generous allowances for precisely those expenses."
"The amendment by the PPE Group, which would make it perfectly acceptable to make gifts to parliamentarians but maintains that this does not affect how they vote, is still more unreasonable."
"It is of course precisely in order to affect votes that such gifts are given."
"In order to put right these flaws we have submitted amendments to oblige Members not to accept gifts, whether they are personal gifts or gifts to their offices."
"We have also proposed that expenses payments should be public, in order to avoid any misuse of travel allowances."
"If the proposals are not amended in the manner suggested by us it will be impossible for me and for many others to vote for them."
"Mr President, it will be really very difficult for us to carry out our work as Members of Parliament if we do not exercise transparency regarding our economic interests."
"Moreover, it is a very serious problem if Parliament is happy to talk about openness and demands it from other Institutions but has a blind spot in this respect."
"The worst problem about Mr Nordmann's new report is that it merely increases the range of possible interpretations of the proposals."
"This leads us to conclude that these proposals are unlikely to be realised even to the extent stated."
"For example, the report proposes a distinction whereby gifts and services are divided artificially into different categories but whereby financial support obtained in connection with political activities is in a category of its own."
"This is an artificial distinction and makes monitoring more difficult."
"On the other hand there is clearly no prospect of any European Parliament rules permitting the notification of MEPs' property."
"In this connection Mrs Aelvoet already said that only in two Member States are there rules of this nature on the notification of property and Mr Nordmann's report is quite insignificant in this respect."
"Mr President - and fellow countryman - being elected by the people is a position of trust, not one of providing services which are for sale to the highest bidder."
"Those elected by the people should be paid by them as well."
"We are here because people have put a cross against our names, and we must live up to this trust and work in an open and transparent way, so that the voters can judge whether they have chosen well or need to make a better choice next time."
"By standing for election, we have declared ourselves ready to work for the remuneration offered by the state, and if we have other sources of income, those earnings should be declared, so that the voters can see what they are getting for their money and what other interests we might represent."
"Gifts from firms and interest groups are not compatible with positions of public trust."
"And it should create a scandal everywhere that gifts are now being legalized by the proposal to amend the Rules of Procedure which the majority in the House is recommending should be adopted."
"On the other hand, it is nevertheless a step forward that openness is being introduced as regards this unacceptable practice, and we are requesting a separate vote so that we can vote in favour of openness and against accepting gifts."
"It is particularly interesting that the Christian Democrats are able to distinguish between those gifts which have an effect on votes and those which do not."
"With gifts of alcohol, it may be possible to measure the effect, but how can one decide whether 14 days on a Turkish beach has an effect on votes on torture in Turkish prisons?"
"Perhaps 14 days in a Turkish prison would make a stronger impression, but that can hardly be called a gift."
"The June Movement is proposing that gifts should be prohibited, and that a copy of every approach from lobbyists should be supplied to the library, so that there is openness as regards approaches to elected representatives."
"It is all very well for the tobacco industry to argue in favour of smoking, but the arguments must be accessible to those campaigning against cancer, so that they can provide evidence of the further damage to heath which can be caused by allowing tobacco advertising."
"Lobbying and closed doors are a dangerous mixture, whilst openness and lobbying from different quarters is a basis for well thought-out legislation."
"Mr President, the reports we are now considering concerning the regulation of lobbying and of MEP's economic interests are aiming at a legislation which should be self evident."
"Lobbying should be open and susceptible of monitoring."
"At the same time it is appropriate that any economic connections MEPs may have should be listed."
"It is equally natural that we should start from the assumption that Members should not receive gifts or services for performing their duties."
"I earnestly hope that Parliament can adopt the Ford and Nordmann reports as they stand."
"If either report were rejected this would be a regrettable commentary on our inability to draw up common rules."
"At the same time it would cast a shadow on those Members of Parliament for whom no such regulations are needed."
"I believe that the vast majority of the Members of the European Parliament perform their duty in a morally unexceptionable manner."
"Questions relating to the rules and openness of politics are important for the functioning of democracy."
"What is just as important is the way in which we are able to hold a sensible discussion with our countries' nationals in the complicated conditions which exist at present."
"Our nationals have a right to know what view of the world their representative holds and how he or she aims to find solutions to its central problems."
"The world has changed, and the fact that a person belongs to a particular political party does not, for example, tell us everything about his political philosophy."
"The boundaries on many important issues cut across party lines."
"Since we are now hopefully going to get the question of interest groups and Members' economic interests off our hands, at least for a time, we may perhaps be able to go on to consider how we can develop a genuine national dialogue in Europe."
"I would wish to include in this discussion the media who are now closely following the discussion of the Ford and Nordmann reports."
"Mr President, it is obviously no easy matter to fight your way through issues like this, and I hope and have every confidence that we shall still reach a successful conclusion tomorrow."
"The solution found for the lobbyists is a reasonable one, provided that the code of conduct is sound, that it is introduced quickly, and that the lobbyists keep to it."
"The only mistake, as far as I can see, is to include assistants in a report on interest groups, and the assistants' association has rightly asked for this passage to be dropped from the Ford report."
"Assistants are our personal aids, and are entitled to have rules of their own."
"As far as our ethics are concerned, I shall be happy with any solution which guarantees transparency, legal security and privacy."
"If Amendment No 3 is adopted, I would repeat what I said in January: that Members who are not subject to the same requirements as their national counterparts must themselves ensure that they do not slip through the net, and must voluntarily agree to respect the same rules as their national colleagues."
"This is still the case for Members from my own country."
"Mr President, public confidence in the work of Parliament is completely dependent on the system being open and democratic."
"This applies equally to the relationship of parliamentarians with individual interest groups which wish to influence the decisions of Parliament."
"The proposals in the Ford report are good, as far as they go."
"Lobbying must be regulated, partly to prevent improper influence through gifts and financial advantages but not least in order that all individuals and interest groups should have the same opportunities to influence the work of parliament, irrespective of their size and financial strength."
"Verifiable passcards which facilitate registration and checks based on the principle of public accountability constitute the only system which meets the requirements of openness, democracy and equal conditions for all."
"This is particularly important for organisations concerned with issues of principle, which must be given the same conditions as industry and interest groups with considerable financial resources."
"The proposal does not go far enough, however."
"There is no need for lists in which donations of money or in kind to Members can be published."
"Such donations and gifts should quite simply not be allowed over and above a purely token level."
"There is also some ambiguity concerning the access the general public may have to the lobby register."
"The solution is just as clear as with the previous point: the register should be open to the public and anyone who so wishes should have access to it."
"The Nordmann report is much the same."
"Strict rules for gifts and other inducements are absolutely necessary if public mistrust of the EU and the advantages enjoyed by MEPs is to be transformed into increased confidence."
"The Nordmann report too points in the right direction but does not go far enough."
"It ought, for example to be self-evident that industry and organisations should not be able to offer financial advantage to MEPs indirectly by appointing staff formally to positions within the company or organisation who are in reality carrying our work for individual MEPs."
"My conclusion is thus that we have two proposals which are a step in the right direction but do not go far enough."
"The proposals should nevertheless be supported as an initial measure."
"Mr President, a good many people in this House have been angry with the Greens for criticizing Members' undeclared income and the lack of clear rules governing their expenses, and people have been quick to accuse us of currying favour with the public."
"However, I think that if there had not been criticism from within the House, it would soon have come from outside and would have weakened Parliament's standing."
"How can we try to explain why there has been this endless tug-of-war about banning the acceptance of gifts?"
"How can we explain why Members make up to 50 % profit on their travel expenses?"
"How can we explain why travel expenses are paid even if Members have not made the journey and even if they live in Brussels anyway?"
"How can we explain that some people claim allowances for attending meetings of committees of which they are not even members, that meetings are deliberately extended to the following day so that Members can claim a second day's allowance, and that Members employ their relatives as assistants?"
"I could easily go on with this list of abuses, and only my lack of speaking time prevents me from doing so!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the previous speaker spoke with a great deal of passion, and I have to say that I agree with him."
"If the provisions of the Nordmann report are applied - and I say if they are applied - we will see that there are three types of Members in this House: those whose parliamentary activities are their only source of income, those who also have another profession or paid job, and those for whom none of this is enough and who feel they need sponsorship as well."
"This last category should actually not be allowed."
"People in the Member States are having to work harder, partly as a result of the Maastricht Treaty, yet we allow those who are already handsomely paid for their political activities to receive money from third parties."
"That is why we should support amendments which aim to ban these kinds of perks, but even if those amendments fail, the proposals put forward by the rapporteur, Mr Nordmann, still represent a step forward, because at least we shall now know who receives what and from whom."
"Moving on to the Ford report, Parliament should stand up for its Members' assistants."
"There have been various calls for general rules to be introduced for aids and assistants, but since neither Parliament nor the national governments have managed to draw up rules for themselves, rules on assistants may be a long time in coming."
"They are currently required to declare their incomes, and rightly so."
"But if you impose certain obligations on them, then you could also consider giving them certain rights, such as that they should be properly employed in accordance with all the social security and tax rules, and that Members should give them a pass or at least some proof that their social security and tax position is in order."
"Mr President - and fellow countryman, as I can say like Mr Bonde - there are many lobbyists in the European Parliament."
"They form a natural part of our work and contribute views and information."
"They probably cannot be dispensed with, but we should have rules governing their activities."
"The Ford report is a good attempt to create a set of rules which are workable."
"I should have liked to see the rules made stricter - everything which a business gives a Member ought to be registered, but I appreciate that there is a balance to be struck here, and that it was not politically possible to achieve more, because the right wing in Parliament would not go along with it. The most important thing is that now, for the first time ever, we have rules on the activities of lobbyists, and we can always make them tighter in the future."
"I welcome the fact that in line with my own amendments, Members will have to declare in a register what financial interests they have apart from representing Europe's citizens."
"It should be a matter of course that there is public access to this register, in keeping with our idea of openness."
"We hope that these rules will make the lobbying firms more transparent, but let us be under no illusions."
"Even the new rules can be got round."
"If a Member wishes to cheat, that can always be done, but we must hope that the new rules bring into focus the relationship between Members and lobbyists, and that they will also serve as moral guidance for Members."
"The new rules say to Members that it is wrong to use one's status as a Member for personal financial gain, whether by letting oneself be bribed by lobbyists or by selling information."
"Openness should prevail."
"We have waited a long time for these rules."
"Today we can take a step in the right direction, and I really do hope that the right wing will therefore change its mind and that we simply declare what we are now concealing."
"Why will they not go along with this?"
"The reason could of course be a guilty conscience."
"I hope that that is not the case."
"Mr President, I did not wish to speak as rapporteur, I was replacing Mr Wijsenbeek, but that was indeed rather ambitious."
"I think I have three minutes in which to say that the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party approves the two reports whose preparation it has been closely involved with."
"It also gives me an opportunity to offer my personal congratulations to Mr Ford for having come up with some provisions which, though they may not go far enough for some people here, nevertheless allow the process of clarification to begin on a sound footing."
"In the case of both reports, the Liberal Group is all the more pleased to lend its support because they provide for a general approach of transparency based on trust, rather than on distrust."
"We do not need procedures for officiously inquiring into anyone's affairs, we need instead to encourage a spirit of openness and confidence. That explains why subparagraph (b) of Article 2(1) is phrased so economically."
"We are well aware that financial support or support in terms of staff or material additional to that provided by the institutions is sometimes given."
"Some of our colleagues are supported by their political party, especially parties which have been institutionalized at European level by the Maastricht Treaty."
"It would therefore be extremely hypocritical to claim that the only material support is provided by Parliament and its budget."
"We in the Liberal Group believe that although this is only a small step, it is not one without significance. We are therefore concerned that those who are calling for a more radical text may be trying to alter or delay the introduction of measures to increase transparency because these might bring to light some means of support which they themselves are currently enjoying."
"The best is the enemy of the good. This maxim is especially true where a spirit of moderation is required."
"The Liberal Group therefore commends the moderate nature of this compromise."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Restructuring in the steel industry"
"The next item is the report (A4-0213/96) by Mr Caudron, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament 'Fresh impetus for restructuring the steel industry in the Community' (COM(94)0265 - C40060/94)."
"During the 1950s, the steel industry together with the ECSC were the basic elements in the process of European integration."
"Twenty years later, as a result of the drastic restructuring programmes and their terrible social cost in the 1970s and 1980s, it almost caused the downfall of this same Union."
"We should be aware that in many areas and for many of our fellow citizens, the damage is irreversible. They have lost heart."
"As a Member from northern France, a traditional industrial area, I speak from first-hand experience."
"May I remind you that in less than 20 years, the number of jobs in the steel industry has fallen from 850 000 to 350 000."
"Fortunately, the situation today is somewhat better: the market for steel is quite good, even if it is still unstable and continually at the mercy of crises in other sectors - armaments, automobiles, and so on."
"Nevertheless, the European steel industry is a net exporter and makes a profit."
"But is this a reason for doing nothing, for allowing the markets carte blanche , for crossing our fingers and hoping that all will be well?"
"This is what some industrialists would have us do, and sometimes they tell us so in no uncertain terms."
"For our part, we do not think so, and I refuse to sit back and do nothing."
"On the contrary, we must take advantage of this respite to plan for the future, to maintain the performance of our steel industry and thus avoid further traumas. That is how we shall be able to cope intelligently and humanely with future changes."
"That is the approach I have pursued with my colleagues from different groups for nearly a year, and my thanks to all of them."
"I have also sought the advice of all the economic players, businesses and trade unions."
"In my report, I go on to make many specific proposals affecting four main areas."
"Firstly, the competitiveness of the European steel industry must be strengthened by developing new products and markets, and giving ourselves the means to do this."
"In a restricted market, Europe's share must not be allowed to contract."
"It must therefore be expanded."
"To ensure that the necessary restructuring measures are carried out in a totally transparent way, we must not penalize those who have worked hard, nor excuse those who have been late in meeting their obligations."
"More money will have to be spent on research to ensure that our industry remains competitive on the global market. That is an absolute precondition."
"Secondly, social policy in this sector needs to be improved."
"A qualified workforce is of prime importance to the European steel industry."
"We should definitely rid ourselves of the idea that it is a burden. On the contrary, it is an asset!"
"We should therefore reassure our workers in order to avoid further traumas."
"The effects of future changes should also be managed from within, and it is important to convince the workers of this fact!"
"Thirdly, as regards relations with third countries, we should remain firm in our dealings with the United States, but be very cooperative in our relations with the countries of Eastern Europe, in order to facilitate their essential restructuring and transition processes."
"Most of them will be in the Union one day, and now is the time for them to be preparing for accession."
"Finally, our industry must remain or become large enough to compete worldwide, and we must give ourselves the means to achieve this, including regroupings."
"We must stop burdening ourselves with constraints that our competitors do not have."
"Lastly, we should already be preparing for the post-ECSC era in 2002 in order to ensure a smooth transition, in particular by incorporating measures and mechanisms into the Treaties during the IGC."
"Such mechanisms are needed to ensure greater transparency in the markets and in state aids and other types of aid, as well as to step up research, with active and intelligent social policies designed to bring about increased productivity and with a long-term commitment to avoid jeopardizing the future for the sake of short-term gains."
"Finally, the European steel industry was the driving force behind the Union before turning into one of its worst disasters."
"Today it is in a good state of health, and with this in mind, we should be planning for the future."
"That is the essence of my report."
"I hope it will receive overwhelming support, and also that it will raise awareness and lead to rapid measures so that it can be of lasting value."
"Mr President, after all the painful restructuring of the last 20 years and after the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs, the steel industry is still a sector with a future."
"That is the message which the rapporteur, Mr Caudron, wishes to convey to us."
"I commend him for having treated the steel issue with the sensitivity of someone who comes from one of the many areas stricken by unemployment, and for having put forward practical proposals that avoid the pitfalls of unfettered liberalism and sterile economic intervention."
"He has come up with a whole series of interesting proposals."
"I should like to highlight one or two of them."
"The first advocates an offensive strategy for steel consisting of greater product diversity, a broader range of uses, particularly in construction and public works projects, as well as naturally stepping up research in various areas."
"Of course, such a strategy will only work if competition is not distorted."
"State aids, whether open or concealed, are therefore placed under scrutiny."
"On these issues, I am in agreement with the rapporteur, who defends the code on aid and the policy instruments, but who is opposed to state aid for individual businesses. He does, however, make an exception for regional aid in special circumstances."
"Secondly, where restructuring has been carried out, in other words where there has been a dramatic fall in the number of jobs, we must stop the haemorrhaging once and for all. Often, in the wake of the rationalization and the frenetic attempts to increase productivity of recent years, labour has been casualized in various ways."
"Our industrial policy must safeguard stable jobs, a task always met by long-term renewal through the employment of young people."
"Finally, I should like to say a word about the ECSC Treaty, which expires in the year 2002."
"The crisis in the steel industry showed the value of the instruments it contains. These include the aid code, the statistical system for monitoring market development, the Consultative Committee - of paramount importance for social dialogue in this sector - and the research carried out by using the funds available."
"We now recognize that this Treaty has a more pronounced social spirit than those which followed."
"Like the rapporteur, I too believe that in making the transition, we should preserve this spirit as well as the more positive elements in the ECSC Treaty, whilst adapting it to suit recent economic and social developments."
"In particular, I should like to support the establishment of a structure to accommodate the ECSC reserves, which could be used for joint technological and social research."
"In conclusion, Mr President, my group broadly approves this report, which lays down guidelines for a competitive steel industry in the future."
"Mr President, we began with a rather weak communication from the Commission, but Parliament and Mr Caudron have transformed it into a vision of the future, a proper industrial policy for the steel industry."
"I think Mr Caudron deserves our warmest congratulations, and his report should be adopted as it stands."
"Everyone knows that as well as making a major contribution to the economies of the Member States, the steel industry is also an extremely important source of employment, both direct and indirect."
"There is often a misunderstanding here."
"Businesses do not create jobs, and have only one choice: to operate as efficiently and cost-effectively as possible against cut-throat international competition."
"In our western society, cost control almost inevitably means job losses."
"The steel industry has always depended heavily on the regions around it, and I therefore greatly regret that a programme such as RESIDER, designed to help the regions diversify, is drying up."
"The steel industry is still in the act of developing into much smaller but more widely distributed units, and halting this trend will only harm the industry's competitiveness."
"The fact is that, internationally, the price competition is absolutely ruthless."
"There are a few extremely important elements that need to be included in our industrial policy for the steel industry after the ECSC expires."
"This is the first report that actually looks beyond that point."
"First of all, the new aid operations under Article 95 will need to be strictly monitored."
"Every case of aid under Article 95 is by definition a distortion of competition, in my opinion, and the industry itself has also come round to this point of view."
"Some Members have already tabled amendments which take quite a different line, and I only hope that Mr Fayot is trying to keep his group in check as I am with mine."
"Secondly, the 1997 revisions must introduce more rapid and transparent inquiry procedures, so that effective sanctions can be imposed where the support rules are infringed."
"Thirdly, it is vital that European trade statistics should be made available more quickly."
"Full American trade statistics on volume and average import prices are available within two months, whereas the European figures take eight to twelve months."
"This completely stymies our dumping policy, since the WTO insists that complaints about dumping must be based on official trade statistics."
"This is certainly a more important priority than encouraging mergers, which are in any case contrary to the current trend."
"Fourthly, the steel industry also feels that it is very important to have a research fund based on the ECSC model for the period after the ECSC expires, in order to promote the dissemination of technological innovations."
"And, last but not least, I think the Commission should work hard with the Americans to try to reach a multilateral steel agreement or MSA."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are considering today deals with measures designed to relaunch the restructuring process after the ECSC Treaty has expired in 2002. The aim is to strengthen the competitiveness of the industry, its social policy and its relations with third countries, and to ensure the retention of certain mechanisms contained in the Treaty which is to disappear."
"It should also be borne in mind that the future of the Treaty and its financial role are due to be examined under the Irish presidency, and that we are expecting a draft text from the Commission towards the beginning of September."
"In addition, a discussion is currently taking place on the draft aid code for 1997-2002, with a view to a decision being taken by the Council of Industry Ministers in November."
"Mr Caudron's excellent report will be endorsed by all our group."
"It deals with recent developments in the European steel industry and considers its future as effectively as is possible at the present time."
"A wider definition of steel products put forward in the resolution, such as the declassification of scrap metal as waste, and attempting to reach a bilateral compromise with the United States, with a view to a multilateral agreement, are both moves in the right direction."
"Lastly, like the resolution, we too would welcome the creation of a structure to accommodate the ECSC reserves."
"Clearly, however, these reserves, together with the interest accruing on them, should be used to finance Community steel research programmes and be subject to adequate controls, once the levies on the steel industry have been ended."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we too would like to congratulate Mr Caudron."
"His report deserves our support, but it also requires some modification, since there are obviously two sides to the ECSC."
"On the one hand, it is an example of a robust industrial policy with its own research and social arm, whose carefully regulated and focused long-term strategy has, broadly speaking, succeeded in bringing structural change to the sector."
"On the other hand, it is also a prime example of an industrial model which we all know started to give us problems a long time ago."
"It is highly monopolized, with cartels and a die-hard aristocracy among the workers."
"It pursues an aggressive external trade policy."
"These are the less favourable aspects which the Community cannot afford to allow to continue in the longer term."
"So what we need to do is to carry on with the positive side of the ECSC while at the same time making it more open and less privileged."
"The ECSC reserves, for example, cannot be treated as some sort of private fund for the coal and steel industries."
"Raw materials and energy are more general issues, and we are going to have to discuss exactly how we want them to be used."
"Mr President, although the European steel industry is relatively healthy at the present time, let us not forget the debilitating effect of the loss of nearly 600 000 jobs over the last few years."
"In 20 years, jobs in the steel industry have been cut by two thirds. As a trade union official at the time of the major restructuring programme in France, I witnessed the havoc which this caused."
"Whole regions were ruined, and families torn apart. But there were also fiercely determined battles, in spite of everything, to save an industry of which several generations of steelworkers were justly proud."
"Today, the steel industry has been modernized. And, if we are to be honest, the increased productivity has largely been due to new technology and new production methods which, in turn, have led to massive lay-offs."
"Whereas in 1986, it took five hours to produce a ton of steel, nowadays it takes only three."
"It goes without saying that the competitiveness of European steel depends to a large extent on our capacity for research and technological innovation."
"New procedures have been introduced which allow for greater flexibility, both in terms of diversity of supply and production volume."
"Links between producers of steel products and downstream users have been strengthened, and joint research and marketing ventures have been established."
"But I wonder how much further this process can go - even though it is one that all modern industries undoubtedly require - without resulting in further massive job losses, unless it is accompanied by a reduction in working hours and by new working methods?"
"Research in the steel industry will also be a campaign which it is essential for us to wage."
"The expiry of the ECSC Treaty and the integration of steel research into the fifth framework programme of research and technological development present a serious problem."
"We should indeed therefore be considering the creation of a structure to accommodate the ECSC reserves, the interest on which would be used to encourage technological innovation and to develop a social policy covering training and working methods."
"On a more general note, Mr Caudron, whom I should like to congratulate, has stressed that when the ECSC Treaty expires, there must be no systematic abandonment of a sectoral industrial policy."
"Yet this is what may well happen."
"Lastly, the future of the European steel industry is linked to the development of other industrial sectors such as construction, automobiles, and so on. As we know, these are experiencing severe problems, mainly because of restrictive policies imposed by the convergence criteria."
"I am afraid that such a policy may well force us to sacrifice our Community industry, unless we are on our guard."
"Mr President, I shall conclude my speech by highlighting a similar need for vigilance with regard to the United States and its anti-dumping measures."
"However, I am confident that, in this respect, the Commission will protect the interests of the Community steel industry."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Caudron's interesting report has two themes."
"It examines the restructuring of the Community steel industry, and outlines the course the industry must take to safeguard its future."
"As emphasized in the report, the future of the steel industry already depends and will continue to depend on global competition."
"Today, 320 000 people in the Union are employed in this sector."
"We entirely support the guidelines set out in this report for giving the industry a lasting chance of success."
"To this end, everyone, including our competitors, must abide by the following rules."
"State aid must never be used as a subsidy to artificially revive uncompetitive producers."
"The Union must not allow unfair trade practices, such as any kind of dumping, not least on the part of the countries of Eastern Europe."
"The same applies in the case of unilateral protectionist measures taken by some non-Union countries against the latter's products."
"The most vital element in the future of the steel industry is research."
"We must ensure that it is adequately financed after the expiry of the ECSC Treaty in 2002."
"Another element is innovation - hence the overwhelming importance of research."
"Only on this basis will we forge a future for ourselves in the third millennium."
"Mr President, it has already been pointed out today, and it is something I would like to emphasize, that the steel industry is undoubtedly a symbol of the construction of Europe."
"I think any follow-up to the ECSC Treaty needs to focus on two things: technology and a proper social policy."
"The problem of how to ensure that the European steel industry remains competitive in future will be difficult to resolve."
"We have to realize that just producing iron and steel will not be enough, and that the survival of the entire steel industry in Europe will depend on things like integrated plant construction and the further development of iron and steel products."
"Let me give you an example from my home state. More than 40 000 jobs were lost at Voest Alpine, but since privatization the firm is now back in profit and is certain to..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, like many others here, I should like to congratulate Mr Caudron on his excellent report, which draws attention to the suffering and concern of those regions and peoples that are heavily dependent on steelmaking."
"They are concerned because in the year 2002, they see the only industrial policy currently in force in the European Union coming to an end. That policy stemmed from a Treaty which was one of the models for the European Community and which has scarcely been replaced."
"Hence there is a danger that it will be overwhelmed by the policy of unregulated competition governing the single market, with consequences similar to those experienced in other sectors."
"And there is concern too because some workers are being discriminated against, as often happens in public-sector industries."
"The Forges de Clabecq in Belgium, which is currently being subjected to an inquisition by the Commission, is a good example of such discrimination."
"On this point, I would add that Mr Caudron's report has not completely escaped the liberal influence of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, since it acknowledges the crucial importance of the codes on state aids."
"Whilst we share this view, we question the indulgence that is shown towards currency drift and the laxity of fiscal dumping."
"In short, we are facing a situation that will affect the future of sectors where employment levels are still high."
"I therefore await with considerable impatience the Commission's forthcoming proposals on industry, as well as on research, where there is a lack of consistency as regards the wealth of ideas and initiatives."
"Mr President, thank you for your report on the European steel industry, Mr Caudron."
"This is an industry which has undergone a tough restructuring process and suffered the loss of half a million jobs over the last twenty years."
"In this restructuring process, the amount of state aid received has been unequal, and this is something which should also be borne in mind for the future."
"By way of example, the steel industries of some Member States have closed down up to 30 % of production capacity, whilst receiving less state aid than the industries of other Member States, some of which - curiously - are now protesting vehemently against state aid."
"This effort has had, and is continuing to have, a considerable social cost."
"The most recent restructuring operations should be carried out in the best possible social conditions, using the available financial resources and the ECSC reserves to finance not only R&D programmes, but also social measures, such as early retirement schemes and compensation for redundancy."
"Let us not deceive ourselves with the euphemism 'funding for social research' , which accounts for no more than 1 % of overall research in this sector."
"It is not social research which needs funding, but the necessary social measures connected with the large-scale reductions in production capacity."
"State aid regimes must be rigorously applied, but no more rigorously than they are for productive sectors which are competing with the steel industry."
"Hence the Community framework for R&D support must be equally valid for the steel sector."
"We cannot penalize this sector in relation to the others."
"One final comment, Mr President: imports from third countries - especially those from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, which frequently take place in conditions of dumping, and above all those which enter the Union via countries which are not subject to quotas - must be controlled."
"The controls must be strict, since otherwise Europe's steel industry will be harmed. And, lest anyone should think that permissiveness with regard to dumping by third countries is somehow connected to internal competition in the Community steel industry, I would add that the steel sectors of some Member States will be harmed more than those of others."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Caudron, who has drawn up a very complete report which addresses all the scientific and social aspects of competition policy in this area."
"I am sure that he will forgive me, however, for raising three objections to his excellent report."
"We would hope to see these three objections resolved when it comes to the vote, although I appreciate that the rapporteur himself is willing to accept some of these points."
"I also welcome the fact that Mr Bangemann is present, since I should like to put a question to him."
"These painful restructuring operations have been carried out throughout the length and breadth of the European Union."
"Hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost, not only in northern, but also in southern Europe."
"The countries of northern Europe began the restructuring process before those in the south, because the former joined the European Community and benefited from the ECSC approach before the latter did so. The latecomers began their restructuring process in the 1970s, without the help of the Community aid provided through the ECSC."
"Consequently, I do not think that anyone is lagging behind."
"Everyone has done their duty and made the painful cut-backs, which have also meant reductions in capacity: from the United Kingdom to the new German Länder , and from north to south."
"And all with the help of state aid - and massive state aid, as Mr Imaz pointed out."
"Let us therefore stop beating about the bush and talk about state aid."
"The ECSC Treaty is expiring, with all its advantages and disadvantages. We fail to understand, however, why one industrial sector will be penalized in relation to the others."
"Consequently, the code on state aid must be brought into line with the general system of the industry's competitors."
"Finally, Mr President, let us not forget that the adjustments and the need for social measures will continue everywhere."
"Mr President, as in many other cases here in Parliament, we are in a situation today where we are good at identifying areas where there are problems, but may well disagree strongly on how to solve them."
"Several speakers have said how the steel industry has been through a major upheaval."
"The decision taken by the Council in 1993 on structural change, reorganization and the adjustment of capacity was then backed by a number of initiatives from the Commission."
"We often judge matters on the basis of our own home areas."
"Earlier today, I spoke on the trans-European networks."
"I feel like saying the same things again now."
"We are in a situation where we need to see ourselves in relation to worldwide, not just internal competition."
"We have often used a good deal of energy discussing how we are applying state aids within the Union, how we may be cheating one another, rather than using our efforts to see how we can make some impact on the world market, so that we can cope with competition in the future."
"Many good things have been said about the future."
"I would stress that research and product development are vital, as I see it."
"We talk about adjusting to the market; we could also talk about expanding the market."
"All in all, international trade agreements are crucial for us."
"One point which I would highlight in Mr Caudron's excellent report is the situation after 2002."
"There is a need for strict controls on what takes place internally, so that we can pursue a common policy and not devote our energies to investigating whether we are cheating one another."
"The proposals from the committee are good ones, but the Commission should perhaps not..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, Mr Caudron has given us a very accurate description of the current situation and has made a number of very useful proposals on how to meet the challenges of the next few years."
"We are fortunate in being able to hold this discussion at a time when the situation in the steel industry has, generally speaking, stabilized, though it is quite true that there have been job losses in the steel industry, just as in other primary industries which are having to face up to both technological change and increasingly strong competition."
"However, the steps taken by the Commission and the steel industry itself in recent years have at least brought us to a point where prices are fairly reasonable and the jobs that remain are fairly secure, even though the modernization process is, of course, still ongoing."
"Our main achievement, and one which should not be underestimated, has been privatization, which, particularly in those Member States where the industry was previously almost entirely nationalized, has meant that every firm can now think and work for itself in order to remain competitive."
"This is absolutely crucial, because competition is set to become increasingly globalized."
"We are going to have to compete more with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, and this is why it is vital that we should not go back to needing state aid to compensate for poor competitiveness."
"I have to tell Mr Desama that his comments this evening are hardly helpful to either Clabecq or the steel industry in general, and nor is that the way to solve the problem."
"We have not begun an inquisition there, but we have to do what the law requires."
"If we want to protect jobs in the steel industry, we have to ensure that competition is not distorted by the payment of illegal state aid."
"Jobs throughout the entire steel industry are at stake, so no one should make wild claims that the Commission is conducting an inquisition."
"The expression really is one which I refute."
"We are simply doing our duty, and if you do not believe me, the people from Clabecq have asked Mr Gandois to produce a report on how to make the company competitive again, and there is only one way of doing this, which is to invest in modernization."
"If it does invest in modernization, then Clabecq can be expected to recover its competitive position."
"But you have to ask, of course, whether anyone is likely to do this if they cannot be sure of ending up with a viable company?"
"This is the six million dollar question."
"We cannot simply carry on as before, when aid was paid out and healthy firms went to the wall because unhealthy firms put up unfair competition."
"I would ask you to try and be a little more realistic before you make such statements, Mr Desama."
"The same applies to the claims that the ECSC Treaty is the only possible policy for the industry."
"I am very sorry to have to say it, but this is totally wrong."
"As an industrial policy, it is terribly outdated."
"It is an interventionist policy based on quotas, price controls, controls on trade flows and so on, and when we applied it in earlier steel crises, it never solved anything."
"Only when we applied the modern industrial policy which the Commission has been successfully promoting for a number of years were we able to find reasonable solutions, and we are now able to adopt a more relaxed approach when new problems arise."
"I cannot give you any further details of the transition from the ECSC Treaty to the general rules."
"It is absolutely certain that we will not be extending the Treaty, though we shall carry over some of the mechanisms which fit in with our modern industrial policy."
"We have yet to decide what to do with the reserves, in other words the money raised by the industry."
"The Member States seem to be quite keen to pocket this money, but they are forgetting that it has come from the industry itself."
"We should try to find a solution which will enable at least some, if not all, of the money to be ploughed back into the steel industry, such as for modernization or research."
"The Member States have other ideas here, but I hope that with Parliament's support we can find a sensible solution."
"I also hope we can resolve our problem with the USA."
"We are, of course, all in favour of a multilateral agreement as the only way to solve such trade disputes, and we still have our sights on this once the elections in the USA are over."
"We have entered a new phase in the restructuring process and are more or less back to normal, with an industry that is once again competitive and now only needs to maintain its position."
"We do not need a completely new set of rules, we simply have to ensure that we remain competitive in the years to come."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Trans-European telecommunications networks"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0222/96) from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the common position established by the Council (C40225/96-95/0124(COD)) with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Decision on a series of guidelines for trans-European telecommunications networks (rapporteur: Mr Hoppenstedt)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I once again have the good fortune, as I had at the last plenary, to be speaking to you shortly before midnight."
"I must say I feel really sorry for those who cannot be with us, and who are sitting out on those hard chairs in bar gardens drinking chilled beer and wine."
"We are really much better off here."
"But we are not here to talk about that, we are here to talk about the trans-European telecommunications networks."
"We are here to deliver our opinion at second reading and to look at the common position and the amendments which the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has unanimously adopted."
"For those who are not familiar with the subject, I would point out once again that in a single market without frontiers, there has to be free movement of goods, people, capital and services."
"The Community measures already adopted and others still in the pipeline will require considerable amounts of information to be exchanged between individuals, economic operators and public administrations, and work is already being done on this."
"The trans-European telecommunications networks are the way to ensure that this exchange of information takes place."
"Article 129d of the EC Treaty lays down guidelines covering the objectives, priorities and broad lines of measures envisaged in the sphere of trans-European networks."
"These guidelines provide for projects of common interest."
"And the trans-European telecommunications networks cover the three levels that are involved: applications, basic services and basic networks."
"The common position supports the linking of networks within the telecommunications infrastructure and the development of interoperable services and applications and access to them, in order to facilitate the transition to the information society, improve industrial competitiveness and consolidate the Community's economic and social cohesion."
"One way to achieve these objectives is to select projects of common interest, and it is a priority in our amendments - and one which we insist on keeping - that an order of precedence should be established."
"Other priorities include educating the public about the advantages of using the trans-European networks and transEuropean telecommunications services, promoting joint initiatives to organize projects on trans-European telecommunications networks, providing funding for applications, particularly those of common interest, promoting partnerships in the public and private sectors, and promoting the supply and use of services and applications among SMEs."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy has identified Articles 3, 6 and 7 as being in particular need of amendment."
"What we really want to see is a trans-European telecommunications network that will guarantee the development of the information society."
"But our amendments and list of priorities are also designed to take special account of the man in the street and his concerns, such as common interfaces or the weaknesses of the system."
"I think it is important that we should have not just information highways in future, but also information walkways and information pedestrian areas."
"We also feel that transfrontier, inter-regional initiatives are particularly important, as is linking up with telecommunications networks in the Mediterranean basin, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the CIS and Latin America."
"All of these are important aspects which we underline in our amendments."
"I feel it is absolutely vital that the Council should accept our opinion and the decisions we reach at second reading without delay, because we feel that there is huge employment potential just waiting to be exploited in the steel industry and in information technologies."
"There would not be any additional jobs, but there would be new ones, and I think we need to do everything we can to take advantage of this."
"It is not enough simply to produce white papers and take weighty decisions about securing existing jobs or creating new ones. We really need structures which are specifically able to provide support for employment."
"We must put an end once and for all to this endless talking and get down to work and do something."
"I think the approach the Commission has proposed in the common position before us provides some extremely good opportunities."
"The information society will develop on its own anyway, but if we fail to act as I have suggested, the man in the street is probably going to be left behind, and this is something we must not allow to happen."
"I therefore commend the proposals of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy to the House, and I am confident that they will be adopted more or less unanimously."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to remind you that the proposal before us, the legal basis for which is Title XII of the Treaty, requires the Union to establish guidelines, objectives, priorities and broad lines of measures envisaged to help implement projects connected with the trans-European telecommunications networks."
"In particular, the aim is to compile a list of sectors in which calls for tenders will be issued with a view to eliciting projects, some of which will be designated as being of 'common interest' and hence eligible for financial support from the Community."
"In February of this year, Parliament delivered its opinion at first reading with a number of amendments, some of which were not accepted by the Council."
"Mr Hoppenstedt's report, which we are discussing today, includes a good many amendments that our group will be unable to approve."
"I would draw particular attention to the problems of comitology and the division of responsibilities between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, the definition of suitable projects, the joint adoption of the work programme with Parliament, and the transformation of the management committee into a mere advisory committee."
"As regards the selection of projects, Parliament's proposed amendments would mean that decisions would be made jointly by the Council and Parliament."
"We cannot, however, agree to this."
"Likewise, we are also against the compulsory transnational element in the identification of projects, firstly because it is not a Treaty obligation and, secondly, because we feel that projects listed under the heading 'information superhighways' in the call for tenders could not be developed on a European basis."
"Lastly, in addition to the points I have just mentioned, no account has been taken of the principle of subsidiarity, nor of the new requirements concerning selection priorities and deadlines for implementing projects."
"Moreover, new priorities have been included which do not seem to us to have been legitimized by any earlier decision."
"Our group therefore reserves the right to vote as it thinks fit tomorrow with regard to certain amendments."
"Mr President, the amount of information in society is increasing to an inconceivable level."
"Having the right information or knowing how to obtain information is an important skill for most people who will work in the labour market of the future."
"Two essential tasks stand out if the information society is to develop positively."
"The first concerns democracy and the right of all to participate in and benefit from the opportunities offered by the information society."
"The second is a question of exploiting technology in the right way and coordinating networks to make the best possible use of their operation, that is to say putting the needs of users, consumers, first."
"The present report is primarily concerned with the latter."
"It is after all important that as representatives of the public we always take into account aspects such as democracy, and fair and equal conditions, when we are discussing technical issues too."
"Effective coordination of telecommunications networks facilitates the transition to the information society."
"Coordination of networks is also important for the implementation of various Community programmes concerning research and technological development and support for small and medium-sized businesses, which include programmes particularly concerned with information, such as INFO 2000 and MEDIA II."
"Allow me to mention some other aspects which are important in this connection."
"Applications should make use of local languages."
"They should also take into account the special needs of sections of the population who will perhaps not initially use systems."
"These may include women, uneducated people, people in sparsely populated areas or disabled people."
"Steps must be taken to ensure that these groups have the same access to and opportunities to use the financial and technical networks and systems."
"As regards the construction of masts and design of telephones and other equipment, it is also important that use is made of the best possible environmental technology for recovery and recycling and to ensure that damage is not caused by the use of systems."
"Attention should also be devoted to the social consequences and applications and to the use of telecommunications technology and networks."
"The important areas of application for telecommunications in the future include education (e.g. distance learning), generally improved communications in both the public and the private sphere, the use of smart-cards of various kinds, electronic means of payment, electronic mail and video services."
"In the somewhat longer term I can also see that undreamt of possibilities will emerge for the use of trans-European telecommunications networks for general and commercial services and the simplification of routine procedures in such sectors as transport, procurement, purchasing, invoicing and the postal, banking and insurance industries, which will be to the benefit of us all."
"The opportunities for improved telecommunications involving sound and pictures will also facilitate decentralisation, with the spread of employment to new regions."
"Properly used, Mr President, this could yield benefits to society through a reduction in environmental damage."
"Finally, I should like to express my satisfaction at the unanimity of the committee."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the second reading of this common position, prepared by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, raises the question of comitology, requiring that the European Parliament should have a greater role and more say in decision-making when it comes to selecting projects for the trans-European telecommunications networks."
"How could I fail to agree, in principle, to making the European institutions more democratic?"
"As regards the telematic networks, however, let me stress the need for rapid and flexible decision-making procedures; it is precisely because of this need that I find Amendments Nos 8, 9, 10 and 11 inappropriate, even though the underlying principle is fair."
"We are faced with a phenomenon - the information society - which is growing and developing continuously."
"I would refer to just three points from a speech by Mr Hundt, President of the Federal Communication Commission, which I heard as a member of the European Union/United States parliamentary delegation: over the past three years, the FCC has done nothing less than deregulate the US market in telecom services, causing it to grow exponentially; the FCC has engaged in the somewhat novel policy of auctioning off the spectrum, earning the sum of USD 20 billion, effortlessly and without any loss to the taxpayer; and USD 1 bn, or 5 % of the proceeds, is to be invested in a project to connect all secondary schools in the United States to the Internet."
"This pragmatic approach is well suited to a sector undergoing continuous change, in which technological progress is unstoppable and investment cycles often very short."
"Even though, according to some, the American example should not necessarily be followed - if it were, we would have to concern ourselves more with installing the infrastructure and less with applications - I am nonetheless inclined to believe that the success of the Internet is based to a large extent on the investment by the Department of Defense in the DARPA network, just as - by analogy - the Global Positioning System, or GPS, is an offshoot of the 'Star Wars' programme, the SDI."
"In conclusion, misgivings are justified in one respect: by dwelling on the defence of linguistic pluralism in Europe, or on procedures for the selection of our preferred applications, we are wasting valuable time in the race for new opportunities: I therefore hope that the views of Parliament and the Commission will soon be reconciled and, at the same time, that measures to promote the information society will be introduced without delay."
"Mr President, Mr Hoppenstedt and all the other speakers are well aware that these are more or less the same amendments that Parliament proposed at first reading, which were rejected by the Council and have now been tabled again."
"They basically concern the question of Parliament's involvement, and this is really what today's debate is all about."
"I can understand Parliament's position, but I can tell you here and now that the Council will not accept it, and you will then be faced with the problem of deciding in the conciliation procedure whether you are prepared to retreat at least partly from your position, or whether you intend to delay this entire programme, which is rightly regarded as being of vital importance."
"I am sorry to say that this is the situation in which Parliament finds itself."
"We will help you as much as we can, but I do not think you will be able to persuade the Council to accept everything you decide tomorrow."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Pressure equipment"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0217/96) from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the common position established by the Council (C40226/96-00/0462(COD)) with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning pressure equipment (rapporteur: Mr Meier)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the certification and testing procedures for pressure equipment in the Member States still vary, so that gas cylinders, for example, cannot yet be transported and used throughout the Community."
"However, the internal market is an area without frontiers, and free trade should not be restricted by such differences."
"Harmonization eliminates restrictions, and that is what this directive is designed to achieve."
"It is, of course, not yet complete, and covers only equipment with a pressure of over 0.5 bars."
"Simple pressure vessels are covered by Directive 87/104."
"The transport of dangerous goods is currently regulated by international agreements, and military equipment, equipment for use in nuclear plants, oil pipelines and underground oil and gas storage vessels are also excluded from the scope of the directive."
"This does not mean, however, that the dangers associated with these sectors have not been recognized: on the contrary, they call for especially detailed regulations and test procedures, and were only excluded from this report because of their special requirements."
"The current legal provisions therefore still do not cover certain areas, but this new directive is intended to improve conditions on the internal market without reducing the existing safety standards in the Member States."
"The basic requirements regarding safety, health protection and hygiene for human beings and safety for animals also need to be given strong consideration."
"The pressure equipment sector in Europe always has been and will continue to be a major market, ensuring jobs and, with its stringent safety standards, successfully matching up to competition on the world market."
"This report deals with the following points, on which we have also tabled amendments."
"We need to examine how effective this directive will be in practice, and we should also consider whether Directive 87/404 on simple pressure vessels could not be incorporated at some later date."
"We should look at the areas currently excluded to see whether they need to be regulated at Union level."
"It would be advisable to include technical experts in the Commission's standing committee."
"We lay particular emphasis on the safety aspects, which are the main concern of many European standards organizations, consumers and users and those working with pressure equipment."
"Safety must be guaranteed by testing at official centres, recognized independent test centres and operators' test centres."
"We also consider the advantages of CE marking."
"In order to highlight the safety element - and no one can actually be against safety - I would also recommend the adoption of Amendments Nos 10 and 12."
"Equivalent overall safety standards should also apply to new materials to which harmonized standards cannot be applied."
"I would point out that we have specifically proposed that there should be cooperation between the Member States and the relevant authorities here, because we feel this is extremely important."
"Regarding the last amendment concerning the diagram, I would point out that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy failed to reach a compromise on this, and it should therefore not be adopted so as to maintain the overall compromise in the committee."
"I therefore commend this report to the House for its approval, together with the comments I made at the start about the need for further development and the exclusion of certain specific types of pressure equipment until further directives appear necessary, ."
"Thank you for your attention at this late hour."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this directive on pressure equipment is intended to harmonize the national regulations in this field which have been in force up to now."
"The very scope of the directive - from fire extinguishers, pressure vessels and valves to entire chemical plants - indicates the wide range of subjects to be covered."
"It is in our economic interests to have a harmonized system of European rules providing a high degree of safety, and that is what this common position gives us."
"The directive covers only products which present a high potential risk of danger, and I think this is the only sensible approach here."
"I would point out that any alteration to the directive could jeopardize the compromise which it has taken two and a half years of hard bargaining to reach, and I therefore feel it is vital that we should exercise some restraint when it comes to proposing amendments."
"At the same time, I think we have to take another look at Annex I, section 7, which is simply a list of technical numerical values."
"The PPE Group feels that this departs from the agreed line, which was that annexes containing only technical figures should be avoided in this kind of directive."
"We therefore intend to ask for a separate vote on this tomorrow, in order to ensure that the directive can at least be discussed again through the conciliation procedure."
"I hope that the PSE Group will be able to support this move, so that we can at least go to conciliation."
"One further point in the directive which I feel I should mention is the aim of giving manufacturers more responsibility in risk evaluation, which I know the technical monitoring institutes are not happy about."
"We feel, however, that it should be one of the manufacturers' responsibilities to identify any risks associated with the manufacturing of equipment and to take these risks into account in the design and assembly processes."
"We therefore feel that this directive both increases responsibility and helps towards deregulation, which is something that the PPE Group welcomes."
"Mr President, I should like to offer Mr Meier my sincere thanks for his report on what is a most difficult and complicated subject, which the Council has also taken a long time to deal with."
"I looked into this and discovered that the Commission took its first decision on the matter in mid1993."
"Not that I am blaming the Council, but it shows just how complicated the subject is, particularly when you consider the modern procedures we wish to use to guarantee safety."
"That is, after all, the aim of the directive: to identify procedures which ensure a high degree of safety, while at the same time avoiding imposing an unnecessary burden of bureaucracy on the industry concerned."
"Mr Konrad did indeed refer to one of these conflicts of interests."
"Some of the amendments improve and clarify the text."
"This applies to Amendments Nos 1 to 7, 9, 11, 12, 14 and 15, which we therefore accept."
"We cannot accept the remaining amendments, Nos 8, 10, 13 and 17."
"Amendment No 8 calls for the product inspection in the higher categories to be carried out in all cases by an independent third party."
"This conflicts with other provisions in the directive and with the Council decision on the conformity assessment procedure, which provides for the use of quality assurance systems as an alternative to such procedures."
"This decision has been successfully applied for some time, and we do not wish to depart from it."
"Amendment No 10 calls for the promotion of the application of harmonized standards."
"Since this is already guaranteed in principle by the new system, there is no need for the additional special report required by this amendment, which we feel would not improve safety, but simply add to the bureaucratic burden."
"I hope that we can now make faster progress than before, because as Mr Meier and Mr Konrad rightly pointed out, this is a most important directive which affects a large section of the internal market and should have been introduced years ago."
"Now we have it within our grasp."
"I have made an effort, for the sake of both the House and, in particular, the interpreters, not to let my speech go on after midnight."
"I have indeed left the President a minute to spare so that he can close the proceedings."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 12 midnight)"
"Tribute"
"Ladies and gentlemen, on 23 June 1996 Andreas Papandreou died."
"Five months previously, his chronic illness had forced him to resign as Prime Minister of Greece in the middle of his third term of office."
"For ten years he had set his seal on Greek policy as Prime Minister and during that time had established his country's place in the European Union."
"He was not an easy partner to deal with - not even for his friends - but there again he was not the Prime Minister of an easy country either."
"The positions he adopted did not always meet with approval."
"That has to do with his country's difficult neighbours and with a history full of disruptions and antitheses."
"But as President of the European Council he was also able to achieve integration at crucial moments, thereby helping the Community to make vital progress: in 1988, when the Council adopted the financial package that was needed to achieve the aim of the Single European Act, and in 1994, when the last remaining institutional questions were resolved to pave the way for the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden to the European Union."
"Andreas Papandreou heightened our awareness of the significance of Greece and of the Mediterranean region, with its great strategic importance to Europe."
"Andreas Papandreou played a vital part in restoring freedom and democracy in Greece after the dark years of military rule."
"He was one of the fathers of democratic Greece, who led it into the community and solidarity of the European democracies and irreversibly embedded it there."
"Andreas Papandreou had a gift that few people possess, namely the ability to captivate others through his personality, his life and his work."
"For Greece and its people he was greater than the sum of his numerous public offices and political achievements."
"The overwhelming grief of the many thousands of people who paid their last respects to him on the day of his funeral reflected the esteem in which he was held."
"We sense the loss felt by his country at his death."
"Our sympathy goes out to his family, his party and his people."
"(The House rose and observed one minute's silence.)"
"You have risen to honour the memory of Andreas Papandreou."
"I thank you."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I am asking for the floor pursuant to Rule 108 in order to make a personal statement."
"At the end of yesterday evening's debate on the transEuropean networks there occurred what I must say was a deplorable incident."
"I had called into question - in terms which I freely admit were colourful - the behaviour of the Commission during the last two weeks of this affair, both as regards its docility in dealing with the Council and as regards its duplicity in dealing with Parliament."
"In his reply, Commissioner Kinnock, instead of arguing his case on the facts, saw fit to make me the target of a volley of insults which even his Welsh origins cannot fully excuse."
"Having described me as 'ponderous and immature' , he went on to describe my intervention as 'empty' ."
"As for being ponderous, ladies and gentlemen, I might be inclined to overlook the remark, since my weight makes it impossible for me to deny the Commissioner's charge."
"As for being immature, I might again take a forgiving view, because the description comes from a man who for his part clearly suffers from something of an excess of maturity."
"As for the last point, I think that what Mr Kinnock can charge me with is not having made an empty intervention, as he said, but an excessively dense intervention, because I explained, following on from my colleague Mr Dell'Alba, that between the letter of 1 July sent by Mr Kinnock to President Cornelissen and his subsequent letter of 12 July to Mr Simpson, the Commission had in fact performed a perfect U turn, since the first letter explained that the Essen list could not be modified without codecision and the second demonstrated that it had been."
"I do not want to blow this incident up out of proportion, but since President Santer is with us today I suggest, Mr President, that you ask him whether he finds it normal that every time a member of the Commission is caught in flagrante delicto contradicting himself, he prefers to make a personal attack on the honourable Member who points out his error rather than offering a reasoned answer."
"Mr Bourlanges, that was a personal statement under Rule 108."
"We shall, of course, communicate its content to the Commissioner; that goes without saying."
"Besides, let me say that this entire House consists only of mature persons!"
"(Laughter, applause)"
"(Parliament approved the Minutes)"
"Programme of the Irish presidency"
"The next item is the statement by the President-in-Office of the Council on the programme of the Irish presidency."
"It gives me great pleasure to welcome Mr Spring, Tánaiste and President-in-Office, to make a statement on the Irish presidency."
"The Irish presidency faces formidable tasks, but it has been well prepared."
"We, in the European Parliament, are looking forward to active cooperation with you and your colleagues throughout the next six months."
"But, allow me to add, we in the European Parliament are deeply aware of your preoccupation with the concerns of all the Irish people at the latest developments in Northern Ireland."
"The peace process, which was initiated two years ago, thanks to the courage and resolution of the Irish and British Governments and of leaders of the community in Northern Ireland, has suffered severe setbacks in the last few weeks."
"We, in this House, have already placed on record our abhorrence at the recent resumption of terrorist activity by the IRA and we do so today once more."
"In the last few days rioting and violence have returned to the streets of Northern Ireland; sectarian confrontation has jeopardized the onward march of peace."
"We, in this Parliament, remain steadfast in our support for you and all those like you in your efforts for peace and reconciliation."
"We strongly urge all the democratic forces, the two governments and community leaders, to redouble their efforts and give a new signal of hope for the peace process through the all-party talks."
"Last week two of our Member States, France and Britain, welcomed Nelson Mandela on a state visit."
"The huge public outpouring of affection and respect for the South African President was, of course, to salute his role as an architect of a new democratic and free country, but it was also recognition of the reconciliation that he has brought to his country."
"After years of persecution and violence and discrimination he preaches peace and friendship and forgiveness."
"He does not - he cannot - forget the past but he is building for the future."
"It is the most powerful message of reconciliation and hope; it is a message that we in Europe must not ignore; it is a message that the whole community in Northern Ireland must hear."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before I begin my statement on Ireland's presidency of the Council, I should like to thank you for your words of support in relation to Northern Ireland."
"This is a matter of the utmost concern to me not only as Foreign Minister of Ireland but also as Presidentin-Office of the Council in which capacity I address you today."
"As Members are aware, events have taken place over the last ten days which have led to serious instability in Northern Ireland and have placed in peril the substantial achievements of the peace process over the last two years."
"The origins of the recent disturbances are deeply rooted in the fundamental divisions which exist within Northern Ireland and which must be addressed by achieving a new beginning for relationships within Northern Ireland, within the island of Ireland and between the peoples of Britain and Ireland and by agreeing new institutions and structures to take account of the totality of relationships."
"Nothing can excuse the widespread violence and intimidation of the last ten days."
"Violence may be an outlet for frustration but it can only worsen an already bad situation and will not solve the problems which lie at its root."
"Solutions will be found exclusively through dialogue, negotiation and compromise."
"It is essential that the supremacy of politics over street violence should be quickly re-asserted, the rule of law must be seen to prevail and to be effectively policed in an impartial manner."
"A solution must be found to the issue of contentious parades which serve to provoke the recent unrest."
"The Irish and British Governments have agreed to hold a special meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference tomorrow at which recent events and the parades issue, including the review announced by the British Government, will be discussed."
"The two governments will continue their joint efforts to bring about a comprehensive political settlement based on a lasting peace and to build on the foundations of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the Joint Declaration and the framework document."
"The multi-party negotiations launched by the two governments on 10 June offer an unprecedented opportunity to achieve such an agreement."
"The Council urges the parties to the negotiations to negotiate in good faith on the basis of exclusively peaceful means and the rejection of violence."
"It calls on all those involved to open their minds to the building of new relationships based on equality of treatment, parity of esteem and the accommodation of the rights and traditions of all."
"May I conclude these brief remarks by expressing the hope that the inspiration which sustained the founding fathers of the European Union, their determination to build peace in diversity and to banish for ever the violent divisions of the past may also serve to inspire the peoples of Northern Ireland and the British and Irish Governments in the challenges which now confront us."
"The Irish presidency of the Council of Ministers of the European Union began on 1 July."
"However, no presidency has really begun until its programme of priorities has been launched before the European Parliament."
"I come here today to launch the priorities of the Irish presidency."
"And I come here today to commend these priorities to you, which I know you share."
"The Irish presidency takes place at a time when the European Union faces exceptional challenges."
"We must translate growth into jobs."
"We must tackle the challenges of globalisation and ensure we are prepared for these challenges."
"We must address the concerns of citizens as to their personal security."
"We must manage the move to Economic and Monetary Union."
"We must prepare for enlargement."
"We must advance the work of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"And, most fundamentally, we must maintain and reinforce the enormous achievement that the European Union represents."
"The European Parliament will have a significant role to play in the task of ensuring that the Union can meet the challenges it faces over the next decade and more."
"In our programme of priorities for the next six months we emphasise the concerns of citizens."
"As politicians elected by the people you know what these concerns are."
"You know that our constituents are entitled to secure employment."
"You know that our constituents are entitled to safer streets."
"You know that our constituents are entitled to sound management of their money."
"And most fundamentally, you know that our voters want a peaceful Europe."
"You know what our people want and are entitled to."
"And on the most fundamental question the European Union has delivered."
"Europe is at peace."
"It has been at peace for 50 years now."
"As I look around this room from left to right I know that it is inconceivable that Europe should ever be at war with itself again."
"The European Union, therefore, passes the first and basic test."
"It has set itself additional goals."
"The Single Market has reinforced the logic of Economic and Monetary Union."
"1 January 1999 has been confirmed as the start of the third stage of EMU."
"The benefit of currency stability has been seen in low interest rates."
"The message that sound money has a huge impact on creating a sound economy is accepted."
"What we must do now is translate these benefits into secure jobs and put more resources into creating safer streets."
"The Irish presidency will place great emphasis on employment."
"Employment is in the first place a matter for national action."
"However, acting together we can achieve a significant reinforcement of national efforts."
"This is especially the case in an increasingly global economy, as the conclusions of the G-7 Summit attest."
"The European Union provides an ever wider field where Member States can cooperate, coordinate their efforts and learn from each other's experience."
"Job creation is the overriding challenge for all of our Governments."
"It is the single greatest concern of our electors, as you will be well aware."
"The Commission's White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment sets the guidelines."
"Successive European Council meetings at Essen, Cannes, Madrid and Florence have provided the framework."
"We will prepare the second joint report on employment for the Dublin European Council in December."
"We will emphasise, in particular, the needs of the excluded: of young people, the long-term unemployed and unemployed women."
"The Irish presidency will also develop the ideas in the Pact of Confidence on Employment initiated by President Santer."
"We will draw on our own national experience in the local employment area."
"We want to see the adoption of the multi-annual programme for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"We will actively promote competitiveness in industry and promote adaptation to the information society."
"Organised crime is the scourge of modern societies."
"The drug trade is one of its worst manifestations."
"This was brought home to us in Ireland very recently with the shooting dead of a brave journalist who fearlessly investigated criminal wrongdoing."
"Veronica Guerin's murder is a testimony to the power of words and truth."
"She uncovered evil."
"Evil people murdered her."
"The expressions of grief in Ireland and beyond at her murder bring home the need to pursue with ever greater vigour the evil people who perpetrate these deeds."
"Justice and home affairs issues remain largely within the national competence of Member States."
"Nevertheless we need to ensure that the Union adds to the efforts taken at national level to counter crime and especially the trade in drugs."
"We must ensure that the four freedoms of the Single Market are not abused by criminal elements and that they do not become freedoms from law."
"We must ensure that the instruments available to us nationally, internationally and at the level of the European Union are used and coordinated to the full."
"The Irish presidency will focus on a number of activities over the next six months."
"For example, we want to see the Europol Convention completed, the Extradition Convention signed; we want more cooperation between national forensic laboratories; more cooperation in the external borders area; we want serious drug trafficking offences to carry penalties within the highest range available in each Member State; we want greater cooperation between police and customs services and we want enhanced cooperation between customs services and the private sector."
"We have every confidence that the European Parliament will play its part also in a determined European level response to the drug problem."
"In particular, I hope it will expedite its consideration of the Community Programme on Drug Dependence so that it can come into effect quickly."
"On other justice and home affairs issues the Irish presidency will seek to improve collaboration between the Member States in such areas as policing, customs, immigration, asylum policy and judicial cooperation."
"In response, in particular, to the concerns expressed by the European Parliament, the presidency will build on the conclusions and recommendations of the Conference on Trafficking in Women held in Vienna in June 1996."
"We will continue work on the Action Programme on Immigration and Asylum."
"And in both the drugs and the other justice and home affairs areas we will look closely at the funding arrangements available."
"Both drugs and employment issues are of great and immediate concern to everyone in Europe."
"But the European Union is also playing its part in ensuring an equitable, tolerant and inclusive society, a society that cherishes its weakest members including people with disabilities."
"It has responsibilities in the areas of public health, social affairs and cultural cooperation."
"It also has responsibilities in the education, youth and research sectors."
"We will seek progress in all of these."
"The Union's role in the environment policy is effective and worthwhile."
"My own country has benefited substantially from the development of the Union's activities in this area."
"Standards have been raised."
"Awareness has grown."
"Citizens have a better grasp of their rights and obligations."
"The environment is therefore an area of particular concern to our presidency."
"Economic and Monetary Union is on course."
"The Irish presidency will aim to show further substantive progress by the end of its term."
"The maintenance of stability in the Third Stage and the exchange rate relationship between the Euro and the other EU currencies will be the main focus of attention."
"We aim to complete the technical preparatory work on the legal framework of the Euro before the end of 1996."
"And the Dublin European Council will reconfirm 1 January, 1999 as the beginning of the Third Stage of EMU."
"The Single Market is one of the great success stories of the European Union."
"The White Paper programme has been practically finalised."
"But the Single Market is not complete."
"To consolidate growth and employment we must remove the remaining areas of divergence in our economies."
"The Santer Pact of Confidence on Employment has emphasised the need for internal market consolidation to create jobs."
"To this end the Irish presidency will seek to expedite the adoption of the statute for a European Company and the legal framework for biotechnological inventions."
"We will also advance work on the internal market in electricity and in the gas and telecommunications sectors."
"The Union must ensure strict implementation of the policies of the Union to ensure fair competition by preventing the granting of illegal state aid and preventing monopolies from developing."
"Work arising from the Commission's report on the effectiveness of the Internal Market will be pursued actively as will the Citizens First Initiative."
"The Common Agricultural Policy remains a keystone of the Union and we have a considerable agenda to pursue here."
"The restoration of confidence in the beef sector will be a major focus of attention during our presidency."
"My country exports 85 % of its beef production."
"Consequently we realise the importance of the establishment at Florence of a route map for the resolution of the BSE crisis."
"The successful management of this issue will require cooperation and solidarity from all Member States."
"We will seek to ensure that the issue is dealt with according to scientific criteria outside the political realm."
"Since the last Irish presidency in 1990, the context in which the European Union operates has changed dramatically."
"The Union has enlarged to fifteen Member States."
"It has received applications for membership from an additional twelve States."
"The external challenges and responsibilities which the Union has had to address have also become more complex and demanding."
"The Union has sought to respond primarily by engaging in building relationships of partnership and mutual respect with its neighbours in Europe and other regions."
"The establishment of a Common Foreign and Security Policy by the Treaty on European Union represented a significant step forward in equipping the Union with the capacity to pursue these objectives more effectively."
"While the tasks which Ireland now inherits as presidency in the external relations area have become more daunting, we draw inspiration from the work carried out by preceding presidencies and by the role played by the European Parliament."
"It is our aim as presidency to foster the development of a Europe that is open to the world and actively contributing to international peace, security and solidarity."
"Advancing the CFSP's objectives in relation to the promotion of democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights will be important in this regard."
"One of our major priorities is to pursue the Union's active support for the full implementation of the peace initiatives in former Yugoslavia and to contribute to efforts to prevent a return to the tragic circumstances which have shattered that region in recent years."
"Crucial issues will include the holding of free and fair elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina under OSCE auspices, economic reconstruction, creating conditions for the return of refugees and ensuring full respect for human and minority rights."
"We will seek to develop political dialogue with partners in the security area."
"We will also pursue the continuing and effective development of EU-WEU cooperation on the basis of the Treaty on European Union."
"At its summit in Lisbon in December, we will work to strengthen the role of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe as a pan-European security forum."
"Fundamental to our system of global security is a reformed and financially secure United Nations system."
"Nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, reinforcing prohibitions on chemical and biological weapons and highlighting conventional arms issues will remain areas of priority for the Union during our presidency."
"To the maximum extent possible, we will also seek to develop the international momentum in support of the elimination of anti-personnel landmines."
"In the light of the Union's support for the reform process, we will give priority to developing further the Union's relations with Russia and to assisting in its political and economic transformation."
"The situation in Chechnya will continue to be monitored closely."
"We will also devote attention to the Ukraine, given its pivotal position in the region."
"We will give high priority to continuing the EU's efforts in support of the Middle East Peace Process, in close cooperation with the co-sponsors of the process."
"The EU's role in this area should be commensurate with the scale of the economic resources which the Union is committing in support of the peace process."
"We will also seek to advance the Euro-Mediterranean partnership which offers opportunities for wide-ranging dialogue and cooperation with countries of the Mediterranean region."
"Transatlantic relations are of fundamental importance to both the EU and US and for peace and prosperity worldwide."
"Consequently, we will attach particular importance to the effective implementation of the EU-US Agenda and Action Plan."
"We will seek to ensure enhanced cooperation on a range of foreign policy issues."
"The multilateral trading system is of vital importance to all of us."
"We will work closely with the US to strengthen the system - especially in the context of the First WTO Ministerial Conference."
"And we will cooperate with the US on a range of other areas including the fight against crime."
"We will work to continue to strengthen and develop relations with Canada."
"Preparation for the first Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation in Singapore next December will be a major responsibility for us."
"We need to consolidate and develop the multilateral trade system."
"The European Union must make its contribution towards that end."
"Conflict prevention and the development of our institutional relationship with regional organisations such as the Organisation of African Unity and Southern Africa Development Community will be the major focus of our efforts in respect of Africa."
"We will also attach importance to strengthening the Union's economic and political relations with Asia, to developing closer relations with the countries of Latin America and Australasia and to continuing efforts to narrow the gap between rich and poor on the basis of sustainable development."
"Enlargement is a historic opportunity for peace and prosperity in Europe."
"The European Union has demonstrated its willingness to seize this opportunity."
"The process of preparing for enlargement is now underway."
"The Madrid European Council, building on Copenhagen and Essen, took a series of decisions of the first importance."
"The Commission was requested to expedite preparation of its Opinions on the membership applications."
"The Commission was requested to embark on the preparation of a composite paper on enlargement."
"And the Commission was requested to deepen its evaluation of the effects of enlargement on the common policies and to undertake a detailed analysis of the Union's financing system post-1999."
"The principle that applicant countries be treated on an equal basis was set out at the Madrid European Council."
"As presidency, we will give every support and encouragement to the Commission in its work in these areas."
"We look forward to the Commission's report on work-in-progress at the Dublin European Council in December."
"Meanwhile, we will use to the full the opportunities offered by the Union's pre-accession strategy and in particular the structured dialogue mechanisms."
"We will ensure that the applicant countries continue to play an important role in discussions on matters of mutual interest and common concern."
"I come now to the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Our presidency is not just about managing the Union as it is but also about helping to shape the Union of the future."
"The Florence European Council set a challenging mandate for the Intergovernmental Conference during the Irish presidency."
"In line with Florence, our aim will be to bring forward to the Dublin European Council in December a general outline for a draft revision of the Treaties."
"The general aims of the IGC are:"
"to bring the Union closer to the citizen; -to strengthen and enlarge the scope of the Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy, and-to assure the effective functioning of the institutions while respecting their balance, and the efficiency of the decision-making process.The Irish presidency will work ambitiously to achieve these aims building on the good work of the Italian presidency."
"We depend, of course, on the commitment of all partners."
"What we want is to enter right away the stage of substantive negotiations."
"Indeed this process has already started and we are seeking already to focus discussion where possible on draft Treaty texts."
"I know that the European Parliament fully supports the aims of the IGC."
"I know that the European Parliament supports the presidency's approach of moving now into the negotiating phase with a view to an ambitious outcome of the IGC which will serve the interests of the European Union as a whole."
"I should emphasise our appreciation of the contribution to the IGC which is being made by the European Parliament."
"The Irish presidency looks forward to working closely with the European Parliament during its term."
"The need for transparency in the IGC and in other areas of the Union's activities remains a major focus of attention."
"The Irish presidency will do everything in its power to ensure the maximum openness and transparency."
"We now face the task of explaining to our citizens the outcome of the IGC and the implications of enlargement."
"We must also ensure that EMU is fully understood."
"As politicians we know that communication is vital if citizens are to accept the many changes which will come about in the Union between now and the end of the century."
"The Irish presidency agenda is complex and multifaceted."
"Amid all the complexities, however, we must realise that we are a Union of fifteen Member States each contributing in its own way to the overall progress of the common enterprise."
"It is very much in that spirit that the Irish presidency will carry out its responsibilities."
"For the next six months Ireland has the challenge and the privilege of being a presidency of the Council of Ministers for the fifteen Member States."
"The European Parliament is a Parliament for people throughout the European Union, for the people of all the Member States."
"Together, you Parliament and we the Council of Ministers, represent the common interest and the interests of all."
"We must work together to achieve the common end of defending the interests of our citizens."
"The European Union rightly looks forward to the prospect of a membership of twenty seven or more Member States."
"As part of the preparation for enlargement, we are engaged in the IGC process."
"Enlargement and the IGC are the appropriate focus of the European Union's attention."
"They are the focus for a community of Member States."
"We must not lose sight of the spirit of what we are and what we will be."
"We must continue to recognize our shared interests."
"We must together move towards our common goals."
"We must work with each other cooperatively and in the interests of all, and in the interests of those who want to join us."
"If we lose sight of this spirit of common endeavour now, how can we hope to create a community or Union of twenty seven or more Member States?"
"The strength of this Union of ours has been our willingness to listen and to learn, to urge and to accommodate, to share and to support."
"Without these attributes the European Union - with however many Member States - will have little future."
"I have set out for you our priorities for the next six months."
"These priorities represent the priorities of the European Union as a whole."
"I know that the European Parliament shares the common goals which have been set and towards which we will aim during the next six months."
"In setting the priorities, we have consulted widely with the institutions of the European Union."
"We have striven to ensure that the views of the Commission and of European Parliament are taken into account."
"We will work closely with the European Parliament."
"We will continue to ensure that the European Parliament's crucial role is acknowledged."
"As presidency of the Council of Ministers of the European Union, I also ask you in the European Parliament to help us to ensure that the agenda of the Union is advanced during the next six months."
"We cannot achieve the goals we have set ourselves without you."
"We seek your continued support and assistance to achieve our mutual goal: a Europe that works for all."
"D'fhás agus d'fhorbair an tAontas Eorpach ón mbun-smaoineamh 'Comhphobal' ."
"Ó na caogaidí anuas, rugadh agus tógadh fís na hEorpa le spriorad na meithle, sé sin le rá, tíortha móra agus beaga ag comhoibriú le chéile mar dlúth-chomharsana."
"Tá príomh-aidhmeanna Uachtaránacht na hÉireann socraithe agam do na sé mhí atá le teacht; déanfaimid ár ndícheall i dtreo Aontais níos fearr a bhunú don todhchaí."
"I spiorad an chomhphobail 'is ar scáth a chéile a mairimid, ' agus is mar thoradh ar ár gcomhoibriú laethúil go bhfuil Aontas cruthaithe againn anois atá níos treise ná iomlán a rannpháirteanna."
"Ní hé sin le rá gur féidir linn anois ár scíth a ligean, caithfimid leanúint ar aghaidh leis an dea-obair ag tarraingt ar Eoraip atá níos éifeachtaí fós, Eoraip atá ag obair don uile dhuine."
"(Translation: The European Union has its roots in the concept of community."
"This spirit has permeated the vision of Europe from the 1950s to the present day, a Europe of good neighbours and good neighbourliness, countries large and small working together."
"I have set Ireland's priorities for our next six months as presidency; we will make our contribution to the building of a better Union for the future."
"In the best traditions of the community we will not be alone in this task - it has been through working together that a Union has been created that is greater than the sum of its parts."
"We should not rest on our laurels, but continue the process towards a more effective Europe, one that works for all.)"
"Mr President, it is a pleasure for me to address you in a great language."
"Thank you."
"(Loud and sustained applause)"
"Thank you, Mr President-in-Office."
"We also thank you for this example of cultural and linguistic diversity in Europe that you have given us."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we come now to the debate."
"Mrs Malone will begin on behalf of the Party of European Socialists."
"Mr President, it is a great honour for me, on behalf of my Group, to extend to the Tánaiste, Mr Spring, the President-in-Office, a céad mile fáilte to the European Parliament and I want to congratulate him on the very detailed programme of work that he has set out."
"I can tell him to take off the earphones now, I am going to proceed in English."
"I also want to congratulate you, Mr Spring, on your success last week with regard to ending the impasse on the MEDA programme."
"This fifth Irish presidency takes place at a time when the Union is facing exceptional challenges, including the preparations for economic and monetary union and for enlargement and the revision of the treaties."
"I want to acknowledge, Mr Spring, your own personal efforts in trying to establish reconciliation in Northern Ireland, often in very difficult circumstances."
"We in this Parliament support your efforts to restore credibility to the peace process and indeed to the political process."
"Can you assure us that the Council will play its full part, in the same way that the Commission and Parliament have, in mobilizing the political resources of the European Union in bringing about a peaceful resolution to this conflict in Northern Ireland?"
"Returning now to the priorities which you have outlined for your presidency, we fully agree with the emphasis you have put on unemployment, organized crime, drugs and fighting fraud."
"But the real challenge for the Irish presidency will be to get concrete results so that these aspirations are not left as empty sentiments."
"On employment, I hope that the high-level working group which has just been set up to examine the question of financing the trans-European networks will report back as quickly as possible."
"As to the IGC, it is important that the draft treaty being prepared is not based on the lowest common denominator principle."
"We need a revised treaty that is truly relevant to the needs of ordinary people."
"This should provide, for example, for the establishment of a European coastguard service to tackle the drugs problem, which is a dreadful blight on all our communities."
"Mr President-in-Office, we have heard your remarks on the EU-US agenda, and, as a member of this Parliament's US Delegation, I can tell you that we have just returned from Washington, where we had meetings with members of the Congress, and a lot of our discussions obviously focused on the Helms-Burton legislation - legislation that is very damaging to our European interests."
"So while we welcomed last night's announcement from the American side of a six months delay, we are fundamentally opposed to this legislation in principle and we want to say that we think that the Americans, by bullying their allies, have not found the correct way forward."
"I am confident that this Irish presidency will deliver on its priorities as it has consistently done in the past and give the lie to the myth that the small states cannot effectively handle the assignment."
"We share the goals that the Tánaiste has outlined, his vision and commitment, and we will work with you, Mr Spring, so we can progress towards an EU which is based on equity, tolerance, justice and peace and which is open and accessible to all citizens."

It gives me great pleasure also to welcome the commencement of the Irish presidency and to listen to the ambitious programme which Minister Spring has laid out for us today, because his priorities - unemployment, drugs, tolerance, openness, education, the environment and human rights for people with disabilities - are all key areas in Parliament's agenda."
"His commitment to keeping his message simple, human and, above all, relevant, is also greatly to be welcomed, because if we do not do this, and include the citizens in our programmes, the vital survival of this Community will be at risk."
"The President-in-Office has an onerous burden: to make progress in these areas under the shadow of what is, perhaps, the last remaining and most intractable political conflict in Europe is, indeed, a very heavy burden to bear."
"However, the President-in-Office has made a very good start."
"We have made a very good start: we have seen many ministers visiting parliamentary committees and political groups already, and this has been much appreciated."
"The briefing and exchanging of views will set a very good precedent for the Irish presidency."
"We look forward to this continuing throughout the presidency."
"With few exceptions, European society today is very tolerant."
"However, our tolerant and open society is under threat from organized crime and from the drug trade."
"We must engage in a wholehearted and unrelenting attack on these threats to our society."
"Our hospitals and jails are full of the victims of drug addiction; most crime is now fuelled by the need to fund a drug habit; and our ability to remain open and grow in tolerance and openness in our Community depends on our capacity to control the narcotics and organized crime trade."
"The President-in-Office will have the primary responsibility for guiding negotiations in the Intergovernmental Conference on the revision of the Treaties."
"I hope that he can ensure that any new Treaty will provide the legal framework needed successfully to fight organized crime and the drug trade."
"I also hope he will encourage all the Member States to honour and sign the various international conventions which remain unsigned by some Member States - conventions, for example, on money-laundering, on the internationalization of organized crime and, of course, on cooperation between the police forces within the Community."
"If we wish to hold on to an open and tolerant Europe, we must defeat these organized criminals."
"Enlargement of the Union to include countries from Central and Eastern Europe is absolutely unthinkable unless we have this kind of control over organized crime."
"This also has a serious affect on immigration policies within the Community."
"We must remember, in terms of immigration, that mercy and tolerance must be our first preoccupation."
"Unless we can control organized crime - international organized crime, particularly - we will find that these policies will become more and more restrictive."
"I take this opportunity, on behalf of my group, to congratulate and offer support to the President-in-Office and to wish him every success in the course of the presidency."
"Mr President, i dtosach báire ba mhaith liomsa céad míle fáilte a chuir roimh Tánaiste na hEireann is Uachtaráin Chomhairle na hAirí do Comhphobal na hEorpa ar an gcéad turais seo atá déanta aige do Parlaimint na hEorpa."
"I warmly welcome the Irish presidency on their first visit to the European Parliament since taking up office on 1 July."
"I would briefly like to comment on the introductory remarks made by the Tánaiste in relation to the Northern Ireland situation and say to him that many in this Parliament were dismayed at the abject surrender in Northern Ireland in recent days to mob rule."
"The official message conveyed is that the rights of the nationalist community can be overridden by force when necessary."
"This has inevitably caused deep anger within the nationalist community which must, however, be channelled constructively and with dignity."
"There must be no violence, no bombs and no retaliation."
"All must respect that the principle of consent must be upheld and consent must be sought and given freely, peacefully and without intimidation or coercion."
"The freedom to give consent is also the freedom to withhold consent and the consent of both communities is needed."
"The British Government pledged in the framework document to exercise their jurisdiction with rigorous impartiality on behalf of all the people of Northern Ireland in their diversity with emphasis on full respect for and equality of civil, political, social and cultural rights and freedom from discrimination for all citizens, on parity of esteem and a just and equal treatment for the identity, ethos and aspirations of both communities."
"That is the pledge."
"Both communities in Northern Ireland are vulnerable in different parts in Northern Ireland."
"I deplore the sectarian attacks to which each of them have been subjected in recent days."
"The spirit of reconciliation and mutual accommodation is needed all over Northern Ireland in place of the spirit that the majority rules."
"The human, political and economic cost of such an attitude is far too great and risks repeating the shameful intimidation of people from their homes which has scarred Northern Ireland so often in the past."
"There is a great responsibility on the British Government and the Irish Government and all the northern parties to give the peace process fresh impetus after the grave setback of the last ten days."
"I am sure that the work of the Irish presidency over the next six months will yield positive results for the many difficult problems which are confronting decision-makers in the European Union at the present time."
"The most serious political, social and economic problem confronting the Union at the present time continues to be the urgent need to find job opportunities for the 18 million people without work in Europe today."
"Commission President Jacques Santer recently tabled proposals for a Confidence Pact on Employment containing a series of measures which have the potential to promote economic growth and new job opportunities provided that our respective governments agree to work with each other and with the Commission on the implementation of President Santer's plans."
"The Irish presidency has decided that tackling unemployment will be the main priority of its term in office."
"If the presidency is to succeed in making progress on this important issue, then it must persuade the Union's Member States not just to give political support to the Confidence Pact on Employment, but also to provide the funding to implement the proposals and construct the TENs projects put forward by President Santer."
"While it will not be easy to get the agreement of the national governments on the politically difficult question of funding, the Irish presidency must guard against efforts, which are already under way, simply to divert resources from the structural funds and the common agricultural policy to fund these new proposals."
"Such a solution would effectively result only in funds being transferred from the agricultural and peripheral regions to the denselypopulated and already highly-developed regions of the centre of the Union."
"This would not be in the best interests of the European Union as a whole nor would it be in the best interests of the countries on the periphery such as Ireland."
"The presidency's second priority is to tackle the drugs problem."
"Effective action to confront the illegal drugs trade requires a wide range of measures such as harmonizing laws on drug smuggling and money laundering and increased cooperation between police and custom agencies."
"Most of all, as customs and immigration control within the Union are progressively reduced, increased cooperation will be required to confront the drug smugglers along the Union's external frontiers."
"Resources will have to be transferred from the Union's internal frontiers, where they are no longer required, to the external frontiers."
"The most appropriate method of transferring resources to the Union's external frontiers to combat drug smuggling is by making money available in the annual budget of the Union for upgrading equipment and increasing training to these agencies."
"The 1996 budget does not contain any money to assist in policing the Union's external frontiers."
"If the presidency is to succeed in making progress in tackling the drug problem then it should, as a matter of urgency, bring forward proposals for making money available from the Union's 1997 budget for this purpose."
"Mr President, may I right at the start of this debate, as a Dutchman and a European, express my solidarity with the Irish Government in its efforts to move the peace process in Northern Ireland forward."
"This is a subject on which my friend and colleague Pat Cox will be speaking in detail shortly."
"I hope the people of Northern Ireland will draw inspiration from the European Union's role as an instrument for fostering understanding and cultivating reconciliation."
"There are 18 million people without work in the Union."
"The combating of unemployment must be the top priority of any presidency."
"Grand objectives are not enough."
"It is actions which count."
"It is high time the Council actually accepted the proposals which have been gathering dust on its shelves for years and which would, if accepted, help to create jobs."
"I am thinking particularly of the proposal for a European company statute."
"The European Commission estimates that businesses would save 30 billion ECU a year if this instrument were in place. A sum bigger than the annual budget for the European structural funds."
"Just think how many jobs could be created if investment on this scale were made feasible."
"But this decision has remained blocked in the Council for years."
"I urge the Irish presidency to get this matter sorted out at last."
"One of the Irish presidency's priorities, and rightly so, is the fight against crime."
"Criminals are currently the only people who can come and go across Europe's borders at will."
"Our internal borders are no deterrent to crime, quite the opposite, they make it harder for us to combat crime."
"My Group believes that things like border checks, immigration and drug trafficking should be placed under the authority of the Union."
"Intergovernmental cooperation on these is simply not working."
"Take drugs, for example."
"The French and Dutch Governments have dug themselves into an entrenched position."
"The only way they can dig themselves out again and resolve their differences is by getting the European Union to act as a bridge-builder."
"The Dutch are right to point to the relative attractiveness of their policy in terms of addict numbers and drug-related deaths."
"But the French are equally right to ask the Dutch to limit the cross-border effects of that Dutch policy."
"I urge the Irish presidency to try to mend fences between The Hague and Paris here."
"The lack of courage shown by the European Union in Yugoslavia continues to undermine the Union's credibility in the eyes of the world."
"The European Union would like to see Mr Karadzic and Mr Mladic relinquishing power."
"But last Monday the foreign ministers once again ended their meeting without agreement on how this objective can be secured."
"It is high time IFOR was given a mandate to help bring about the arrest of these alleged war criminals."
"It is high time the foreign ministers showed leadership here."
"I trust the fact that Ireland is the only EU Member State which is not part of IFOR will not prevent Ireland from giving a lead on this."
"Europe was not prepared to bring peace to Bosnia. It should at least help to bring reconciliation and justice."
"I also urge the presidency to concentrate on Kosovo."
"The merciless Serb oppression of the Albanian minority in Kosovo is a direct threat to peace and stability in the Balkans."
"It is vital for the Union to bring every possible pressure to bear on Mr Milosevic to persuade him to open talks with the leader of Kosovo, Mr Rikova."
"Here too I ask the Irish presidency to show leadership."
"Finally, a word or two on Cyprus."
"The situation in Cyprus is getting worse."
"Union efforts to improve things have not been successful."
"Nor have those of the USA."
"I call on the Irish presidency to work with the USA to help improve the situation in Cyprus."
"It is essential that stability in that part of the Mediterranean should be improved."
"Mr President, I should like to tell the President-in-Office of the Council that our group feels very much in agreement with the presentation that he made of the Irish Government's six-month programme and in respect of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Like the other groups, we are also very much aware of the awfulness of violence in Northern Ireland."
"This is not something affecting Ireland alone, it is something affecting the whole of Europe and we wish to lend our support to the Irish presidency to try and resolve the problem - our eventual aim should be peace, solidarity and cooperation between all parties involved."
"Undoubtedly, this is a vital time to take a look at the Intergovernmental Conference and assess the results."
"As you said it is necessary to begin the real negotiations so that a Treaty programme can be presented at the December Summit in Dublin."
"We cannot have any transitional presidencies."
"The Irish presidency cannot be seen as a transition to the Dutch presidency and therefore we very much appreciate his courage, the clarity of his ideas and the fact that he has set objectives already for the December Council."
"We should also add dialogue and cooperation with the European Parliament and bring European construction closer to the citizens and social protagonists."
"A dialogue, in particular, on the social model and problem of unemployment."
"We also give our support to the presentation and approval of a constitutional framework which includes a declaration of fundamental rights and duties and the inclusion of a chapter on employment in the Treaties."
"We must give employment the same importance as EMU."
"We refuse to consider employment as a rare commodity on the market of which we are difficult consumers."
"It is another philosophy the lack of jobs for so many European citizens is also costly."
"In terms of regional policy and, more particularly, in terms of the structural funds, we reject any linking of the structural policies with the accomplishment of the indices of convergence through conditionality clauses."
"Cohesion and enlargement have to be re-enforced head-on."
"We agree with the measures proposed to combat drug abuse, delinquency and the white slave trade."
"The Irish presidency will also show special sensitivity to the treatment of immigrants."
"The Irish people has always been a people of migration and it has helped to build new countries, it has taken its culture around the world and it should know how to deal with all immigrants, including the so-called legal immigrants and those without immigration papers."
"I must say, I am surprised that there is so little determination to fight the Helms-Burton Act."
"We have asked for the Act to be rejected clearly and energetically, not only the third chapter - but obviously the third chapter in particular, which contaminates international relations."
"As for Turkey, our question is whether we are going to demand that Turkey respects human rights and fulfils international resolutions."
"Will pressure be put on Turkey to free Leila Zana?"
"I return to an internal problem because this is still a global problem which concerns us all: the problem of mad cows."
"In our opinion, this is now, above all, a problem of public health."
"But we also know that it is a problem facing the beef market and, therefore, we are asking for transparency and efficient action - and for that you can count fully on our support."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Spring, it is very difficult today to speak about the Irish presidency - difficult, because I cannot simply speak about a routine programme of work after all that has happened over the past few days in Northern Ireland."
"The business of the day is actually discussion of the Intergovernmental Conference, of economic and monetary union, of employment and environmental policy, of Europol and of internal security in Europe."
"But who can simply turn his attention to routine business when the fires are raging in Northern Ireland, when the internal security of Belfast and Derry is threatened in a different and more horrific manner than that of Munich, Paris, Rome or Brussels?"
"Turning our attention to routine business today would mean sweeping violence under the carpet, refusing to point the finger at its causes and its perpetrators."
"It would mean ignoring the systematic violations of human and civil rights in Northern Ireland."
"By our silence we also incur a share in the guilt."
"How, ladies and gentlemen, am I to discuss the programme of the presidency and move on from there to speak and make judgements about greater closeness to the citizens and about the fight against racism when in my mind's eye I see the pictures of the death of the young Catholic who was buried two days ago, when I see the Irish flag being burned in Northern Ireland, when I am touched by the despair of people in our midst because peace is so far off?"
"What good is it to speak of closeness to the citizens and civil rights when basic fundamental rights are on the line for the minority in Northern Ireland?"
"John Bruton has criticized the British Government more vehemently than any Irish head of government before him for the failure of its policy on Northern Ireland."
"I should have liked him to be able to speak these words with the same clarity and force as President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union, because he is right."
"I have demands to make of the Irish presidency in terms of a sustained environmental policy, consistent measures to combat social exclusion, marginalization and unemployment, to promote work and fight poverty, in terms of rethinking the convergence criteria and taking comprehensive action against discrimination."
"Responses to all these reasonable and important demands, however, can only develop under peaceful conditions, which is why the foremost priority is an all-out effort to promote the peace process."
"And in that you will be supported to the hilt!"
". I am your Celtic sister from Scotland and you have a lot to live up to because the previous Irish presidencies have been such a success."
"I speak also for my group and I am proud to do so."
"Recently your President Mary Robinson came and made time to visit Scotland."
"She said that Europe deepens Irish identity and this is a matter well understood in Scotland."
"I would just like to say that - and I do not think the Irish presidency needs to be reminded - there are 40 languages, 40 minority cultures in our Union, and all of them hope that Europe will deepen their identity too."
"But they often need a helping hand with funding."
"The Committee of the Regions which was not mentioned - you could not mention everything in your basketful of dreams - has a very important part to play."
"On reading your priorities I found myself almost in tears because I know this was drafted before the troubles reemerged."
"A peaceful Europe."
"There is not much sign of peace in the north part of the island of Ireland."
"I have to say something which is perhaps a little drastic."
"Yesterday Mr Crowley, speaking from the heart, said this part of the European Union is now ungovernable."
"That is indeed the position."
"In view of precedents in the Middle East and South Africa where the coming together of people has been achieved despite enormous animosity, perhaps we should look at another solution such as the United Nations."
"Or let us stop this talk of preconditions that the British Government keeps on about. In the precedents of South Africa, Kenya, Rhodesia and the Middle East, no such preconditions were made."
"Unless we get rid of this we are never going to get the talks going."
"I was glad that mention was made of Nelson Mandela."
"For ten years I have been involved with the Lomé Convention and I am so proud to think that the world has recognized this man."
"But are we going to make sure that the funding for the Third World is not diminished because we have so many other demands on our funds?"
"We want to help Eastern Europe but please do not let us allow any diminution of the funds for the Third World."
"Recently I was privileged to be in Ireland with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and meet many of the Irish Ministers."
"It was very interesting that Ireland is one of the four Member States that can meet the criteria for entry into EMU."
"Yet, as the Minister of Finance told us, there is, as everywhere else, a problem of unemployment."
"I am glad that this is a priority of the presidency."
"I also come from a peripheral region - the Highlands and Islands of Scotland - and we have to look to the SMEs, particularly the very small ones."
"And we have to look at that sleeping giant, tourism, which can create so many jobs."
"Perhaps we have to look at more funding for the upgrading of tourist facilities and marketing the lengthening of the season in those northern climes that do not necessarily have assured sunshine."
"We have to look at late payments and access to cheap money."
"There are many practical ways where we can translate the hopes of reducing unemployment into reality."
"On discrimination, perhaps the President-in-Office should lean on some of the EU institutions to make sure women get to the top."
"On fishing, let us have some attempt at regional control and on beef let us try and remove the ban, bit by bit, starting with quality herds in Northern Ireland and Scotland."
"On the IGC, let us make sure that this Parliament us very fully involved."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, the Italian Alleanza Nazionale Group would like to welcome Ireland, which is to represent the European Union over the next six months; and we should also like to express our hope that peace will be restored within Ireland."
"We are confident that Ireland's courage will, during these next six months, help to solve at least some of the many problems that are currently dogging the European Union and have remained unsolved over several presidencies."
"We are sure the European Union understands the need to strengthen itself, in complete political unity, before opening its doors to nations that have yet to achieve, within their own borders, the necessary conditions for aspiring to become part of the broader consensus of the European Union, itself suffering from considerable problems, including the very serious one of unemployment."
"I say this, not out of narrow-minded egotism, but because I am sure that the sum of the weaker parts does not make a strong whole, it makes a weak whole, and also because the stronger Member States of this Union must not be permitted to create for themselves an area of even greater power in the more extensive jigsaw of old Europe."
"Good luck to Europe and good luck to Ireland."
"Mr President, allow me to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his presentation of the Irish presidency's ambitious programme."
"In the long term the most important priority is, of course, the intergovernmental conference, to which the Irish presidency has already given a lot of attention. That and the development by this presidency of a common security policy with other countries which do not belong to the Western European Union."
"The European Union has common values and a single economy and shortly it will also have a common currency. It has already displayed solidarity via a series of common policies and it must now turn its attention to the sectors of defence and security."
"It is comforting - and I should like the presidency and Mr Spring personally to note the fact - that the Fernández-Albor report on the CFSP states that the external frontiers of the Member States should be considered the frontiers of the European Union and that solidarity should be shown where these frontiers are not respected."
"This is a subject in which the countries on the periphery, such as your country, Mr Spring, have a special interest."
"The credibility of the Union in the eyes of Europe's citizens depends among other things on making tangible progress on this specific issue in the framework of the intergovernmental conference."
"One of the presidency's objectives is the presentation of a first draft of the new treaty prior to the European Council in December."
"That text must match the aspirations of the Member States which want substantial results from the intergovernmental conference."
"It must not be a minimum compromise."
"Of course, the most important immediate priority - but with long-term significance also - is employment."
"I welcome everything that you have said about employment, but I feel obliged to point out that we have heard it all before and often it has turned out to be just empty words."
"Let me remind you that very little of what was envisaged in the White Paper of Jacques Delors has become reality."
"I hope that the same will not happen with the Irish presidency."
"The funding of the trans-European networks, the research programme and other measures which would help are slipping behind."
"Other Members will raise a whole host of other matters but I wish to mention just two. The unacceptable situation that has been brought about by the US administration's decisions on Cuba - and the delay of six months means nothing - and the continuing refusal of Turkey to protect the rights of its citizens and to respect the international rule of law."
"I think that you, Mr Spring, and your presidency, can achieve a great deal on those two matters also."
"On behalf of the Socialist Group I welcome you and wish you good progress and every success."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the President-in-Office of the Council mentioned the Intergovernmental Conference, and the presidency will present an outline for a draft revision of the Treaties to the December summit meeting of Heads of State and Government in Dublin."
"What we as Members of the European Parliament have heard about the meeting of government representatives held in Cork at the beginning of July has been very encouraging."
"We have heard, Mr President-in-Office, that the Irish presidency conducted the talks very effectively and briskly, and we should like to encourage you to continue in the same manner."
"We should also like to encourage you to pursue the negotiations now on the basis of quite specific texts so that we achieve a good result in time for December."
"Lastly, we should like to encourage you to avoid basing your proposals for the draft treaty revision on the lowest common denominator among the 15 States of the EU but rather to go a good bit further than the positions on which agreement may ultimately be reached."
"We in the European People's Party call for reform of the European Union, which now has a population of 370 million, to enable the Union to prepare, on the threshold of the 21st century, for the accession of new States."
"You spoke, Mr President-in-Office, of a Community of 27 States; we shall have to wait and see whether that actually comes to pass in the foreseeable future."
"The prospect facing us is that of over 100 million people who want their countries to join the European Union."
"We in the European People's Party base our policy for reform of the Treaties on the principle of effectiveness - effectiveness, indeed, is perhaps the key to the future of our continent - combined, of course, with the democratic principles as well as with the transparency to which you have referred."
"For us in the European People's Party - and in this debate I can only focus on the main points - the following criteria are vital to reform of the European Union:"
"First of all, in the international context the European Union must be endowed with the legal capacity which, as we know, it does not yet possess, and only through this capacitation in international law can we enable the European Union to act as a legal and political entity and to be represented in international organizations."
"Secondly, we call for the principal human rights to be incorporated into the Treaties and for the European Union to accede to the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"Thirdly, it should be standard practice for the Council of Ministers to decide by majority vote on Community legislation; unanimity should only apply in exceptional cases, and even where unanimous decisions are still prescribed by the Treaty they should be phased out within a fixed period of time."
"Fourthly, the European Parliament should participate in the legislative process as an equal partner with the Council, and legislative procedure must be simplified accordingly."
"Fifthly, we in the European People's Party believe that the rationale of European unification demands the integration of the Western European Union into the European Union."
"We do realize that this will probably not be achieved at the present Intergovernmental Conference, because a number of Member States that do not belong to the WEU are unlikely to accept Article 5, in other words the mutual assistance clause."
"That is why we support the inclusion of a political solidarity clause in the Treaty on European Union as a stepping-stone and in particular the incorporation in the EU Treaty of the Petersberg Declaration of June 1992 regarding humanitarian, peacemaking and peacekeeping operations outside the area of application of the WEU Treaty."
"We believe that no Member State should be forced to take part in military operations to defend democracy and human rights but that a minority of States must not be able to prevent action being taken by the majority of States if the latter wish to act."
"Our sixth and final point - and this is perhaps the most important point, having been mentioned several times already - concerns the field of justice and home affairs."
"We must start to bring some aspects of justice and home affairs under the Community umbrella, such as asylum, immigration and visas."
"The conventions, in other words international agreements, and intergovernmental cooperation in these domains are becoming increasingly unsuitable platforms from which to launch the campaign against crime in Europe."
"In this fight against crime too, we need the Community procedures of majority decisionmaking by the Council and equal legislative rights for the European Parliament."
"Your presidency of the Council, Mr Spring, faces great challenges and a host of other issues."
"We wish the Irish presidency perseverance and determination but also good fortune and success."
"Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to wish the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Spring, every success in the course of the Irish presidency agus go n'eirí an bóthar leat sa post atá romhat amach anseo."
"In the light of the mayhem of communal strife, street violence, intimidation, murder and bombing which has returned to Northern Ireland, unfortunately, in the past 10 days, I want first of all to place on record my group's utter condemnation of that descent towards the abyss."
"Now is the time, we believe, to cool it; the time for cool heads and calm reflection; the time for a renewed but deepened commitment to resorting and sustaining the peace."
"In the long and complex history of Anglo-Irish relations and relations on the island of Ireland, and especially the violent history of the past 25 years in Northern Ireland, one lesson is beyond any possible doubt: that violence from whatever source postpones the day of reconciliation."
"We share with you, Mr Spring, your assertion that the primacy of politics must be reclaimed and restored, and support your efforts in this regard."
"The past 10 days have been a watershed, a defining moment for the peace process."
"On the one side there is the prospect of slipping into violence - a renewed violence, but without hope; or alternatively, a renewed commitment to redoubling efforts to engage once and for all, and perhaps for the first time, in a genuine and meaningful political dialogue."
"It has to be founded, if it is to be meaningful, on mutual respect rather than political posturing or gallery-playing which, unfortunately to date, have attended much of the political aspect of that process, especially in Northern Ireland."
"All political leaders in both governments, but especially those in Northern Ireland itself, bear a heavy responsibility."
"Those who will not learn the lessons of history condemn themselves and society to repeat that history."
"Those who are more at home with the cosy familiarity of their own tribe, on both sides, must choose a more open and pluralist alternative."
"If not, the blood that flows will be on their hands as surely as on the hands of those who pull the triggers or plant the bombs."
"This House is the chamber of deputies of the people of Europe and is a testament to the ability to reconcile difference and to found a lasting peace."
"That has been built against staggering odds, if you look back to the starting point of 50 years ago."
"It gives a message of hope to those who would lead Northern Ireland forward."
"But that message of hope carries within it the seeds of the other fundamental message."
"It requires also a leadership commitment."
"That is the absent tribal part that has not yet been won over."
"And that is the challenge."
"If they do not meet the challenge I regret to say the alternative is too horrible to contemplate."
"Madam President, firstly, on Northern Ireland, it is clear that force and the threat of force have overcome the rule of law in Northern Ireland."
"During the Irish presidency the government should be seeking support from other Member States for an urgent reform of policing structures in Northern Ireland."
"It can no longer simply be argued that this is an internal matter for the British."
"The marching season is not over in Northern Ireland yet."
"There will be the Apprentice Boys' March on 12 August in Derry."
"If this Parliament wants to show solidarity with the people of Northern Ireland it should perhaps consider sending a delegation there for that march."
"Moreover, the Irish Greens have always argued that a neutral and impartial player should be brought in, like the United Nations."
"Now is the time for this to happen."
"As regards the Irish presidency, the programme of the Irish presidency states that, on security and disarmament, it will pursue the continuing and effective development of EU/WEU cooperation on the basis of the Treaty on European Union in cooperation with the Belgian WEU presidency."
"Ireland is not even a full member of WEU, so why does it need to cooperate more with the WEU presidency and on what issues will it be cooperating?"
"Minister Spring, you stated last year that WEU's nuclear policy was unpalatable for Ireland."
"Last week the International Court of Justice found, much to the vindication of Ireland's position, that nuclear weapons were the ultimate evil."
"Why then is Ireland gradually forging closer and closer links with an alliance committed to, and endowed with, a nuclear capability?"
"The Irish presidency also pledges that it will be highlighting conventional arms issues."
"I wonder, Minister, if that means that you will be publicly putting pressure on Britain, Sweden and Finland, among others, to cease selling arms to places like Indonesia where they have been used in genocide campaigns against the East Timorese."
"As a non-aligned country, Ireland should be promoting the right of the four Member States of this Union to maintain their non-aligned status within the Union instead of toeing the EU pro-military line."
"Mr President, a new presidency marks a change."
"Change brings hope, and we are hopeful, but we are also anxious let me say to the Irish Members, anxious about the past and about plans for the future."
"First, the past."
"You say that one of your priorities is to combat Alzheimer's disease. Well, there is nothing wrong with our memories."
"We remember Mr MacSharry, first of all, with the sinister Blair House agreement, the negotiation of the agricultural GATT, and most of all we remember Dublin."
"For the wine-growing people of Europe, and especially for my wine growers in Languedoc-Roussillon, the memory is of 'Black Dublin' , compulsory distillation (in Catholic Ireland!), the grubbing-up of vines that are one of the symbols of christianity, the freezing of prices, the change of course towards globalization, which Mr MacSharry was to confirm."
"And so we wonder what the viticultural CMO plans may yet have in store for us, and we cannot help worrying."
"Then there are your plans for the future."
"We note first of all the 'Spinellist' atmosphere of those plans - constitution, new Union Treaty - but also, and especially, we note their content."
"It is formal, conventional in appearance."
"You offer, no doubt speaking for President Santer, a Pact of Confidence for employment."
"The only thing missing is confidence, because there is no analysis of causes and so, as a consequence, it is difficult to treat the effects."
"It is true that you do have plans that attract me in fiscal matters."
"Although here again there is a snag: your legislation on excise duty."
"No one can accuse you of doing things by halves: 17 francs tax on a litre of wine, but a mere 6.50 francs on a litre of beer!"
"Even so, you are trying to lighten the tax burden, I grant you that."
"I will propose to you two rules which I have proposed n times to President Santer."
"Rule one: compulsory deductions must not increase faster than the growth of GDP."
"Rule two, to fit in with your European ideology: establish the principle of free choice of the least taxed geographical route."
"Madam President, Ireland has taken on the responsibilities of presidency."
"I wish Ireland success."
"A great many hopes and expectations are placed in a new country holding the presidency, even now."
"The last presidency left a feeling of disappointment because no progress was made on employment."
"This increases the expectations placed in Ireland's presidency."
"I note with satisfaction that the first of Ireland's priorities mentioned by name was unemployment."
"The programme continues in this vein by considering as a priority new job seekers, the long-term unemployed and unemployed women."
"Youth unemployment and long-term unemployment are indeed high on the list for the Union's attention."
"Mr Spring said just now in his speech that he would stress the concerns of the citizens and would invest in job security."
"Improving the unemployment situation is indeed the most important of the Union's tasks at present in Parliament's view."
"In my opinion, as far as citizens are concerned, it is the decisive issue, for the whole credibility of the European Union."
"Hitherto programmes and reports have been drawn up, but decisions to create jobs in practice have been lacking."
"In my opinion this will also be the acid test of Ireland's presidency. Our citizens expect action, not programmes or reports."
"Employment, as the President Spring said, is an area for action at national level."
"However, we have included employment for so long in other contexts as one of the areas of priority action by the Union that expectations of the Union have increased."
"I may remind you of the conclusions of Cannes, Essen and Madrid."
"According to these conclusions it is possible, by means of decisions at Union level, to have a positive influence on employment in the Member States."
"Mr Rasmussen, Prime Minister of Denmark, asked a few weeks ago whether we were so well off that we could afford to manage without the work contribution of 18 million people, and he replied that we really were not."
"I would give the same answer."
"On that basis I appeal to Ireland for a chapter on employment to be prepared now, at the beginning of its half-year presidency, for inclusion in the Treaty."
"It would ensure the continuation of serious efforts to remove unemployment from Europe for we will not achieve a good employment situation without serious joint efforts."
"This is referred to in the OECD's most recent report which regards the alternatives as being continuing high employment or freer labour markets which would leave a section of the population in permanent poverty."
"In preparing for enlargement, we did not desire this development."
"Our only alternative must be to organize jobs for our nationals."
"Madam President, first of all I should like to convey my sympathy to the Irish Government on the great difficulties being experienced in Northern Ireland."
"As a Dutch protestant I would also emphasize how very much we as Dutch people deplore the misuse of the name and colour 'orange' ."
"The House of Orange has always fostered religious freedom, not religious conflict."
"Our Queen, a member of the House of Orange, is queen of catholics and protestants alike."
"Madam President, I must compliment the Irish presidency on the programme it has outlined to us."
"Past Irish presidencies have always been good and effective ones."
"We have every confidence in Mr Bruton and Mr Spring."
"I should like to focus on three points: the IGC, measures against drugs, and the situation in Yugoslavia."
"Regarding the IGC, I believe it is most significant that the Irish presidency is proposing a number of substantial advances here."
"The plan to start concrete talks on texts as soon as possible and if possible to put forward a new draft treaty seems to me an excellent idea."
"It will then be the job of the Netherlands to take that good beginning through to the end."
"As Parliament's rapporteur on the IGC, let me run through our principal concerns again."
"I agree here with Mr Poettering that we want the position of Europe's citizens to be defined more clearly and the principle of non-discrimination to be enshrined firmly in the Treaty."
"We want more openness and transparency over the Union's documents and its decision-making."
"We want use of the veto to be kept to an absolute minimum and we want Parliament's joint legislative powers to be respected and extended, in respect both of legislation and of the budget."
"As regards substance we want the European Union to do more in the areas of employment, and we support the Irish presidency on that, of internal security, environmental policy, foreign and security policy and measures to combat crime."
"A detail or two on that, Madam President."
"A lot of good things have already been said on the subject. But I would like to stress once again the importance of the Irish proposal for a European coastguard service."
"As a former Dutch transport minister I tried to secure this during the Dutch presidency in 1991."
"I did not succeed."
"But I can tell you that it is a good idea and that there are perhaps more arguments in favour of it now than there were at that earlier time."
"So I wholeheartedly back the Irish presidency on that one."
"And then there is Yugoslavia, Madam President."
"I am very concerned at the way things are going."
"My question is whether the Irish presidency is totally committed to getting Karadzic and Mladic arrested."
"I have no faith in a peace without justice."
"It is scandalous that these two men are allowed to remain at liberty and a poor example to the rest of the world of how Europe deals with war criminals."
"Mr President, if your presidency can get this problem resolved I think you will have done Europe a service."
"And I urge support here for Parliament's call for an international inquiry on Srebrenica, which is urgently needed."
"I would ask the Irish presidency to take initiatives on this too."
"Mr President, I wish your presidency well."
"We have every confidence that it will be a successful one."
"I wish to thank the President-in-Office for outlining the priorities of the Irish presidency."
"The important tasks of this presidency have, however, been overshadowed by the crisis in the peace process in the north of Ireland."
"We want to deal with unemployment and the social crisis we are faced with."
"We cannot do so while anarchy is permitted to rule in any state of the Union."
"It is fundamental to civilized life that people enjoy equal rights under the law."
"Last week in Northern Ireland the forces of the state capitulated in the face of lawlessness."
"It is unacceptable in any state of the Union that an organization should impose sectarian intimidation of citizens."
"If we cannot protect women and children from being intimidated from their homes and if people are forced to flee, then the evils of lawlessness and terror will be loosed again for another generation."
"We cannot go back to burying people, we have to move forward in peace together and to do that we have to maintain political authority."
"We in the EU have failed to do that in Ireland over 25 years."
"I ask the President-in-Office to try once more, otherwise we will have to ask the UN and the Americans to help us out."
"Surely we should not be faced with that within the borders of the European Union."
"I do not want to see any more people buried in my country on either side."
"Remember that people are intimidated on both sides within their own communities: Protestants are intimidated by Protestants, Catholics are intimidated by Catholics."
"We can call them unionists or nationalists."
"That is a terrible side to it which we do not refer to here."
"I also wish to ask the President-in-Office to deal with the nuclear issue."
"Many citizens are critical of nuclear power and the non-nuclear states have a right not to be polluted by emissions from nuclear states, such as those in the Irish Sea from Sellafield, now much increased by THORP."
"I would ask the President-in-Office to foster a coalition of nuclear-free states within the European Union."
"He talks about cooperation and the WEU, but we want that cooperation to extend to the neutral and non-nuclear states of this Union."
"Madam President, it is very gratifying to note that tourism also features in the list of priorities of the Irish presidency."
"I should like to point out that the entire European tourism and travel industry has great expectations of the Irish presidency."
"The substance of these expectations is that this industry should finally be granted the official and legal status commensurate with its actual social and economic importance and with its contribution to the maintenance of peace and international understanding."
"A few months ago, a majority of the European Parliament voted in favour of tourism having its own legal basis in the Treaty."
"It would be very good and very gratifying if, under the influence of the Irish presidency, the Council also endorsed this position, which has important implications for the preservation and creation of jobs."
"Madam President, may I congratulate the President-in-Office on the priorities of the Irish presidency for a Europe that meets the needs of its people."
"The first and surely the most important priority to everyone in Europe relates to employment and in particular to the continued development of a Pact of Confidence on Employment in which special attention is to be focused on the problems of young people, the long-term unemployed and women."
"Since declarations of intent are virtually all we have seen so far, it is now time for practical implementation, and I can only reemphasize your statement, President Spring, in which you stressed that job creation is the overriding challenge for all of our Governments."
"I consider it especially important that the Irish presidency has emphasized the role of the partnership between management and labour, the importance of small and medium-sized businesses and the promotion of local employment and development initiatives."
"Our efforts to underpin the EMU project in particular need to be accompanied by energetic labour-market strategies."
"But as someone involved in education policy, I am especially pleased when I hear lifelong access to education and training being mentioned in the same breath as employment, and I am delighted that a separate chapter on education and young people has been included in the programme."
"As you know, we are currently discussing the Commission White Paper on teaching and learning, a sequel to the Delors White Paper on growth, competitiveness and employment."
"As with your priorities, Mr President, what we are concerned with here is the quality of education, a lifelong learning process and teacher training."
"Unimpeded lifelong access to general and vocational education is the best weapon in the fight against marginalization and the division of European society into a society of 'knows' and 'don't knows' ."
"I am also pleased that a point about cultural cooperation is contained in the programme and that there are plans to conduct a debate during the Irish presidency on European cultural policy, including media policy and the Community's cultural action programmes."
"Although culture is the very soul of Europe as well as an important means of bringing the Community closer to many of its citizens, its significance is still underestimated."
"In addition, it is important to find ways of helping our young people to identify with European ideals. The third priority after employment and the fight against drug abuse is the creation of a Union based on equal treatment and tolerance, which is why precedence must be given to addressing issues such as equality of opportunity, social exclusion, transparency and the fight against racism and xenophobia."
"This is an important aspect of our policies for peace and security, whether they seek to promote the process for peace in Northern Ireland, which all of us in Europe so fervently desire, or to establish an outgoing Europe that plays an active part in the quest for peace, security and solidarity."
"Madam President, I want to welcome the President-in-Office and to congratulate him on his enthusiastic and competent approach to the whole business of guiding the affairs of this Union over the next six months."
"As a European federalist without reservation, I have every confidence in the Irish Government in its intention to help guide and develop this Community in every possible way for the benefit of its citizens."
"I would like to have talked about the financing of the larger European Union, in particular, and other issues which were raised by the President-in-Office, but in my brief time and as I represent the entire border area of the Irish Republic, I want to refer briefly to the statement on Northern Ireland by the President-in-Office."
"While the people in my constituency identify with nationalist sentiment and aspirations in Northern Ireland they are by no means in any way hostile to the Unionist population in Northern Ireland, to their aspirations or their vision of the future for themselves."
"Yet I have to say that in all my political life I have never seen so much anger as I saw in my constituency and across the border in Northern Ireland over the weekend."
"This anger was fuelled by the massive disappointment at what was perceived to be the intimidation of the minority with the participation of the police force and the British Army in that exercise."
"The people were disappointed."
"They had seen some evidence of a greater effort by the police force in Northern Ireland to be impartial and helpful to all the citizens."
"They were disappointed in the British Government and bitterly disappointed at the way the months of ceasefire were squandered and the opportunity to establish a greater dialogue was lost."
"We hear all the time that the Unionist population in Northern Ireland feel that they are under siege and under threat."
"The vast majority of people even in the border area of Southern Ireland have no aspiration to intimidate the Unionist majority in Northern Ireland into a United Ireland."
"They only have one aspiration - you could hardly call it a hope because it is so long-term - and that is that the people in Northern Ireland will find an accommodation with each other."
"There will be peace on the island of Ireland if peace can be established between those two communities."
"Nobody wants to upset the Union at this moment or withdraw Northern Ireland from it without the consent of both traditions."
"I speak for the part of the Republic of Ireland which lies on the border."
"We can see that with Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom there is no border in the new Europe between Southern Ireland and Northern Ireland."
"There is no border to prevent our contact and cooperation."
"There are common policies to encourage our development."
"The island of Ireland has been growing more rapidly than any other part of the developed world in the past 18 months during this peace process and the fruit was only beginning to ripen."
"We have gone to the edge of the precipice but we have not gone over."
"We can restore peace and confidence which was beginning to emerge."
"But a lot is in the hands of the politicians in both communities in Northern Ireland."
"Madam President, the Irish presidency has chosen employment as the number one priority for its presidency and that is nothing new."
"Its wish to translate the many pronouncements of European Union summits into deeds is nothing new either but it merits our support."
"I warmly endorse what the Irish prime minister said in an interview, namely that if we want to demonstrate the benefits of a single currency we can only do so if we also demonstrate that it will be good for jobs."
"And it is good that the Irish presidency has already, straight away, started a concrete debate on measures to combat long-term unemployment."
"Here too I warmly endorse the prime minister's claim that a measure of unemployment may perhaps be good for healthy competition in the labour market but that certainly is not true of long-term unemployment which reduces workforce mobility and the willingness of workers to take risks."
"I would add that it also wastes one of our most important resources for the future, namely human resources."
"You cannot read anything about the information society without constantly being reminded that people are the most important resource for the economy of the future."
"We currently waste millions' worth."
"Regrettably, I have to tell the presidency that the dangerous possibility looms of a discrepancy between word and deed."
"Under the current Union budget it is likely that far too little of those budget funds will directly benefit the citizens of Europe."
"I urge the presidency not to accept this under-use, but to encourage their colleagues to view the Union budget as a task-setter, a means of ensuring that this money is actually spent on human resources, rather than arguing that it enables more money to be spent on the TENs."
"The same discrepancy between word and deed threatens the plan for EMU."
"Ireland has made enormous and successful efforts to modernize itself in all manner of areas thanks to billions in aid, from the Union, it has to be said, but that in no way detracts from the achievement."
"And Ireland is now one of the likeliest qualifiers for EMU."
"Yet unemployment there, at 14 % or so, is well above the EU average of 10.9 % and nearly twice that in the 'best' Member States."
"In my view that reinforces the argument that one should not believe that EMU will automatically mean jobs."
"I think it also provides evidence to support the European Parliament's view that the criteria for EMU are more flexible than the ECOFIN ministers would often have us believe."
"As I understand it your minister Ruairi Quinn intends primarily to put the criterion of budget deficit into perspective and to split it into investment costs and current budget costs."
"I wish him success in that."
"It is, I think, the only thing which may succeed in convincing our citizens that EMU is a plan designed to benefit them and not a measure of purely financial discipline."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, the initial contacts we have had with your Ministers within the various committees give us high hope of the Irish presidency."
"We have been able to see for ourselves their goodwill, their availability and their attentiveness to Parliament's concerns, which only reflect those of the public, and all that is reflected in the priorities you have laid down."
"The only comment I would make is that there are rather a lot of priorities: American business has a saying that if you have more than three priorities you have no priorities."
"In other words, we know that the presidency is subject to constraints, to limitations."
"The President-in-Office is surrounded by large numbers of people who do not all have the same objectives, and we know that the Council can have trouble reaching a ruling on certain difficult subjects."
"When we have conciliation talks with the Council, the talks do not always take place with the Council itself but sometimes with COREPER, and often three or four levels down."
"In other words, we know the kind of difficulties you have."
"That is why, by placing the emphasis on certain priorities, you are running the risk of developing a credibility gap ."
"We know that when it comes to unemployment the main responsibilities and the main activities are at Member State level."
"What little can be done at European level is established and solemnly proclaimed by the European Council, and then three months later ECOFIN meets and does exactly the opposite, or near enough."
"The only thing that can be done at European level to combat unemployment is to finance the intra-Community infrastructures."
"And then what happens?"
"When you decide to do it everyone thinks it's going to be done, but your Finance Ministers meet a little later and do exactly the opposite."
"So it is no surprise, in these circumstances, that the citizen has difficulty believing in Europe and in the capability of Europe to solve his problems."
"As far as organized crime is concerned, it is all very well wanting to draw up a program to combat it, but that involves other resources than mere inter-governmental cooperation."
"Well, that is what we are reduced to nowadays, and we know that in order to fight international organized crime we are going to have to adopt the same weapons as the organized criminals themselves."
"They have organized themselves internationally, while you are hesitating to do so."
"When they read your communications and when they see what we are doing, they must be saying to each other that the good times are not over yet!"
"That, Mr President-in-Office, is why I would like to concentrate on essentials, and especially on the work of the IGC, where we will need to start thinking about forms of differentiation."
"Madam President, I would like to deal with two issues very quickly in the time that I have."
"The first one is in relation to the Helms-Burton legislation and our relations with the United States."
"As one of my colleagues mentioned earlier, the European Parliament delegation was in the United States last week for the annual meeting with the US Congress."
"I hope the presidency of the Council understands the seriousness of the situation that we now face with a Congress that is increasingly protectionist and increasingly hostile to the multilateral arrangements that it has entered into."
"It is essential that this morning, when Mr Spring winds up this debate, he should state very clearly that we will not simply have an exchange of letters with the United States on the unilateral and illegal action being taken, not only in Helms-Burton, but the threatened action on Iran and Libya; that there will be firm and decisive action taken as a reprisal against the United States because of the likely injustice that will be meted out to European citizens."
"I do not think letters are sufficient."
"Congress goaded us last week, Mr Spring, and said that all it expected from Europe was a strongly worded letter from President Santer."
"We will actually not get any action unless we act on HelmsBurton, unless we make it clear that US interests will be damaged, that we will take a calculated decision to damage US interests."
"Failing that, we will get the D'Amato legislation on Iran and we will get legislation on Libya."
"The other issue I want to deal with very briefly is the way in which your presidency will deal with the Essen conclusions and the whole approach to employment."
"What we really want to see in Dublin is a target to tackle a manageable aspect of employment."
"We do not want these glorious resolutions passed at the end of summit meetings."
"We want something done about unemployment."
"The best thing that the Irish presidency could do, given its own problems with unemployment, is to tackle one section of the labour market."
"The area that we would like to see you tackle is the question of youth unemployment."
"In Dublin, at the end of your presidency, we would like to see a determined practical commitment by the Council actually to reduce dramatically the numbers of young people on the unemployment market."
"Unless we do that I believe that all these statements that come from summit meetings are increasingly going to make the population in Europe cynical about what Europe is going to try to achieve."
"I hope that we can single out one section of the labour market and ensure that by the end of the six-month presidency - and I hope it will be a very successful presidency - there is a very clear light at the end of the tunnel, particularly for the young people in Europe who really do still have faith in the whole project of building a strong European Union."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, I welcome the priorities of the Irish presidency put forward here today."
"The battle to reduce unemployment is and must remain our first priority."
"The emphasis given to coordinating and developing all services involved in the elimination of drug trafficking and organized crime is also welcome."
"Drug addiction is one of the greatest threats to modern society."
"Therefore, every possible effort must be made to destroy it and also the related crime of money-laundering."
"I do not wish to repeat all the comments made on the situation in Northern Ireland, but I believe it is important to realize that events there in recent days are an offence against the European ideal."
"We depend on democratic institutions and respect for the rule of law."
"There can be no excuse for any government to apply the rule of law in a purely partisan way."
"I welcome the attempts, in very difficult circumstances, by both governments to restore the peace process."
"We must never lose hope."
"Let me briefly turn to two important issues mentioned by the President-in-Office, Mr Spring: enlargement and institutional reform."
"The enlargement of the European Union to include all the applicant countries is an ambition that will be achieved over a period of years."
"However, the conditions must be right."
"All the applicant countries are in need of substantial help to develop industry and infrastructure."
"We must make realistic estimates of these costs and agree to provide the extra finance in the European budget."
"Enlargement with the current restrictions on our budget would be disastrous for the new Member States and would also destroy much of the success in achieving economic and social cohesion between the existing 15 Member States."
"An under-financed Union cannot be successful."
"Similarly, an enlarged Europe needs wide-ranging institutional reform."
"In this Parliament the decision-making process must be reformed."
"There are at least 15 different procedures for making decisions in this House."
"Such complexity is wasteful of resources and cannot be reasonably explained to the general public."
"In the Council of Ministers the unanimity rule must be removed in almost all areas."
"We have seen the destructive power of this rule recently when Britain, in a very misguided policy decision, held up most decisions for several months."
"This type of behaviour has no beneficial result and must be prevented."
"The Irish presidency has made good preparation for its period in office."
"We know the Irish Government is determined to make progress on a wide range of issues over the next six months."
"Can I wish all my colleagues every success."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a Member of the House referred this morning to the idea that, when they hold the presidency of the Council, the small Member States of the European Union do not possess the clout to galvanize the other States into action."
"Nevertheless, I am very encouraged by what we have heard this morning."
"For that reason I ask the Irish presidency to channel some of the energy to which the President-in-Office bore witness this morning into addressing a problem currently under discussion at the Intergovernmental Conference and about which our group is increasingly concerned, namely that of the democratic deficit within the European Union."
"When we fight crime, when we proceed now - as Mr Poettering very lucidly and rightly said - to bring certain domains such as asylum or immigration under the Community umbrella as a matter of urgency, we not only need to intensify cooperation among Member governments, as the President-in-Office advocated."
"We certainly need to do that, but we must also intensify cooperation between police authorities in the fight against crime and create a European police organization."
"This, however, must not be done at the level of intergovernmental cooperation, for that would give rise to a dangerous development."
"The fact that only executive bodies cooperate with each other and try to come up with European solutions means that the national parliaments - as we have all heard from parliamentarian colleagues in our own countries - are told with increasing regularity that they need no longer concern themselves with this particular issue because it is a European matter."
"This domain, in other words, is being surreptitiously prised from the control and participation of the national parliaments."
"At the same time, however, because of the structure of the Treaties and the current interinstitutional structure, the power to legislate on these matters has not passed to the European Parliament."
"So an uncontrolled democracyfree zone, as it were, is emerging, precisely where decisions are taken which affect the personal rights of the individual citizens of the European Union, as we saw here yesterday in our debate on freedom of movement."
"Parliament and the Commission are endeavouring to eliminate the deficit in terms of the remaining restrictions on freedom of movement, but we hear that, behind the backs of Parliament and the Commission, the Council under its present Irish presidency is planning a draft joint action, in other words a joint measure on the basis of Article K.4 of the Treaty, which means that neither the Commission nor Parliament are involved in it."
"That is no way to foster democratization and amounts at best to a contribution to closer intergovernmental cooperation."
"That is why I ask the presidency to lend impetus to the democratization process by ensuring that Parliament is strengthened."
"You can set a good example, Mr President-in-Office, if you can ensure that, at a joint meeting of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights and the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs in September, the competent Minister helps to allay the irritation that has arisen in connection with the Monti initiatives and the debate on freedom of movement."
"Madam President, could I also give a word of welcome to the President-in-Office, I wish him well for the time that he holds that office."
"As I represent a Unionist point of view, I am not going to mince my words with you because you know me well enough and you would not expect anything else."
"Northern Ireland has come through many difficult times during the past 27 years."
"Last weekend we faced an abyss so deep we could see no bottom."
"It is not my intention today to respond to earlier comments in this House, although I just wish a lot of people would be aware of the full facts before they make some wild statements."
"Drumcree and Garvaghy Road manifest our divisions in Northern Ireland. I have to say the Chief Constable got everything totally wrong and he now holds the trust of very few in the Province."
"In the interests of accuracy I must make some points very clear."
"Garvaghy Road is a main arterial route, no houses fronting the road."
"That march would have taken between 10 and 14 minutes."
"The route was an agreed compromise many years ago."
"There is now only one parade which goes down that road, where 10 years ago there were 7, and that is the bottom of the problem that was faced."
"The return of megaphone diplomacy by the Dublin Government was extremely unhelpful and was quite frankly like pouring petrol on a raging fire last weekend."
"I wish to remind this House and the President-in-Office of the Council: Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, the people vote, time after time, in free elections, to remain within the Union."
"The views and the wishes of the majority community have been set aside and dismissed, and they have observed terrorists being rewarded and lauded for their atrocities."
"Both governments stand for overlooking and taking for granted the views of the majority community - I hope you will give that consideration in the future."
"We have in Northern Ireland the clear ability within both communities to thwart each other, yes, and unfortunately we have the power to bomb and kill each other, as we have shown."
"Only when we genuinely respect each other's traditions and principles will we begin to understand and promote reciprocal tolerance which will genuinely respect each other's traditions, we will begin to find a real long-term peace."
"The people of Northern Ireland have experienced, since the original ceasefires, a period of uncertain peace, and they have enjoyed that time."
"The last two weeks has brought home to them, in the most vivid way, the options they now face."
"I pray the people of Northern Ireland will choose wisely."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, I welcome the fact that Mediterranean policy is also one of the priorities of the Irish presidency."
"We certainly achieved a great deal in Barcelona, but we must keep at it."
"We have assumed obligations, for example with regard to human rights and the rights of minorities."
"We spoke of our search for mechanisms for the settlement of conflicts and our desire to initiate disarmament and arms control measures."
"These intentions must be converted into specific projects."
"It is not enough, Mr President-inOffice, to have a huge selection of political options on the table, like a kind of à la carte menu, if nobody in the kitchen is preparing the various dishes."
"For the next meeting of foreign ministers in the spring of next year - Barcelona II, so to speak - specific projects must be prepared and presented to our Mediterranean partners."
"So what is the presidency's position on the Euro-Mediterranean Convention, the Euro-Mediterranean partnership and the stability pact?"
"These are various proposals, some emanating from the European Parliament, with which we should like to tempt the palates of the presidency."
"What about a charter on emigration in the Mediterranean region?"
"Another subject, Mr President-in-Office, is Turkey."
"We have heard very little about Turkey today."
"I remember that in 1995 we could not escape the appeals with which the French presidency bombarded us to approve the customs union."
"What is happening with the customs union, Mr President?"
"Are we going to reform it, are we going to revise it in accordance with the wishes of Mr Erbakan?"
"We were told that we really ought to support the customs union in order to promote stability in Turkey."
"Instead of a customs union we now have Mr Erbakan, and I think, Mr President, that the Council presidency ought to comment on that."
"In my opinion, the presidency too should let its voice be heard on the threat to the borders of the European - I repeat, the borders of the European Union."
"One final point, Mr President: the dynamics of the peace process in the Middle East seem to have seized up for the time being."
"If we are waiting for Mr Holbrook or Mr Christopher or some other flying peacebroker to arrive on the scene, we can wait a long time - to be precise, at least until after the presidential elections in the United States!"
"Why cannot we as the European Union take an initiative?"
"Why can we not convene an extraordinary meeting of foreign ministers along the lines of the Barcelona Conference and then try to inject fresh impetus into the process?"
"(Applause from the left)"
"Madam President, the US President has made use of his right to defer Title 3 of the Helms Burton Act for six months."
"So there will be no court cases for the time being."
"But the US can refuse visas to employees of the firms concerned, their spouses and children."
"Even though the US has now eased this extraterritorial law, it is still totally unacceptable and a flagrant breach of international law."
"It is the EU's fervent hope that working together with the US, we shall get true democracy and human rights restored to Cuba."
"Let there be no misapprehension about that."
"But we want to decide for ourselves what route the EU will follow in pursuing that goal."
"We do not wish to be pressurized by the US."
"The United States should realize that you don't beat your enemies by hurting your friends."
"We call on the new Irish presidency resolutely to counter any move by the United States which will be disadvantageous to the citizens of the EU."
"Following the example of the Canadian Government which reacted strongly and proposes among other things to refer the US to the conciliation machinery of NAFTA."
"We should do the same with the World Trade Organization."
"We must retaliate swiftly and not be content with spoken or written protests."
"By its very existence, however, the Act has already done great damage to the more than 150 firms which feature in what the Americans so graphically call Cuba's 'Hall of Shame' ."
"One Dutch bank has already been forced to withdraw from financing the sugar industry in Cuba."
"Where can that bank go for compensation?"
"There is only one Member State of the European Union which has legislation to indemnify companies and individuals against the consequences of extraterritorial legislation."
"Is it not time, Mr President-in-Office, for the European Union to accept its responsibilities and enact framework legislation under which Member States can pass desirable and harmonized laws to protect citizens and companies?"
"The exclusive powers which the EU enjoys in trade create obligations too."
"Because the US has plans for countries other than just Cuba."
"Extraterritorial laws against Iran and Libya are also at an advanced stage of preparation."
"In the corridors of Congress there is talk too of other possible target countries where there is a high level of European investment."
"So with an eye to the future, Mr President-inOffice, the EU's reaction must be prompt, clear and tough."
"A tough response by the Irish presidency will make an impression during this pre-election period in America."
"Madam President, I should like to congratulate the Irish presidency on its programme on trade policy."
"But we have to express our surprise that there has been no mention of problems arising from complications of the Helms-Burton Act because this is not a law to protect the security and integrity of the United States but it is an Act which exercises excessive power and is an instrument which is likely to lead to a trade war."
"The decision to suspend for six months the right to bring action under Title III of the Act is no Pax Romana."
"The threat is still there."
"Only if we are able to take a firm stand will we win."
"Otherwise we shall just be ridiculous."
"Let us not delude ourselves about the true nature of these measures, since we are the world's leading trading power."
"Who is behind this incomprehensible operation - and this is the awful thing - which is being sold with so much media support? It is a powerful lobby of Cuban exiles led Mr Mas Canosa."
"First of all, we should ask whether it is possible to allow a single economic lobby to plunge into crisis the relationship of traditional friendship between the United States and the European Community and whether that same lobby can dash the expectations raised by the trans-Atlantic declaration signed in Madrid last December. And also whether it is legitimate to introduce an instrument to attack our national sovereignties in the pretence of defending that of the world's most powerful country."
"No nation has the right to prevent the rest of the world trading with whoever it wishes."
"If it does so it will be breaking the rules which were reached in the World Trade Organisation and this calls for the punitive action contemplated for extreme cases and executed under the mandate of supra-national political institutions."
"On the other hand, if the intention of these unilateral measures is to bring an end to the current Cuban regime the effect is the opposite one - in other words the Cuban regime has been strengthened."
"If the intention is to prevent us from achieving the European Union by weakening it or undermining our desire to build a civic, political, social, economic and monetary space, it too has failed."
"This attack has helped to strengthen the Commission and the Council and the measures which we have announced in response have had the full backing of European public opinion."
"Our group gives firm backing to our joint institutions and we therefore congratulate them; but with the same firmness we should like to criticise any cracks which may have appeared."
"From a consensus perspective it seems incomprehensible to us that the Spanish Foreign Affairs Minister should have held talks last week with Mr Mas Canosa, who is the inspiration behind this awful Act and the black lists."
"I should like to make one last remark, Madam President."
"Whether we like it or not it is the Cuban president who has won this battle, even though his political health is far from excellent."
"Was it worth it for the White House to embark on such a fragile ship?"
"Given the outcome, everything seems to point to a negative answer."
"As we say in Basque, eskerrik asko , thank you very much, Madam President."
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"I am very concerned at the attendance and surprised that there has been so little participation in this House by our British colleagues during this whole debate on the Irish presidency."
"In fact, only one Member spoke and he did not address the issue of Northern Ireland."
"I do not know what kind of a message that will send to people in Ireland."
"Are they not concerned?"
"Do they not worry?"
"Is it contempt, or what?"
"For the first day of a presidency, I have never seen this before and I am quite concerned that not one has participated."
"Madam President, that is a quite unwarranted attack."
"I have been here throughout this discussion."
"I can tell you that until this morning it was not clear from the presidency of Parliament at what stage the issue of Northern Ireland would be dealt with: whether it would be dealt with in the Irish presidency discussion or whether there would be a special slot provided tonight."
"The leader of the British Labour Members wished very much to speak but, because we had no idea of when, we had anticipated that the debate would take place tonight."
"So, I reject entirely that suggestion that there is disinterest."
"There is very great interest and concern amongst all the British Members of this House."
"That is a quite unwarranted attack and should be withdrawn."
"Firstly, let me say that I have listened very attentively."
"I thank the Members for their contributions."
"There are a number of things which strike me very forcibly."
"Firstly, we in the Irish presidency are setting out to ensure that we have an effective and efficient presidency."
"It is well-known by Members of the European Parliament that for a small Member State the presidency is an enormous challenge."
"It brings with it great demands on a small country."
"We have shown in the past, most recently in 1990, that we are capable of an effective and efficient presidency."
"I can assure Parliament that is our intention in the course of the next six months."
"There seems to be sufficient consensus on the priorities of the presidency."
"Someone quoted a business expression that if you have too many priorities, you have no priorities and the European agenda is certainly a very full one."
"It is an obligation on the Irish presidency to ensure that we address all of the items on that agenda."
"Some of them will be dealt with as an immediate priority, others will be taken along and progress achieved over a period of time."
"But what strikes me from this debate here this morning is that there is very strong consensus on the fact that employment remains top of the agenda, that the drugs question must be tackled in an effective manner by all European Member States in cooperation with other regions."
"We must work and strive to establish social justice and bring Europe closer to its citizens."
"I think that sometimes we under-sell the achievements of Europe to our citizens and indeed to ourselves."
"We, as politicians - both the European parliamentarians and the Member State governments - have to work harder to ensure that the people of Europe realize what is happening in the Union and what we are trying to achieve both domestically, internally and in our external relations and in terms of the role that we have to play."
"Obviously at the end of the presidency we are going to be judged by results."
"We are prepared to face that test."
"Two senior formations of the Union have met in the last few day."
"We have had the ECOFIN meeting and the General Affairs Council on Monday and Tuesday of this week."
"I certainly hope that already we have given very strong signals and demonstrated that our presidency is going to be effective: we are going to get the business done and address the agenda items we have before us."
"I also welcome the tenor of the remarks by colleagues here in terms of the spirit of cooperation and solidarity which was expressed."
"I can assure you that is going to be the hallmark of the relationship between the Irish presidency and the European Parliament for the next six months."
"In relation to Northern Ireland I feel that I have to respond because so many people expressed their concern."
"I have been directly or indirectly involved in Northern Ireland on behalf of the Irish Labour Party or on behalf of the Irish Government for over 14 years."
"I have to say that it is no exaggeration to state the level of despondency which has permeated Northern Ireland for the last number of days."
"The despondency is particularly palpable because of the optimism that existed in Northern Ireland between the parties and between the public at large in Northern Ireland over the period 1994/95 during the cease-fire."
"There was an air of optimism that people under the age of 25 had never experienced previously."
"All they had known was terrorism, bombs and civil strife over the past twenty-five years."
"We have to get back into dialogue between the parties and we have to do that as a matter of urgency."
"That is the responsibility for the governments and for the political parties in Northern Ireland."
"Through dialogue we have to develop tolerance and we have to find a peaceful accommodation which will be built on mutual respect and equality and we have to get away from the politics of domination and from the threat of violence."
"Those are objectives of the governments and, already with the meetings which took place yesterday and further meetings today and tomorrow, we are working towards those objectives."
"In relation to the presidency and the European Parliament, I can assure you that Irish Ministers will be in full consultation in the months ahead."
"We will be attending many of your committee meetings and my hope - and indeed my certainty - is that we will cooperate closely with you on advancing the many technical dossiers which provide the foundation of European economic integration."
"Many Members have mentioned the difficulties which Europe faces in relation to the Helms-Burton legislation."
"Let me reiterate that we share the desire of the United States for reforming Cuba."
"We seek the establishment of political freedom and full respect for human rights in Cuba and we should work together with the United States for these common aims."
"I am sure that Members are aware that at the General Affairs Council on Monday, at the first opportunity that was available to us during our presidency, we reaffirmed our concern to promote democratic reform in Cuba but we also recalled our deep concern, already expressed in the European Council at Florence, at the extra-territorial effects of the Helms-Burton legislation."
"We moved very quickly to give a very strong signal of our intention to respond to any damage which the application of legislation could cause to European interests."
"I have to say that I welcome President Clinton's decision yesterday to suspend for six months the right to bring action under Title 3 of the Helms-Burton legislation."
"This is a useful step and we will carefully examine its implications."
"However, it must also be said that it does not remove the extra-territorial effect of the legislation nor does it remove the restrictions which have been applied to European businessmen."
"The Helms-Burton legislation has been condemned by the main trading partners of the United States and I certainly hope that the United States will reflect further on the implications of its action and work with its partners to protect and promote an open international trading system for the benefit of all."
"Through the trans-Atlantic agenda we have a framework to further develop Europe's relations with the United States."
"As I have already indicated, the Irish presidency intends to advance cooperation with the United States in the many areas covered by this dialogue."
"A number of speakers have referred to the discussions which are taking place in the IGC on the ways in which the Union's common foreign and security policy can be strengthened."
"I will be addressing these issues in the debate on the Fernández-Albor report immediately after this debate."
"The IGC is currently addressing the aim identified by the Florence European Council of strengthening and enlarging the scope of the CFSP, including the Union's security and defence dimension."
"This discussion also embraces the question of closer links between the EU and the WEU."
"As their first priority, many Members raised the matter of employment and I would point out that the Irish experience of local development, which is an integrated approach to tackling disadvantage including unemployment black spots, will be the subject of a European conference in Dublin during our presidency."
"The OECD report on the Irish experience of local development was recently published and I commend it to Members of the European Parliament who may be interested in this topic."
"On the issue of free movement, I have listened very carefully to the remarks made by the honourable Members here today."
"This issue could be very appropriately discussed when the President-in-Office of the Justice and Home Affairs Council, Minister Owen, meets the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs in September."
"It will be very useful to hear the views of the committee on this important issue."
"Many Members raised the question of Cyprus."
"I would state that the prospect of accession to the EU by Cyprus offers an opportunity and incentive to seek a political settlement on the Cyprus question."
"It was in this context that the Italian presidency appointed a special representative."
"As holder of the EU presidency, Ireland will seek to continue the Union's support to contribute to the international effort to make progress towards an agreed settlement."
"At the General Affairs Council this week I announced the appointment of Ambassador Heaslip as the presidency's representative for Cyprus and we will consult with our partners when his recommendations are available on how the Union's approach to Cyprus might be further developed."
"Many mentioned the difficulties in former Yugoslavia, a concern which I would share myself, having visited the region in the last ten days."
"The position of the European Union, as it was set out at the European Council at Florence, is that the peace agreement excludes those indicted by the international criminal tribunal from running for office."
"Mr Karadzic's removal from the political scene is essential and indeed vital."
"The presidency will continue to work urgently together with others in the international community to achieve this objective."
"Likewise in relation to Kosovo, the European Union is very concerned at the situation."
"The Council expressed the hope that further steps by the Belgrade authorities, notably as regards Kosovo, would allow the development of good relations with the former Republic of Yugoslavia as well as improvement of Belgrade's position within the international community."
"We will maintain pressure towards this end."
"Mention was made of the importance of the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue."
"I personally put great emphasis on the achievements of the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue to date and particularly the success of the Barcelona Conference during the Spanish presidency."
"We have that as a priority and I am very glad, and I am sure Council Members are aware, that on Monday of this week, with the approval of MEDA, took a very important step in the direction of enhancing relations between Europe and the Mediterranean region and we will continue with that work."
"In fact, this afternoon we have a meeting with the Foreign Minister of Turkey to discuss relations between the European Union and Turkey, which I know is of concern to Members."
"We will use all of our abilities to make progress with regard to the relationship between Turkey and the European Union."
"Madam President, I welcome the contributions made by the Members of the European Parliament."
"As I said at the outset, I look forward during the Irish presidency to working very closely with you, the elected Members of the European citizens."
"I know that good work between the institutions will be vital if we are going to make the progress that we have said we want to make on the various dossiers and the various agenda items of the European Union."
"The debate is closed"
"Welcome"
"Before proceeding with the agenda, I would like to welcome on your behalf a delegation from the Sabor, the Croatian Parliament, which is in the gallery and is being shown round by the President of the Parliament, Mr Pavletic."
"I hope your work will be beneficial, and we are certain that it will be."
"I welcome you on behalf of Parliament."
"(Applause)"
"Progress in CFSP"
"The next item is the report (A4-0175/96) by Mr Fernández-Albor, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the progress made in implementing the common foreign and security policy (January-December 1995)."
"Madam President, as you will know this the second time that the European Parliament is holding a debate which, pursuant to Article J.7(2) of the Treaty on European Union, it must hold on progress achieved in implementing the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"In order to facilitate an orderly debate in the plenary session, the committee which it is my honour to chair has presented a report which we hope is balanced and likely win over an overwhelming majority of the Assembly."
"The draft report drawn up by my predecessor, Mr Matutes, was amended in committee by all political groups, with 57 amendments in all, most of which were incorporated into the text which is being presented today."
"It must be pointed out that most of the amendments were more amendments of form than substance, perhaps with the exception of those referring to the subjects of security and defence which, as we shall see, are still posing certain problems of analysis and interpretation, as well as the objectives and the general conception of European integration."
"It is important to emphasise that the Committee on Foreign Affairs did not want to duplicate the work already carried out the Assembly in respect of the necessary improvements which must be introduced into Title V during the Intergovernmental Conference which is under way. We have tried to keep to the Treaty provision limiting our exercise to analysis of the developments of the CFSP and the main thrust of the European Union's activity in this area over the year 1995."
"The general spirit of the report, and the motion for a resolution presented, is quite critical."
"This could not be any other way since in general terms 1995 was not a satisfactory year for development and implementation of CFSP."
"This lack of any development in the CFSP is all the more obvious since the Union's external activity was particularly intense."
"It was intense and we could even say that it was satisfactory in terms of the Union's external activity of a conventional nature."
"Along these lines the signing of the agreement with Mercosur, the Barcelona Euro-Mediterranean Conference, active and practical participation in the reconstruction plan for former Yugoslavia, the trans-Atlantic Pact, the signing of association agreements with Morocco, Tunisia, the Baltic States, etc., are major successes but does this mean that we have made any progress in developing a common external policy, does it mean that all of the potential of Title V of the Treaty has been put into action or does it even mean that we can detect a positive trend?"
"We do not think so."
"The perception we have, which also coincides with other analysts and public opinion, is that very little is being done to put into motion a CFSP worthy of that name."
"Therefore we think it is incongruous and discouraging (in points 9 of our motion for a resolution) that such intensive, fruitful conventional external activity should have produced so little development of the CFSP instruments."
"Indeed, we wish to emphasise the imbalance that exists in the Union's external activity."
"On one hand, we sign treaties and pay bills and yet, on the other hand we do not actually take any diplomatic initiatives which live up to our ambitions."
"The Treaty on European Union was a lukewarm attempt at overcoming the differences in European political cooperation and to assert, as it says in Article B, the European Union's identity in the international arena."
"That is why we were given a European political cooperation consisting of three elements: common action, common positions and the definition of a common defence policy."
"These three elements, which are vital for developing the non-conventional or diplomatic part of our external relations, has suffered very slow development, not to say non-existent, compared with the level of everyone's expectations, during the period which we are assessing."
"That is why in point 12 of the report we deplore the apparent confusion between the use of common positions and common measures."
"Their use seems to be the result of random or capricious designs which are no substitute for the application of instruments of a different scope devised for different situations."
"It would seem necessary to emphasise that, when we speak of a common deterrent system, there is no reference to the fact that that deterrent should have anything to do with nuclear deterrents, a subject which does not appear anywhere in the report and which lies outside the subject which we are dealing with. Our subject matter is only that of developing - as provided for in the Treaty on European Union - a credible common defence and security policy, one which is therefore dissuasive and effective."
"However, the term 'deterrent' is an unfortunate one because it is associated with nuclear weapons."
"Nothing prevents its being deleted in the text."
"I wish to conclude by regretting, as the report does in point 27 of the motion for a resolution, that we have not been capable - and I sincerely think this is not the fault of the European Parliament - to reach an inter-institutional agreement for correctly implementing Article J.4 of the Treaty."
"We have to point out that the Council has systematically ignored the European Parliament's recommendations on external policy and - which seems even more serious to me - has not even bothered to explain its stance politically."
"The European Parliament is entitled to be informed and consulted and that right has not been respected."
"Madam President, my presentation of Ireland's priorities earlier today gives a flavour of the increasing scale of the European Union's external engagement."
"The Union's activity in the foreign policy area has intensified considerably since the establishment of the common foreign and security policy."
"The Treaty on European Union expressed the Union's ambition to act coherently and effectively on the international scene."
"It provided, for this purpose, a mechanism for the definition of a common policy."
"The European Parliament's resolution, which is the subject of this debate, aptly describes the common foreign and security policy as an evolutionary process which must progress slowly but steadily in the direction of the objectives clearly laid down in the Treaty on European Union."
"Since the Treaty came into force, the Council has worked to develop agreed approaches to the major challenges confronting the Union and the procedures necessary for their implementation."
"The Intergovernmental Conference's review of the CFSP provides a timely opportunity to take stock of the progress achieved and to consider aspects which may require improvement."
"The deliberations of the Reflection Group last year helped to identify and clarify the issues to be addressed at the IGC."
"I would like to salute, in this regard, the invaluable contribution made to the work of the Reflection Group by the European Parliament's representatives, Mrs Guigou and Mr Brok."
"The concern expressed in Parliament's resolution about the lack of an identifiable analysis centre capable of evaluating risks and threats is broadly shared by its Member States."
"The IGC is considering the modalities for the possible establishment of a planning and analysis capacity at Union level which could serve as a focus for the identification of the common interest on foreign policy issues and facilitate the formulation of rapid and effective responses to these challenges."
"The Conference is also reviewing the procedures for the adoption and implementation of foreign policy decisions and the Treaty provisions on security and defence policy."
"Parliament's resolution correctly observes the establishment of the CFSP is not an end in itself but rather a means to promote the Union's objectives in relation to international peace and security, the development and consolidation of democracy, respect for the rule of law and fundamental freedoms."
"These objectives are pursued in a range of international fora, in particular the UN and the OSCE, and through the development of the Union's relations with its third country partners."
"Various means are used for this purpose."
"While joint actions and common positions are important CFSP instruments, they are by no means the sole measure of the scope or effectiveness of the Union's foreign policy activities."
"The new trans-Atlantic agenda and the action plan adopted at Madrid in December 1995, for example, represent a detailed strategy for closer EU-US cooperation in promoting international peace, stability, prosperity, democracy and human rights."
"Comprehensive political cooperation mechanisms have been developed with the European associate countries within the framework of the pre-accession strategy and structured dialogue."
"Notable progress has been made towards aligning the foreign policy positions of applicant countries with those of the Union in preparation for enlargement."
"The stability pact initiative of the Union, which was concluded last year, provides a framework for the development of cooperation and good neighbourly relations between the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, which are party to it."
"A more profound relationship is being developed with the countries of the former Soviet Union; the European Union is committed to negotiating partnership and cooperation agreements with Russia and each of the newly independent states, based on the principles of partnership and mutual respect."
"A number of agreements have already been negotiated."
"They are wide-ranging in scope and include important provisions on political dialogue, support for the consolidation of democratic structures and protection of human rights."
"The first parliamentary elections to the state Duma, established under the 1993 Constitution, and the recent presidential elections - both of which were observed by the EU - were important milestones in the process of democratic reform in Russia."
"The situation in Chechnya, however, remains a cause of concern, especially in the light of the recent resumption of fighting."
"The Union is continuing its support for the efforts of the OSCE to promote a negotiated settlement for this conflict."
"The declaration adopted at the Barcelona Conference in November 1995 represents a major step in the development of the Union's relations with its neighbours in the Mediterranean region, including the core parties to the Middle East peace process."
"The declaration established a process for deepening cooperation and partnership in the political, security, economic, social and cultural fields."
"It sets out a number of principles and objectives, together with a work programme, which is being actively implemented."
"The progressive development of all aspects of the partnership is a key objective of the Irish presidency."
"I am very pleased to be able to report in this context that the General Affairs Council this week adopted the MEDA regulation."
"This will give effect to our cooperation in the Euro-Mediterranean partnership."
"In 1995 the Council agreed general guidelines for the cooperation between the Union and Latin America for the period leading up to the 21st century."
"The political objectives of such future cooperation relate to institutional support for consolidation of democratic processes and respect for human rights with the involvement of civil society and in a context of open regionalism."
"With a view to redirecting its institutionalized dialogue with all countries in the region, the Union entered into a number of innovative dialogue arrangements."
"These included the signature of an interregional framework cooperation agreement with Mercosur at the Madrid European Council, preparation of an agreement with the Andean Pact countries - a political declaration was signed recently - and the signature of joint declarations with Mexico and Chile."
"These provide a dynamic framework for strengthening relations between the European Union and Latin America."
"Asia is now a major player on the international scene, in political as well as economic terms."
"The European Union is giving due priority to developing the dialogue between the Union and Asia and its countries and leaders."
"The Bangkok Summit established a new comprehensive Asia-Europe partnership aimed at strengthening links with a view to promoting peace, global stability and prosperity."
"The meeting agreed a number of specific follow-up measures in the political and economic areas."
"The Asia-Europe process provides the Union with an enhanced framework to develop mutual understanding with its Asean partners and to pursue its foreign policy interests and concerns in the region."
"As well as developing its external relations, the Union has continued its involvement in international efforts to address the major contemporary challenges to peace and stability."
"The peace agreement on Bosnia-Herzegovina, concluded last December, was a culmination of a sustained commitment by the international community, to which the European Union contributed substantially."
"The Council has at all times been concerned to ensure the Union's capacity to respond rapidly and flexibly to the evolving situation on the ground, in close consultation with its main international partners."
"It has used the instruments available to it under the Treaty on European Union for this purpose."
"The challenge now is to develop the structures necessary to secure and consolidate the peace."
"The Union is playing a key role in the implementation of the civil aspects of the peace accord through its contribution to economic reconstruction and its joint actions in support of the high representative, Mr Carl Bildt, the electoral process in Bosnia-Herzegovina and humanitarian assistance, including de-mining activities."
"The Union is also pursuing its support for the Middle East peace process on the basis of the approach set out in the Florence Declaration."
"The Union has played an active, constructive and even-handed role in cooperation with the co-sponsors of the process and the regional parties."
"It has been the principal provider of economic assistance to the Palestinian authority and has participated actively in the development of Palestinian institutions."
"The major role played by the Union in the organization and supervision of the January 1996 elections which led to the establishment of Palestinian institutions on a democratic basis was widely appreciated in the region."
"The continuing violence in the Great Lakes region and in particular Burundi has been a matter of serious concern to the Council, reflected in the series of steps taken with a view to alleviating the crisis."
"The common position on Burundi adopted in March 1995 expressed the EU's support for the process of national reconciliation and for dialogue between the local parties."
"This instrument also provided a framework for EU assistance in the form of support for the OAU military observer mission in Burundi and for the sending of human rights observers by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights."
"In the light of subsequent developments the Council appointed an EU special envoy to the region."
"He is actively supporting the ongoing peace efforts of the UN, the Organization of African Unity, regional leaders and other mediators such as former Presidents Carter and Nyerere."
"The Council supports the objectives of the security assistance process recently initiated at Arusha and hopes that it will help to create the conditions for an inclusive and substantial political dialogue between the parties."
"The Council strongly condemned the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa in November 1995 and subsequently adopted two common positions on Nigeria, both of which were designed to encourage respect for human rights and a return to civil democratic rule there."
"These included measures such as restrictions on visas to members of the security forces, an arms embargo and a suspension of development cooperation."
"The Union has continued to monitor the situation in Nigeria closely and intends to pursue its examination and identification of possible further measures against that country."
"The primary objective of the common position on Angola adopted in October 1995 was to assist its government in firmly establishing democratic structures and the rule of law."
"Other provisions included pursuing EU participation in efforts to alleviate the suffering of refugees and to encourage respect for human rights."
"The Union supplemented its activity in this area with a pledge of almost $ 800m in humanitarian rehabilitation assistance at the UNDP round-table last year."
"In the context of its joint action on mine clearance the EU has contributed ECU 1.5m to mine clearance projects in Angola."
"Early completion of the military demobilization process is crucial to the long-term underpinning of the peace process."
"As well as responding to immediate crises, the Union is also seeking to address the underlying causes of conflict in Africa through its ongoing practical dialogue in cooperation with the Organization of African Unity."
"In its conclusions of 4 December 1995, the Council reiterated that preventive diplomacy, peacekeeping and international security are priority aims of the CFSP."
"It outlined the principles behind the Union's contribution in support of action taken by African bodies, in particular the OAU, to establish conflict prevention and resolution mechanisms."
"These principles are now the basis of the EU's ongoing dialogue with the OAU in this important area."
"They are aimed at assisting the OAU's efforts to create its own effective conflict prevention and resolution mechanisms by providing training, expertise and logistical support in the areas of early warning, preventative diplomacy and peacekeeping."
"The joint action on anti-personnel landmines, adopted on 12 May 1995, was a significant step in the European Union's efforts to address the tragedy caused by the indiscriminate use of weapons of this kind in many countries."
"The joint action established a common moratorium on the export of anti-personnel landmines and made provision for active preparation of the review conference of the 1980 Inhumane Weapons Convention and a contribution to international mine clearance."
"While the joint action did help to give some impetus to the work of the review conference, the outcome fell short of our expectations, and some of the goals set out in our joint action in a number of important respects."
"Our objective now is to reach agreement on an updated joint action in order to maximise the European Union's contribution to the international movement for a world-wide ban on these weapons."
"I welcome the emphasis placed by Parliament's resolution on the protection of human rights in its endorsement of the efforts made by the Council to uphold this principle."
"The Council's annual report to Parliament on the Union's activities in the human rights area was presented earlier this month by President Hänsch."
"The Irish presidency will pursue the Union's efforts to advance respect for human rights and to ensuring this objective remains at the heart of the Union's policies in general and its common foreign security policy in particular."
"I would like to thank the European Parliament for providing the Irish presidency with an opportunity for an early exchange of views on CFSP."
"I would like to assure you again of our commitment to keep Parliament informed of developments in the CFSP area over the coming months, and I look forward to a constructive working relationship between the Council and the European Parliament, which will enable the Union to effectively meet the challenges which lie ahead."
"Mr President-in-Office, thank you."
"We are suspending the debate on this report; we shall resume at 3.00 p.m."
"Votes"
"The next item is voting time."
"I propose that we change the order of voting slightly, if only because of the Members who are present in the Chamber. We shall start with Mr Wolf's recommendation and then vote on Mr Piecyk's report, Mr Hoppenstedt's recommendation and Mr Meier's recommendation."
"We shall then move on to the reports, or rather votes, which require an absolute majority, but before that we ought to vote on the calendar of part-sessions."
"Are there any comments on this slightly amended procedure?"
"Mr President, the vote on the calendar is precisely the point on which I would like to comment."
"My request is a simple one: I would like you to declare inadmissible all the amendments relating to the number of plenary part-sessions at Strasbourg, for two reasons."
"First, in order to comply with the Edinburgh compromise, and secondly because we should await the judgment of the Court of Justice, which has been asked to rule on this question."
"Mr Wurtz, would you be good enough to put on your headphones so that I can say something to you!"
"I have just made a proposal to change the order of voting."
"That has to do with the Members who are present in the Chamber."
"I shall announce the calendar of part-sessions at a later point."
"When I announce the vote on that item, you and anyone else who wishes to speak on it will have the opportunity to do so."
"It is more efficient to do that when the item is announced."
"Mr President, in yesterday's debate there were a couple of ambiguities, which is why I wanted to say a few more words of clarification."
"First of all, our vote today does not conclude our work on the trans-European networks, because they are, of course, subject to revision at regular intervals."
"Secondly, some Members pointed out yesterday that a number of amendments to Annex I had not been considered. That is true, which is why we have agreed with the Commission that a separate proposal will be submitted for the ports, for instance, and that other parliamentary amendments which have not yet been considered will be taken into account by the Commission in the forthcoming revision."
"Thirdly, the conclusions of the Florence Council caused annoyance here in Parliament, and in that respect I am very pleased that Mr Dini, in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council, set the record straight in our Brussels Chamber."
"He stated that the Council had not made any unilateral amendments in Florence."
"It was merely a question of acknowledging a proposed amendment to project No 8; any actual amendment would naturally be made through the codecision framework."
"You know that we have both discussed the matter too, and under these conditions, Mr President, I can recommend to the House that we approve the joint text today."
"(Parliament approved the joint text)"
"Pursuant to Rule 125 (3) of our Rules of Procedure, I should like you to declare inadmissible all amendments on the draft calendar for the 1997 part-sessions which relate to the number of plenary part-sessions to be held in Strasbourg. I ask this for two reasons: first, in order to comply with the Edinburgh compromise, and secondly, Mr President, whatever your decision on that matter, we must wait until the Court of Justice, which is currently considering this problem, is able to give its judgment."
"Mr President, I am grateful to be given the floor, all the more grateful because I didn't ask for it."
"As it is not a frequent occurrence for you to give it to me when I do ask for it, I would like to pay this small tribute. Mr Striby spoke on my behalf."
"Ladies and gentlemen, before we go any further with interventions of this nature, let me say the following: of course I have given thought to the question whether it is permissible to vote on this amendment today for the removal of an October part-session from the calendar, and I have examined the matter carefully."
"Firstly, in the history of Parliament there are several precedents, and my predecessors have always considered amendments of this type to be admissible, and these amendments have always been put to the vote here in the House."
"I should not like to deviate from that practice."
"Secondly, last year we voted on a similar amendment."
"It is now the subject of proceedings before the European Court of Justice."
"Last year, by adopting the amendment, the House confirmed its de facto admissibility."
"I shall not therefore proceed to complicate the case before the Court by deciding differently this year."
"Thirdly, the House is free to adopt or reject the amendment."
"Whoever considers it inadmissible must vote against it."
"So the issue is in the hands of the House, and that is where I shall let it rest."
"Mr President, I should like to make the point that we cannot accept your arguments, because the matter of admissibility is not a matter of fact but a matter of procedure."
"Now, you are required to apply the Treaties and the Rules of Procedure, and having due regard to the Treaties and the Rules of Procedure - and the Treaties are definitive, since they represent a decision by the Heads of State and Government - you must declare these amendments inadmissible."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you know every bit as well as I do that there are differing views in this House on the extent to which the Edinburgh decision is contractual in character."
"The Court has yet to rule on the matter, so as long as there are differing views I shall apply the selfsame rule that Mr Striby quoted: ' The President shall decide whether amendments are admissible.'"
"Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor on a point of order."
"I am aware that you have difficulty in noticing certain people on your right, and so I am grateful for being given the floor."
"I also wish to raise a point of order, in connection with the same points mentioned by previous speakers, Mr Pasty and Mr Striby in particular."
"My own view is that the amendments are inadmissible."
"I know you don't agree with me, but even so I am bound to say that at a time when the intergovernmental conference is in session, it seems to me - irrespective of strictly legal questions, it seems to me, as I say - that, politically, it would be weakening Strasbourg to accept the symbolic submission of the European Parliament to the Council and Commission by deporting the sittings of the European Parliament to Brussels."
"I believe that much of Parliament's independence depends on the fact that its principal seat is located in a city other than the place where the Commission and the Council have their seats."
"This submission, in my view, is quite deplorable. I wanted to make that point to honourable Members before the vote."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we shall now proceed to the vote."
"So that the matter can be properly resolved, you should refrain from trying to prevent or delay the vote by procedural ruses or interventions on points of order."
"All Members have the opportunity to use their vote to express their views on the issue we have to decide here."
"Mr President, it has been hard, but it has been worth the effort; we are finally being heard in this House."
"I do not wish to delay the vote, Mr President, I should simply like to ask you not to intervene every time a Member speaks, since you have now spoken five times on the same issue, whereas we can speak only once, and that with difficulty, because you rarely bother to look at either the far right or the far left."
"I should therefore like to ask your collaborators to take more heed of Members' requests to speak."
"As regards the subject of our intervention, you have said that what happened with your predecessors was that only amendments of a certain kind were accepted, and yet you are doing just the same."
"What comes to mind is the old Latin saying, errare humanum est , but it is a shame to see the same mistake being made again and again."
"As for the special pleading for Brussels, I should like to denounce in this House the strange goings-on concerning the assets of both the Commission and Parliament, a problem on which we should like to see light shed, since somebody somewhere is getting shamefully rich at the expense of Parliament and of democracy."
"Mr President, I am sure that the House overwhelmingly supports the statement you have made."
"If this House is not sovereign in fixing its own agenda, what is it sovereign in?"
"This must be understood, not just by the Council of Ministers and the European Council, but also by the Court of Justice."
"Today we can send a signal."
"I hope Parliament will do so."
"Mr President, much has been made in this Parliament about the supremacy of this Parliament and also about observing the Rules of Procedure and the Treaties and so on. Let us not forget that when Hitler wanted to take over, and impose Nazism on Germany he used so-called parliamentary democracy to this end."
"What is happening here is that, by refusing to allow people to speak in this Parliament, by refusing to ensure that people abide by the Treaties and constitution of this Parliament and of the European Union, we are failing to fulfil our duty to set an example to people."
"It is quite clear from the Treaties that Strasbourg is the seat of Parliament and, despite what the Members over there may try and say and despite what they may try and do, they are flying in the face of law, of constitutional law and of the rights of the people of Europe!"
"That is not a point of order!"
"Now please listen very carefully and concentrate on the vote!"
"Mr President, the comments of Mr Crowley are a disgrace to this House!"
"I would ask him to withdraw them straight away!"
"Mr President, with all the respect due to any honourable Member, I believe that making a comparison between a Parliamentary debate on the calendar and the political problem of Hitler's Germany is not just a disgrace but also stupid, and unworthy of the European Parliament."
"(Loud applause)"
"Mr Crowley, you can consider yourself fortunate that I did not hear what you said because of the noise in the House."
"But I shall not permit any further debate on this question."
"After the vote on Amendments Nos 1 to 7:"
"Mr President, what you have just done is scandalous!"
"You have given proof of irresponsibility, and on top of that you have just violated the most elementary principle of democracy."
"We are the authors of the amendments which you have just put to a block vote."
"I ask you for the floor to withdraw some of those amendments. You refuse to give it to me."
"Not only are you showing yourself to be totally irresponsible, you are also treating with contempt the right of each of us here to express an opinion."
"When a Member tables amendments, he always has the right to speak before those amendments are voted on!"
"After the vote:"
"Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor, and I shall be very brief."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, now that things have calmed down, I would like to say a word about the majority in this House which is, as it were, legally empowered to do everything and anything."
"Mr President, my point of order is based on Article 216 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, Article 77 of the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community and Article 189 of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community. All these articles, Mr President, most explicitly provide - and they are available to you - that the seat of the institutions shall be determined by common accord of the Governments of the Member States."
"The Edinburgh declaration, which is an international treaty, also forms part of the references."
"If you create the principle that the parliamentary majority can violate the rules which determine that power, it can also violate the treaties on which that same power is based thus, as it were, sawing through the branch on which it is sitting."
"Mr Gollnisch, the seat of the institution was not in any way the subject of this debate and vote."
"At the Edinburgh Council, Strasbourg was designated as the seat of the institution."
"Our vote here has merely been about holding a week's part-session and nothing else!"
"Mr President, I was just looking at the text of Amendment No 21, which we passed a few moments ago, which concerns changes to weeks 37 and 38."
"I note that it says week beginning 8 September and week beginning 15 September."
"If you look at Parliament's diary for 1997, you will find that 8 and 15 September are actually Sundays and week-ending days, not week-beginning days."
"Mr Cassidy, the calendar I have here does not show that."
"We shall look into it, of course, but if you are correct the decision will stand, subject to the proviso that for Sunday the European Parliament will read Monday."
"Mr President, at its meeting on 24 June 1995 the Committee on the Rules of Procedure gave a mandate to its chairman and to the rapporteurs to recommend a vote on the Nordmann and Ford reports, pursuant to Rule 114 of our Rules of Procedure."
"The rapporteurs, and the chairman of the committee, recommend the House to reject all the amendments except those which were adopted in committee."
"To the authors of the amendments whose rejection we recommend, I would say that our only purpose is to respect the commitments entered into by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, and that no value judgement is implied regarding the amendments whose rejection is proposed."
"Some of the provisions contained in their amendments have, in any case, already been the subject of lengthy discussions within the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, and furthermore they will be discussed again during the preparation of subsequent reports which will be necessary for the continuation of our work."
"I repeat, therefore, that the rejection of these amendments, some of which contain interesting ideas that will be useful for the further work of the committee, does not imply any value judgement."
"Mr President, following on Mr Fayot's very fair presentation, I would like to withdraw my Amendment No 4 in the interests of Amendment No 10, which has been put forward by Mr Nordmann."
"Amendment No 4, if I understand correctly, is thereby withdrawn."
"Mr President, I owe our colleagues an explanation regarding Amendment No 10."
"I naturally endorse in its entirety the declaration by Mr Fayot, which relates to the other amendments."
"Amendment No 10 is somewhat special: it is a formula which I proposed following the mini-debate that took place on Monday, when my report was restored to the agenda, in order to make it easier to arrive at a consensus."
"Of course, this amendment only has any prospect of being adopted - as demonstrated by the previous votes since the debate at this sitting - if it is supported by the majority of the groups, and especially of the major groups. It would appear, from information I have received, that one of the major groups is not endorsing this amendment."
"In the circumstances, in my capacity as a rapporteur interested in achieving a consensus, all I can do is withdraw it, though I still hope - since our Rules of Procedure provide such a possibility - that it may eventually be taken up again by one of my colleagues!"
"Mr President, I should like to follow the very broad hint given by Mr Nordmann and adopt the amendment on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party."
"Before the vote on Amendment No 10:"
"Mr President, this amendment was not tabled in due time and is therefore to be regarded as an oral amendment."
"I oppose it for two reasons."
"The first is a formal reason: we have been discussing this text now for a year and a half and this is no time for last-minute compromise amendments."
"My second reason concerns the merits."
"There is no need of detailed rules for the application of provisions that have been adopted hitherto."
"If anyone wants detailed rules of application it is because, in point of fact, he wants to oppose the reform."
"In the interests of transparency and in the desire to ensure disclosure of all the financial provisions affecting us, I therefore oppose this amendment and I have no doubt that I shall find twelve other Members to oppose it with me."
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, the fact is that this is a compromise amendment which was tabled in the proper manner."
"It is also available in all languages."
"The amendment was withdrawn, and the Rules permit another Member to take over the amendment, which thereby becomes a compromise amendment."
"That is how we have proceeded."
"I cannot see even the slightest error in that course of action, and so we shall now vote on Amendment No 10."
"After the vote on Amendment No 10:"
"Mr President, expanding on what I said earlier, I shall also call you inventive. You have just invented forms of compromise amendments although there are no amendments to start with."
"In our Rules of Procedure, provision is clearly made for compromise amendments when there are a number of amendments and when in order to resolve clashes between two or more amendments a compromise amendment is agreed by two or more political groups."
"You have described as a 'compromise amendment' something which was not a compromise amendment."
"I therefore maintain the reservations I have entered."
"Here again, I think that, pursuant to the Rules of Procedure, you should have asked if honourable Members were opposed to a vote."
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, I shall try to choose my words more carefully in future."
"(Parliament adopted the decision)"
"Mr President, I just wanted to welcome Sir James Goldsmith to the Chamber on one of his rare visits to Parliament."
"Had he been here a little earlier his French voters might have been happier about the outcome of the vote on the Brussels/Strasbourg question which was lost by one vote."
"(Laughter)"
"Madam President, on behalf of our group I should like to reemphasize that it was a matter of great importance to us to vote against the trans-European networks."
"We consider it absurd to want to fight unemployment by means of expensive showcase projects and to seek at the same time to use the structural funds for that purpose, funds which are actually intended to improve local infrastructures and create jobs."
"In addition, it is now undisputed that readiness to finance these crazy projects is declining."
"It is also undisputed that their disadvantages far outweigh their advantages."
"As the Spanish Minister of the Environment made clear when he addressed our Parliament last year, such enormous central roadbuilding projects make no sense whatsoever, because they concentrate wealth to the detriment of the underprivileged and remote regions, since these transEuropean networks link large population centres which already enjoy a high level of development, these being the only areas in which it pays to engage in such expensive flagship projects."
"The underprivileged regions derive no benefit whatsoever from them."
"Anyone who suggests otherwise is lying, for Europe 2000-plus has already demonstrated this to be the case."
"The underprivileged regions will be further depleted, and their social infrastructure will continue to decay."
"This in turn would mean that we should have to inject more structural funds, but these would no longer be available."
"In other words, such regions will be cut adrift."
"The environmental clause with which Parliament sought to redress the balance in certain respects has been watered down in the compromise."
"So the projects as they now stand do not even meet the requirements of the negotiated environmental clause; in other words, the clause is mere window-dressing in which the Council is now engaged. I am pleased that we shall be voting by roll-call."
"And I should also be pleased if the Members did not only have to answer for their vote to the present electorate but also to future generations."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is simply out of a sense of responsibility that I am voting for the common project."
"Although, on the one hand, Article 20 pays special attention to projects concerning multi-modal transport and priority attention to the 'Adriatic Corridor' and a reading of Article 19 reveals the purely indicative nature of the list of 14 Essen projects, on the other hand, the entire affair, which has now been dragging on for years, bears witness both to the terrible behaviour of the Council, which has often taken action in total disregard of Parliament, and to the negative outcome of the Florence Summit."
"I find it especially mortifying that this occurred during the Italian presidency."
"It also emerges from a reading of Article 18, and this is extremely worrying, that the Committee on the Exchange of Information and Relations does not include a representative of the European Parliament and that the individual Member States are not in a position to guarantee the funds needed to implement a serious transport policy, so as to create the infrastructures required to help the development of Europe's peripheral areas."
"It is now up to the individual Member States and especially, in my opinion as a representative of southern Italy, the Italian Government."
"I hope the Italian Government, together with the Government of the Union, will be able to guarantee the effective implementation of projects that could, especially in the case of multi-modal transport, really bring the peripheral regions into closer contact with central and northern Europe."
"Madam President, following all the excellent points made in the debate by my colleague Mr Le Rachinel, I shall confine my intervention to three points of more specific relevance to France."
"The first relates to the Rhône-Saône-Rhine wide inland waterway."
"This link is shown in the documents supplied by the French Authorities, but it is high time they told us clearly whether or not they believe that this waterway - which has been delayed for nearly a quarter of a century - is still profitable today, and whether its completion is compatible with environmental protection."
"If not, of course, it would be completely ridiculous to create it bit by bit."
"My second point is along the same lines, but in this case I refer to the high-speed rail link."
"I would hope that, for once in a way, Europe might actually achieve something and that we could avoid what has been done up to now, which is that all rail traffic has been concentrated around Paris. So I am glad to see this proposed link appearing on the documents that have been supplied."
"Finally, my third and last point relates to the airport map we have been given."
"The French and European Authorities refer to the cities of Toulon, Perpignan and Nantes as having regional airports."
"One of them, Toulon, was actually proposed as a future international airport."
"I have just learnt that the national airline was not only refusing to serve these cities but was even intending to prohibit any other airline from serving them either. This is a completely unacceptable practice."
"We in the Freedom Party voted for the report on guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport networks because the Brenner Tunnel, an important project for Austria, is part of these guidelines."
"We note, however, that the new approach has considerably eroded the legal status of the list of priorities in Annex III, thereby jeopardizing the building of the Brenner Tunnel, which is of such great importance to Austria."
"We also place on record that without an agreement on the funding framework these guidelines will be utterly meaningless."
"The major trans-European transport networks are one of the most ambitious projects of the European Union, fundamental for strengthening the internal market, the movement of persons and goods and for economic and social cohesion."
"That is why we welcome this general plan to be put into execution by the year 2010."
"However, in respect of Portugal we have to raise some reservations."
"The first refers to the policy on sea-transport and renovation of the port network which is not exactly highlighted."
"We hope that in 1997 the Commission will make more explicit its policy on this sector."
"The second refers to the motorway link between Valladolid and Lisbon which was introduced at the Essen summit."
"In 1995 the Portuguese government showed an interest in building this link on a route between the IP5 and IP3 highways with an extension across to the north-south motorway somewhere between Lisbon and Oporto."
"This solution seems to us right as it serves the whole of the national territory."
"The intention which is now being announced to link this motorway to the Portuguese capital seems to us unacceptable because it forgets about the northern hinterland, the centre of the country and the coastline."
"This solution does not serve the objectives of harmonious development of the national territory as a whole."
"If we only serve the capital there is no doubt that regional imbalances will only increase."
"We will not be able to support this new solution since it does not clearly define the simultaneous purpose of benefiting the interests of the coastline and the centre of the country by doubling up the IP 5 highway."
"It should also be added that since the Portuguese government announced at the Florence Summit that it could replace the Valladolid-Lisbon axis by a system of inter-modal transport, we are not certain at the moment which concrete project will comprise that system."
"Without calling into question the possible merit of this project we think that the details should already be defined so that we can actually vote in knowledge of all of the facts."
"For these reasons, I am unable to give my full support to this proposal as I would have liked."
"I am voting against the conciliation committee's proposal, which would entail the Union continuing to waste money on unnecessary and expensive motorway projects."
"In view of the fact that the countries of the European Union are supposed to achieve the objectives of the UN's Rio Declaration concerning the significant reduction of carbon dioxide emissions this proposal is a step in the wrong direction."
"The Commission has itself pointed out that emissions of carbon dioxide will increase by almost 40 % under the 'business as usual' scenario."
"The proposed motorway projects are harmful to the environment and will of course increase emissions still further."
"The proposed rules on environmental protection appear largely to be empty political rhetoric and are far from sufficient."
"The Øresund bridge is a typical example of how you can try, using calculations which are not serious, to prove that there will be environmental benefits."
"The economic calculations are even more laughable!"
"The problems of traffic jams can be solved more simply and in a more environmentally friendly manner through economic management systems, primarily through the introduction of a high carbon tax which can persuade transport users to switch from private cars to public transport."
"In terms of energy consumption rail transport is more effective and should be supported today."
"If all types of transport had to pay their own environmental costs rail transport would automatically become competitive."
"Investment in motorways is also a bad thing in terms of equal opportunities."
"It is almost exclusively men who will get the jobs."
"The EMU convergence criteria have compelled the Member States to make panic savings in health care and care of the elderly and this has resulted in many women becoming unemployed."
"The proposal does include some support for certain rail projects but this in no way compares with the massive contributions to motorways and airports which dominate the proposal."
"We have reached the final episode of the long soap opera of trans-European transport networks."
"After much shilly-shallying by the European Parliament and Council, we have before us the outcome of conciliation."
"But it needs to be said that the lack of respect Council has shown for the joint decisionmaking procedure laid down by the Maastricht Treaty is scandalous."
"We had hoped it would be possible to discuss the projects set out as priorities by the Essen Council of December 1994, and perhaps even to replace some of them with more substantial, more useful or simply more feasible projects."
"We were told this was no longer possible - for the European Parliament."
"But the same did not apply to Council, which, at Florence, announced a very substantial change in one of those projects."
"And how can we believe, in this day and age, that it will be possible to find the Lit 25 000 billion needed to build the Brenner tunnel, a tunnel that will moreover serve absolutely no good purpose?"
"It is not even going to be possible to build the high-speed line between Lyons and Trieste according to programme."
"Minister Burlando himself has told the European Parliament that through the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"The two lines added concerning protection of the environment, which are, in any case, inadequate, do nothing to change our negative opinion of this document."
"And that is a real shame."
"The Greens are not against modernizing or speeding-up Europe's transport networks."
"But neither are we willing to sacrifice all the available money and energy on the altar of competitiveness to carry our outdated projects that serve few people and have a very serious environmental and social impact."
"First of all a word of thanks to the chairmen of the conciliation talks, the Italian minister and our principal Vice-President, Mrs Nicole Fontaine."
"Both of them steered the talks with a great deal of dedication, patience and understanding."
"Thanks and praise are due also to rapporteur Piecyk and Commissioner Kinnock."
"The outcome is decidedly not as good as it might have been and it has created confusion."
"Certainly, after what Council President Dini said at our last part-session in Brussels and following the Commissioner's first letter to committee chairman Cornelissen, I thought that Parliament's power of co-decision was clear enough and what Commissioner Kinnock subsequently told Mr Simpson simply gave rise to confusion and suspicion."
"Why was this letter in fact necessary and why was it made public?"
"In football terms this was a one-two which the referee should not have allowed."
"The Commissioner's reaction to Mr Bourlanges, who asked a number of perfectly reasonable questions, was certainly not the courteous reply which Parliament would have expected and prompted the VicePresident in the chair to intervene."
"Regarding the matter in hand: in line with our criteria giving preference to environmentally friendly modes of transport Parliament adopted an altogether acceptable compromise on Malpensa airport at the second reading, and this was a clear sign of goodwill on our part that we were prepared, in exchange for recognition of our power of co-decision, to accept the list in Annex III without amendment."
"The Commission was certainly in no doubt about that."
"Given the budget appropriations, the list of networks as such and as shown in Annex I is certainly too long to be taken seriously."
"The decision of the European summit in Essen to designate fourteen priority projects was thus understandable and sensible."
"So it will not do subsequently to try to undermine Parliament's power of codecision by saying that this list of priorities is 'a matter for the bosses' and sacrosanct."
"That was our complaint and the ultimate result of the conciliation procedure, as confirmed by Minister Dini's statement."
"In line with my contribution to the conciliation procedure, my Group has thus voted in favour of the result we have now."
"Our citizens are now looking for concrete results, especially in view of the extra resources and extra positive effects on employment promised by Commission President Santer."
"Those national politicians who believe that Europe cannot help to combat unemployment by carrying out infrastructure projects over and above the national interest have totally misunderstood."
"The TENs, which are joint European undertakings, represent a positive contribution to the prosperity and integration of future generations and for that reason we can all be very happy with the result achieved."
"Hoppenstedt report"
"In this report from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, Parliament is maintaining its position from the first reading in January this year."
"The point is to ensure that in the selection of projects eligible for support as part of the development of trans-European telecommunications networks, sufficient emphasis is placed on projects which have a practical utility value for both businesses and private users of telecommunications services."
"The information society is not emerging of its own accord: it must be developed by exploiting in practice and gradually expanding our awareness of the scope of information technology, as indicated in the Commission's White Paper on growth, competitiveness and employment of December 1993."
"In this context, Parliament wishes this joint European Parliament and Council decision to be implemented in accordance with Article 129d of the Treaty, whereby Article 189b will be applied."
"This request should be supported - not least in the light of the commendable consistency with which Parliament has acted over a number of recent years in its efforts to promote technological development and to strengthen Europe's competitiveness through extensive liberalization of the telecommunications sector."
"Meier recommendation for second reading"
"At the first reading of the Commission's original proposal for a directive, which took place in the spring of 1994, the European Parliament adopted a large number of amendments aimed at increasing the safety requirements for pressure equipment which is produced and marketed in the EU."
"In view of the nature of the products, there can of course be no concessions regarding user and consumer safety."
"Of the 25 amendments which Parliament adopted at first reading, the Council has so far accepted 14."
"Before the second reading, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy therefore retabled ten amendments and tabled another five, with a view to further specifying the requirements to be met by pressure equipment before it is placed on the market."
"There is every reason to encourage the committee and its rapporteur to maintain the amendments tabled in the recommendation during the discussions which must now be expected to start in the conciliation committee."
"I can therefore fully endorse the recommendation and the amendments it contains as a basis for approving the Council's common position."
"I am afraid that safety standards regarding pressure equipment will in time fall."
"The need for third party checks on such equipment is an important one and should have been established for even more of the equipment concerned."
"The preparations for the approximation of Member States' legislation have, however, been long and complicated (the first reading in the European Parliament took place as long ago as April 1994), and this has greatly restricted my ability to exert any influence over the report at second reading in the European Parliament."
"Nordmann report"
"In voting on the Nordmann report, the European Parliament is initiating a salutary arrangement with regard to transparency and the financial interests of its Members."
"This is a first step, though no more than that, towards a definition of the status of Member of the European Parliament defined at Union level."
"No doubt it was impossible, as yet, to go beyond this compromise, given the diversity of traditions and practices in force in the various Member States."
"That is why, despite its inadequacy, I voted in favour of this amendment to the rules, because, being unable to prohibit any form of financial support, it makes its disclosure compulsory."
"I believe this is an advance as compared with the secret nature of the present situation, an advance which I feel sure will reduce the scale of these deplorable practices."
"But total prohibition, which is still imposed on the French Members by national legislation and case law, should be our own, and the sooner the better."
"The study of the Nordmann report, and the debate and vote on it, as in the case of the Ford report, had only one purpose and one meaning for me: the need to ensure, in conditions of the greatest possible transparency, the greatest possible independence of elected representatives from their economic environment."
"In order to carry out his duties (and perhaps ensuring that he does carry out his duties 'effectively' ), a Member of Parliament receives various forms of compensation."
"They are justified and they are amply sufficient!"
"We must, then, prohibit any financial or material gift to a Member from any quarter whatsoever, and we must monitor compliance with that prohibition."
"This is clear, it is simple, all we have to do is do it!"
"This a vital matter for the image of politicians and therefore for 'politics' ... and for the future of democracy!"
"Mr Nordmann has done his job well, admittedly sometimes creating the feeling in some of his colleagues that he has something of a taste for 'liar's poker' ."
"Each of us has today had the opportunity to indicate in full public view what he wanted and display his choices."
"As far as I am concerned, after twenty years of electoral life, I have only one regret - that we waited so long and wasted so much time before reaching this point."
"The politician works for 'the public' ."
"He is paid for it by 'the public' ."
"He must provide a full accounting of what he has done and what he has earned and what assets he holds."
"And that's that!"
"At a time when public opinion is demanding transparency and rectitude from those who are elected to administer public life, it is high time that the European Parliament emerged from its protective cocoon with a clear statement of support for total prohibition of financial or material gifts to any Member from any person whatsoever."
"Those were the conclusions of the working group set up by this institution and adopted by Mr Nordmann, and those are conclusions which I irrevocably support."
"Members of the European Parliament, like their colleagues in the national Parliaments, receive allowances - public allowances, which are verified and verifiable - to enable them to perform their duties."
"Any external, parallel or other form of remuneration, or any hand-outs of any kind, must be totally and definitively prohibited."
"Why adopt a complicated approach when we can adopt a simple one, easy to understand and clearly stated. I shall therefore be voting for the absolute prohibition of any gift."
"Eriksson and Sjöstedt (GUE/NGL), Holm and Schörling (V), in writing."
"(SV) For us democracy is synonymous with government by the people."
"This means that the people govern in accordance with the principle of one person, one vote."
"The rights of citizenship should be exercised through voting rights, rather than being the preserve of wealthy elites."
"It troubles us that in the context of the debates on the Ford and Nordmann reports the Members of the European Parliament did not manage to prohibit lobbyists from offering gifts and bribes within the domain of the European Parliament."
"It is even more serious that MEPs found themselves unable to decide that they themselves should give written and public assurances that they had not accepted and would refuse to accept gifts, staff support or other benefits other than those financed by their own institution."
"Furthermore, Parliament refused to agree to make public payments by the 'Caisse des Députés' , one of its own service departments."
"Taken as a whole, this behaviour makes it look to the public as if Parliament has something to hide."
"As a result, Parliament's credibility as a driving force for democracy and openness within the institutions of the EU has been dealt a serious blow, and one whose consequences may prove extremely difficult to reverse."
"The vote on the Ford and Nordmann reports represents a first step on a difficult road - it involves disciplining the activities of Members of the European Parliament in their relations with the outside world."
"First, I would say this: in contrast to political life in certain Member States, European politics has not so far been the subject of any political and financial scandals."
"Even if demagogues of all hues do like to moralize and never tire of denouncing supposed scandals, it is fair to say that the European Parliament has so far been free of any 'affairs' ."
"As this Parliament gains in stature and importance, pressure groups are taking more and more interest in it."
"That is the subject of Mr Ford's report."
"Hitherto, honourable Members have never really known whom they would meet during a day's work in the European Parliament buildings."
"The registration of lobbyists and the observance of a number of rules are going to bring a little transparency into relations between Members and the representatives of interest groups."
"The other aspect, covered in Mr Nordmann's report, concerns Members' interests."
"My view is that most Members have nothing for which to reproach themselves."
"Here again, though, the card is worth playing - maximum transparency on incomes, outside occupations, support received by a Member in that capacity."
"We do not want any gifts or hand-outs, anything at all is too much. Let's be clear about that!"
"So, this is a first step."
"We should remember that the European Parliament is a young institution, taking shape slowly."
"By contrast, the national parliaments are a century or even several centuries old, while the European Parliament elected by direct suffrage dates from 1979."
"It is having to invent common rules, a common mentality, a European approach to ethics, bit by bit."
"This is a first step, an agreement that was difficult to reach."
"The next steps are in preparation: European rules for Members of Parliament, rules relating to assistants and intergroups, a code of conduct for interest groups."
"Here again, we know that consensus will take a long time to ripen."
"But it will be essential if we are to construct a consistent, serious and effective parliamentary institution, in the service of democracy and transparency in Europe."
"Mr Nordmann's report on transparency and Members' financial interests ought to be resulting in strict rules on the influence of lobbyists on the work of the European Parliament."
"However, the rules set out in the Nordmann report do not resolve the difficulties at all."
"Amongst other things, they allow support to be provided by third parties in terms of staff or materials."
"Gifts of any kind should naturally be declared, but ideally there should not be any gifts at all."
"This applies to all kinds of gifts, including meals and travel."
"The rules should prohibit gifts completely, but they fail to do so."
"That is why I have voted against the Nordmann report today."
"I have voted for the Ford and Nordmann reports as first steps towards a system of rules on lobbying and economic openness for MEPs."
"The reports are not sufficient, however."
"Donations and gifts should not be allowed."
"The lobby register should of course be public and anyone who so wishes should have access to it."
"Industry and organisations should not be able to offer financial benefits to MEPs by appointing staff within companies or the equivalent who are in reality working for a particular MEP."
"The European Parliament's accounts concerning MEPs' travelling and subsistence expenses should be public."
"As everyone knows we are governed by the principle of not enjoying personal benefits accruing from the exercise of public activity."
"That is why we call - and not only in the European Parliament - for greater transparency and an effective upgrading of the morals of politics."
"With the moral authority of someone who not only calls for but also always applies these principles personally."
"Therefore, our votes on the reports in question and amendments which have been tabled were determined by the following main aspects:"
"In respect of the Nordmann report:"
"The complete ban on Members of Parliament receiving, in the framework of their parliamentary duties, any amounts or other donations in addition to those to which they are institutionally entitled;"
"The total transparency and guarantee of maximum public information on Members' incomes from all sources."
"In respect of the Ford report:"
"Total opposition to the institutional promotion of lobbying activity even when carried out under the cover of its own regulations;"
"Total opposition to the growing - albeit relative - obstruction of access to parliamentary activity by persons or entities not organised by the European Parliament;"
"Total opposition to the explicit or implicit 'legalisation' of the receipt, by Members of Parliament, of any benefits from lobbies."
"In all honesty I do not really understand the Clochemerle-style goings-on of the last few days, which ended in Mr Nordmann's report being put back on the agenda."
"If this report is approved - even supposing it is tightened up by the most radical of amendments and the Christian-Democrats' amendment is thus rejected - even then we shall have tackled no more than the tiniest tip of the iceberg of Euro-profiteering."
"This is mere window-dressing."
"It is cosmetic surgery designed to suggest that some real action is being taken against Euro-profiteering; profiteering which in recent months and, in contrast to what Mr Wilfried Martens said yesterday, has very properly come under fire from public opinion."
"I note that we have a few hundred honourable Members in attendance today who accepted the offer of a bit of political tourism from the Turkish Government just prior to our vote on the customs union with Turkey."
"I know that those who voted for this customs union were subsequently given a gift by the Turkish Government."
"I see that this report does nothing to change the more than generous salaries and other remunerations paid to us Members of Parliament."
"I see that this report does nothing to change the wholesale squandering by all kinds of European bodies of billions of taxpayers' money, nothing to change the enormous frauds over Community funds, nothing about the scandal of the European Parliament's building in Brussels, which has now cost twice the original estimate and has proved a nice little earner for certain financial groups with links to political parties."
"In short, I shall vote for this report - assuming at least that the amendment of the European People's Party is rejected - but without the slightest enthusiasm and in the knowledge that it is nothing more than a political sop."
"Obviously transparency is vital if citizens are to recognise themselves in their representatives."
"I doubt that this report or any other will make any contribution to this, something that should be a fundamental objective of any politician."
"Transparency can only result from a culture rooted in a concept of participatory and widespread citizenship and the concept of the State at the service of the citizen."
"Otherwise, it would always be a game of illusion."
"That is the case of this report for which I voted out of respect for my colleague and out of solidarity for my group - but without any conviction."
"After considerable hesitation I have decided to vote with the Socialist Group on this report."
"However, I consider Amendment No 7 by the GUE/NGL Group to be quite clearly better than that proposed in the report."
"In Sweden it is perfectly natural that Members' annual declarations to the tax authorities of their incomes and assets should be public documents."
"The same is true with regard to share ownership."
"This should also be the rule for Members of the European Parliament."
"It is wrong that contributions to Members in the form of staff or equipment provided on top of the generous secretarial allowance we receive today from Parliament should be permitted."
"There are now far too many rich lobby organisations which provide Members with 'assistance' with their work."
"It is only reasonable to suppose that this affects Members' attitudes on the substantive issues of the day."
"A lobby organisation does not furnish a Member with staff and material resources out of pure idealism: they consider that they have something to gain from it."
"Information on all the payments made by Parliament's 'Caisse des Députés' to each individual Member should also be public."
"To summarise, I believe that this report could have gone much further in establishing rules on the ethics governing Members' work in Parliament."
"Ford report"
"After considerable hesitation I have decided to vote with the Socialist Group on this report."
"However, I consider Amendment No 4 by the GUE/NGL Group to be quite clearly better than that proposed in the report."
"The report could have explained the conditions under which lobbyists are permitted to work in Parliament even more clearly."
"The report should also have stated that it is extremely important that the people whose names appear in the lobby register should in some way provide assurances that they have not provided and do not intend to provide any kind of benefit, gift or service to Members, officials or assistants."
"Such assurances, where given, should also be public and take the form of documents attached to the register."
"I believe it is of the utmost importance that a proper examination is made of Parliament."
"It is quite clear that MEPs are influenced by the attentions showered upon them today by rich and powerful pressure groups operating at EU level; these attentions include everything from free lunches to help with the services of assistants and gifts."
"Measures must be taken."
"Unfortunately it is apparent to me that this report does not go far enough to deal with the problems in the European Parliament at present concerning the behind the scenes influence of lobby organisations on political decisions."
"BSE"
"Madam President, I should like to speak to the few colleagues who are willing to listen, because that seems to me to be the best way of voicing some feelings that could never be expressed on paper."
"The joint resolution on which we have just voted has links with two other resolutions on the same subject, which were adopted by Parliament on 31 July and 19 December 1988."
"Precisely eight years ago."
"Those two documents called for information on the alarming news concerning cases of bovine spongiform encephalitis."
"The disease, which had already been identified in 1986 by the UK's central veterinary laboratory, was, in 1987, the subject of epidemiological studies that indicated as its cause the use of meal produced from the meat and bones of ruminants."
"It is hard to believe that the results of those studies did not reach the European Union's Veterinary Committee and, hence, the competent commission."
"The outcome was that the problem exploded in all its gravity."
"But what is even more scandalous is the fact that the sensational news was covered up, in 1990, by a high-ranking civil servant, so as not to damage the market."
"The protection of public health and of the consumer was obviously nothing more than an optional item of the Treaties then."
"But even though we have, since then, had the Maastricht Treaty, which has helped to increase awareness in many areas, we are still at stalemate as far as any concrete results are concerned."
"And the situation is still the same, even after the debate and even after the explanations offered by President Santer and Commissioner Fischler."
"Having shrugged off the responsibilities of their predecessors, these two have still not provided sufficient guarantees concerning unequivocal clarification and the punishment of those responsible."
"Indeed, the ease with which unscrupulous traders are still managing to evade the embargo is deeply worrying."
"I therefore believe that this document, together with the other two, of eight years ago, will end up in the book of records of demagogic outrage, lost opportunities and betrayed expectations."
"Madam President, we voted for this resolution, which was drawn up jointly with most of the other groups."
"We should have liked it to be more forceful in some points."
"We should also have welcomed the adoption of the amendments that called quite explicitly for the appointment of a committee of inquiry."
"Nevertheless, we assume that the resolution itself will result in a committee of inquiry being appointed."
"Mr Santini, in his explanation of vote, clearly reiterated why this is necessary."
"We now hope that this afternoon's Conference of Presidents will recommend the establishment of a committee of inquiry and that Parliament will be able to vote on it tomorrow and institute the committee in due form."
"If it is necessary to use this new instrument, which has been available to us since Maastricht, the purpose of its use is not to act against the Commission, be it in the case of BSE or in any other case, but to work with the Commission in its present efforts to identify where faults have occurred with a view to ensuring that both Parliament and the Commission follow a consistent line in future in the implementation of measures against this BSE epidemic."
"Madam President, someone - it was Charles Maurras - said that you should never despair in politics, not even of the European Parliament."
"For those who remember the atmosphere in Brussels three months ago, I recall that no one wanted to know about responsibilities."
"We were the only ones to use the word."
"No civil responsibility for the Demulder brothers who manufactured the contaminated feeds in Britain."
"No political responsibility for the Commission, and not even any political or criminal responsibility for Jacques Delors."
"Today, the matter is resolved."
"Everyone admits that we must, at last, talk about responsibility."
"Parliament has just taken its first step. It is going to admit, I hope, this afternoon, the Commission of Inquiry."
"It still has a second step to take, that of the Philippe de Villiers group, which tabled the motion of censure."
"And finally, as a third step, it has to admit its philosophical responsibility, because before contamination through feeds we had contamination through ideas - the ideas of free trade, the elimination of borders, hyperproductivism."
"The pathogenic agent has been a philosophical one."
"In its handling of the 'mad cow' crisis, the Commission claims that it has always acted, within the limits of its powers and on the bases of the knowledge available to it at the time, in the best interests of public health in Europe."
"Unfortunately, we have extensive evidence to the contrary, evidence that reveals radical malfunctions among the European institutions."
"President Santer told us that the Commission must be judged by its acts and not on hearsay."
"Since that is what he wants, let us talk about acts."
"They show that, in the 'mad cow' crisis, the Commission has always been behindhand and has, if anything, endeavoured to restrain the initiatives of those Member States that were anxious to protect the health of their citizens, before following on willy-nilly in their wake."
"In this context, the chronology of events is revealing."
"Let us take a few examples. It was 18 July 1988 that the United Kingdom decided to prohibit the use of bone meal in the feeding of ruminants; it was on 24 July 1990 that France took a similar decision; but it was not until 27 June 1994 that the European Commission adopted the same measure, although it had had all the necessary powers since the directives of 1989 and 1990."
"The same applies to the imposing of the ban."
"In May 1990, when France wanted to prohibit the importing of certain British beef and veal products, the European Commission threatened to bring proceedings against France before the Court of Justice, as recently recalled by Henri Nallet, the former Minister of Agriculture."
"That action would have been brought on charges of interference with freedom of trade."
"Indeed, the Commission later repeated its error: in February 1996, when five German Länder unilaterally prohibited imports of British beef and veal into their territory, the Commission dared to bring proceedings against the German Government, once again for obstructing the free movement of goods, which seems to be its one and only obsession."
"It was not until the following March, when thirteen Member States in succession prohibited the importing of British beef and veal on their own initiative, that the Commission eventually gave way."
"Consequently, if we judge it by its acts, as its President wants us to, the Commission has to be found guilty."
"It is quite obvious that at every stage it was more concerned with pursuing its utopia of a European super-State with no internal frontiers than with the health and safety of its citizens - exactly as it is still doing today in another area, the area of border controls on individuals."
"There is nothing accidental about this deplorable attitude: on the contrary, it reflects the constant priorities of the Commission, those same priorities which have isolated that institution from public opinion."
"Conversely, it must indeed be recognized that the Member States, more in touch with the concerns of their populations, have at every stage done the right thing, even though the Commission obstructed them on each occasion before eventually trailing along behind."
"This is the context in which we need to see the disclosure of certain internal Commission matters, such as the unacceptable pressures brought to bear on the experts of the Scientific Committee for Food, as disclosed by the press, and the astounding meeting of 12 October 1990, where European officials calmly discussed campaigns of disinformation to deceive the consumers."
"These facts are not anecdotal. They confirm the priority that the Commission attaches to free trade, even at the expense of human health, and its determination to conceal the failures attributable to its misdirection of the movement towards European union."
"These manoeuvres also show that a very worrying state of mind prevails within the Commission: the Commission believes it is the keeper of a higher truth - higher than the nation states, higher than Europe's citizens, and ultimately even higher than democracy."
"This state of mind is all the more dangerous in that the Commission has exorbitant powers, such as the monopoly right of initiative."
"We believe that, as things stand, the European Union can no longer tolerate this situation if it is not to be plunged into the abyss."
"That is why we demand that the intergovernmental conference should at last remind the Commission of its true role, which is a subordinate one."
"BSE is just one disease brought about by a sick agricultural policy, and the Commission should take the opportunity to restructure this policy systematically, so that taxpayers' money is only used in future to support production conditions which we can justify in terms of an environmentally threatened planet, animal welfare and human health."
"At the moment, we are directly encouraging the spread of animal disease through our systems of support."
"We are paying extra for animals to be mistreated, and making extra payments to those who are polluting our groundwater by using more fertilizer, thereby posing a threat to the health of future generations."
"The more that is produced, the more support is triggered."
"The more that goes into surplus stocks, the greater the support."
"The more that is destroyed, the more support we provide."
"The more allergyproducing colourings that are added to conceal the lower quality, and penicillin to increase the shelf life, the more is milked from the EU's coffers."
"We should be calling a halt to this madness and reorganizing things, so that any support only encourages decent goals such as animal welfare, human health, the cleanliness of our planet and farmers' incomes."
"A new agriculture policy would hardly give landowners with 1000 hectares ten times as much subsidy as farmers with 100 hectares, ecological landowners would hardly receive less subsidy than those who use pesticides, and there would no doubt be fewer animal diseases among livestock which are not farmed as intensively as they are today."
"That is what we should all be thinking, now in the era of BSE."
"I voted in favour of the resolution on BSE, because of the assurances given by Commissioner Fischler that full background information would be made available on all measures taken by the Commission and other EU authorities since the early 1980s and because of the further research which has been announced."
"In the interests of public health and of beef as a safe product these investigations must not, however, be an excuse for delaying tactics in the handling of the BSE affair, behind which the Commission can take refuge."
"I would thus ask you to give Parliament a time scale for the management of this affair."
"The scourge of BSE is destroying the beef industry throughout Europe."
"The Florence agreement gives us the opportunity to rebuild the industry but it will take some time yet."
"We must proceed with haste to eradicate BSE from Europe, but we must above all return confidence to the consumer and this will only occur with the progress of time."
"The Commission must bring in immediate new proposals to prepare for what will be a very difficult trading period in the autumn."
"I do not believe we need or require any special committee, the present proposals are sufficient and capable of restoring confidence."
"All such a committee can achieve is further public debate."
"Contrary to the statements made by Mr Santer, scientific information existed from 1990 onwards suggesting first that BSE could cross the species barrier and secondly a connection between Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans and BSE in ruminants."
"As evidence, I cite a neurological textbook dating from 1978, used by French medical students, which was already putting forward strong presumptions of similarity between the illness detected in man and that found in monkeys."
"We all know that medicine is not a cartesian science, like mathematics."
"Experts have never been able to establish any certainties about the risks associated with this illness. But the Commission at the time, under Mr Delors's presidency, should have been the guarantor of consumer health protection and should therefore have taken radical steps from 1990 onwards."
"And today, what has been done?"
"For example, has there been any serious research into possible transmission through milk?"
"You must understand that we can no longer settle for vague replies - we have lost the confidence of our constituents."
"The European Parliament's Commission of Inquiry is an obligatory step. It will have to determine responsibilities at all levels: European institutions, governments, the animal feed industry, etc."
"The Court of Justice will have to impose exemplary penalties, and only then will we be able once again to think in terms of confidence and of relaunching the consumption of beef and veal."
"Madam President, I am amazed that there have been no explanations of vote on the calendar of part-sessions."
"I recall perfectly that there were such explanations last year, and I draw my authority from the case law of President Hänsch, who said just now that the example of what happened last year must be followed in every detail."
"Well, last year there were explanations of vote on the calendar and I want to make one on behalf of my group."
"There was no final vote on the calendar."
"For that reason there are no explanations of vote on the calendar."
"I quite understand, Madam President, but last year the practice was different."
"There were explanations of vote on the calendar, and I cannot see why we are not following the same course this time."
"Madam President, one thing you said was very important."
"There has been, as you say, no final vote on the calendar. But as this item appeared on the agenda, I think that this vote should be taken now."
"And I hereby call for the vote to be taken."
"There has never been a final vote; we have always simply voted on the individual part-sessions."
"The draft calendar was on the table, and amendments may be made to it, but as a general rule there is no final vote."
"Amendments can be tabled."
"If a specific amendment is adopted, the calendar is altered accordingly, but there is no final vote on the calendar in its entirety."
"That concludes voting time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.45 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Mr President, pursuant to Rules 127 and 108 of the Rules of Procedure of Parliament I wish to beg the indulgence of yourself and the House, if possible, to clarify remarks which I made this morning."
"During the lunch break several Members from different groups across the House came to me and gave a different interpretation to what I had said, stating that they had felt personally insulted and aggrieved by my remarks."
"To that end I wish to put on the official record that I intended no insult or aggression to any individual Member within this House and I wish to apologize unreservedly if my remarks were open to a different interpretation."
"My main point was that this Parliament must not only uphold democracy and freedom of speech - it must be seen to do so."
"My analogy with particular types of political movements was an attempt to reinforce my argument that this Parliament and this House in particular must abide by the balance of powers and the different competencies attributed to the different institutions in the European Union."
"I wish to apologize unreservedly to all Members for any personal insult they may have felt."
"Thank you very much, Mr Crawley."
"I am happy to take note of the rectification which you have pointed out and today's minutes will be amended accordingly."
"Progress in CFSP (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on report (A4-0175/96) by Mr Fernández-Albor, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on progress in implementing the common foreign and security policy January-December 1995)."
"Mr President, do not worry because I am not going to deliver a long speech: there is no time for that."
"But, first of all, I would like to say that I am pleased with the declaration which I have just heard because I think that it is wise to amend one's mistakes."
"In respect of the Fernández Albor report, I should like to say on behalf of the group of the party of European Socialists that, in our opinion, this report is a fairly complete and balanced assessment of the European Union's activity in the field of the CFSP in 1995."
"On behalf of my group, I should like to take note of the important declaration made by Mr Fernández Albor at the end of his speech, about his position on the subject of deterrents - something he is right has never been dealt with and I think that we ought to deal with it separately in due time; as far what was said by the Council, I should like to thank, although the President-in-Office of the Council is not here, but he was here this morning, Mr Spring, who read out to us a very complete report of everything that the Union did in 1995 and so far in 1996."
"I was very pleased to hear that."
"We already knew it but it is always good to hear people say that we are doing something."
"In that respect I should like to point out that the Council's enthusiasm for developing the CFSP should also, however, lead it to support not only the considerations given to it in the Intergovernmental Conference but also developing and applying the Treaty;"
"I think we must therefore call seriously upon the Council to support fulfilment of Article 7."
"But we should not only criticise the Council and the Commission and if you allow me Mr President, in the time which remains, I must also criticise Parliament and the presidency, because I had the honour and responsibility of adding to the Fernández Albor report a recommendation which, I know not why, the presidency of the European Parliament has referred to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure."
"What is planned by the Committee on Foreign Affairs is something very simple: what can be done by the Intergovernmental Conference is very good but progress has to be made."
"In order to make progress and to learn from our mistakes and to meet the expectations of our fellow citizens in the European Union, what we have to do is make sure that the CFSP is governed by majority and is included in the Community budget and, as far as possible, that we develop our abilities to apply preventive diplomacy in our own camp."
"Mr President, I have to say that it makes a great impression on me when there are many people in the Chamber, because sitting here there are indeed representatives of nations which have fought each other over hundreds of years."
"Now at least they are sitting down and talking to one another."
"One might well call that progress in terms of security policy."
"And then we read in the newspapers that Europe is moving into a crisis once again."
"It is going from one crisis to another, according to the newspapers, but at least that is better than before, when the countries were going from one war to another."
"All things considered, one may wonder at the fact that Europe has survived."
"Europe, this damsel in distress - and as a Phoenician princess she was indeed a member of the female sex - has been mutilated time and again by its inhabitants, and after the last major war in this part of the world, in 1945, she actually became the lady who is sawn in two, with one half in the East and the other in the West."
"Since then, she has been sewn together again to some extent, but she has not emerged from the experience unscathed."
"New confrontations lie in wait for us on the map."
"The constant task for Europe and the EU must now be to detect and counter new dangerous situations, before they end up as full-scale confrontations such as that in the Balkans."
"An analysis centre such as that envisaged in Brussels is important."
"It could also be called a look-out post or a watch-tower."
"Using such means, we should be better equipped to help stabilize dangerous situations, and certainly to recognize them in time."
"I also see this as the philosophy behind a reinforced common foreign and security policy in the EU, but such a policy cannot just be seen as one of fire protection, designed to extinguish the fire after it has broken out."
"It must also be an instrument for creating a whole culture of preventive security - a culture of security for the old world, for Europe, and that is why I am in favour of working further in that direction through a general, reinforced foreign and security policy which is aimed at the whole of Europe."
"I have to express my reservations regarding one point, however."
"This concerns paragraph 21 of the report, which refers to a common system of deterrence."
"This must be taken to mean nuclear weapons, as I read it, and I do not feel that I can agree to this, at a time when we are constantly trying to do away with nuclear weapons, and when we are talking about nuclear non-proliferation agreements in Geneva and elsewhere."
"Moreover, in the view of the Conservative People's Party, nuclear weapons are a matter for NATO, and that is why I have reservations concerning paragraph 21 - and I am pleased to see that I am not alone, but have the support of my fellow Scandinavians, as I might put it."
"As a little twist in the tail, and with your permission, Mr President, I should like to present the compliments of one of my fellow countrymen."
"He is pursuing a more European policy than most, at least just at the moment."
"His name is Bjarne Riis."
"He is Danish, and he is currently leading the Tour de France ."
"He is riding for a German firm, and his family lives in Luxembourg."
"You can meet him on Friday in Paris, and I wish you all a good time!"
"Mr President, firstly I would like to convey a very warm and hearty welcome to the Irish Minister for European Affairs on this, his first visit to a plenary session of the European Parliament."
"It is not his first visit to Strasbourg - he has been here on quite a number of occasions to prepare the groundwork in a careful way for a successful presidency, which I very much hope and am sure will emerge."
"It is not yet clear if any decisive moves will be taken in 1996 to start serious work on what the Maastricht Treaty describes as the eventual framing of a common defence policy."
"It is not yet clear, for that matter, how far Member States are prepared to go in framing a common security policy."
"Recently, when asked how far I thought certain Members would go in foreign policy, I said I would be convinced of the intentions of colleagues when I saw Members of the Union who hold permanent seats on the Security Council of the United Nations offering one of those seats to Europe."
"That in itself would be a test of how far countries are prepared to go."
"In the field of defence, regardless of what common policy elements are adopted, I believe that Member States will continue to play different roles."
"There is no suggestion to hand at yet, for example, that France or Britain is ready to hand over its independent nuclear deterrent to the WEU or to some new European defence organization."
"For my part I believe that Ireland would be very reluctant to become part of a defence alliance still committed in certain circumstances to the use of nuclear weapons."
"On the contrary, we want to see the dismantling of nuclear institutions which, if they are involved in bad accidents, could certainly bring a lot of ruin and disaster to the Member States of the European Union."
"I believe that we have a duty to contribute to the upholding of peace but I think it legitimate to do so in a manner true to our own traditions."
"The eventual framing of a common defence policy should allow Member States to play different roles - which they will do in any case - and to make different contributions."
"Mr President, we are grateful to the rapporteur who is, moreover, the new chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, for his excellent report."
"He unerringly picks out the weak points and proves once again that the Community structures of the first pillar are far better able to manage foreign policy than the intergovernmental CFSP."
"1995 was a successful year for international agreements but an extremely poor and depressing year for the CFSP."
"The report says that very clearly."
"Both the quality and quantity of common positions were significantly poorer than in 1994."
"Of the ten common initiatives only three were truly new."
"The others were continuations or amended versions of initiatives taken in 1994."
"Full use is not being made of the potential which the common foreign and security policy offers."
"Although the Commission has had joint power of initiative since Maastricht, it made no use of it at all in 1995."
"Even though Maastricht sometimes allowed qualified majority voting in the Council, all decision taken in 1995 were reached on the basis of unanimity."
"Moreover, the Council gave no response at all to the European Parliament's recommendations concerning the common policy and our call for a common defence policy is being totally ignored."
"Disappointing results on the common foreign policy front meant that the Union continued to be unrepresented on the world stage and it meant that the expectations awakened in the public mind were disappointed."
"It remains to be seen how the Union will act over extending the mandate of IFOR to identify and arrest war criminals in former Yugoslavia."
"The IGC must equip the European Union with a proper common policy as promised during the Maastricht summit."
"Mr President, the actions of the EU Member States and the European Union are of course crucial to security in Europe."
"It is also crucial that a real analysis should be conducted of where exactly the insecurity lies as regards threats to security from the rest of the world."
"We can see several such areas of insecurity, such as the situation in the Balkans with the terrible war which has been conducted there and the need for the war criminals to be condemned by a lasting peace."
"We can see that certain countries in Eastern Europe, such as Albania and Belarus, are sliding back into authoritarian forms of government."
"This can even be said to some extent of countries like Croatia."
"We can see enormous social and economic problems on our doorsteps, such as in Ukraine, and in North Africa."
"This situation holds considerable risks for us and these include major security risks which must be dealt with using methods which are truly effective and which are in proportion to the risks."
"Against this background the present report is to some extent a disappointment, because it argues very traditionally along military lines."
"Common defence is discussed."
"Paragraph 21 talks of a common system of deterrence."
"This cannot be interpreted as meaning anything other than a common nuclear defence."
"I do not believe this line of thinking provides any solution to the problem facing us, rather it is what one might call a 'non-solution' ."
"What is needed is stability, social and economic development in Eastern Europe and North Africa."
"Real pan-European cooperation within the UN and within the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe is required."
"This is the only way that cooperation with the countries concerned can be achieved."
"I believe that the military course represents the vestiges of an old Cold War mentality which is actually obsolete and which cannot survive."
"We will therefore support the amendments by the Socialists and the Greens."
"The most important of course concerns paragraph 21."
"I hope that my children and other people's will grow up without the nuclear threat with which we grew up."
"If we review the progress made towards a common foreign policy we see that 1995 was a year of very intense activity, especially as far as treaties and agreements are concerned - I am thinking of MERCOSUR, the Barcelona conference and so on. But if we analyse the instruments which the Union deployed to this end, we have not really moved forward much from European Political Cooperation."
"We have not made use of the opportunities afforded by the Maastricht Treaty."
"Specifically on current events, of which European Union citizens have some expectations - either events on our own doorstep, former Yugoslavia for instance, or further afield, above all the Great Lakes region in Africa - we see that there was a spectacularly effective Union presence, with humanitarian aid, but that sadly the Union was unable to exert any influence in bringing a political solution any closer."
"It is precisely this, a truly constructive presence and the ability to help bring about a political solution, which will give our citizens a positive picture of the Union's foreign policy, which sadly they do not have at the moment."
"On the one hand, of all the reports I have ever seen, there has never yet been one which paid as much attention as this does to preventing conflicts and as far as possible using peaceful means to obtain political solutions."
"In this respect I find the report most encouraging."
"On the other hand there are still of course a number of things which are hard to swallow and paragraph 21 is the hardest of all."
"Primarily because it talks unashamedly of deterrence when it clearly means nuclear power."
"We hope that Mr Sakellariou's amendment will be accepted here because it makes a correction in respect of these proposed deterrent systems, and secondly because it calls for action to be taken on the demand made in Mr Rocard's report for a centre providing analysis and proposals for active involvement."
"Agreement on the feeble achievements of the Common Foreign Security Policy for 1995, disagreement on the necessary steps to correct current practice - this is the dual judgement by the Europe of Nations Group on the Fernández-Albor report."
"We have embarked upon a process which generates both inconsistency at Community level and the undermining of national diplomacy, since the theoretical existence of a common foreign policy tends to provide an alibi for inertia and a desire to reduce national resources."
"How can we prevent this dual process of drift, and return to the straight and narrow?"
"Certainly not by communitizing the CFSP, nor by trying to define a single foreign policy, the only result of which would be the adoption of totally artificial and anti-democratic objectives."
"The establishment of a genuine CFSP would involve, according to the report, and I quote, learning to share sovereignty equitably."
"This expression is an outrageous one: sovereignty is not for sharing - at the very most it may be delegated in some cases when nations so decide."
"If any attempt is made to bring into existence a genuine CFSP, utilizing the community method and calling into question its intergovernmental nature, even though that is enshrined in the Treaties, and setting up a European corps diplomatique which is dependent on the Commission, failure will inevitably result."
"Let those Member States which desire a genuine CFSP start by controlling the galloping inflation afflicting the self-proclaimed embassies of the Commission's external services, while the real embassies, vested with powers and networks which should make them the effective channel for implementing the CFSP, see their resources eroded."
"In order for a genuine CFSP to come into existence, it is necessary to start from the facts and, as a first step, compile an inventory of those interests and needs which are genuinely common."
"Next, it is necessary to measure the degree of political will that exists to defend those interests jointly."
"The result may be a multi-track system, depending on the areas in question."
"Where should this permanent inventory of interests shared by our countries in the field of foreign policy be kept?"
"The institutional device best capable of providing this function will be one that strengthens its intergovernmental character and gives it its full effectiveness while reinforcing the part played by the institutions that represent the wills of the Member States."
"In these fields of foreign and defence policy, which are at the heart of the sovereign powers of the Member States, it is therefore essential to strengthen the role of the Council and of the national Parliaments."
"This reorientation is equally essential in the context of the enlargement of the Union to include nations which certainly have no intention of abdicating the essential powers of sovereignty that they have just recovered at the end of a long ideological winter."
"This is why we have proposed the appointment, within the Council and under its authority, of a permanent VicePresident responsible for the CFSP and possessed of a sufficiently long-term mandate."
"We would also like to see an end to the artificial separation between foreign policy as such and trade policy, which is an essential part of it."
"The minister responsible for the CFSP would therefore also have to be responsible for its trade aspect."
"This adjustment of the institutional balance would need to be one of the priorities of the intergovernmental conference."
"This is a necessary condition if a genuine common foreign policy is eventually to come into being, the sufficient condition naturally being the political will of the Member States, the absence of which cannot, quite obviously, be compensated for by any institutional device at all."
"Mr President, the report on progress on the Common Foreign and Security Policy gives Parliament a welcome opportunity to discuss this important topic."
"A large majority here approves the objective of making the EU's foreign and security policy more effective, to enable us to strengthen peace and security both in our own Continent and throughout the world."
"At the same time, however, we come up against the differences arising from different countries' different historical experiences."
"Three new Member States, Finland, Sweden and Austria, which do not belong to any military alliance, bring a new approach into the Union."
"It has sometimes been hard to explain, for example, that Finland's non-aligned status is not just a way of getting a free ride in security terms but, in our view, increases the security at this time in Northern Europe, and in particular the Baltic."
"Neither must our non aligned status hinder our active involvement in designing and bringing about a common foreign and security policy."
"In life as in politics, clean cut solutions are rarely sensible."
"It is necessary to do what is unavoidable and possible."
"We must beware of solutions which may lead to an increase in tension and a new military division."
"Getting stuck in a traditional military political viewpoint does not benefit us."
"At the same time if the common foreign and security policy is to be made more effective in the EU, particularly in the fields of crisis prevention and crisis management, we must develop cooperation on the basis of the NATO Partnership for Peace Programme."
"I am glad that my own Social Democratic Group uses a wide interpretation of 'security' and understands different approaches."
"I warmly support the amendments made on behalf of Jannis Sakellariou."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we can welcome the fact that Article J.7 of the Treaty on European Union allows us to have an annual debate on the implementation of the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"Unfortunately, our finding is that the implementation is not entirely satisfactory."
"First, we can recall with pleasure the fact that the Union has adjusted the balance of its medium-term collaboration with Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean, and that it has signed agreements with Morocco, Tunisia, Israel, South America and certain Asian countries. We can recognize a degree of inefficiency in the negotiations on the former Yugoslavia, where America still holds the diplomatic initiative, with Russia, where the Chechen problem remains untouched, and with Turkey, the Middle East, Burundi and Rwanda."
"All of these, as the rapporteur emphasizes, and I congratulate him on his carefully documented work, result from the fact that declarations by the Council do not involve any specific decision by the Member States."
"The fact is that there is no genuine political will in the Union within this area, and that is linked to our permanent vacillation as to what we want our Europe to become!"
"Secondly, as far as common security is concerned, the only decisive action is still the prohibition of antipersonnel mines, while in the field of human rights, we, personally, would prefer to see the European Union doing more about the constantly threatened security of its own citizens before worrying about what is happening outside its common borders."
"In conclusion, we can only deplore the way our Parliament is disregarded by the Council, which makes no political response to our recommendations and supplies us with no regular written information - something which is essential for better cooperation between institutions and a better definition of a genuine common policy with clearly defined objectives."
"Mr President, it is a little late in the day to be discussing progress in the Common Foreign and Security Policy more than six months after the end of 1995."
"However, have we made any progress in this field and, if so, what have we achieved?"
"The customs union with Turkey is a partial victory for the European Union because some of the conditions we set for approval were met."
"The human rights situation in the country is still far from satisfactory, however."
"The human rights clauses in international agreements are a major step in the right direction but they will continue to be worth no more than the paper they are written on if they do not result in practical action."
"We in the European Parliament can certainly congratulate ourselves on our commitment to the reconstruction work in the former Yugoslavia."
"However, should it not have been the object of CFSP to prevent the human tragedies which also occurred in 1995?"
"You only have to think of Sarajevo, Srebrenica, Krajina and many other places."
"CFSP must entail preventive action, not just a response after the event to assuage our guilty consciences."
"Experience shows therefore that what is really needed is an extension of the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"In my view NATO will continue in the future too to form the basis of our continent's military security - and this will include a US presence."
"Of course consideration needs to be given to the shape we, with the help of the WEU, will give to the European pillar."
"In any event, there must not be still more bureaucracy to demonstrate our ability to manage by ourselves."
"It is important that in the future too NATO should move more in the direction of crisis management, which might perhaps enable those countries, including mine, which are at present militarily nonaligned to join in due course."
"I should also like to say that IFOR is an example of how NATO countries and non-aligned countries can together carry out a military operation in an atmosphere of excellent mutual understanding."
"Mr President, despite certain reservations we welcome the content of these documents, with which we can identify to a great extent."
"For that reason we also regret the minimal progress that has been made in developing our common foreign and security policy, especially in the sphere of defence policy."
"For the same reason we especially regret the indecision of the Austrian Federal Government in this matter, because it ought to have recognized long ago that neutrality has no place in a community such as the EU and results in a free ride for some Member States, reflecting a lack of solidarity."
"We are not happy with the practice of the European Parliament, in which it also indulges to some extent in this report, of putting forward too many utopian demands and resolutions that bear little relation to realistic foreign policy, which is primarily a means of asserting and safeguarding Community interests rather than an instrument for improving the world."
"In the domain of CFSP, we are more in favour of restricting ourselves to a few priority areas of particular importance instead of pursuing a watering-can policy, which may be visible everywhere but is not effective in any single area."
"Mr President, my Group and I also compliment Mr Fernández-Albor on his report."
"It is a competent analysis and shows that the Union and above all the Commission were very active last year in a wide range of areas."
"The rapporteur's account is in part highly critical of the CFSP and it covers the period 1995 when the Union showed itself incapable of taking a lead over the situation in former Yugoslavia."
"That role was left more or less to the United States."
"I think that did little to imprint the Union's identity on the minds of the rest of the world, an identity which is largely recognizable only to citizens of the EU."
"The rapporteur rightly notes that a lot has been said on a lot of subjects, but that little has been done in the area of security."
"Unfortunately the rapporteur thinks that only a number of giant steps will get us out of this situation."
"Only if the Union has a common defence policy and a common system of deterrence can it develop a true CFSP. That includes too a kind of obligation to provide assistance."
"He also wants a European Civil Peace Corps."
"We think he should have mooted this peace corps earlier."
"A Union which has the decision-making machinery and the capacity to conduct peace-keeping missions is already one step ahead."
"This, rather than far more ambitious objectives like a common system of collective defence, should be the focus of attention in the immediate future."
"Priority should be given to an IFOR-style peace-keeping force of the kind we have in Bosnia and to a EU planning and analysis unit."
"The Union may perhaps be put to the test next year in Bosnia."
"I think, for example, that NATO's Berlin declaration offers a good starting point on which to build a development of this kind."
"My view is that defence cooperation should be devised primarily on an empirical basis along the lines I suggested and not by formulating objectives which will prove unattainable in the years ahead."
"Mr President, without oversimplifying things, a judgement of common foreign and defence policy could be summarized thus: we do what we can, but not always."
"The boundaries within which CFSP can operate are necessarily tight and prevent us from speaking of any real foreign policy, just as the ambiguous relationship between the European Union and WEU prevents us from speaking of any real common defence policy."
"To be able to do either, there would have needed to be a real defence community, but plans for that fell by the wayside some forty years ago."
"So, we must now content ourselves with taking potluck, and the pot must be pretty empty if foreign policy is hopelessly inconsistent, or downright non-existent, at times of dire crisis or when a deterrent is needed."
"Harmonization of the individual Member States' foreign policies is undoubtedly a laudable expression of good will, but, when it comes to major issues, it comes to a grinding halt, blocked by the disparate interests of the individual Member States."
"WEU, which could be one of the strong points of a hoped-for foreign policy, is little more than a paper army and, what is more, not all Member States of the Union are members of WEU."
"How can we implement a CFSP that is in danger of remaining a non-entity without a common defence policy and a common system of deterrence?"
"How can we implement a foreign policy when the concept of European sovereignty is clearly absent?"
"It is on the answers to these questions that the future of Europe depends, if Europe is to be more than a monetary union, which is already difficult enough and is most certainly important, but like a single swallow it does not make a summer."
"In the meantime, I call upon the Commission to take courage and seize all the opportunities offered by the Treaty - something it has not always done because, in its timidity, it is aware of national governments' relentless watch on its powers."
"But forcing the issue is the duty of any body called upon not to be the agent of national governments' will but to serve as part of an embryonic European government - for embryos can and must grow if they are not to be still-born."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to compliment the chairman of the committee and my dear friend, Mr Fernández-Albor, on the well drafted report he has presented us with."
"This report deserves our full agreement since it refers to the significant development of the conventional activity of the European Union in foreign policy and at the same time, unfortunately, with reason, it refers to the fact that after more than two years we have got no further in defining the instruments of a Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"My agreement with this report is strengthened since it refers to and emphasises the fact that, without a common defence policy, the European Union cannot have a strong, effective and credible foreign policy."
"I should like to make a short but special reference to paragraphs 20 and 21 of the report."
"A common defence policy, which is the very basis of an external policy of the European Union, calls for universal active cooperation by all Member States of the Union."
"Neutrality or non-participation by certain Member States are positions which might be pleasing for a time and politically convenient, as well as economically comfortable, but they are far away from the principle of solidarity which cannot not only be applied to economics and which is now the very basis of the Union."
"I should like to end with a slight dig at the report."
"Although it is fashionable to forget and even condemn our allies in certain circumstances I think that, since it deals with defence policy, it might be right and proper for this report to spare a small word for our allies."
"It seems that we only remember our allies when our own house is at risk."
"This report has two sides to it."
"It can be unreservedly supported in its criticism of the shortcomings, restrictions and limited effectiveness of the Union's common foreign-policy stance."
"As far as my own country is concerned, I can say that our neutrality has neither prevented us from participating in any previous initiatives nor will it prevent us from not only actively supporting but also helping to shape this common international policy of the Union."
"But there is also a second side to this report, and that is the presentation of its strategy for defence policy, with which I - and no doubt others too - have certain problems. Talk of Europe as a power with a deterrent capacity sends a shiver down the spine, not of the potential enemies of Europe but of the peoples of this continent."
"I consider it wrong to want to make the Union into a nuclear power."
"The potential strength of this Union is a broad security partnership with those States that are not yet Members or that may never become Members."
"Austria, with its neutrality, has no problem at all in participating in the dynamic further development of the Union."
"But a warning needs to be voiced in good time against any development that could ultimately result in this whole Union also assuming the status of a military pact."
"Mr President, I do not know whether Mr Konečny was with us when the rapporteur, Mr Fernández-Albor, was speaking, because he expressly pointed out that the report did not relate to nuclear weapons, and for that reason I can give it my wholehearted support."
"One thing is clear, namely that Europe must have the means of acting in a timely and effective manner to prevent future crises."
"Nothing has done more to harm the European ideal and the good name of the European Union than the lack of such means in the case of the former Yugoslavia."
"That is why this shortcoming has to be rectified, which is one of the paramount tasks of our foreign and security policy."
"In so doing, we must not create a situation in which a qualified majority can be prevented by a minority from engaging in peacekeeping and peacemaking operations."
"That implies, of course, and cannot but imply, that the outvoted minority, whose parliaments and governments have good reason for being unable to participate in such operations, cannot for their part be compelled to assign troops to the task force."
"This, needless to say, does not affect the obligation to show solidarity with the other Member States of the EU: any aggression against the Union is tantamount to an attack on each and every Member State."
"The solidarity obligation is necessary here and must also be incorporated into the Treaty on European Union."
"The delegation of the Austrian People's Party therefore supports the motion for a resolution, and we also believe that we are thereby fulfilling the terms of the declaration made by Austria on its accession, in which it expressed its interest in a common foreign and security policy as well as its willingness to cooperate in the creation of this common foreign, security and defence policy."
"The present coalition Government of Socialists and People's Party have stated in their working agreement that we as Austrians intend to be among the leading proponents of further development of the Union."
"That applies to the Schengen Agreement, it applies to economic and monetary union and it applies to the common foreign and security policy, because here too we want to play a creative role and because we see this as the great advantage of our membership, which we want to be an active and cooperative contribution with all our partners to the development of Europe."
"Mr President, in my opinion Mr Fernández-Albor's opinion expresses an outdated, cold war thinking."
"It is based on threats which belong to the past, and it seeks security solutions which cannot possibly promote security."
"Europe's current fundamental security structures are fulfilling their tasks well."
"One positive feature of these structures is the neutrality of four EU Member States."
"There is no military threat on the horizon which would be a reason for the European Union changing into a military alliance by uniting with the Western European Union."
"NATO and the WEU as at present constituted make a positive contribution to the security of Europe as a whole."
"However, we have before us the question of the enlargement of NATO."
"We must of course respect the right of every European State to apply for membership of NATO and NATO's right to accept new members."
"On the other hand we must ask whether there is a real need for the enlargement of NATO and whether it would increase the security of Europe."
"Would joining NATO really strengthen a State's security?"
"What effect would such enlargement have on those States which remain outside?"
"Would it increase or weaken Europe's military stability?"
"In my opinion, Europe's security can best be promoted by preserving the current basic military security structures and by developing pan-European and transatlantic security cooperation on that basis within the framework of the OSCE, the NACC and the Partnership for Peace."
"On the other hand it is important to develop peaceful cooperation which will promote stability and democracy in the Eastern parts of our Continent."
"The European Union must tighten its cooperation with all the States of Europe and must promote pan-European integration by exploiting, inter alia , the possibilities offered by the OSCE and the Council of Europe."
"The EU's common foreign and security policy must be developed but it must be based on unanimity among the Member States, and it must respect the differing security policy choices of the Member States."
"Mr President, broadly speaking, I welcome this report, which is an improvement on last year's attempt by Parliament to build elaborate and ambitious castles in the air."
"Mr Fernández-Albor has stuck much more closely to the practicalities of the issue and, as a consequence, has made some telling points."
"Even this report, however, sometimes slips into discussing the grandiose and the theoretical."
"Foreign and security policy is the most sensitive area of national sovereignty."
"We have, therefore, to learn to walk before we can run and we should be getting the basics right before we start constructing more ambitious models."
"Firstly, we need a clear understanding of the purpose and objectives of a common foreign policy."
"At the moment we have 15 national foreign policies."
"Recently a German Council official told me that his Brussels office might as well be in Bonn, as his main point of reference was the German Foreign Ministry."
"Secondly, we need a proper mechanism for day-to-day decision-making in foreign policy."
"Too often in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy we ask the CFSP secretariat what the EU stance on a particular situation is, only to be told that we do not have one because the Foreign Ministers have not met yet to discuss the matter."
"I am afraid crises do not wait for the convenience of EU Foreign Ministers."
"No wonder Richard Holbrooke recently boasted that Europe slept while President Clinton resolved a particular European crisis."
"Thirdly, the current chaotic situation regarding finance must end."
"Operational expenditure must come from the Community budget."
"Unfortunately, the Fernández-Albor report's biggest weakness is the call for a common deterrent."
"This is, frankly, nonsense."
"Just when we are coming to grips with the changing security demands of the post-Cold War world; just when people are beginning to understand that security is as much about economic and political stability as diplomatic and military action; just when the Petersberg tasks on humanitarian aid and peacekeeping were agreed as an objective of our security policy, Parliament comes along with a demand for a common deterrent."
"That is not the way to build a new security framework for the new European situation."
"Mr President, too many dysfunctions, too many discords, too many repeated false notes!"
"CSFP is still an unfinished symphony, and as such it is much more a source of disappointments and frustrations than of satisfaction or pride."
"In 1995, Richard Holbrook took charge of things in the former Yugoslavia, showing the way in terms of determination and high profile."
"He also derided the Europeans to the extent that some have seen it as a model of the leadership which Europe should be providing in its own backyard."
"Clearly, the suggestions regarding a Mr CFSP take their cue from this American example."
"The fact that Mr Holbrook has been back on duty since yesterday should really give us something to think about."
"The CFSP is certainly one of the areas to which public opinion is - and has been made - highly sensitive."
"It expects an affirmation of Europe's international role, greater resolution and more capacity for action."
"But his expectations are often disappointed, because - apart from a declaratory diplomacy which usually trails along behind the course of events - we too frequently offer a distressing spectacle of endless domestic strife and paralysis when it comes to action."
"Failing some radical and sudden improvement in our performance, it would surely be appropriate to change the title of our report: rather than referring to progress in implementing the CSFP, it would I fear be more appropriate to place the emphasis for the present on the problems of getting it started."
"And yet we know the answers. First, we should equip ourselves with a common analytical and planning capability."
"Next, it would be valuable to take more advantage of political and financial solidarity."
"And finally, we absolutely must improve the decision-taking mechanisms so as to increase the prospects of reaching agreement more frequently on joint action before it is too late."
"In short, the time has come to acquire the resources to match up to our ambitions!"
"Mr President, progress on implementing the CFSP has been very meagre. In fact, in the public mind the European Union does not have a common foreign policy."
"It is indicative that the Council has not made use of the instruments and mechanisms specifically provided for in the Maastricht Treaty."
"In the last year it has adopted only three common measures and five common positions, and the Commission has not exercised its right of initiative at all."
"The Council has, in addition, ignored recommendations from the European Parliament on crucial matters including the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, Turkey, in relation to which the European Union continues to display insufficient sensitivity on human rights issues, and on the Cyprus question, on which - despite the European Parliament's resolution - the Council is essentially refusing to undertake an initiative in the form of joint actions which could help towards a solution of the problem."
"The European Union must develop a coherent foreign policy of its own if it is truly serious about welcoming in new members and about playing a viable role on the world stage."
"It must have a foreign policy which can contribute to the promotion of peace, stability and security and respect for human rights, international law and the territorial integrity of the Member States."
"A policy which can set a new standard in international relations."
"To that end it will be necessary to put in place the requisite institutions and mechanisms, and above all else, to elicit the requisite political will from the leaderships of the Member States, and from the leaderships of the powerful Member States in particular, and to ensure that those states understand that they cannot play a role by themselves on the world stage in disregard of the other partners or work for the creation of a controlling group of just a few countries for the purpose of imposing their views and positions on the remainder."
"The IGC which is now in progress is a challenge. It offers the European Union an opportunity to make progress on the CFSP and, at the same time, to formulate a security and defence policy and strengthen its supranational institutions."
"In concluding, Mr President, I wish to say that the Fernández Albor report gives a clear presentation of the situation and offers a number of interesting ideas and proposals."
"Mr President, even the Roman Cicero knew, two thousand years ago, that there are two ways of resolving conflicts: through negotiations or through force."
"As he said, the former is intended for people, the second for wild beasts."
"This piece of wisdom still applies today."
"How we resolve our conflicts reflects how far we have come in our development, as people where we choose negotiation, as wild beasts where we choose force."
"In shaping Europe's security policy for the next century we must learn from this."
"We must learn from history, not repeat it."
"Conflict resolution, international relations, economic relations, trade, aid and cooperation with neighbouring countries are much more important parts of a common security policy than a common military defence, that is to say we must resolve conflicts rather than bring military might to bear on them."
"The Cold War resulted in insane nuclear armament, which could annihilate all of humanity."
"Nuclear arms have reduced, not increased, security for all countries, including those with their own nuclear arms."
"Now, in a new era, with the Cold War over, we have the chance to construct a security policy without nuclear weapons."
"To suggest in 1996 that a security policy for tomorrow should depend on nuclear deterrence is not only an obsolete way of thinking but also extremely dangerous."
"The proposal in paragraph 21 of the Fernández-Albor report must be rejected and replaced by Amendment No 10."
"The Socialist Group considers this to be so important that we will vote against the report as a whole if our Amendment No 10 is not adopted."
"It is a common peace policy with a common system for the prevention of conflicts that we need in Europe."
"It is time for a security policy based on negotiations and not on force."
"Mr President, this report, in so far as it is a survey of the progress achieved to date in implementing a common foreign and security policy, has much to commend it."
"It covers a whole range of the Union's activities in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, the Middle East, the Mediterranean, Africa, Latin America and elsewhere."
"The report underlines the importance of common action on human, social and democratic rights and it emphasizes the central objective of peace."
"It underwrites values such as the idea of the democratic welfare state and the need for common action to eliminate anti-personnel mines."
"It is therefore very unfortunate that the report also puts forward proposals for a common defence policy which are not acceptable in a number of Member States and go further than public opinion would be prepared to support. Without widespread public support across the Union, such a policy would not be viable, above all at times of stress and strain."
"We also have to consider the kind of Europe we wish to build."
"We should not be seeking to create a new nuclear power in the world, but paragraph 21 declares that without a common defence policy and a common system of deterrence the Union will never be able to implement a common foreign and security policy."
"At a time when we are pressing for support for the principle of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons it will give the impression that we are in favour of creating a nuclear Europe while objecting to others doing likewise in their areas."
"This would not only undermine our credibility and detract from our standing in the world as a force for peace and progress by peaceful means but it would in fact make very much more difficult achieving the objectives we have in view."
"Unless paragraph 21 is changed or withdrawn, and there is a Socialist Group amendment, the report as a whole would be quite unacceptable despite the very positive proposals which it contains, I hope the rapporteur will bear this very much in mind."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is a good report."
"It pays a just tribute to a number of positive achievements, rightly reminds us that all this falls very short of convincing public opinion that there is some substance behind the terms 'foreign policy' and 'common security' , and rigorously criticises the serious conceptual, institutional, political and practical inadequacies reflected by the fact that our handful of common positions and joint actions are nowhere near sufficient to give evidence of a genuine common foreign and security policy."
"I myself, together with the French socialist delegation on whose behalf I speak, sincerely agree with this general view of things, which is why we are preparing to vote in favour of this report."
"There is a political problem, however, reflected by problems with wording and with voting on two amendments."
"Our rapporteur is inspired by a European ardour which some would call federalist, others integrationist, and I myself simply vigorous, because it is consistent."
"Basically, then, I share this enthusiasm, but our rapporteur allows himself to be carried away by it in two areas: that of vocabulary, as regards both courtesy and diplomatic caution in his report, and that of the conceptual relationship linking foreign policy, security and defence."
"As to the first point, the fact that some governments and - as we have just heard -some national public opinions in the Union do not in fact propose to take part in the implementation of an effectively common foreign policy should prompt us to understand them and endorse their awareness of strategic and diplomatic issues that concern us all, rather than harassing or denouncing them."
"I regret, in Article 9, the adjective 'discouraging' ."
"The phrase in Article 20 to the effect that there is a lack of the necessary political will for integration among certain Member States is more likely to be perceived as aggressive than as an attempt at persuasion."
"The rejection by some Member States is explained by the nature of the national security consensus in each one of them."
"Neutrality here, absolute submission to NATO as the sole guarantor there, independent nuclear deterrence somewhere else."
"For my part, I believe that nuclear deterrence is entirely meaningless since the disappearance of the communist threat, that neutrality is entirely meaningless in a fully interdependent world, and that the dominant reference to the Atlantic Alliance is totally inadequate when the dangers threatening us are primarily linked to the geographical spread of regional conflicts, conflicts that exist everywhere in and around Europe while they affect America very little."
"We would therefore lighten the burden on America by being more aware of these things in Europe."
"Understanding that is the key to our future common foreign and security policy."
"Let us allow everyone time to come to appreciate this point."
"The second consequence of our rapporteur's ardour is that he talks about defence rather than security."
"This is perceived in some quarters as a provocation."
"In Articles 9 and 21, the concern expressed is for a common vision of the security of foreign policy."
"The definition of institutions, procedures and means of defence can only be a consequence of it."
"I must say to the rapporteur that this is an area that calls for persuasion and conviction, and the necessary time to achieve them."
"Denunciation is no help at all."
"Finally, the same enthusiasm leads the rapporteur to speak of a common system of deterrence."
"You have all heard this, you heard it just now."
"It is not within our power to dispel the common but incorrect notion that deterrence means nuclear deterrence."
"Nuclear deterrence is obsolete, and does not arise here."
"The first purpose of any defensive force is to prevent the other party from attacking, even by conventional means - that is what deterrence means - and only to defeat him if that fails."
"But we must dispense with this word, which is unfortunate as regards what it means in non-nuclear terms."
"I would prefer this renunciation not to dispel the idea that we have a common need to serve the United Nations' peace-keeping missions, and to begin, at least, to equip ourselves with the intellectual resources of common security thinking before we draw any conclusions from it about defence."
"Mr Fernández-Albor, you need to pursue a more educational line, even though your European ardour agrees with us."
"Mr President, the excellent report presented by Mr Fernández Albor on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs might give rise to some specific comments and a few examples."
"First of all, we now have a notorious example, that of the partial withdrawal of the Helms-Burton Act by President Clinton, which is undoubtedly a consequence of a common external policy exercised - and this is rare - by the European Union through the Council."
"That means I can only point out the important function played by the Spanish Foreign Affairs Minister, something which is normal given the very special links between Spain and Cuba, links of a historic, cultural, linguistic and human nature."
"Therefore, I was very much surprised this morning to hear a representative of the Spanish Socialist group criticising Mr Matutes for having received Mr Mas Canosa."
"It must be pointed out to the honourable Member that Mr Mas Canosa was also received by the former Prime Minister, Mr Gonzalez, and by the former Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Solana, who is now Secretary General of NATO."
"The only difference is that they received him in secret and not in the transparency which we have always tried to apply to our own external policies."
"This just shows that losing power also produces a certain loss of sense of humour in certain political parties."
"The second practical observation refers, on the contrary, to failure rather than success."
"In the first case this was a sign of the success of diplomacy based on economic reasons, the defence of legitimate interests, without any doubt, but perhaps slightly forgetting the dramatic situation which the Cuban people are experiencing."
"But in the second practical case to which I wish to refer, it is surprising and sad for everyone that Mr Holbrooke should have to come back and sort out a situation which was supposedly dealt with at Dayton through US mediation."
"This says nothing against Mr Bildt, but does seem to be clear proof that there is not sufficient solidarity in our foreign policy."
"Finally, and here I direct myself again to the Irish presidency, I should like to call upon that admirable country to make progress in a policy for setting up genuine common diplomacy."
"This is not only a matter of the external representation provided by the generally very efficient offices of the European Commission, but a genuine integration of diplomatic services."
"The British and Germans have just made some steps in that direction by exchanging diplomatic employees."
"But once again, as I have travelled around the world I have asked myself and now I am saying it before the European Parliament whether it might not be possible to consider setting up joint embassies, in other words bringing together our diplomatic services so that we can be represented jointly in other countries."
"Therefore a country like Ireland, which has such an admirable tradition but which naturally cannot have diplomatic representation in every country in the world, might take steps which perhaps nations with bigger populations would not, on the other hand, be able to take."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the only consistency to be found in the Union's foreign policy is its fairly automatic support for the policies conceived by the American superpower."
"What, for example, is the European Union's grand policy for dealing with the historic movement represented by the growth of Islam to the south and east of the Mediterranean?"
"A single incident will show how blind we are: the incident of customs union with Turkey."
"On this matter, we prefer to obey diplomatic instructions from beyond the Atlantic rather than think about the geopolitical and geocultural situation of the great Turkish state, which demonstrates that in fact it will never be European."
"Another example: what is the European Union's grand policy towards the great eastern power of Russia?"
"Russia is a great independent nation which deserves a genuine spirit of partnership, because Russia is an essential element in the establishment of a balanced multipolar world."
"It is not right that everything should be subordinated to a single world power."
"That is precisely the type of thinking which the European Union refuses to adopt."
"And that is why the results cannot be satisfactory."
"Mr President, following the detailed presentation by the Council President Minister Spring this afternoon, I offer a number of brief comments of my own."
"First of all the Commission too must compliment the rapporteur on his extremely clear report, which I have already had the privilege of discussing on a previous occasion with the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy."
"It is perfectly clear that the rapporteur too appreciates that when we speak of the common foreign and security policy we may do so in a very broad sense and also in a narrow sense."
"In the broad sense he points very clearly to a number of exceptionally good initiatives and activities of external policy pursued by the Union over the past year in the conclusion of agreements with a large number of third countries and regions which are politically, strategically and economically of great significance and which contribute to stability and security."
"I am thinking not least of our relations with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe which have been further widened and deepened and which are ultimately aimed not only at those countries' accession and full membership but also at furthering the security, stability and development of those countries."
"The Commission has recorded its views on the shortcomings of the common foreign and security policy, which are readily admitted and pointed out, in the report submitted to the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Minister Spring has also discussed them in detail this afternoon."
"So I will not go over them again, even the main points, since they are already familiar to you."
"I hope at any rate that the intensive discussion now going on in the Intergovernmental Conference on our policy under the second pillar will prove successful."
"Today's in-depth debate has shown once again how much this is needed and how much agreement there in fact is about our current machinery and perhaps also our political will is not great enough to give the European Union a political weight on the world scene which matches the huge economic weight it carries."
"Looking at the progress of the Intergovernmental Conference I think in all honesty that we have to admit that positions held for some time have relaxed further and that the time is now beginning for real talks between the delegations."
"We are not without hope on this, especially as it is fair to say, as far for example as the preparation of foreign policy decisions is concerned, that there has already been movement towards consensus on the setting up of a multidisciplinary preparatory body which will further facilitate decision-making."
"Ideas are also developing further on the visible external representation of the Union in international policy."
"More encouraging still is the clear impression, certainly following the NATO conference in Berlin, that progress is being made towards a common defence policy."
"In response to the honourable Members who expressed concern that this was going too far I would say that it was already agreed at the time of Maastricht that a common defence policy would be devised, the exact form and content to be determined later."
"But I very much agree with those who have said that we should not hamper a debate of this kind by getting so far ahead of ourselves and talking about things like nuclear deterrence, whether or not that was intended in the Fernández-Albor report, that we forget that in addition to the more common diplomacy which we pursue we also need a degree of muscle behind that policy which we can flex in crisis situations or in order to prevent crisis situations."
"We fervently hope that there will be further concrete acknowledgement of this need and that decisions on it will be taken at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The European Commission at any rate will continue to play its part."
"Naturally, it has no powers of its own in the area of defence, but is very closely associated with the Union's common foreign and security policy and also has a joint power of initiative which it will use."
"We hope that in the year ahead, that is to say the remaining period of the Intergovernmental Conference, there will be constructive discussion of this with the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, under the chairmanship of Mr Fernández-Albor, and with the plenary too."
"This is enormously important to the future of the Union."
"Thank you very much, Mr Mitchell."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Broad economic policy guidelines"
"The next item is the statement by the Council on the broad economic policy guidelines of the Member States and the Community."
"Mr President, I am very pleased to be here today, as President-inOffice of the Economic and Finance Ministers of the European Union, to address Parliament on the broad economic policy guidelines of the Member States."
"As you know, the Council adopted, at a session on 8 July, a recommendation setting out the broad guidelines on the economic policies of the Member States of the Community."
"I wish to discuss in some detail the strategy underlying these guidelines and to deal with some of the concerns expressed by some Members of Parliament in relation to them."
"The guidelines call for more than just a stable, macroeconomic framework in the progress towards EMU: they incorporate an explicit strategy for sustained growth and increased employment to be achieved through the key areas of monetary policy, budgetary policy, labour market policy and structural adjustment."
"The core of the broad guideline strategy may be summed up in the following statement in the text: ' High and sustained non-inflationary economic growth over the medium term is essential to reduce significantly and durably the Community's unacceptably high level of unemployment and to combat the spread of social exclusion.'"
"The guidelines incorporate a strategy which aims at generating a sustainable increase in both the rate of economic growth and its employment content."
"The strategy recommended in the guidelines essentially consists of three interrelated elements."
"The first major element is the creation and maintenance of a stable macroeconomic framework."
"Monetary stability and sound public finances are preconditions for growth."
"That is why we continue to underline the importance of a stabilityoriented monetary policy and budgetary consolidation."
"Failure to achieve convergence on low inflation among Member States presents a major obstacle to growth because it overburdens monetary policy by necessitating higher interest rates to dampen inflation."
"Higher interest rates, in turn, damage consumer and business confidence with adverse implications for private consumption, investment, output and employment."
"As the guidelines rightly point out, budgetary consolidation does not just mean budgetary cuts, but also a redirection of government spending towards investment and human capital."
"I will return to this point."
"The second major element in the strategy concerns actions to raise permanently the Union's potential rate of growth and to improve its competitive position both in its domestic and foreign markets."
"The guidelines recognize that to achieve and sustain a high rate of economic growth, a significant rise in investment is required."
"To increase investment significantly requires improved confidence, structural policies and wage moderation."
"In addition, wage moderation will help improve the competitiveness of the Union economy which, in turn, will increase the Union's capacity to create sustainable jobs."
"As I indicated earlier, this means that budgetary consolidation efforts are not just needed for achieving sustainable public finances, they are also needed for improving the prospects for employment-creating investment by avoiding the crowding-out of the private sector, that is by avoiding the absorption of private savings by governments' current spending."
"Budgetary consolidation efforts will also restore confidence in the financial markets and exert downward pressure on interest rates on a sustainable basis."
"This, in turn, contributes to increased investment profitability, enhanced growth potential and an easing of the debt service burden on Member States."
"The guidelines also recommend redirecting government spending, to the greatest extent possible, towards productive activities such as investment in infrastructure, human capital and active labour market measures while not endangering the necessary reduction in budget deficits."
"The guidelines recognize also, however, that in order to tackle unemployment effectively, and particularly the hard core of structural unemployment, sound macroeconomic policies must be supplemented by structural policies aimed at increasing the efficiency and employment-creating features of both the product and labour markets."
"With this in mind, and to increase the employment content of growth, the guidelines draw on the recommendations of the Commission's White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment."
"The most important elements in this strategy are measures to reduce the barriers to employing people, active labour market policies and structural changes in the functioning of product and labour markets."
"In the third element of the strategy the guidelines recommend active policies towards employment."
"The necessity for a broad range of labour market reforms has been stressed by the Council."
"What we have in mind is an improvement in occupational and regional mobility and the efficiency of employment services."
"Moreover, the Council considers as vital the reform of the educational systems so as to equip more people with the skills required in today's labour market."
"But the Council has also made it clear that the labour market alone should not have to bear the burden of adaptation."
"We need more efficient product and services markets in order to create investment opportunities."
"We all have an important role to play in tackling our serious level of unemployment."
"In its report to the European Council in Florence the Commission said that it would intensify its dialogue with the social partners on macroeconomic issues."
"I now propose to turn to some of the areas where concern has been expressed by Parliament in relation to the guidelines."
"I believe that Parliament and the Council agree completely that sustained, non-inflationary economic growth is essential to tackle the scourge of unemployment and the social exclusion which accompanies it."
"Employment is our joint concern and is, of course, the concern of the citizens of the European Community."
"Your request to refer to Articles 2 and 105 of the Treaty is more a question of style than a question of substance."
"I can assure you that the Council supports fully those two fundamental provisions of the Treaty dealing with the general objectives of European Union policy and the tasks of a European Central Bank."
"A reference to the transEuropean networks - the TENs - in the context of the guidelines has been a matter of contention between the Member States."
"That is why the Council could not take it up in the guidelines."
"However, on 8 July, the Council agreed to set up a high-level working party appointed by ministers and assisted by the Commission and the European Investment Bank to examine this contentious issue and to make recommendations before the informal Ecofin Council in Dublin in September."
"I have the impression that the concrete policy actions suggested in the resolution, adopted by Parliament on 19 June are quite similar in substance to those the Council recommends."
"Reading very carefully the European Parliament's resolution on the broad economic guidelines from 19 June, I find that nearly all of the policy actions recommended by you are in line with the text and the spirit of the Council's guidelines for 1994, 1995 and 1996 and indeed, the Essen and Madrid conclusions on employment policies."
"These are: firstly, reorienting public expenditure towards investment; secondly, creating a favourable environment for job-creating companies; thirdly, analysing best practices in the labour market and education policies of all of the individual Member States."
"The commitment of Member States to tackling unemployment led to the adoption of a multi-annual employment programme at national level."
"The implementation of the Madrid recommendations and the monitoring of the multiannual programmes will form the basis of the follow-up in 1996 of the employment policy of the Union."
"Unfortunately I have to share the view of the European Parliament that implementation of the guidelines by Member States has been slow."
"I share your impatience at the pace of progress and I intend to strive to increase it."
"However, it is possible that the effects of some positive measures may have been temporarily concealed by the slow-down in economic growth."
"It is also a fact that certain measures will take some time to show positive results."
"In my view, the approach taken in the guidelines since 1994 is still valid."
"But I recognise that we have a serious problem about its implementation."
"I think the implementation has been slow for two main reasons."
"Firstly, because certain structural measures require not only legislative procedures but also require consultation with, and the participation of, the social partners."
"You cannot rewrite the social contract overnight."
"Secondly, the coordination between macro-economic and structural policies and the adoption of policy responses to the internal market are relatively new challenges for Member States."
"I now turn to another subject."
"There is one area where I feel that the Council cannot share the views of Parliament, at least as I understand your resolution: that is your request for a relaxation of monetary policy."
"The Council considers that the level of interest rates does not only lie in the hands of monetary authorities, but depends substantially on achieving sufficient fiscal consolidation and appropriate responses from the market."
"The Council has always considered that keeping inflation low is a pre-condition for sustainable growth and employment."
"I recognize, of course, that there is an important need to create the conditions for sustainable easing in monetary conditions, but this requires budgetary and pay developments to be compatible with the price stability objective."
"Any lowering of short-term interest rates which was not warranted by appropriate budgetary and pay developments would soon risk being offset by expectations of higher future inflation and a weakening of confidence by financial markets, leading ultimately to higher long-term interest rates."
"This, in my view and in the view of the Council, would damage investment prospects and weaken the recovery, with consequently adverse implications for growth and employment."
"Budgetary consolidation and monetary easing can be compatible, but here we need to strike a balance."
"If credible plans for budgetary consolidation and agreements leading to moderate pay increases were achieved, market expectations could be favourably influenced and conditions would be more favourable to sustained monetary easing."
"I can assure you, Members of the European Parliament, that the Irish presidency will make all possible efforts to accelerate the implementation of the guidelines in a positive and constructive spirit and with a particular emphasis on the need for much stronger employment growth."
"In addition, the Council will prepare the annual joint report on employment for the regular Dublin European Council."
"I would also draw your attention to the fact that the Irish presidency is organizing a conference on local employment initiatives in November of this year."
"The objectives of achieving strong, sustainable economic growth and increasing the employment intensity of that growth are receiving considerable attention, not only in the broad economic policy guidelines, but also in the wider work of the Commission and the European Council."
"In all this work there is a clear recognition that we need to tackle this serious problem of our high level of unemployment and the social exclusion which it entails."
"But we need to keep our attention focused on the employment objective and to intensify the debate on the most appropriate policy responses which cover a very broad spectrum of actions."
"The discussion we are having here today will, I believe, contribute importantly to intensifying that debate."
"I am looking forward to the common efforts of Parliament and the Council, the Commission and the Member States to improve policies towards the employment objective."
"In all our deliberations we should keep before our minds what is ultimately at stake: the future performance, wealth and dignity of all our children."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Ecofin Council for his presentation today but also for the way in which he has already given an undertaking to the European Parliament on ensuring that we have a better relationship with Ecofin than we have in the past."
"I should like to deal very quickly with four issues and hope that the President-in-Office of Ecofin will have the chance to respond to these."
"First there is an issue I raised with the Italian presidency regarding the broad economic guidelines and that is the reason for the change that was made by Ecofin to the Commission's proposals."
"I wish to refer in particular to the dropping of the reference to a better economic policy mix more favourable to growth, which was taken out of the Commission text, and also concerning the convergence programmes - the reference to the fact that these programmes should clearly indicate that the measures aimed at improving convergence go hand in hand with the promotion of growth and employment in the medium term."
"There are many more examples of the way in which these guidelines produced by the Commission were changed."
"I am led to understand that in fact the document that was presented at the Ecofin Council was not the text from the Commission but the text that had been produced by the Monetary Committee."
"Could the President-in-Office explain to us the role of the Monetary Committee here?"
"Surely it is the obligation of Ecofin to consider the Commission text and not to allow the interference of central bankers in a text which should of course have been presented to it first for consideration."
"My second point concerns the relationship with Parliament."
"We do not have a very good relationship with the Council on economic and monetary issues."
"We have a better relationship with the Commission where we meet regularly with Commissioner De Silguy."
"Would the President-in-Office of the Ecofin Council, be prepared to meet with a delegation of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee perhaps early in September to see if, during the early weeks of the autumn, we can thrash out a new relationship which will strengthen the relationship between Parliament and the Council during the crucial period running up to the conclusion of economic and monetary union?"
"The third issue relates to this idea of budgetary consolidation."
"In the speeches I have heard recently no-one actually differentiates between borrowing for investment and borrowing for current expenditure."
"Can the Presidentin-Office, during his term of office, ensure that Ecofin, particularly in the context of the stability pact, makes the distinction between borrowing for investment, which surely must be acceptable under carefully defined circumstances, and borrowing for current expenditure?"
"The fourth issue is in relation to the stability pact."
"We in this House are very nervous about the fact that there are those who want to promote a stability pact outside the Treaty on European Union."
"They want some new intergovernmental arrangement."
"We want the President-in-Office's assurance that the stability pact will fit exactly with the terms and the spirit of the Treaty on European Union and also that when he presents that stability pact to this House during his presidency he will ensure that it also fits in exactly with the priorities of the Essen Summit."
"Mr President, I would like to thank, on behalf of my Group, Mr Quinn, the President-in-Office, for the full and comprehensive way in which he set out the Council's reactions to the broad economic guidelines."
"I was particularly pleased that he raised and played back to us a number of items from our resolution of 19 June."
"There are one or two issues which I would like to develop further with him, but may I first of all most sincerely thank him for taking note of our paragraph 11, which states that the European Parliament considers it very important that the Irish presidency should be present at Parliament's July part-session in order to present recommendations under Article 103(2) of the Treaty."
"Thank you very much indeed, President-in-Office, for taking note of that particular suggestion."
"On the other hand, I think it is true to say that the Council and, if I may also say so, the Commission, are still operating in what Parliament considers to be an area of wishful thinking."
"We refer to this in paragraph 4 of our resolution, the fourth indent, where we specifically state that the current approach is based on wishful thinking."
"There is nothing either in the communiqué from the Florence European Council, or indeed in the Ecofin recommendations and the Commission recommendations, which leads us to vary that opinion expressed by Parliament."
"We would also perhaps have liked to have a little bit more attention paid to the questions raised elsewhere in paragraph 4 of our resolution, particularly in the sixth indent where we refer to the creation of an environment where employers in the European Union are encouraged to take on workers."
"I think there was an implicit acknowledgement of that in the President-in-Office's references to moderate pay increases."
"I would have liked, as rapporteur, to have had something more specific, drawing attention to the burdens imposed on employers, because we did draw attention in our resolution, paragraph 8, to the need to reduce non-wage labour costs, particularly at the lower end of the wage scale."
"That indeed is referred to as well in our paragraph 4, sixth indent, because it is the impact of high social costs or taxes on jobs at the lower end of the wage scale which is contributing to maintaining uncomfortably high levels, particularly of youth unemployment."
"On the question of uncomfortably high levels, I would like also to draw attention to the points that we made in our resolution, recital B, to the historically high levels of unemployment here in the European Union: currently 18 million people unemployed with 50 million suffering from social exclusion."
"Not a very creditable reflection on the famous European social pact."
"There is one other point which I would have liked the President-in-Office to have raised, because it is something which I included in our original resolution, and that is the reference in paragraph 4, seventh indent, to the need for us to study the best practice in the 15 Member States and elsewhere, particularly in the United States, to identify policies which can achieve results in bringing down unemployment."
"Having said all that, however, I congratulate the President-in-Office, thank him once again for his courtesy in responding so promptly to our request in June and wish him a successful six months."
"Mr President, two of the four main priorities the Irish presidency of the European Union has set for this six-month period concern economic issues: efficient finance and employment."
"This means that 50 % of what is to be done or improved concern the economy."
"In fact, half of our activities should concern social and policy issues, whilst the other half should concern economic matters."
"This is why the broad guidelines the Council is required to set out in this area are of at least equal importance on the European stage."
"The Community was born of the economic sector and has grown to include the social sector; it must now seek a fair balance between the two."
"That said, we believe that today's broad economic-policy guidelines should focus primarily on small and mediumsized enterprises: although, individually, these enterprises are representative of the micro-economy, together, they are of macro-economic importance, because of their number, which amounts to some 18 million in the European Union."
"Eighteen million, Minister Quinn, is also the number of people unemployed in the Community."
"I shall leave you to do the simple equation concerning new jobs."
"It is not simply a question of size; it is not simply that small and medium-sized enterprises have greater employment potential than large industrial undertakings, which are replacing workers with machines; it is also a sectoral issue, a question of directing more effort to sectors that offer major opportunities."
"I am referring, in particular, to tourism, which the Irish presidency has rightly included among its priorities, but I am also referring to the crafts sector, services and the commercial distribution system."
"We should like to see increasing attention, matched by appropriate resources, being paid to these four sectors - commerce, tourism, services and the crafts sector."
"We feel sure that Commissioner De Silguy has this clearly in mind."
"Large and small companies should be working together."
"The objective is common growth of the European economy, growth of the Community itself."
"Our thanks and best wishes to our Irish colleagues."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to welcome the beginning of the Irish presidency and the Irish presidency's good will to cooperate with the European Parliament."
"I should like to make a general remark, given that Mr Cox and Mr Watson have referred to much more specific subjects."
"The President-in-Office of the Council mentioned four areas - monetary, budgetary, labour markets and structural reform."
"However, we in the Liberal Group in a debate held a month ago on the guidelines of economic policies in the Union, expressed our concern that there was an excessively monetarist slant to the guidelines in economic policy in general, perhaps because money supply is one of the easiest parts of the economy to control."
"On the other hand, we were asking for an effort to be made to reduce interest rates, as the OECD has called for, in order to offset the negative aspects of the economic climate brought about by budgetary cuts, in order to boost economic growth, without which it would be very difficult to achieve EMU which, as the Irish presidency and the European Parliament have shown, is our end objective."
"This means we have to find ways of striking a good balance between the correct application of monetary policy and the necessary structural reforms, including proper measures in the other three areas which the President-inOffice of the Council mentioned."
"Mr President, the Council appears, without justification, to be optimistic about the future."
"Its assertions are the same as those of a year ago when the previous proposals were adopted and simply bear out the fact that the expectations expressed at that time have not been met and that since then economic activity in the Union has slowed down markedly, unemployment has risen again and the gap between the actual level of economic and social prosperity and the level that was projected remains in broad terms undiminished."
"The point is that the approach to those problems is to remain unchanged and that still the Council is optimistic."
"Resolute in its perception, the Council intends, according to the latest proposals and the general content of the convergence programmes, to continue with and harden the policy pursued in the previous period and to impose reductions in public spending, especially in social spending, the increasing of taxation revenues, a reduction in real incomes, deregulation of the labour market and a continuation of the privatization policy."
"The problem is not that the proposals have not been implemented with sufficient determination and consistency. The failure of confidence in the European Union, which the Council itself acknowledges, can be traced to the philosophy and ideological choices pursued by the Union in determining the actual content of those proposals, in shaping out the content of the economic and social policy which it and the Member States have been implementing for many years."
"Reality shows that the objectives are specious and the means ineffective and that a radically different approach is needed."
"Yet again, the European Union is refusing to draw the necessary conclusions."
"The workers, who are the main victims of its policy choices, will denounce the policies which are impoverishing them and driving them to the wall and will fight, with the support of others, to get them changed."
"The delivery of the people's verdict via referenda on the course imposed by the Maastricht Treaty, on economic and monetary union and on the changes that will result from the intergovernmental conference will, I feel sure, make clear the general disapproval of these policies. That is the conclusion that the Council should be thinking about."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you say that you do not wish under any circumstances to relax monetary policy and that you continue to be concerned about inflation."
"But is not the real problem area the fact that the economy has moved rather in the direction of deflation?"
"You clearly wish to rush the economy along at such a speed that over-rapid and violent convergence will only increase unemployment and social exclusion."
"Do you really believe, Mr President, that under these conditions it is sufficient merely to have the courage to hold to the EMU timetable?"
"In my opinion this does not seem even advisable."
"It is, however, clearly not possible to admit this in the face of market forces."
"Secondly I should like to say that the Council does not seem to care at all that the Union is incapable of taking any decision relating to taxation."
"Does Ireland intend to do anything about this serious problem?"
"Do you intend to contribute to altering the priorities of taxation so that the exploitation of natural resources and the pollution of the environment are taxed more heavily and employment and labour less heavily?"
"Thirdly I would like to ask whether you have any initiatives in mind regarding the preconditions for international action on the economy?"
"Do you intend to take any new initiatives towards coordinating monetary policy at international level?"
"From more and more quarters, serious proposals are now being made for a speculation tax which would prevent the economy from becoming detached from reality and moving off into a sphere of its own, and would return it to a much closer relationship with the real economy."
"I should like to hear whether the Council is considering any initiatives to this end."
"Mr President, we were all delighted to hear the Irish presidency this morning, and Mr Quinn just now, saying once again that the matters of employment and growth would be given priority. At the same time, though, it is impossible not to be struck by a contradiction between this declaration of priorities and the content of the guidelines proposed by the Council of Ministers regarding the economic policies of the Member States."
"As far as those guidelines are concerned, in fact, they amount to no more than a restatement of those previously announced in earlier years which, to summarize, comprise monetary stabilization as a foundation for a policy of reducing public spending and a policy of imposing a ceiling on wage costs, or even reducing them."
"Does that sound like a recipe for renewal of growth and increased employment?"
"We think not, and to judge by the results of the economic policies pursued in recent years - especially in the year that has just ended - the opposite seems more likely to be the case: a slow-down of growth and worsening unemployment."
"We believe that, on the contrary, pursuing and strengthening these guidelines is likely to trigger a kind of deflationary spiral which could be dangerous for the economy of the Union, for social peace in Europe and for the European idea as such."
"What Europe needs is confidence - not just market confidence but consumer confidence, too, and the way to consumer confidence is through a future without unemployment."
"Yet we see nothing in the proposals by the Council of Ministers specifically designed to provide a swift cure for the drastic employment situation in the European Union."
"Furthermore, we are also struck by a growing contradiction between the march towards monetary union - however desirable it may be - and absolute inertia regarding the definition of other instruments of economic policy which would be necessary supplements to the monetary instrument in order to enable the Union to steer its economy efficiently."
"In this context, we believe it to be entirely desirable that supplementary instruments should be defined as a matter of urgency."
"In the budgetary area, first of all, we should - without awaiting the end of the application period for the Delors II package - begin to give thought to what the Union's budget will be at the time when monetary union is in force."
"Additionally, as regards taxation, which was mentioned just now, this is another area where action needs to be taken to move towards harmonization, first the harmonization of direct taxation."
"Mr Monti recently gave an excellent account of the way labour in Europe has been overtaxed for several years: how can this be remedied without a policy of harmonization of direct taxation?"
"And, over and above that, we should no doubt give consideration to a Union tax, a Community tax, which would enable the Union to be a union of citizens also."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, I very much welcome the fact that the Irish presidency has emphasized that the Maastricht Treaty not only calls for the achievement of monetary union but also for European union in the fields of economic and social affairs and employment, and so the challenge of combating mass unemployment has rightly become a priority of the Irish presidency."
"However, if we consider, analyse and evaluate the economic policy guidelines of the European Union, we really do start to wonder to what extent they represent an appropriate policy mix."
"And since rigid monetary policy is not being subjected to critical scrutiny as the European Parliament has requested, I wonder just how monetary policy, along with economic policy, employment policy, structural policy and industrial policy, is supposed to achieve investment-led growth that will create jobs."
"This question cannot be answered if we do not also take stock of our monetary policy, which is why I hope that the Irish presidency will step up its efforts to find an answer, because it simply cannot be in the interests of Parliament to speak here of a lax monetary policy."
"On the contrary, we have to ask how monetary policy can help to achieve the objectives of economic and monetary union, namely greater growth, sustained growth and above all higher employment levels."
"We do not want economic and monetary union to be merely a milestone in our monetary history; we want it to benefit the people of this European Union."
"When I assess the underlying economic policy principles, I also wonder how the years that still lie ahead can be used to make it even clearer, by means of the economic policy guidelines, that we need a political strategy at European level for the things we can no longer regulate at national level."
"The globalization of markets has not left Europe untouched, and even though the single market and monetary union are appropriate responses to this challenge, there is still a pressing need to establish a framework governing the operation of the social market economy at European level."
"I should very much welcome the Irish presidency coming up with a strategy for action in this area as part of its efforts to develop the economic policy guidelines."
"In addition, may I also ask the President-in-Office to take another look at the question posed by the European Parliament about how the democratic deficit in the domain of economic and monetary policy can be overcome."
"Can we not expect an interinstitutional agreement at some stage, laying down procedures for the multilateral monitoring of the excessive deficit?"
"What is the Irish presidency's position on this point, which is of great concern to the European Parliament and ought to be resolved at long last?"
"A Uachtaráin, ar an céad dul síos ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh Aire Airgeadais na hEireann agus Uachtarán in Oifig, an tUasal Ruairí Quinn, T.D. chuig Parlaimint na hEorpa."
"Guím gach rath ort agus tá súil agam to n-éireoidh go geal leat na haidhmeanna atá curtha romhaibh le linn téarma Uachtarantacht na hEireann a bhaint amach."
"(Translation: At the outset, I would like to welcome Mr Ruairí Quinn, T.D., Irish Minister for Finance and Presidentin-Office to the European Parliament."
"I wish you every success and I sincerely hope that you will achieve the aims you have set out during the term of office of the Irish presidency) ."
"President-in-Office, welcome and congratulations on your speech here this afternoon."
"While Ireland has generally benefited from European funding, there are pockets of that country that are disadvantaged, whether it be the North-West, the West or indeed the border counties."
"I believe the Economic Commission must now do the necessary studies in relation to the regions that continue to be disadvantaged - and disadvantaged irrespective of the economic indicators applied - where there is a high rate of unemployment, depopulation, a weak industrial base and poor rural infrastructure."
"Indeed, in many parts of my constituency we must travel two hours before we meet these proposed TENs or national primary roads."
"We cannot continue to ignore large regions or indeed any region within the Union."
