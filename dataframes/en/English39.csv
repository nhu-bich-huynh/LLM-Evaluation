"Text"
"I would like to say to the candidate countries that they must bear in mind that the defence of human beings, without exceptions, without discrimination, is today the backbone of the European Union."
"The exclusion of women, the exclusion of Romany minorities, are today the focus of our attention."
"There is no room in Europe for exclusion, for expulsion, for marginalisation, whether collective or individual."
"Europe, as from today, is entering into a new dynamic, which, since it is stronger and more powerful, must be more sensitive to its most distant and distinct elements."
"Mr President, I would like to make three comments."
"As far as enlargement with Turkey is concerned, it is the usual practice to have a debate."
"We cannot express regret that European citizens lack an interest in Europe whilst also rejecting the debate on enlargement, enlargement which would be the furthest removed from the European Union's original plan."
"At the same time, the enlargement process that is currently being undertaken includes the greatest number of countries."
"We must remember that we have never enlarged by more than three countries at once."
"The current enlargement process is not yet completed."
"We all hope that it will be a success."
"Let us complete it successfully before launching a debate on possible future enlargements."
"With respect to the European Union's major neighbours, one of which - but not the only one - is Turkey, we must be capable of proposing another solution to the dilemma with which we are trying to grapple, that of accession or exclusion."
"Yet, as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is proposing, there is another solution, one better adapted to the problem raised."
"This solution is to define a specific framework of relations including a substantial economic section and which enables us to finance a specific number of projects and infrastructures."
"This is how the continent of North America is organised, and no one there is proposing that Mexico or Canada should be members of the United States of America."
"The Group of the European People's Party is proposing another option, which is much better adapted to the real problem."
"I am sure that Parliament will be open to the feelings of the population and will ask to move forward in this direction and lay down a new framework between the European Union and its neighbouring countries."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the enlargement of the European Union this time round is truly impressive."
"Ten new countries are about to join."
"I should like, if I may, to turn my attention in this interesting and highly promising development to Cyprus, rather than to what are indisputably more densely populated countries far closer to home."
"Cyprus, that tiny country with its long history and tragic vicissitudes over recent years, covers the far side of the Mediterranean dimension of the European Union and, by virtue of its position, can contribute a great deal to the Union's Mediterranean policy."
"We all know that the political importance of Cyprus far outweighs its economic importance to the future development of the European Union."
"At the same time, however, by integrating Cyprus, the European Union itself is demonstrating that it is an international entity with international credentials and this will help enormously in resolving the Cyprus problem."
"The implementation of the acquis communautaire in Cyprus is the key to reconciliation and cooperation and will enable Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots to live side by side in a single, federal, twin community, free, independent state which respects human rights and the ethnic origins and religious persuasions of its people."
"It is the basis on which a fair, viable, workable solution can be found; the sort of solution that the UN Secretary-General's plan should bring about once it has been negotiated by the interested parties."
"More importantly, the integration of Cyprus into the European Union is a test and a challenge to Turkey in its efforts to speed up the process of meeting the Community criteria, the process which will enable it too to join the European Union at a later date."
"May everything go according to plan!"
"Mr President, after today's debate, I understand why Turkey is calling upon the forthcoming December Council to set a date for the start of the negotiations."
"I support Turkey's request, for what is happening here is a farce, started by Mr Giscard d'Estaing and continuing today in this Chamber."
"Here, we are not discussing whether Turkey is fulfilling the conditions it needs to fulfil in order to become a member of the Union in the near future - and we can be rigorous in demanding that it does fulfil them - we are opening a debate on whether or not Turkey is to be allowed to join the Union in the future and wondering whether a different sort of association might be appropriate."
"We are going back on decisions already made and reopening the debate on the opening of a line of credit for a major country - a country which is essential to Europe and the West - which has applied to become a full member of the Union."
"Personally, I support the line taken by Mr Brok in his report and his resolution, where he calls for greater pre-accession cooperation from the Commission and for the Council to adopt a position which is more in line with that expressed on occasions by Parliament, but I do not support the Ferber amendment - which I will vote against tomorrow - in that if it were to be adopted, the whole approach of the Brok report and resolution would be turned upside down and they would make no sense."
"There are good reasons for what I am saying: we have a duty to be unambiguous towards a major country which practises moderate Islam, is pro the West, which could have great cultural significance on our borders and could give substance to a Union foreign and security policy."
"I hope that, tomorrow, we will reject the Ferber amendment - as a member of the European People's Party I will do so - and we will thus be able to take a step in that direction."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we draw near to the close of the debate it is not easy to introduce another new aspect."
"Since there is broad agreement here that we welcome this process and we are taking for granted that ten new states will soon be sending their representatives here officially, I should, however, like to raise one aspect again, that is the necessity of canvassing in all future 25 countries for this also to find acceptance with public opinion, with the citizens."
"I think that is a great task that lies ahead of us and cannot only begin when the accession process is almost completed and the treaties signed."
"I come from a region that in 1990 entered this European Union overnight, as it were."
"I know that many citizens experienced the necessary restructuring process as a personal defeat, a downgrading that marked them out as losers."
"I think we need to make clear to people in the candidate countries, too, that membership of the European Union also results in resources and means being made available to cushion the citizens and help them through the difficult process."
"That will be a big task for us because after all we need majorities in the population."
"If we in this Parliament are agreed, that is to be welcomed, but we must take the citizens with us in this process, which will certainly not be as easy as it sounds."
"Let us work together to make it possible."
"As a member of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I should like to see the advisory committees more fairly and intensively involved in the next concrete discussions of the outcome of negotiations."
"I know that is a great political achievement, a great political report, but the individual specialist committees must surely have something important to say about the process."
"Mr President, we are heading for the unification of Europe."
"This is a natural consequence of the winds of freedom having swept away the closed borders of Europe and the insurmountable antagonisms, as well as the suspicion, the Soviet system and the Communist dictatorships."
"I am convinced that 2004 will go down in history as 1989 has already done."
"The work of enlargement must proceed further, however."
"The new Member States must be treated with respect."
"The principle of subsidiarity must serve more clearly as a guide to cooperation as the EU grows."
"National self-determination must be the same in the new Member States as in the old."
"What we do not want the EU to interfere in where our own countries are concerned, the EU must not interfere in where the new Member States are concerned, either."
"The enlargement process must not cease after 2004 and 2007."
"We already know that new applications for EU membership are on the way."
"At the Helsinki European Council in 1999, Turkey was recognised as a candidate country for EU membership."
"Three years later, the European Parliament cannot now, as some amendments demand, try to change this."
"Nothing has happened to justify such a measure, so the basic conditions governing an international, confidence-building project cannot suddenly be changed."
"It would be unworthy of a generous and responsible European Parliament in this way to change the basic conditions set for Turkey."
"Turkey has made great progress in order to be able to embark upon the negotiations with a view to EU membership."
"There are things that remain to be done, and it is for Turkey to decide whether it wishes to continue."
"I am nonetheless convinced that, in the future, a democratic Turkish society governed by the rule of law may be crucially important to a better understanding between the West and the Muslim world."
"Such friends are valuable at this time."
"Mr President, I absolutely agree with what Mr Arvidsson has just said with regard to Turkey."
"Turkey has improved its human rights situation and its legal praxis in a way that is worthy of our respect."
"I think it is very unfortunate, however, that it has been suggested that there should be a change of policy."
"Our message to Ankara should remain the same as it has been the whole time, which is that EU membership is open to all European countries provided that the criteria for accession are satisfied."
"With enlargement, the Internal Market, which is the EU's core mechanism, will grow larger, which will improve the EU's chances of success in the global markets."
"In the pauses between the celebratory speeches, however, we have to remember that achieving a viable Internal Market required and will require, in the future too, great effort on the part of all concerned."
"For that very reason, the Copenhagen criteria also include the requirement that there is competitiveness within the Internal Market."
"I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Brok, that there is still a lot of work ahead of us."
"Making political decisions is easier than bringing about changes in the economic structure."
"The timetable for 2004 is a tight one."
"It is difficult to implement economic structural reforms at times but we have to keep to the commitments that have been made."
"We have to ensure in particular that the future Member States have the administrative and legal capacity for operating as part of the Internal Market."
"Our job as politicians is to guarantee that the Internal Market will function successfully after enlargement."
"This means that the work cannot stop with Copenhagen."
"Even after accession the new Member States will have to continue with their policies of reform."
"The internal reforms the applicant countries implement will nevertheless increase the prosperity and stability of their societies in the long term."
"The European Parliament will also have to monitor the situation and ensure that the present Member States, the Commission and the future Member States each play their part in completing the enlargement process."
"Mr President, one evening, after winning a battle, Winston Churchill declared 'it is not the end, it is not even the beginning of the end, but one can say that it is the end of the beginning'."
"I think that this sums up our situation perfectly."
"Our friends who are joining us feel, no doubt, that they have arrived at the end of the road."
"In fact, they are only at the end of the first stage along the road and tomorrow we must all set about building Europe."
"They are not arriving in a ready-made world."
"We must establish a political Union and both the foreign policy and defence policy must be drafted."
"The institutions are due to be radically reformed within the framework of the Convention and already, those who are due to join us are taking part in the work of the Convention."
"This is a Europe that we are therefore going to build together."
"Do not have any preconceptions or the feeling that you are arriving in a world made by others and for others: you are arriving along with others in a world that we shall all be building together."
"And I would simply like to give you what I feel is the secret of influence in Europe."
"Some believe that one must be hard and strict, that one must constantly complain and protest in favour of one's national interests."
"This is far from being the case."
"Europe gives itself to those who support it."
"This is the fundamental rule of the European Union: support it and it will serve you well!"
"I should like to thank Mr Bourlanges for his concluding remark which gives me a welcome opportunity now to present my few concluding observations."
"First of all, I should like to thank the rapporteurs for the serious work that has gone into the reports."
"They contain sound overviews, wise deliberations and a number of conclusions."
"In this way, a serious basis has been laid for the massive support for enlargement that Parliament has confirmed today."
"It can safely be said that there is huge support."
"That has now become apparent in this Assembly in the last eight hours."
"I should like to thank you for your commitment and support."
"I should also like to answer a couple of the central questions put to me."
"Up until the negotiations in Copenhagen - that is to say over the next three weeks - we face a huge task in concluding the negotiations with each of the 10 candidate countries."
"The Presidency will conduct the negotiations in cooperation with the Commission and with complete respect for the EU rules on expenditure ceilings set in Berlin and for the conclusions adopted in Brussels."
"That was what the General Affairs Council recommended to the Presidency at the meeting yesterday."
"The Presidency will make active efforts on this basis and do its utmost to find compromises that are acceptable to both the new and the existing Member States."
"A great willingness to compromise is required, however, together with great understanding of the other party's needs and points of view."
"On the subject of the negotiating situation, it can be said that of course negotiations can take place and of course flexibility can be shown, but I think that everyone in this Chamber agrees that EU law must be respected."
"The expenditure ceilings set in Berlin must be respected and the decisions taken in Brussels concerning, for example, agricultural expenditure must be respected."
"Nonetheless, there is a certain room for manoeuvre, as Commissioner Verheugen too has pointed out."
"To Mr Bonde, Mr Modrow and quite a few others, I should like to emphasise what Mr Rasmussen also said just before lunch, to the effect that there is no question of the fifteen Member States now going on to write a new treaty to which the 10 new countries then agree, without having had any influence on it."
"Yesterday's meeting of ministers again confirmed what is stated in paragraph 23 of the Treaty of Nice, to the effect that the new countries will participate in the forthcoming intergovernmental conference with fully equal rights and with speaking and voting rights that are on a fully equal footing with those of the existing Member States."
"That is the way things are. Anything else would also, of course, be objectionable, unacceptable and impossible for the politicians in the new Member States to hold referendums on."
"I believe it was Mrs Myller who raised the issue of the new neighbours."
"Following enlargement, we shall of course have new neighbours to the east and, yesterday, at its meeting in Brussels, the General Affairs Council adopted a longer term strategy for dealing with our new neighbours."
"The Council expressed the desire to formulate an ambitious, long-term and integrated strategy in relation to each of these new neighbouring countries with a view to promoting democracy and economic reforms, sustainable development and trade and for promoting stability, prosperity etc on the other side of the new EU border."
"It was emphasised that account should be taken of each country's special political and economic circumstances and that the issue as a whole should be seen in the context of the current deepening of cooperation with Russia."
"There was also talk of cross-border cooperation, organised crime, illegal immigration and regional cooperation between the new neighbouring countries."
"I can therefore give an assurance that thought has been given to all of this."
"It was decided in conclusion that the Commission and Mr Solana should be called upon to prepare more detailed proposals as soon as possible, and the decision was rounded off with words to the effect that the candidate countries would be consulted on this work."
"To Mr Alavanos and others who talked about Cyprus, I would state that, as is well known, the UN Secretary-General submitted, on 11 November, a general proposal for solving the Cyprus conflict."
"This is a complex and extensive proposal covering 150 pages."
"The plan submitted is designed as an overall political solution to ensure that a united Cyprus is able to join the EU."
"Where accession is concerned, it is the Helsinki conclusions that continue to form the basis of the EU's position."
"The EU would ideally like to see the accession of a reunited island, but a solution in those terms is not a necessary prerequisite for accession."
"The Council will take a decision on Cyprus's accession, taking account of all the relevant factors."
"The EU also supports the UN Secretary-General's efforts and will be able to endorse an overall solution to the conflict in accordance with the principles on which the European Union is based, that is to say with a view to Cyprus's being able, as a Member State, to speak with a single voice and to guarantee the correct application of EU law."
"With regard to relations with Turkey, these will be based on the European Council's decision, also taken in Helsinki."
"Turkey is a candidate country that will be treated in exactly the same way as the other candidate countries."
"The Commission's report stated that fulfilment of the political criterion, which is a prerequisite for embarking upon negotiations, has still not taken place. Major progress has been made, however."
"The economic criteria must be fulfilled no later than upon accession to the EU."
"At the Copenhagen European Council, a decision will be made concerning the next phase of Turkey's relations with the EU, and Turkey will in that way receive exactly the same treatment as all the other candidate countries have received."
"Last of all, I want to say to Mr Maaten and Mr Arvidsson that we all recognise that enlargement from 15 to 25, and subsequently to 27 or perhaps 28, Member States requires a new treaty. Otherwise, we shall have problems."
"That is, of course, why the Convention is sitting and why we must have an intergovernmental conference."
"It goes without saying that we are obliged to take decisions at that intergovernmental conference."
"From everything I have heard, however - yesterday, too, from the Member States and the new Member States - there is an awareness of the fact that decisions must be taken so as to prevent the bottlenecks Mr Maaten talked about or, in other words, problems involving the inability to take decisions."
"Mr Arvidsson is, of course, quite right that a Union with so many Member States must also concentrate on the essential issues and not spread itself too thin, for the system could become very complicated if the proximity principle and the principle of subsidiarity were not borne in mind."
"With these words, Mr President, I want to express my sincere thanks for this debate of eight and a half hours which signals massive support for the great project we have under way."
"We have reason to be proud of this support, and I take the liberty of saying 'we' for I was involved in starting up the project when I was still an MEP."
"Thank you very much, Mr President-in-Office of the Council."
"You are right to stress the fact that it is one of the longest debates that we have ever had in Parliament."
"This reflects the scale of the task which lies before us."
"To wind up this debate, I shall give the floor to Mr Verheugen, who will speak on behalf of the Commission."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since the Council Presidency has answered all your questions so precisely, I can allow myself to be very brief."
"I think this debate has been very helpful."
"It has contributed to the dynamism we need in order, with the wind behind us, to reach our objective in Copenhagen."
"It has also given clear pointers as to what still requires attention in the negotiations that lie ahead, and we shall endeavour to bring the pointers that have emerged from this debate into the talks."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 7.20 p.m.)"
"Commission annual legislative and work programme for 2003"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the annual legislative and work programme for 2003."
"I should like to thank Minister Haarder for being here."
"This is the first time that the Council has actually been present for the presentation of the legislative programme."
"Mr President of Parliament, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, you told us, Mr Prodi, that we would inaugurate a new method which would allow the three institutions, in drawing up the Commission legislative and work programme for 2003, to work more closely together."
"We would like to emphasise the importance of this new method."
"For the first time, Parliament, the Council and the Commission have engaged in a constructive dialogue to establish a legislative programme."
"We are particularly in favour of this cooperation and especially of increasing initial discussions between Parliament and the Commission."
"Although this dialogue did indeed take place last spring, however, it was difficult to differentiate between this specific legislative planning exercise and what are known as regular meetings which take place throughout the year between parliamentary committees and commissioners in their respective fields of competence."
"In future we will probably need greater preparation and a better structure for this dialogue and, in particular, each Commissioner will probably have to present initial guidelines for each specific legislative field."
"The single document 'Annual Policy Strategy for 2003' presented by the Commission in February proved insufficient, and this situation could -appear harmful, as 2003 is a particularly important year due to enlargement."
"I did note, however, Mr President, that you would like the Commission to present monthly reports to Parliament."
"Having said this, we welcome the three political priorities set by the Commission and we would like to make the following comments:"
"On the first point, entitled 'An enlarged Europe', our primary concern is to ensure that the Community acquis is properly applied throughout the enlarged Union."
"It is therefore crucial for a codified version of Community law to be available in all the languages of the new Member States."
"Successful enlargement means including the environmental aspect and the objective of public health and consumer protection in all the other policies, as well as taking account - as you said yourself - of human resources, and it also means being innovative."
"Lastly, it means monitoring the application of Community legislation, and we will need to help the future Member States to establish suitable structures as swiftly as possible."
"With regard to the second point, entitled 'Stability and security', the terrorist threat hangs over the Union."
"We therefore welcome the measures proposed in order to combat this scourge."
"Combating terrorism is one factor in a broader objective, that of ensuring that the Union is safe and secure."
"We also welcome the Commission's commitment to move forward in creating an area of freedom, security and justice, within which the rights of the individual will be protected, whether in terms of civil protection, food and industrial safety, transport, energy or land use planning, in order to take into consideration all the factors affecting public health and the environment."
"With regard, more particularly, to establishing a European Public Prosecutor, we believe it is appropriate to await the Convention's conclusions on the subject before taking any initiatives."
"Ensuring stability and security within the Union also means defining and setting up an integrated border-control system and taking coordinated practical action to combat illegal immigration."
"We would also ask the Commission to present proposals in the near future on asylum and immigration policy that clearly distinguish between asylum seekers, those requesting international protection and migrant workers."
"On this subject, our group is still concerned about what we perceive as a lack of resolve within the Council."
"It is also important to monitor the actions of the European Union and the Member States regularly with regard to the International Criminal Court."
"On the third point, entitled 'Sustainable and inclusive economy', if we want to prevent the deterioration in the economic environment from having a negative impact on employment, it would be desirable for the Commission to be able to inform us of proposals for a more flexible working market, which is essential for increasing employment opportunities."
"We appreciate the Commission's firm stance over the Stability and Growth Pact, but, on the other hand, we consider it lacking in other areas."
"It is regrettable that the Commission programme makes no mention of the fiscal package and that no progress has been made in the field of VAT with regard to the principle of country of origin."
"In particular, we would invite the Commission to go further in considering the harmonisation of the basis for taxation, wherever this is necessary for the proper functioning of the single market, while not proposing a measure aimed solely at harmonising rates."
"The European Union's fiscal policy must, in all cases, be aimed at reducing general taxation and lowering administrative costs."
"Economic development is also achieved through strengthening infrastructures, in particular in the field of transport."
"We would also, following the ruling of the Court of Justice of 5 November 2002, which found eight Member States guilty of concluding 'open sky' agreements with the United States, call for the European Commission to present a communication on drawing up future bilateral agreements in the field of air transport as swiftly as possible."
"With regard to the Union's foreign policy, we would ask the Commission to publish a Green Paper on the new borders of the enlarged European Union, supplemented by ideas on relations with the new neighbouring States and the various partners."
"It is regrettable that the Commission legislative programme makes no reference to either the creation of a Euromed free trade area, or the creation of a Euromed parliamentary assembly."
"Within the context of post-Doha discussions, we would ask the Commission how it hopes to be able to integrate the commitment of Europe, no longer of fifteen, but of twenty-five States."
"Lastly, trans-Atlantic dialogue must be strengthened in a spirit of sustainable and inclusive development and must of course make good the Kyoto commitments."
"We are pleased that the proposal puts forward seven strategies as indicated in the Sixth Environment Action Programme, as well as proposals concerning integrated product policy and a new chemicals strategy."
"In conclusion, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe it is important to begin to reform employee status, make OLAF more independent and publish declarations of the financial interests of commissioners and directors-general on the Internet."
"I am sure, Mr President, that in this way we will be able to avoid an exponential increase in measures, duplicated criteria as well as- and I shall end here - excessive transposition work, in order to ensure the best possible future for the enlargement of the Union."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we are getting increasingly close to what we asked for at the beginning of the legislature, that is, an annual political programme presented to Parliament with the participation of the Council - and I hope that Minister Haarder's presence here is not superfluous and that he can also participate by responding to our comments, in line with visibility, transparency and democratic control."
"In this context, Mr President, please allow me to refer to a phrase that is in the programme - and which I believe is an error by the 'hack' who wrote it - which states that the programme provides the Commission's input to the Council's annual working programme."
"Could the President of the Commission clarify for us what this sentence means?"
"Because what we believe is that Parliament is not taken into account and the Commission is reduced to the role of secretariat of the Council, and we disagree entirely with this kind of approach."
"I am going to focus on the three great priorities mentioned by the President and I will leave it to other Members to deal with specific aspects."
"With regard to enlargement, we spoke about this yesterday."
"Within the Community acquis, we attach great importance to the strengthening of the social dimension in the candidate countries, except in relation to the areas in which we believe the Commission should make more effort."
"And, apart from holding discussions - the final phase of the negotiations is yet to take place - there are certain issues which we should remember."
"For example, we are struck by the fact that in the report of the Court of Auditors this year it says that in the SAPAR pre-accession programme, only one million euros has been spent, which is 0.1%."
"We are always discussing quantities, but we must look at how they are spent and invested."
"We must debate this issue not only with the Commission, but also with our friends and, I hope very soon, neighbours, in the candidate countries."
"Secondly, with regard to the economic issue, which is absolutely central, we can see that the spirit of Lisbon and Gothenburg are still alive within the Commission."
"However, we must recognise that recent events have demonstrated that we are not playing a central role in terms of economic growth and, above all, there is a concern that economic governance is not being strengthened - and we will have to see what is happening in the Convention's working group."
"In the long term, a monetary union which is not consolidated by an economic union and a political union is not viable; history has taught us this and we must take it very much into account in order to move forward."
"A final point on the economic and social priorities."
"As well as sustainable development, you, in relation to the framework directive on services of general interest, which was agreed in Barcelona, are proposing a Green Paper."
"We prefer a framework directive."
"With regard to stability and security, apart from the priority of terrorism, which is absolutely universal, the Swedish Presidency proposed a consideration of the demographic future of Europe."
"This should be linked to the issue of immigration."
"We welcome the fact - and in particular I am referring to the Members on the Right of the House - that you defend the role of legal immigration in relation to our welfare societies and our demographic future, but, in any event - and I am addressing the Council - I believe it would be very positive if there were a more active approach."
"With regard to the debate on the borders of Europe, you have spoken of the spirit and soul - I believe in lay terms - for all Europeans."
"Our former colleague, Mrs Palacio, Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, said that Europe is not a Christian club."
"I welcome this comment, which I believe is absolutely correct."
"In any event - also in relation to the Convention - it is important that we find formulae for qualified association."
"Please allow me to comment on the elements missing from the programme."
"The status of political parties is not included as a priority."
"Now that the Treaty of Nice has been approved, it is essential to make rapid progress in this regard in order to consolidate a fundamental element of European democracy."
"The Commission had already made a transitional proposal, even beforehand."
"Secondly, we are going to vote on a resolution - I believe with a large majority in this House - relating to freedom of expression and media concentration."
"In this regard, we would welcome a more dynamic attitude on the part of the Commission."
"Finally, and I will end here, Mr President, there is an issue which worries us very much: the agreements of the General Affairs Council last Monday."
"We have noted, from what we have been told and from leaks, that the President of the Commission is concerned to find a final date for the mandate of this Commission."
"I always thought that you would be a Commission that would be operational from the day of the elections."
"In any event, this is a constitutional issue."
"We are opposed to the General Affairs Council, without having debated the issue with Parliament and without you having presented it, taking a unilateral decision containing many elements which clearly clash with the Treaties."
"We therefore ask - and I address this to you, Mr President, so that it may be communicated to the President of Parliament - that the proposal for an interinstitutional agreement on this important issue be raised by the President in Copenhagen and I would like to hear an explanation today by both the President of the Commission and the Council."
"Mr President, the ELDR Group has always been quite critical in the past of the somewhat incoherent and arbitrary nature of previous annual programmes."
"We have always looked for two things in this programme: firstly, a clear idea of the political direction reflected in the strategic choices taken by the European Commission, and secondly, a political debate between the institutions themselves."
"There has certainly been some progress on those two counts this year, compared to previous years."
"We wish to thank the Commission for keeping to the format and timetable of the new arrangements and certainly thank the college for being present in such great numbers here today."
"However, as President Prodi himself said, there is still some room for improvement."
"The ELDR Group would like to highlight three areas where we feel there should be further improvement."
"The European Commission aspires to be an EU government of sorts."
"Good governments make strategic choices."
"They set political priorities."
"That importantly means they explain what they are not going to do as well as what they are going to do."
"The concern we have is that, even in this improved document, the three priorities are so broad and open-ended that they do not really represent any meaningful political choice."
"This is reflected in the annexes."
"The annex covering the actions undertaken under the three priorities run to around 40 pages."
"More worryingly, the annex covering the issues which fall outside the priorities runs to 50 pages."
"In other words, we are faced with the prospect that the majority of the initiatives undertaken on the basis of this annual programme next year will actually fall outside the political orientation set in the annual programme altogether."
"That is simply not the way to proceed."
"Once again this resorts to a sort of laundry list approach to legislative initiative and we as a group would like to see a much greater display of choice and political orientation as regards what the European Commission proposes to do from one year to the next."
"The second point is the level of detail provided for each proposed legislative action."
"This has certainly improved compared with previous years but that was not difficult."
"It is still not sufficient and I would like to draw the Commission's attention to the fact that in the Convention there are proposals being floated to involve national parliaments in this debate in future."
"This annex is almost incomprehensible to MEPs so it would be utterly incomprehensible to MPs in national parliaments."
"It needs to be explained in clear, cogent, simple prose so that it is comprehensible to people living in the world that exists outside the institutions."
"Finally, the third point is our strong support for the Commission's stated intention of applying impact assessments to a number of pilot initiatives."
"We feel impact assessments are absolutely indispensable to improve the quality of European legislation but we would like to take it a step further in two important respects."
"Firstly, we do not feel that in the long run the Commission can be judge and jury on its own impact assessments - assessing its own draft proposals."
"We feel this should be done independently."
"Secondly, there is little point in the Commission conducting its impact assessments if parliamentary and Council amendments then escape impact assessments altogether."
"Therefore we would like to see an interinstitutional approach which applies impact assessments at all points of the legislative cycle."
"Mr President, President Prodi has described three fundamental points of the programme and, in general, I support the overall line taken."
"As representative of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I do, however, feel that we should be basing our assessment of this legislative programme on the agenda for sustainable development, outside as well as within the European Union. I am afraid to say, President Prodi, that your programme is rather vague on this point, not to say slightly rhetorical."
"We hope that, this time, the Commission's report on sustainable development, due to be presented at the Spring Summit, will not arrive at the last minute."
"Equally, we hope that, as part of the follow up to Johannesburg, it might be possible to publish the annual report on the partnership initiatives on water and energy which, as you are aware, are part of what are known as the type two agreements concluded at Johannesburg, in due time."
"The legislative programme mentions the importance of the success of the Cancún meeting. However, we feel that the European Parliament must be involved in the debate on what the Commission is going to do and say in Cancún."
"We really do not want a repeat of the absolutely disgraceful situation at Johannesburg, where we were faced with a fait accompli, an agreement already concluded between the Commission - or perhaps the Commissioner responsible, for that mystery has yet to be cleared up - and the United States, that WTO rules should take precedence over international agreements in environmental matters."
"This venture was partly foiled at Johannesburg, but we genuinely fear that something similar might happen at Cancún, without any public debate and going completely against the endeavours the Commission itself is making in the area of the environment."
"As regards the external dimension of sustainable development, I would also point out that, although it is true that impact and sustainability assessments are now necessary for all international agreements - and this is a positive innovation which we very much welcome and with which we are very satisfied - it is also true that it is difficult to realise this undertaking, not least because of a certain lack of resources, as is shown by the work carried out on the agreement with Chile, work which was, I regret to say, inaccurate and rushed."
"We are looking forward with great interest, Mr President, to the Commission's Green Paper on services of general interest, and it is our genuine hope that it will be possible to discuss it here in Parliament too, Chairman Barón Crespo."
"Moreover, we hope that it will be possible to produce a directive on the matter as well, not least in that we fear that there might be some inconsistency - as I said just now - between what the Commission says and does in the Union and what it then proceeds to negotiate at international level, particularly within the WTO, which is now extremely powerful."
"In addition, in this International Year of Mountains, President Prodi, knowing your passion for mountains, we would like to know what measures the Commission intends to adopt for the practical implementation of the Alps Convention, particularly the protocol on transport."
"Another environmental issue which we feel needs attention but which I am afraid is no longer part of the programme is PVC, a material which is recognised to be highly dangerous by at least five Commission ongoing studies."
"We were expecting a communication before the end of the summer but it appears that, after Commissioner Liikanen announced his position, all the work was stopped."
"I am citing this example, although it may seem a minor issue, because, although it is true that we are working constructively to improve the legislative programme, it is also true that our discussions do not serve much purpose if we then lose sight of major legislative proposals, firmly supported by Parliament, which appear as part of the programme for years and then suddenly disappear."
"I will end, Mr President, by expressing our deep concern at the influence of industrial lobbies on the Commission's choice of legislative instrument, which may even not be a proper legislative instrument, and I would also point out that this issue is a very specific part of the interinstitutional agreement which, together with other Members of Parliament, we are trying to conclude before the Copenhagen European Council."
"Mr President, President of the Commission, I would like to start by apologising to President Prodi for the improvised nature of this speech, which will be a series of brief reflections on what I have read or heard."
"Clearly, over and above the indications given in the work programme for 2003, we cannot expect the Commission to do everything immediately and, ideally, properly, in the space of just one year, but it is right that guidelines should be laid down, as has been done. I feel that, at least in general terms, these guidelines are sufficiently acceptable."
"I listened to your speech, President Prodi, and I very much appreciated some of the points which you stressed with your usual enthusiasm, particularly the social considerations, which are very relevant at a time when we are discussing security, solidarity and measures which could even include a new direction for the world of work."
"Therefore, if I may, I would like to call upon the Commission and the Community institutions in general to reflect either formally or informally on a number of policies which I believe are of vital importance for the future of Europe, particularly for the future of an enlarged Europe which is genuinely united as regards its fundamental principles."
"Well then, yesterday, we held lengthy formal and informal discussions with many members of parliaments whose countries are aspiring, if I may use that expression, to become a full members of Europe, and, together, we discussed our desire to work towards achieving a Europe which is genuinely, essentially and, ideally, politically united."
"However, in order to be politically united and cohesive, Europe needs to address issues of momentous historical importance transparently."
"Mr President, I believe we need to reflect very deeply on the issue of immigration."
"There can never be enough discussion of the subject of legal immigration, just as there can never be enough discussion on the integration of immigrants."
"I often reflect - and I still do not know the answer - on the problem of integrating immigrants into society, and I sometimes wonder whether integration is not another, new form of oppression of cultures which are different from ours and should therefore be fully respected."
"One of the speakers mentioned the subject of an interesting debate just now, which took place both in Florence and in my own town, Lecce, a town where we have to have no fear of dialogue or the presence of people who do not think in the same way as we do."
"Here, too, we must listen to what is being said about globalisation, about new forms of poverty which genuinely exist, on north and south, east and west."
"We must reflect still more - I reiterate - on the way we may, to some extent, be oppressing immigrant or emigrant peoples which, I imagine, would like to return to their homelands and regain their identities and their cultural roots, but which certainly do not want to go back to economic poverty."
"Therefore, if we have to take economic measures, it is essential that we ensure that these do not lead to the oppression of cultures."
"With regard to this, therefore, I would like to draw the attention of the Commission to the issues of immigration and employment, in order to avoid employment, rather than being a uniting factor, becoming grounds for fresh dispute between the immigrants in our States and those who need to convert their business activities."
"Consider the industrial crisis in our country, President Prodi, and the resulting need to retrain the work force through substantial, genuinely incisive, large-scale training measures."
"Training is also something which depends on culture, and it must be promoted if it is true that Europe wants to continue to grow, as you maintain."
"Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Dutch delegation in the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities."
"The European Commission's three main priorities are a logical choice for its work programme for 2003."
"Preparation for enlargement is a top priority that is rightly seen by the European Commission as an exercise in managing the diversity of cultures, administrative traditions and economic structures."
"Likewise stability and security as a second priority receive my unqualified support."
"Fighting terrorism, management of the new external borders and control of illegal immigration are very important for both the current and the enlarged Union."
"Now however I should like to take a closer look at the third priority: sustainable development."
"While I am of course pleased that sustainable development remains a priority for the European Commission, there is more to it than that."
"It is solemnly promised that special attention will be paid to the impact of new legislation on the environment."
"In Annex 2 however I see that the main focus of attention is on completion of the internal market."
"I am of course curious about the announcement of the inclusion of the environment in EU legislation."
"I am also concerned about the status of this document."
"There is a great danger that it will again end up as a discussion document, resulting in fine words and intentions but not meaning anything concrete in terms of legislation."
"There is certainly plenty of scope for improvement in the energy and transport fields."
"I do not in fact see many initiatives in the area of environmental legislation."
"Perhaps this is not injudicious in the light of the problems with the implementation and enforcement of existing environmental legislation."
"It may also well be that over the next few years we shall no longer be able to develop more far-reaching legislation in a Union of 25 members."
"I have often pressed for a proposal to review the Batteries Directive."
"I know that work on this review has been going on for years, but reaching agreement internally is impossible."
"It is high time that the proposed amendment was sent to Parliament and the Council."
"I should like to hold you to the promise of March 2003."
"Mr President, the Commission work programme for 2003 is better presented than in the past."
"It is clearly based around important priorities and that is a point in its favour."
"The form, however, is still highly ambiguous."
"We are told that this programme will contribute to the Council's annual operational programme for 2003, which the Council is due to subsequently adopt in December."
"But what is the exact status of the Commission's contribution?"
"Should the Council accept it as it is or does it have the right to amend it to introduce new priorities?"
"Only the latter hypothesis is coherent with the hierarchy of the institutions."
"Naturally, we have no doubt that, in practice, dialogue within the institutional triangle will make it possible to iron out this problem."
"It nonetheless raises an important matter of principle."
"The first priority of the Commission programme is essentially to prepare for enlargement."
"We cannot fail to be impressed, when reading the actions to be taken in this regard, by their sheer number, which shows the scale of the Community acquis to be implemented by the candidate countries."
"Having listened to the representatives of these countries yesterday, having heard their reactions, we can clearly see that these countries are keen to enter the Union."
"They want to become part of the European family and are ready to make a great deal of effort to accomplish that."
"We must not, however, exhaust them with excess legislation and authority."
"We must have the wisdom to let them work at their own pace and accept variable geometry to a greater extent."
"The programme's second priority is entitled 'Stability and security' and this presents in particular measures relating to immigration."
"Having read the list of key initiatives several times, I must say that I did find the initiative concerning integration of legal immigrants, but I am still looking for the initiative that was supposed to cover repatriation of illegal immigrants."
"If it is there, it is well hidden."
"This quite simply shows that the Commission still has a long way to go before realising the scale of the problem we are facing today."
"On the other hand, in conclusion, we would like to convey our compliments on the paragraph entitled 'Relations with the enlarged EU's neighbours', which Mr Prodi emphasised earlier."
"These relations must indeed be redefined and in this respect the Euro-Mediterranean partnership could lead to the creation of a new community, which, it must be said, would be separate from the current one."
"It would be more natural for Turkey to be a part of that community rather than be part of the European Union itself."
"Mr Prodi has to leave early to return to Brussels because of the weather."
"Therefore we shall take Mr Prodi's response to the contributions now."
"I understand Mrs Palacio is going to field the questions during the catch-the-eye session."
"Mr President, it is not so much a question of time, rather that I have an appointment with Mr Erdogan in Brussels, which, as things stand, seems appropriate, given that the winner of the Turkish elections is visiting Brussels."
"I am going to meet him this afternoon, and I feel this is important precisely because I believe that we need powerful, direct dialogue on these matters."
"Indeed, the issues on the table are the most far-reaching, most fundamental matters, and I therefore feel it is appropriate to analyse them in some depth, as I am going to do in Brussels this afternoon, as I said."
"Now, however, I want to respond to the first criticisms. I will then leave my colleagues from the Commission the task of developing the themes and exploring them in more detail."
"Indeed, there are a number of issues which are absolutely essential for our future action."
"Mrs Grossetête mentioned our plans for the Mediterranean."
"I fully agree with her."
"I myself have on many occasions found myself in an awkward situation because of the way all the leaders of the Mediterranean countries criticise the Commission directly, accusing us of favouring Eastern Europe over them."
"My response has been simple: the demands of history have led us to take that road, but it is our intention, firstly, to strengthen the Barcelona policy, with whose development we are still encountering major problems, and secondly, to define the new policy which I have outlined - the ring of friends sharing everything except institutions with the Union - which, this is the point, I hope the Greek and Italian Presidencies will help to boost next year, given that we are going to have two consecutive Mediterranean presidencies in the same year."
"I have already discussed these matters and the Commission's desire to fulfil its responsibilities in this area with the Greeks, and I will discuss them with the Italians subsequently too, for I feel that this is an extremely important issue."
"Moreover, I call upon Parliament as of now to strengthen our joint action in the field of the Mediterranean."
"To return to the subject of our working methods, this is the age-old question of interinstitutional cooperation."
"It is a wide-ranging issue with major political implications, on which, however, there are a whole series of operational decisions to be taken, for we cannot limit ourselves to making declarations of principle."
"The Mediterranean policy will require us to take decisions affecting the budget and our whole way of working."
"I therefore feel that, as far as this matter is concerned, it is imperative that we focus primarily on interinstitutional programming."
"Once again, Mrs Grossetête mentioned the need for each Commissioner to present a preliminary report to the Parliamentary committee concerned."
"I have no objection to this. Indeed, it could be useful, precisely because this is a new process which we need to improve."
"We will assess this proposal and I am sure we will take on board the sense of it."
"The only thing I want to avoid is the danger of fragmentation."
"There are a number of points at which, despite the need for in-depth analysis, we need to focus on the overall picture, specifically at the stage of the preliminary proposal at the beginning of the process and again when the final decision is taken at the end of the process."
"I would like these two stages to remain plenary debates."
"Clearly, there will be times during the debate when technical, specific points need to be discussed - we have no objection to that - but the beginning and end of the debate are a matter for all of us, not just some of us."
"Mr Barón Crespo, first of all, the proposal on the Commission's programme is usually determined by the relationship between the Commission and Parliament, which is extremely delicate."
"I would point out that the Commission's programme for 2003 focuses on new initiatives whereas the Council's programme, with very few exceptions, deals with initiatives which have already been presented by the Commission but which have not been adopted."
"In this sense, it is on our relationship with the Council that we need to focus, for we now have a backlog of issues which Parliament has already dealt with."
"Of course, the Commission fully supports the European Parliament - we have been consistent in our support - ensuring that the Council involves Parliament on all the points of its programme."
"Moreover, the Commission defines the political priorities for the Council, and it has already presented them to the General Affairs Council of 18 November."
"In this regard, we should have a close relationship with the Greek Presidency too."
"As regards the point raised by Mr Barón Crespo concerning the political parties' statute, we will present the new proposal as soon as it enters into force."
"We are in full agreement with you as regards its importance, but we are just waiting for the right moment to present the proposal, which must be discussed by everybody together."
"As regards the interinstitutional resolutions for 2004, I feel that what Mr Barón Crespo said is extremely important, and I fully agree with him."
"The Commission has constantly drawn the presidency's attention to the need to find solutions which will not upset the smooth functioning of the institutions."
"An agreement with Parliament is clearly necessary."
"When it became clear that there was a sort of legislative traffic jam, the Commission immediately made it clear that there needs to be coordination between Parliament's rhythm of work and the rhythm of work of the Commission."
"We immediately stressed that the new Parliament must work in tandem with the new Commission right from the start."
"As I see it, these decisions are highly necessary, but we are short of time because solutions have to be found before Copenhagen."
"I think we could discuss this proposal at the interinstitutional summit at the end of November/beginning of December with a view precisely to achieving an agreement before Copenhagen."
"I must stress the vital importance of this matter because what we have to avoid is a scenario in which we have the new Parliament, a Commission that will only be in office for three months and then a new Commission, with all the organs changing and, as a result, a complete breakdown in some areas of the system."
"We are extremely concerned about this."
"I fully share Mrs Frassoni's concerns regarding sustainable development, about which Commissioner Wallström is going to speak later on. Commissioner Nielson is going to talk about Johannesburg and Vice-President de Palacio is going to talk about transport."
"I would point out that our position at Johannesburg was very strong but also very uncomfortable."
"I am not ashamed to say that the countries of the Developing World, the African countries particularly in this case - indeed, Africa is the real major problem - are tending to make less and less of a distinction between Europe, the United States and other countries."
"This is something which should concern us all."
"Despite the fact that, in recent years, we have been acting in a genuinely responsible manner - consider Kyoto, the Everything but Arms initiative, incisive decisions opening up our markets unilaterally, incisive decisions regarding the Kyoto Protocol, incisive decisions on many aspects of development aid, for example in Monterrey, where it was we who obtained the minimum that could be obtained as regards foreign aid, even though it really was an absolute minimum - we must not be surprised if the developing world reacts by lumping us all together without distinction."
"This is a matter of great concern which requires very thorough analysis on our part."
"This is the way we must approach the issue."
"A further concern, expressed by Mrs Boudjenah, relates to the interpretation of peace and development issues overall, as a matter for general concern."
"I agree - as I said before - with this too."
"As regards matters such as the pluralism of the world and multilateralism, it is even more important that we adopt a role of absolute leadership because there is no one else who can keep these debates open, and we know how valuable they are at this time."
"It must also be said, quite frankly, that these are debates which can be kept open in a credible manner if there is a financial commitment, and that is very difficult to fulfil at this time."
"I therefore believe that we genuinely ought to open an in-depth political debate on this because, clearly, if we do not engage sufficient resources, we will be merely moralising to these countries rather than capable of changing the situation in the world."
"I would stress: we have done a great deal and we have played an exemplary role."
"We must continue to do so but we must improve both the quality and quantity of our efforts."
"This brings me to the last part of Mrs Poli Bortone's speech, which concerned immigration."
"It is true that we need to focus on legal as well as illegal immigration, it is true that the issue of integrating immigrants is something that needs to be discussed, but, first and foremost, there is the major issue to be resolved of whether or not integration is taking place."
"I have to say, however, that, for the most part, the immigrants who come to Europe are increasingly stable, increasingly willing to become integrated into the societies of our European countries, wherever they come from, and they become integrated more easily and to a greater degree in some cases than in others."
"I do, in any case, believe that, for the sake of the future cohesion of our societies, we must make a huge effort to facilitate integration as a priority."
"I would stress that it is an issue whose facets and characteristics vary greatly according to the country of origin and reception, but the risk of our societies becoming fragmented is a risk we cannot take."
"It has been a very powerful personal experience for me to visit different communities of Italian immigrants in Germany and Belgium over the years."
"Wherever I have seen that total integration has taken place, I have realised that this was the only way for them to live happy, serene lives on an equal footing with their fellow citizens."
"Total integration is, in my opinion, a major objective for an open society, and it must take place in full respect for all cultures, in full respect for diversities, with a view to achieving societies which are not afflicted by conflict or tensions."
"Clearly, this means that we need an immigration policy which is much more complex and much more cohesive than that we have been working on hitherto."
"We now move on to the catch-the-eye procedure."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, which I have the honour of chairing, welcomes the Commission's initiative to introduce a more compact and integrated political planning procedure."
"The Committee on Women's Rights had an opportunity for constructive dialogue with two Commissioners, Mrs Anna Diamantopoulou and Mr Antonio Vitorino."
"We had a most productive discussion, during which our opinions and positions converged on numerous points."
"In the light of that positive experience, I was surprised - and I wondered why - I was unable to find a single word on gender equality in the Commission programme for 2003."
"Mrs Diamantopoulou assured us at a meeting with our committee at the beginning of October that gender equality policy was a Commission priority and we have heard nothing to make us think otherwise."
"As you know, the Committee on Women's Rights has the exclusive privilege of being invited once a year to a one-day meeting with the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, and ten Commissioners, in order to discuss the specific issue of gender equality."
"2003 is an important year for the Committee on Women's Rights."
"The top priority is the Convention on the future of Europe and we have invested a great deal of time and effort in order to ensure that the new Treaty promotes gender equality."
"Secondly, we need the acquis communautaire on women to be applied, not just adopted by the candidate countries. ?hirdly, there is the question of gender mainstreaming and, of course, we still have a great deal to do to put our own house in order here."
"In all events, I welcome the initiative to put the Commission's annual progress report on sexual equality on the agenda for the spring summit under the Greek presidency."
"Another important priority is to ensure there is a balanced representation of the sexes at the 2004 European Parliament elections."
"The European Parliament and the Commission should set a standard for the other institutions."
"Finally, I am worried and concerned about the fact that the proposal for a new directive on combating sexual discrimination on the basis of Article 13 of the Treaty keeps being postponed."
"Have we any news on this?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, equal opportunities for women is a constant and permanent priority within Community action."
"I do not know whether the chairman of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities believes that they are not sufficiently covered in the texts."
"It is possible, but I would like to say that they are present as a matter of course, because it is our obligation and that is what we all want."
"With regard to some of your ideas on the question of mathematical equality in women's representation in the different bodies, I would like to say clearly that this does not appear in our programme."
"In this respect, I would remind the chairman - who furthermore is Greek - of the famous myth of Procrustes."
"Mr President, I would first like to thank Commissioner Bolkestein for creating the right framework for the future of Basle II."
"However, at the same time I would like to ask Commissioners Liikanen and Busquin what they are doing under their portfolios to ensure that Basle II is implemented without damaging the economy."
"Basle II is about the creditworthiness of companies, of small and medium-sized enterprises, and about the guarantees and transparency this requires."
"I believe that if we do not take precautions in good time here, we will end up with a huge problem involving ever more bankruptcies and enormous unemployment."
"I would like to address my second question to Commissioner Lamy. Mr Prodi mentioned that we want to drive forward the political democratisation of the WTO."
"To what extent has provision been made in the Commission's work programme for making progress with the parliamentary assembly?"
"As there are a lot of requests for the floor, in order to speed things up we will hear from the Commission at the very end rather than after every contribution."
"Mr President, Commission, Council, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs I intend sounding a somewhat negative note about the Commission's work programme and legislative proposals."
"We have to establish that against the background of the Lisbon process, against the background of a growing demand for labour participation, against the background of requests for flexibility in the labour market and against the background of labour mobility in Europe, the Commission's programme, and in particular its legislative programme, is lacking in ambition as far as we are concerned, and that we think is a pity."
"2003 threatens to be a lost year in this regard, certainly if we look at the legislation."
"There are only three proposals that go in the right direction."
"They are concerned with equal treatment, which has already been mentioned, the normal guidelines for employment and social security 140871."
"They are not new legislative proposals, though; they are amendments."
"We also note that delays are occurring in a number of areas or there is even the odd omission, as is the case with the European works council, which is not on the agenda for next year or perhaps only at the end of it."
"There is also a lack of initiative in the fields of parental leave, the protection of women workers, the disabled and atypical work, and I could go on."
"As a committee we have to note that on the legislative side the programme is not really satisfactory when it comes to the demands that are made by society and that are also socially based."
"We have already spent some time discussing this in our committee and with our Commissioner."
"We also believe that the problem does not lie with the Commissioner alone, but also and in particular with the Commission as such and with the Council."
"We therefore ask the Council in particular to take steps on the occasion of the forthcoming mid-term review of the social agenda."
"We must prepare this with the Commission and I hope that we can then make progress."
"At the moment there is really no chance of this happening and we are disappointed to a certain extent."
"But we live in hope and that is why we are asking that these steps be taken."
"I wish you long life and good health, Vice-President Martin, long life and good health to all the Commissioners, long life and good health to all the Members of the European Parliament and long life and good health to the Council representative too, although I know that the Council - the 15 Heads of Government - is very concerned to learn that the European citizens are living longer."
"I read in a wide range of newspapers this morning that a pill has been discovered that may well enable us to live to the age of 150."
"While I was on my way to Parliament, I remembered what it was I had to ask the Commission."
"While I have always been aware that Europe is now beginning to concern itself with pensions - and I have to say that last year's Commission rightly addressed the issue with particular enthusiasm, with, I believe, the support of the Commissioner responsible, Mrs Anna Diamantopoulou - even though the area is still the responsibility of the Member States, I have noticed that many governments, including, not least, the government governing me, Carlo Fatuzzo, too, are making statements which will lead the European citizens to believe that it is Europe which is going to cut their pensions, that it is Europe that is going to reduce their pension income, that it is Europe that is going to force them to tighten their belts."
"However, it is they, the national governments, which have to take these decisions, and if they are going to be forced to cut pension payments, then they must make that clear openly, frankly and honestly to their citizens."
"I would therefore ask you, Commission Vice-President, what the Commission intends to do to make the European citizens aware that Commissioner Diamantopoulou is not a fairy or a sorceress who is able to grant wealth to all the citizens but an evil ogre who is doing what the national governments tell her to."
"Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, I would like to focus essentially on section 1 of the Commission communication."
"The Commission has now achieved the major objectives established at the beginning of its term of office - enlargement and the reforms - but I feel that, in the final stage of its term of office, it must do more than just manage and implement what has already been achieved."
"I feel that the paragraphs entitled 'Defining the future of Europe' and 'Relations with the enlarged EU's neighbours' are the key to the realisation that we need to start laying the foundations for the Union's future political outlook as of now."
"After the accession we hope for of Bulgaria and Romania in 2007, we must turn our gaze resolutely in three directions: towards Eastern Europe, the Western Balkans and the Mediterranean."
"I welcome the openness displayed in the sentence '?the Stabilisation and Association process opens perspectives for membership'."
"I therefore agree with what President Prodi said: we must develop a ring of friends stretching from Russia to Morocco, without excluding the possibility of them acceding to the Union under the same conditions as the other countries which have already become part of it."
"This opens horizons for the future which will extend our project even beyond the geographical confines of our continent."
"While we are preparing to launch the widest and, perhaps, most important enlargement of the Union, we need to be aware of these possibilities."
"In any case, when Russia accedes to the Union - however far in the future - we will not be able to stipulate that only the part on this side of the Urals can do so, and that will bring great changes, particularly in the way the Union defines itself."
"We must therefore see the Union as a ring of concentric circles which are interconnected."
"This is the way for Europe to continue to keep its soul alive."
"The day when Europe ceases to concern itself with the countries beyond its borders will be the day when it loses part of its basic raison d'être."
"Mr President, I have a few specific questions about development policy for the Commission."
"You have said that we want faster spending because far too much remains unspent at the moment."
"In practice however this is still not happening."
"My specific question to you is: what new steps will you be taking to achieve this in your work programme for 2003?"
"You have also said that we must spend better, we want to move towards basic social spending such as education."
"You have accepted a figure of 35%, you have reached an average of 28%."
"What specific steps will you be taking to achieve this in your programme for 2003?"
"Thirdly, in Doha you took on the obligation to table proposals for the reduction of the agricultural subsidies and their conversion into rural subsidies before March 2003."
"When can we expect these concrete proposals in the area of agriculture, as a supplement to the Fischler package?"
"Fourthly, you promised to bring forward a supplement to the regulation of the gap between structural aid and emergency aid."
"This gap, the famous grey zone, is sometimes giving rise to one or two years' delay."
"When can we expect to see this specific regulation?"
"Fifthly, and in conclusion, in the context of migration policy - and Mr Prodi also made reference to this - you said that there is a need to conclude new partnership agreements with developing countries."
"The specific question is: what initiatives will you be presenting in this area in addition to the Cotonou Treaty that will actually do something about a regulated migration policy which - and let us start with North Africa and a number of the suppliers from the different regions - actually involves the relationship with the developing countries?"
"Mr President, we have the Mediterranean and Eastern Europe, but I should like to remind Mr Prodi, the Commission, and the other ladies and gentlemen here, that we also have Northern Europe and the Northern Dimension, and I would ask them to take this into consideration also."
"At present we seem to have all our attention on enlargement, but we must fight tooth and nail to hold on to the Lisbon objectives."
"Enlargement will place burdens on the EU economy, and that underlines the importance of having a competitive strategy to address that problem."
"For this reason, we must also be able to implement some difficult reforms at the same time as enlargement."
"We have to focus our attention on the applicant countries' ability to implement the Lisbon objectives."
"In the old Member States too it is necessary to give attention to the implementation of EU legislation."
"When enlargement takes place we shall particularly have to avoid distortions of competition due to the uneven implementation of directives, for example, in environmental and competition policy."
"The liberalisation process must be speeded up substantially in the electricity, gas, telecommunications and transport sectors."
"The situation at present is that consumers cannot count on economic growth."
"Investment is being put off and the markets are still constrained."
"Labour costs are high while at the same time there is considerable unemployment in Europe."
"Faith in the Stability and Growth Pact is being shaken."
"I would ask the Commission how it intends to integrate this ambitious timetable for enlargement with improved economic competitiveness in Europe."
"Mr President, the fight against terrorism has been, and must continue to be, one of our priorities, if not our main priority."
"There has been much progress in this field and in the field of cooperation in criminal matters and we have demonstrated that when we have political will we can be effective."
"I would like to ask whether you believe that now is the time, following this success in relation to cooperation in the criminal field, to carry out the necessary improvement in judicial standards in the European Union and the defence of individual rights."
"And I am referring to the current Union and the enlarged Union."
"I also believe - and I would like to hear the Commission's opinion on this - that there should be some coordination initiative in the police field which would put an end to these areas of confusion, which are so difficult to explain to the citizens."
"I am referring to Europol and others."
"I am less optimistic about immigration policy, however."
"There is a phrase in the work programme which I find truly extraordinary: to consolidate the immigration and asylum policy."
"I do not believe it is the fault of the European Commission, I am more than sure of that; but, to be frank, I think it would be very positive if we were to begin the immigration and asylum policy."
"Mrs Grossetête asked the Commission for more initiatives."
"I would ask the Commission for fewer initiatives."
"It has presented all the initiatives it should have presented."
"We have a package of proposals which make up a coherent and reasonable immigration policy."
"What we need to do is to begin to take decisions in this area."
"I believe that we should not increase the range of proposals so that the Council can just select little bits of them, but we must demonstrate political will in order to make progress in global terms."
"And finally I would like to welcome the proposal for integration policies and, above all, the idea of coordinating these polices with social policy."
"If we believe that immigrants must enter Europe for employment purposes, we must be effective in both areas, we need an immigration policy which works, but also a labour market which works, a social policy which incorporates immigrants in order to respond to the local problems which immigration creates."
"Mr President, maritime safety is one of the challenges included in the Commission's working programme for 2003."
"Unfortunately, we are currently facing the terrible accident involving the Prestige off the coast of Galicia, which makes this working principle all the more evident."
"I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Commission, by means of its Vice-President, on its rapid reaction and its cooperation with the Spanish and Galician authorities in relation to this dramatic event."
"I would also like to acknowledge the Commissioner for Transport and the European Parliament's Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, who have approved the Erika I and Erika II packages, which, had they already been applied, could perhaps have helped us to prevent an accident of this nature."
"In this respect, I would like to point out that the Directive on the monitoring of traffic - yet to be transposed - in Article 20, lays down the definition of areas of refuge, which, although they are vague, would allow vessels with problems to reach them to try to resolve them."
"We have examples such as the Erika, which was not authorised by the French authorities to enter the port of Saint Nazaire, or now the Prestige, not authorised to enter Galician ports, clearly due to the high ecological value of that coast."
"There should be further proposals for the creation of areas of refuge out to sea, sufficiently close so that vessels with problems can reach them and sufficiently far from coasts to prevent serious ecological problems, but which allow for immediate naval rescue actions with technical resources, both aerial and marine."
"And the measure, Madam Vice-President, if included in the Commission's programme, could be applied urgently without the need to wait for transposition of the directive."
"Mr President, the closure of Strasbourg Airport on Monday evening, which of course held us all up for quite some time, has prompted me to put a question to the Commission on the following subject."
"It would be a good idea to have an overview of all the aircraft within European airspace, coordinated centrally: within Eurocontrol, for example."
"Obviously it is the countries themselves that are responsible for national air traffic control systems, but would it not be appropriate to have a central overview of all the current and planned flights, whether they be civil or military, in order to improve utilisation of the airspace, reduce the number of delays and lessen the impact on the environment?"
"Mr President, while welcoming the programme presented to us today I must express some alarm that on page 12, under 'Key initiatives - sustainable and inclusive economy', the mountain has laboured and made a promise to produce a green paper on public services or services of economic interest."
"I find this extraordinary."
"This Parliament has repeatedly pointed out to the Commission and the Council over many years that there is an urgent need for a directive on a framework for services of general economic interest."
"My understanding is that the spring summit instructed the Commission to come forward with a proposal for a framework for services of a general interest by the end of this year."
"Yet what we have in this work programme for next year is the promise of a green paper to discuss the principles on which services of general economic interest might - might - be constructed."
"At the same time, we have a promise on page 12 that measures to complete the internal market, by eliminating barriers to the provision and take-up of services by business and consumers, will proceed next year."
"I do not find this acceptable."
"This House and the spring summit have been ignored."
"All the calls this House has made for universal services of general interest to the citizens of Europe to be guaranteed as a matter of urgency have been ignored, although this is a key part of European citizenship and of the social model we are so proud of in Europe."
"I would like a clear answer from the Commission as to why it is failing to do what this Parliament has asked it to do and what it was instructed to do by the Council at the spring summit, because this is not acceptable."
"Mr President, I have two questions."
"The first is about securing our external borders."
"I very much welcome the programme and proposals with regard to enlargement, and particularly the fact that you want to have uniform responsibilities."
"The question is this: when do you think the new Schengen manual will be available?"
"We will have common training programmes."
"When do you think this common training system will be operational?"
"What I would also like to request is that we should consider the compatibility of the technology being used and that we should also get Europol to carry out the proposed risk assessment as soon as possible."
"When do you think the system will be operating?"
"My second question is about migration."
"Our objective - and on this we agree - must be to create viable legal immigration mechanisms and prevent illegal immigration."
"However, the problem that arises here relates in particular to the area of asylum, where, although the Commission has made proposals, final decisions remain to be made in all areas."
"But we need decisions to be made quickly so that genuine refugees - who make up about 10% of applicants - can be helped swiftly and so that repatriation can be arranged for the remaining 90% that have to be rejected."
"Commissioner Vitorino, how do you intend to ensure that a system of this kind can finally be made operational and that we can secure Council approval?"
"Mr President, I would like to thank those of the Commissioners who, out of respect for Parliament and the debate on the work programme, have been able to spend a couple of hours with us - once a year."
"I admire Mrs de Palacio for answering questions across all areas of policy, including those of her colleagues who have other priorities."
"What I have said amounts to praise for those of her colleagues who are actually here."
"Mrs de Palacio, Commissioners, I have read the work programme very carefully."
"It is better than what you have usually come up with."
"In my areas of interest at least, it is more helpful."
"You have integrated the concept of sustainability throughout, as we have always requested."
"I really get the impression that you have done your homework, that you have understood the issues and that the external presentation at least has been very well done."
"'External presentation' and 'internal behaviour' are, however, two very different things."
"My queries relate in particular to internal behaviour."
"Let us consider the leftovers, that is to say the things you are carrying forward from 2002. In my field, which is environmental policy, there are some areas that Mrs Schörling and Mrs Frassoni and others have touched upon, such as policy on chemical products, PVC, the batteries directive, and various others."
"If I consider why that is, I see that one of the main problem areas is that you cannot achieve any internal agreement."
"You have conflicts between environmental, industrial and trade policy, and there is also often conflict between consumer protection and trade policy."
"If you cannot resolve these internal conflicts, if you cannot manage to demonstrate leadership and say 'OK, the Commissioner responsible has power over the inter-service procedure', then we will always find ourselves with 'leftovers'."
"That is why I am asking you, Mrs de Palacio, how you intend to resolve conflicts within the Commission in future, and whether you are willing to air these conflicts in a more open and transparent way."
"We can only ever guess the reasons why no proposals are presented to us."
"We learn them already from the grapevine and the rumour mill."
"We mostly seek answers in Commissioner Liikanen's areas of responsibility, sometimes, often enough in fact, we seek them in Commissioner Lamy's areas, and sometimes in Commissioner Bolkestein's areas too."
"I regard them as being the naughty boys."
"I am not referring to poor Commissioner Wallström and Commissioner Byrne, who always do their best but are sometimes pushed to one side."
"I expect your internal behaviour to reflect the way you present things externally."
"That means that you will also present the proposals that you have presented to us very quickly in future."
"Mr President, I was hoping to address my questions to Mr Solbes, but I do not see him in the House, and so Mrs de Palacio or Mrs Diamantopoulou may answer instead."
"I should first like to make a request: please do not abuse the adjective 'sustainable'."
"It is rather like those awful restaurants where they put cream or parsley on everything and in the end ruin every dish."
"'Sustainable economy', Mrs de Palacio and Mrs Diamantopoulou, means absolutely nothing."
"It is just a nod towards the environmentalism of the Greens, towards the left with 'solidarity' and towards the right with 'economics'."
"In short, a little semantic correctness would not go amiss."
"Let us now deal with some rather more serious matters that I have noticed."
"President Prodi has spoken of a single cycle of economic policy coordination - I am referring to point 2.3, b4) - and, indeed, only a single cycle is needed because the objectives laid down in the Stability Pact and the broad economic policy guidelines must coincide with those of the real economy, in other words the labour market and, above all, welfare."
"You realise that the labour market and welfare are two sides of the same coin."
"Well, while the labour market already has an implicit coordination process - the Luxembourg process - which has been making positive headway for six or seven years now, the same is not true for the more recent (as one might say) Laeken process for coordinating welfare action, which has yet to be put into practice."
"The two systems are unbalanced: much has been done in the area of close coordination on the labour market, while everything still remains to be done as regards welfare."
"My request is therefore that the two coordination processes be synchronised as fully as possible so that they then make it possible to fulfil not only Lisbon but the Stability Pact too."
"Mr President, in relation to the Commission's work programme on enlargement we have, as we would expect, a very thorough and indeed a very formidable programme to achieve in the next 12 months, in which the Commission has to address a large number of areas including, in particular, monitoring the progress of the candidate countries."
"Can we be assured that even when the treaties are signed there will be no winding down of DG Enlargement?"
"That will ensure that we have the staff to carry out the monitoring process, which is still important right up to accession."
"Secondly, the focus will inevitably move on to the stability of our borders, as the Commission says in its programme, but it does not say what new steps we are actually going to take."
"We talk about relations with Moldova, for example."
"Moldova is very close to being defined as a failed state."
"How are we actually going to deal with it and with Ukraine, with which we have still tried to have relations?"
"In relation to Bosnia and Kosovo, are we simply going to carry on as before, or are we going to look at enhancing our work there in order to better secure our borders?"
"Finally, we put emphasis on the CFSP in preparing the Commission's role in that area."
"However, defence procurement and securing the future of European defence industries are important."
"To that end we have previously had action plans from the Commission on how it can use its instruments to support that process."
"Commissioner Liikanen keeps promising me that he will put forward a further action plan, but I see no reference to that in the annual programme."
"Are we going to see an action plan on future defence industries and on defence procurement, and are we going to see the Commission using the instruments it has available?"
"That concludes the catch-the-eye procedure."
"Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the presentation of the Commission's legislative and work programme for the year 2003 constitutes an important stage in working relations between our two institutions."
"In fact, the presentation of this programme today marks the end of an interinstitutional schedule of financial payments agreed between our two institutions in January 2002."
"As this is the first exercise of its kind, it will clearly be possible to improve a number of points next time and I shall take the liberty of coming back to this matter at the end of my speech."
"In February 2002, the Commission presented to Parliament the annual political strategy for the year 2003."
"On the basis of this document, a true interinstitutional dialogue took place, from April to July, between the parliamentary committees and Commissioners concerned, on the scope and implementation of political priorities in each specific field of competence."
"In July, within the Conference of Committee chairmen, jointly with the Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs de Palacio, we carried out an assessment of this year's programme."
"Then, in September, the Conference of Committee chairmen, also in the presence of Mrs de Palacio, drew up an inventory of the various legislative proposals that the Commission intended to introduce in its legislative and work programme for next year."
"The document that Mr Prodi has just presented is therefore, to a great extent, the outcome of the dialogue which has taken place throughout the year."
"Now, in order to conclude this process, Parliament is due to decide on a motion for a resolution on 5 December."
"In this regard, I would inform you that the parliamentary committees decided, at the meeting which took place the day before yesterday, to prepare, each in their own field of competence, a contribution which can be included in this motion for a resolution."
"Mr President, allow me to inform the European Commission, as well as Parliament, of my positive assessment of the interinstitutional schedule of financial payments which has been established for the first time."
"More or less one year ago, the Commission position, as you will all recall, was practically the opposite."
"The establishment of this schedule of financial payments required a great deal of effort, in particular by Parliament."
"In this regard, I would like to highlight the remarkable work of our colleague Mrs Malmström, during negotiations with the Commission."
"In fact, it was possible to establish the schedule of financial payments due to the mutual trust that has been created between our two institutions with regard to legislative programming."
"Naturally, on the basis of this year's experience, the various stages will be better understood and can be implemented next year."
"A true culture of planning and interinstitutional programming is currently developing between the European institutions, which is surely moving in the direction expected by our citizens."
"In this regard, allow me to conclude my speech by recalling that at the time of the Seville Summit of 21 and 22 July this year, the European Council decided that the Council would establish a work programme."
"I therefore hope that the resolution upon which Parliament is to vote on 5 December will also address the Council with a view to establishing its programme for the year."
"I would like to end by emphasising the importance of dialogue with the Council."
"I would like to thank Mr Haarder in particular, who has always been there when we needed him."
"I believe it is worth emphasising, Mr Haarder, because it is good to hear congratulations, too, from time to time."
"First of all, transparency in terms of knowledge and citizens' access to the legislative work that the European Union intends to undertake in the year ahead. Secondly, greater efficiency in carrying out legislative work, not forgetting that, thanks to better programming, Parliament, the Council and the Commission can inform the national parliaments and the citizens on legislative work and take full responsibility for it."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioners, Madam Vice-President, I would first like to make a few observations about the key points."
"The first of these is the enlargement of Europe."
"We have already heard several times that the signals indicating the direction the Commission would like to go in here are too weak."
"Let us take a look at the Balkans, for example."
"This region in particular now feels as if it has been rather abandoned - the finance available to it has been reduced."
"That may be justified, but that is all the more reason to give stronger political signals offering these countries two alternatives: either the route to membership at a later stage, or some other option."
"The Zagreb Summit is coming up."
"I do not know what the Council has in mind, but I would like to know, Madam Vice-President, what the Commission intends to propose at the Zagreb Summit, at Zagreb II that is, about what should happen in the Balkan region."
"Is it being specifically identified as an enlargement region once the first round of enlargement has been completed? Yes or no?"
"Secondly, there is the issue of stability and security."
"The point I am about to make has already been made, but I think it could be made more forcefully. Our security is very closely linked to our viewing other, neighbouring regions, ranging from the Balkans to the Caucasus, as partner regions with which we have appropriate treaties and where we intend to extend cooperation against cross-border crime and illegal mass migration."
"On a more positive note, let us look at energy."
"I think we can agree on this, Commissioner."
"You have brought forward a raft of energy policy proposals, including proposals on energy policy in relation to nuclear safety."
"We are now in a position to discuss the details and I am sure that we will not always agree."
"I believe, however, that it is high time we regarded a coherent energy policy strategy as being part of our external policy."
"What regions do we want to link more closely with Europe, especially as regards energy security policy?"
"Let us consider the Caucasian region - or are we leaving it up to the Americans to act there?"
"The Balkans are also involved in terms of the various pipelines that need to be developed and secured there."
"This combination of external policy strategy with security policy strategy and even including energy security needs to be made far stronger."
"Thirdly, there is the issue of a sustainable and inclusive economy. Here I think that what is lacking is a statement about economic policy cooperation, particularly with the European Central Bank."
"The way this cooperation has been implemented in practice so far is by no means satisfactory."
"I do recognise, however, that Mr Prodi's observations about increased flexibility in relation to the stability pact are not reflected in the work programme, not directly at least."
"In which case I do not know why he highlighted that point, but so be it."
"However, the issue of how we can cooperate with the Central Bank to assume greater responsibility in terms of economic policy, and therefore also employment policy, needs to be given greater emphasis."
"On page 14 there is a paragraph about services of general interest."
"I am amazed that the Commission should be saying again that we need to initiate a debate on this."
"A much-needed debate is already taking place, although unfortunately not one in which the Commission has played any really significant role."
"Mr Prodi's comments on this need to be taken really seriously if we are to make progress in this area, because services of general interest are an important issue not just in France but also in many of our Member States, and we need to have a clear line on this."
"Lastly, I would like to make some general points about the legislative proposals."
"Madam Vice-President, you know that you are our partner in the debate on alternative forms of regulation."
"We in this House have a very great interest in seeing laws adopted more quickly and in applying the legislative process in a more flexible way, but to do that we need the cooperation of the Commission and the Council."
"I will say something about that in a moment."
"The Commission is willing to help on a great many issues."
"It is perhaps a little too fearful that we want to take away its right of initiative."
"We do not want to do that, nor are we able to."
"Even if we did want to, we could not take it away from you."
"But that does not mean you are entering into a more productive dialogue with us."
"And it does not mean, above all in areas where we have delegated our legislative competence, that we have a right of call-back, because we are after all surrendering some of our competence and so we want something in return."
"There is one thing that I find totally incomprehensible. I am sorry to say that and have only praise for you, Mr Haarder, for sitting here for hours and listening;"
"I really admire that. I have in mind the very disappointing opinion adopted by the Council, by Coreper, on the issue of other forms of legislation."
"It is not often you see something so restrictive and backward looking. You really cannot expect Parliament to surrender legislative competence as long as you are not willing to budge an inch yourselves!"
"You talked about comitology as if it were the holy of holies, as if it were our primary objective!"
"That really is not acceptable."
"We need to have a situation in which Parliament and the Council are to some extent treated as equals."
"We do not want to impinge on your rights, but please respect ours!"
"Mr President, this has undoubtedly been a good debate between the institutions and 2003 will be an important year against the backdrop of enlargement."
"We must ensure the good functioning of the Union for our citizens present and future."
"That applies very much to the process of how we legislate, how we implement legislation and how we enforce legislation."
"The debate has been very wide-ranging debate as regards how we legislate in this process."
"However, I could not help thinking while listening to the many detailed questions that we have heard that perhaps more of what I and my colleagues have been dealing with could have been dealt with at an earlier stage in the Committees, to give us a more strategic debate here today."
"On behalf of my group, I welcome the emphasis on impact assessments and the emphasis on involvement of our citizens and transparency."
"That has to be the right way forward."
"I would raise some concerns about the Commission's powers of enforcement in terms of infringement proceedings as we move towards enlargement."
"We must make sure that sufficient resources and measures are available in this respect."
"The same goes for the Court."
"The Court has to be fully resourced in order to carry out its tasks in the difficult times that lie ahead."
"We have had a good debate, a good exchange, but I still am left wondering whether it has truly been the strategic debate that should have engaged all of this House and our citizens outside."
"We have done well but we could still do a lot better."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Caudron has just given us his shopping list of good intentions and I have no intention of repeating it."
"I would just like to say that although I am happy with it, I would have preferred a more strategic debate."
"I, like Mrs Wallis, think that we have to set priorities and that Europe has to decide on its place and its role in the world and in the future of the world."
"This is really the main priority for me and for us."
"We must start by adapting our own institutions and asking ourselves whether our own house is in order."
"I would again ask for attention to be given to the place of the regions, this is becoming an important issue."
"So many small states will be joining the European Union, with all that entails, including their own language, their own place in the Council, in Parliament and in the Commission."
"The constitutional regions, the other regions too, the regions with their own language, their own culture, even with legislative and their own implementing authorities, will continue to be deprived of all this and be left behind empty-handed."
"I would ask whether they will then have to become a state to gain a respectable place in the European Union?"
"That is an incitement to separatism."
"Secondly, we want the full integration of the countries that are going to become the European Union with us."
"Should we then, however, not do more so that the populations of these countries actually become involved?"
"I hear the complaint for example that very many people are unable to find European Union documents available in their own language."
"However, I want to focus more attention, because that was yesterday's debate, on the circles of partner countries that we have to develop."
"I think that this debate about the expansion of this second circle is of fundamental importance if we wish to conduct the debate about the boundaries of the Union in a positive manner."
"Personally I do not believe that Europe should extend to the borders of Iraq, Iran and Syria, but we do have to be able to offer Turkey an attractive partnership."
"At the moment this is something we are really talking too little about."
"Then there is our role in the world."
"Peace and development currently involve more than simply the follow-up to Johannesburg."
"As long as Europe is more part of the problem of poverty than part of the solution, then, Mr Nielsen, we have to place a big question mark by all the good things we undoubtedly do."
"Because we know that as long as we engage in agriculture, as long as we engage in trade as we currently do, we are more part of the problem."
"Mr President, if one reads the Commission's programme of legislation carefully, one suddenly happens upon a European army: the Rapid Reaction Force."
"This is to be established in accordance with what has been called the 'all-purpose article': the famous Article 235, now Article 308, which is unchanged in the Treaty of Nice."
"This shows that there is no limit to the EU's interference in the affairs of the Member States."
"With so many new countries due to join the EU next year, it would be better for us all to focus on consolidation and simplification of the existing legislation rather than continuing to build the Brussels legislative pyramid higher and higher."
"This could be done as follows: the Commission should only be permitted to put forward new proposals on condition that the corresponding old legislation is deleted in the process."
"All new proposals should be presented in their legal context, so that it is possible to compare proposals for new legislation with the existing legislation."
"No new proposals should be presented unless they are accompanied by proposals regarding the means of consolidation of the existing legislation in the field."
"This approach would make it possible to reduce the acquis communautaire from more than 85 000 pages to perhaps 25 000 pages."
"Having accomplished this, we should strive to simplify binding legislation, transforming it into non-binding recommendations; regulations can be transformed into framework legislation, total harmonisation directives into minimum harmonisation directives, and uniform rules into voluntary rules."
"Attempts to create a federal state with an ever increasing amount of legislation could be replaced with a decentralised confederation of states, which would allow the Member States a great deal more freedom."
"This is our vision of the form the Commission's legislative programme should take."
"We want a Europe of democracies based on diversity, as we believe that people will be happier if they can determine their own affairs as far as possible without interference and free from detailed rules drawn up by bureaucrats and lobbyists in Brussels."
"Mr President, I will speak very briefly to allow other colleagues to reply in relation to the areas specific to their responsibilities."
"I would firstly like to say that we are pleased to be able to hold this debate, which has been preceded by work by all the Commissioners in the committees, and which, in the end, has led to a result which we can regard as positive."
"In this respect, I would like to thank you, on behalf of all the Commissioners, for the input provided systematically in the debates and discussions which have taken place in the various committees in order to fine-tune our programme."
"When we presented our first proposals, we received initial reactions from Parliament's relevant committees."
"I am therefore grateful for the work carried out."
"This has been an initial test whose result has not been homogenous in all the committees."
"I hope that next year it will work perfectly in all of them."
"Secondly, in relation to enlargement, I believe that President Prodi has been very clear."
"There is no question that 2003 is still the main priority."
"We must pursue the negotiations with the countries which are going to enter in the second wave and ensure that all the changes and adaptations which the candidates entering in 2004 have committed themselves to are being implemented and carried out."
"This clearly requires considerable effort on the part of the candidate countries, and also of the Commission, in terms of cooperating with them in order to facilitate this work and rigorously verify that it is carried out."
"If it is not, mechanisms will have to be implemented in order to correct the situation."
"After enlargement and with the perspectives we have, what will happen?"
"The President has clearly pointed out that we will have to decide on issues relating to the countries of the former Yugoslavia and also that circle of countries with which we have special relations."
"I believe that that will be the challenge we will have to discuss, develop and monitor."
"But at the moment the priority - let us make this very clear - is what we have on the table: the 2004 countries and those countries, in principle, Bulgaria and Rumania, which should enter in 2007."
"With regard to Turkey, we are in a situation of stand-by, of waiting, simply because Turkey is yet to fulfil the political requirements for entry into the Union."
"In the economic field, I will say that the Commission - this is the third priority, as the President has pointed out - will continue to implement the structural modifications necessary to promote the Lisbon project."
"The European Union, as the most developed knowledge-based economy, which aims for full employment, will in 2010 be the most competitive society."
"That is how we are going to continue to work, and, in this respect, I would point out that, with regard to the Stability Pact, we have the framework of the Treaties, which are very clear, including the Protocol, in which figures are clearly mentioned - such as the 3% of deficit and 60% of debt - and it is true that at the Barcelona Council we have been asked to work to create greater economic coordination - which was mentioned earlier, by Mr Barón for example."
"The Commissioner responsible, Mr Solbes, has given us an initial presentation with regard to the approach and the timetable, and soon the relevant specific documents will be presented."
"With regard to the other aspects, I will only make a couple of brief comments on issues falling within my own competence."
"There has been mention of the problems of legislation and the problem of commitology, ladies and gentlemen."
"We know that, at the moment, by means of the high-level group of interinstitutional cooperation, we are negotiating certain agreements with the Council."
"On this particular problem we do not have a real agreement and we are trying to find some common ground."
"I believe that, in any event, there has also been progress in this field and that the progress has been made during this last year."
"We must continue along this road."
"I believe that the possibilities for improvement are favourable."
"In this regard, I would like to say that the Commission will continue to work with Parliament and also, of course, with the Council."
"In this way we will manage to find a conclusion on this issue."
"With regard to resources and ambitions, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, despite everything, the results of the development and process of European Union construction clearly indicate that our ambitions are great, but that we are achieving them."
"Of course, the Commission can always ask for more human resources and has done so, specifically in view of enlargement."
"An agreement has been reached on the minimum necessary."
"I can only say that we would have liked even more."
"If anyone insists on this area, I believe we are working with minimum resources, but that we are achieving a good result."
"I will end by commenting on the specific issues that fall within my competence."
"There has been mention of the Single Sky and responsibility for Eurocontrol."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Single Sky does not mean that flight plans are going to be decided by the Commission."
"Flight plans are still coordinated within Europe by Eurocontrol, not only for the Fifteen, but for all the members of Eurocontrol, of which there are now more than thirty."
"They are different things; the Single Sky involves another series of areas which mean the harmonisation of management rules within the European Union and compatibility of inter-operative systems, management systems, integrating them into a network."
"Specific execution is still in the hands of the States and global coordination in the hands of Eurocontrol."
"In the other area, in Mr Ripoll's area, I would like to say that what this Prestige tragedy - which we all regret, especially the Commission - demonstrates is that we were right."
"We were right to demand greater speed in the approval of measures and in the application of the measures proposed."
"Unfortunately, the Council, Parliament and the final agreements did not achieve much; there were more difficulties than we expected and they have been delayed."
"And since they have been delayed, regrettably, the Prestige accident has taken place."
"Let us hope that the early implementation of the 'Erika I' package - I have asked the Ministers for it to enter into force before next June - and of the 'Erika II' package, in February 2004, will prevent any further accident such as that suffered by the Prestige or by the Erika three years ago."
"With regard to areas of refuge, amongst the proposals in the 'Erika I' and 'Erika II' packages, there are some which call for the different countries to determine and stipulate appropriate ports for dealing with emergency situations."
"Of course, Galicia is part of 'Natura 2002'."
"When talking about certain things, we must bear in mind all the available information, not to mention the difficulties for some ports on that coast, which I know very well and better than certain others."
"Mr President, I would ask that Mrs Diamantopoulou, Mr Nielson and Mr Vitorino may speak next, since many issues have been addressed to them."
"Mr President, first of all, as there have been many references to the presence of the Commission in this very interesting debate, I would like in turn to thank those Members of Parliament who were patient enough to stay and give definitive answers to specific questions."
"Mr President, in addition to the answers already given by President Prodi, I would like to call the attention of the House to the fact that as far as return policy is concerned, very intensive work is under way on the programme for return to Afghanistan, thanks to the commitment of the Danish Presidency."
"In 2003 the Commission will present a directive on minimum rules on return policy, above all in order to guarantee the mutual recognition of return decisions taken by a Member State."
"Such decisions should be automatically recognised and executed by the other Member States."
"The Commission has recently presented a proposal for a European return programme."
"That is already under discussion in the Council's specialised working groups."
"When it comes to integration policy, we have put forward a proposal to create some pilot projects between 2003 and 2005 in order to promote the exchange of best practices as far as integration policy is concerned."
"However, it has to be recognised that there is no explicit legal basis in the Treaty for dealing with integration policy at European level."
"Therefore we need to discuss the added value of addressing integration policy in European-wide terms."
"Thirdly, as far as immigration and asylum is concerned, I can reiterate that the Commission has put forward all the proposals asked of it by the Tampere European Council and the Laeken Council."
"The time has now come for the Council to decide."
"The only two new elements of asylum policy that we are taking into consideration are two proposals that are included in our programme for 2003."
"The first one concerns resettlement policy and the second protection in the region - the possibility of asking for asylum outside the territory of the European Union."
"These two proposals will follow very closely the consultations launched by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees."
"Thirdly, concerning the Seville Conclusions, I would draw your attention to the fact that the Commission has already presented to the Council the proposal on mandates for new readmission agreements with the People's Republic of China, Albania, Algeria and Turkey."
"In June 2003 we are supposed to present, as set out in our programme, the report on burden sharing on external border control."
"We are now preparing a report on the financial allocations for partnerships with third countries aimed at tackling illegal immigration."
"The report aims to identify effective allocations of financial tools, possible shortcomings and the vulnerabilities that must be overcome in the future."
"When it comes to external borders, I can confirm that the Commission intends to present a reform of the common manual on external borders in March 2003."
"All the other actions asked of us in Seville, such as joint training and joint operation in the control of external borders, are already being developed by the appropriate Council working group and will be financed by the Commission's ARGO programme."
"Finally, we recognise the fight against terrorism as a priority for 2003."
"As far as legislative action is concerned, priority should be given to the fight against sources of financing for terrorism, and several of the proposals included in our programme address this challenge."
"As Mrs Terrón i Cusí said, we intend to bring forward proposals concerning common procedural guarantees in criminal procedures."
"We have launched a consultation and intend to build upon the results of that consultation in a green paper."
"We shall therefore be bringing forward a proposal on common minimum rules on criminal procedure guarantees in the 15 Member States by the end of next year."
"Mr President, I should like to respond to the more specific questions raised by Mrs Frassoni and Mr van den Burg."
"To Mrs Frassoni, who talked about the outcome of the Johannesburg Summit, I will start by saying that the Commission in many ways shares the worries about the softness of some of the decisions taken there but this has been duly commented on."
"As regards the question of the relationship between international agreements on the environment and the WTO framework, in Johannesburg it was a non-event and nothing new happened: nothing was added to WTO, nothing was subtracted."
"Johannesburg was an attempt for the two sides to see if that balance could be changed - and it was not changed."
"For that reason not everyone was happy, but there is a limit to the unhappiness."
"The second question from Mrs Frassoni concerned the category II initiatives which are too weak and unclear."
"I agree that the risk is that these weak initiatives do not add up to anything substantial."
"The hard core of follow-up actions for the European Union to Johannesburg will be our water and energy initiatives."
"These are not going to be weak or unclear."
"They are already on the agenda for the spring European Council and we are already engaged with the Member States in clarifying these initiatives, which we see as big and important."
"I agree with Mr van den Burg that we need more rapid disbursement, especially regarding activities covered by the EDF."
"Things are moving forward and are somewhat better than they used to be, but we still have unsolved problems concerning staff and structure."
"This is an ongoing battle."
"We are preparing to do bigger things in the HIPIC global health fund, education for all."
"All this depends on starting up the 9th EDF and I would urge Mr van den Burg when he returns to the Netherlands to make sure that the last remaining country in the convoy takes the necessary action, so that we are ready to access 9th EDF money."
"As regards the agricultural profile of Europe in these global negotiations, this is back on track."
"We managed in Johannesburg and we are still managing to keep alive the formulations embedded in the Doha language on this front."
"We still see the external actions there as part of the necessary process of adaptation, which we in Europe have to take seriously."
"This language is continually being confirmed at all the meetings."
"Yesterday in the General Affairs and External Relations Council this was again the case."
"We are on track."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Titley for his interest and consistency in following developments on the European defence industries."
"The Commission has invested a lot in this issue."
"We had a meeting of the enlarged external relations Commissioners in July at which some of the options for the Commission communication were discussed."
"Since then Mr Patten's service and mine have continued to work on this."
"We shall be having a further Relex Commissioners' meeting in December with the aim of defining a Commission vision of an optimum armaments policy for the European Union, ensuring that its defence-related industry is competitive and in a position to underpin the capabilities required for the ESDP."
"I hope that the next time this issue comes up for discussion we shall be able to present specific documents."
"The final speaker is the President-in-Office of the Council."
"I am pleased that he has been present in person throughout the part-session, which demonstrates respect towards Parliament."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Haarder, a former Member of this House, will now close the debate, and I would ask you to pay careful attention to what he has to say."
"Silence please!"
"- (DA) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, it has been a great pleasure to take part in this dialogue, which is the first of its kind. I know this because I was sitting over there as a Member of Parliament last year when the Commission presented its legislative programme, and at that time the way of working was completely different."
"Moreover, there was criticism from Parliament that we have heard nothing of today."
"This is a testament to the great progress that has been made in the dialogue between the Council and Parliament, and I am happy to be present on this occasion, too, and to contribute to the dialogue for a couple of minutes, without delaying the start of the voting at 12 noon sharp."
"The Presidency is very pleased with the Commission's proposals."
"We have noted the priorities set by the legislative and work programme, and I can say on behalf of the Council that we support the Commission's intention to apply impact assessments to the chief legislative initiatives."
"This is something that Mr Clegg mentioned, and I believe Mrs Frassoni also talked about."
"In this connection, I wish to say to both Mrs Frassoni and Mr Swoboda that I too should have liked more progress to be made on the interinstitutional agreement on better lawmaking."
"We had an excellent meeting in Brussels on 1 October, which I believe both Mrs Frassoni and Mr Swoboda attended, and I sensed that we were very close to reaching tangible agreement on a number of points."
"Now, of course, time is running out, and so if we are to achieve a result by the end of the year, I would suggest that we now set ourselves some realistic goals, that we set out the points we can agree on and that we also show a degree of flexibility."
"The Council can make concessions on some points, for example these alternative or weak forms of regulation that Mrs Frassoni spoke about."
"I believe that we can reach agreement on that."
"Then there are other matters which are more difficult, for example comitology, where it is well known that different countries have different traditions; but let us now reach agreement on as much as possible."
"I am prepared to continue the dialogue, which has unfortunately been extended and interrupted."
"Let us resume this dialogue, and let us ask our government officials to give us a basis for discussion in the near future."
"It is now up to the Greek and Italian Presidencies, therefore, to draw up a joint work programme for the Council for the coming year."
"The new work programme will be presented to the Council in December: probably on 9-10 December."
"I understand that the vote on the Commission's programme here in Parliament is taking place as early as 5 December."
"I am convinced that the upcoming Presidencies will pay due regard not only to the Commission work programme but also to the views on the work programme that Parliament has expressed and is going to express in the days ahead."
"I also wish to thank Mr Vitorino for his words on asylum and immigration."
"As I happen to be President of the Council which deals with such matters, I should like to confirm everything Mr Vitorino said."
"We aim to complete new sets of rules on the reception of asylum seekers, the definition of a refugee and also the question as to which state is responsible for examining an asylum application."
"I would say to Mr Titley, who called for a policy towards our new neighbours after enlargement, that, the day before yesterday, the General Affairs Council in Brussels worked out a more long-term strategy, to be implemented in cooperation with the candidate countries; a strategy that shall ensure that these new borders towards the east are cooperative borders rather than another Iron Curtain."
"Finally, I wish to address Mr Barón Crespo, who raised the question as to what the situation will be as regards the Commission, which will include Commissioners from the new Member States, and how the transition will take place."
"As I announced yesterday, the General Affairs Council recommended the day before yesterday at its meeting in Brussels that accession take place on 1 May, and that the brand new Commission, including Commissioners from the new Member States, take office on 1 November, so that the new Parliament has enough time to approve the new Commissioners. In this way, in the intervening period, from 1 May to 1 November, there will be Commissioners from the new Member States who do not have a portfolio, and who therefore do not need to be approved by Parliament."
"But this is all just a recommendation."
"I mentioned it yesterday because it is of course only possible with the cooperation of Parliament, and it is in the spirit of this good working relationship that I mentioned the Council's thoughts."
"We are completely open to Parliament's thoughts on the subject."
"Thank you very much, Mr Haarder."
"The motions for resolutions on these items will be voted on in Brussels on 5 December 2002."
"Mr President, what I have said to the Council and to Minister Haarder is that they have decided unilaterally on a constitutional issue for the Union without consulting Parliament and without holding discussions."
"President Prodi has agreed with me and has told me that he is in favour of dealing with the issue at the Interinstitutional Summit at the end of the month."
"I have written to the President of Parliament and I would like to know whether the Presidency-in-Office of the Council is prepared to speak to Parliament about a unilateral decision which - as he has acknowledged - leads to absurd consequences."
"Mr Haarder is nodding in agreement."
"The debate is closed."
"Mr President, yesterday morning we had the part-session with our colleagues from the candidate countries. Although it was not an official meeting, it was one of the most interesting meetings ever held in this House."
"I therefore think that it is a matter for regret that although there is a verbatim report of proceedings for yesterday afternoon, there is no verbatim report of the historic proceedings yesterday morning, and I simply wanted to ask if that would be rectified."
"I shall pass that question on to the administration, Mr Posselt."
"Colleagues, yesterday morning here in this Chamber I remarked that the coming year, in terms of the European enlargement process, will be a year of parliaments and parliamentarians."
"I refer to the work we need to do, and the work that needs to be done in the parliaments of the Member States and candidate countries."
"While making a success of enlargement is a key priority, we should not forget our parliamentary relations with the rest of the world."
"On the contrary, we need to continue and develop relations with elected representatives from other states and not least with the US Congress."
"Today, therefore, I am very happy to greet four Congressmen who are in our Distinguished Visitors' Gallery: Mr Capuano, Mr Dooley, Mr Kind and Mr Moran, we warmly welcome you to Strasbourg and wish you a successful visit."
"I should also like to point out that some of the Members of Parliament from the delegations from the Accession States are in the gallery today for our important vote."
"The next item is the vote."
"Report (A5-0371/2002) by Elmar Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on enlargement: progress report (COM(2002) 700 - C5-0474/2002 - 2002/2160(INI))"
"Before the vote:"
"Mr President, I would simply like to say that a series of significant errors have appeared in the Spanish version and I would be grateful if, before the vote on paragraphs 9, 30 and 146, you could allow me to take the floor to clear up these deficiencies."
"I can assure you that we will make a systematic check of all the language versions after the vote, to make sure we render the texts compatible, but if you need to be called at a given point, please indicate."
"Before the vote on paragraph 3:"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on Monday the Council agreed to set the date of accession at 1 May at the latest."
"As I see it, we should not be arguing about one month or another, and I suggest that we should make the necessary adjustments here and accept the date of 1 May."
"However, to make sure that this does not put Parliament at a disadvantage when it comes to nominating the new Commission later on, we should stipulate an arrangement which will benefit Parliament now and add the following words after the date: '? and calls on the Council not to jointly nominate and confirm the new Commission with Parliament until after the European elections and to find a provisional interim solution for the accession countries'."
"I believe that we should avoid Parliament having its rights encroached upon by having nominations made before the elections."
"Mr President, I just want to inform you that the coordinators of all the political groups in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs have adopted the decision, which will be endorsed by the committee itself, to table an oral question during the next part-session regarding the decisions that the General Affairs Council adopted on matters of sensitive institutional importance without consulting the European Parliament."
"I take note of your comments."
"Mr President, could you explain procedurally what happened to paragraph 3?"
"The original text will be part of the vote on paragraph 3."
"Mr President, I believe that, with the rapporteur's agreement, we should at least change the date, because it still says 1 March here, and the additional wording needs to be discussed in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"However, the date ought to be changed."
"Mr President, I think Mr Swoboda's proposal is a very wise one."
"Let me return to paragraph 3 with what is now a new oral amendment."
"The President established that there was no objection to the oral amendment."
"Before the vote on paragraph 9:"
"Mr President, paragraph 9 of the text in the Spanish version reads 'apliquen este problema [apply this problem]' referring to the transposition of the Community acquis."
"I believe that it intended to say that this problem should be resolved as soon as possible."
"It is clearly a linguistic error and I would like it to be noted, as well as the other two, which are more important."
"As I assured you, we will check the linguistic versions."
"Before the vote on Amendment No 51:"
"Mr President, as long as the mover agrees, I would like to make a suggestion to you, namely that the word 'welcomes' should be replaced by the word 'notes'."
"There is a simple reason for this: the Lithuanian authorities and the Lithuanian Parliament have not yet given this their approval."
"However, I believe that it is important for the European Parliament that the Lithuanians should give their approval to this agreement, which is why we should use the word 'notes'."
"I hope that the mover can accept this."
"I would also like to suggest that we should take the first sentence from Amendment No 52 from the Group of the Party of European Socialists, which was originally withdrawn, and add it to paragraph 18."
"That way we will have overcome the technical problems and incorporated the essential message."
"I would be pleased if the members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists could agree to this."
"Mr President, the Spanish version of paragraph 30 says that 'no se debe contar de antemano con la aprobación de la opinión pública en los Países candidates [the approval of public opinion in the candidate countries cannot be counted upon on in advance]'."
"This is clearly absurd, in view of what our colleagues said to us yesterday, and therefore what it should say is that 'no se debe dar por descontada la aprobación de la opinión pública de antemano [the approval of public opinion cannot be taken for granted in advance]'."
"I believe this is an important point and it is worth correcting it."
"Again, as I assured you earlier, we will correct all of the linguistic versions after the vote."
"Before the vote on Amendment No 42:"
"Exceptionally, I will permit one brief comment, but there will be no debate on this."
"Mr President, I can assure Mr Poos that we understand perfectly what he is proposing and it is the inclusion of the second part of Amendment No 9 that we specifically object to."
"That is why we vote."
"We have the chance to register our views."
"Before the vote on Amendment No 10:"
"Mr President, let me cut a long story short."
"We were able to agree with the representatives of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats on a variety of compromises, including paragraph 1 on the Bene? decrees."
"Amendment No 6 now makes further changes."
"In order to achieve as broad a basis as possible, we will be voting for Amendment No 6."
"We will above all also be voting for this amendment in recognition of Mr Schröder's very successful efforts to steer a reasonable course as regards the Bene? decrees."
"Thank you for that early explanation of vote."
"Before the vote on paragraph 71:"
"Mr President, I am the rapporteur for this part."
"I would like to point out that this was originally drafted in English, and that the German translation by no means does justice to the English text."
"That is no doubt the reason why there is now an attempt to have a separate vote."
"I would just like to say once again that the English version is the only correct one."
"I note that the English is the authoritative version and, as I said earlier, we will ensure after the vote that all language versions are correct."
"Before the vote on paragraph 102:"
"Mr President, I would like to add a sentence which takes account of the more recent developments in the media sector, a sector which governments try to control and where they try to put pressure on the press."
"The sentence would read: 'However, insists on the need to further monitor the situation in the media sector so that its independence and pluralism are fully preserved, enabling Poland to satisfy the criteria prevailing in Member States'."
"This time I am not speaking to raise an interpretation or translation issue, but simply to say that the text 'in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council' has mysteriously disappeared from the Spanish version."
"We must therefore include this reference in this version, since it is important."
"Mr President, I will take this opportunity to say that, perhaps in the same mysterious way, my voting card disappeared at the beginning of the vote and I have not been able to participate in the first three nominal votes."
"This is not going to alter the outcome of the vote, but since I was present in the Chamber, I will communicate this information to the services of the House."
"Thank you for adding a touch of mystery to an otherwise interesting vote."

"Before the vote:"
"Mr President, I would just like to stress that the European Parliament supports the Commission proposal to make the most of this experiment in reducing rates of VAT for labour-intensive services."
"Nevertheless, we are very disappointed that the nine Member States that have taken advantage of this did not see their way to submitting their reports on this experiment as agreed, so that the Commission does not have a basis for preparing its own legislative proposal."
"I wish specifically to appeal to these Member States to submit their reports next year so that we can have a European legislative proposal on reducing rates of VAT for labour-intensive services by the end of this parliamentary term."
"Mr President, I know that statistics are dry and boring, and some people even say that they are the most subtle form of lie."
"Be that as it may, statistics are, it is to be hoped, an important way of decision-makers obtaining information and thus reaching the right decisions."
"The recommendation for second reading before us is about the Community statistical programme for the next five years, 2003 to 2007."
"At first reading, the European Parliament called in particular for a significant increase in funding, which seems really essential given the work to be done because of enlargement."
"The Commission and the Council accepted all our amendments except that one."
"I can only lament this short-sightedness."
"In a world that is becoming ever more complicated, and in view of the increasingly close-knit nature of the internal market, European statistics are gaining in importance, and the Commission and the Council in particular need to be aware of this."
"Unless a decision is reached today, Eurostat will not have any money to start this programme on 1 January 2003, and I therefore call on this House to adopt the common position."
"I say this in the hope that the Council will this time show more insight and be more open to our wise counsel!"
"(Loud applause and heckling)"
"Thank you for that vital explanation."
"I must remind the House that, under Rule 110a(4), the rapporteur is fully within her rights to speak for two minutes."
"She spoke for less than that so we must respect that right."
"(Laughter and loud applause)"
"(The President declared the common position approved)"
"Mr President, on a point of order, that does not come under Rule 110a."
"This is a second reading."
"The procedure came under paragraph 4, Mr Corbett."

"Before the vote on Amendment No 32:"
"Mr President, I would like to add the words 'the financial reference amount has to be compatible with the ceilings of heading 3 of the financial perspective'."
"Mr President, I would like to add a fifth footnote, beneath the table, saying: 'The financial reference amount has to be compatible with the ceilings of heading 3 of the financial perspective'."
"Mr President, I must point out that a linguistic correction needs to be made to the Italian text."
"As you know, this resolution was negotiated in English."
"In item 5, the expression 'notably a directive' is translated in Italian as 'ad esempio una direttiva' ('for instance a directive')."
"I do not consider this appropriate and I think it should be corrected."
"We will make the linguistic corrections after the vote."
"(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution)"
"Joint motion for a resolution"
"Mr President, to clarify this matter I would like the words 'and their constitutional regions' inserted after 'Member States'."
"This is a matter of real concern in many parts of Europe, including Scotland."
"Mr President, again, in line with the previous oral amendment, could we withdraw the deletion of this particular amendment and for clarification add the words 'if legally possible'?"
"It is now brought into line with the decision we took on the earlier amendment."
"Mr President, media concentration is an important issue not only at European and national level but also at sub-Member State level."
"There is a significant problem in Scotland."
"In the central belt of Scotland there are two serious broadsheet newspapers, The Herald and The Scotsman."
"The Herald has recently been put up for sale by the Scottish Media Group."
"Rumours have it that the current owners of The Scotsman - the Barclay Brothers - are trying to buy The Herald."
"This would result in a monopoly of serious media coverage in the central belt of Scotland."
"So when we examine media concentration we should look at its impact at every level."
"I would hope that the UK authorities will listen to the advice of this Parliament and ensure that the Barclay Brothers are not allowed to acquire ownership of The Scotsman newspaper."
"The situation, with regard to electronic media in particular, is steadily worsening."
"Biased information, censorship or distortion of news and views unacceptable to the ruling interests, widespread dumbing down and total disrespect for workers' rights are the order of the day in most modern media."
"The main reason for this is because information and news are concentrated in the hands of a few major owners who are also powerful businesses."
"Their aim is to control information and dictate an ideology, a way of life and consumer habits."
"Big business has aggressively penetrated sectors which belong to the state, with the state's blessing naturally."
"All we can do is to suggest a few improvements such as:"
"prohibiting media owners (even with just one share) from owning shares in companies which tender for public works or public procurement; insisting that shares in these companies be registered; ensuring that no one owns more than one of the same type of medium; and re-opening the debate on state-owned radio and television subject to constant and efficient public control."
"The resolution under discussion turns a blind eye to the real dangers and keeps to a general stand on pluralism and freedom of expression and incomprehensible (obviously compromise) proposals on how and if the European Union should legislate in this area, which is why the MEPs of the Community Party of Greece voted against it."
"The authors of these resolutions are starting from the idea that media concentration has accelerated substantially."
"In the quest for the philosopher's stone that would allow pluralism to be preserved, the European Commission is being inundated with requests."
"Some believe we should organise a broad consultation of professional bodies."
"Others think we should consider the political, economic and legal implications of a European regulatory framework or other regulatory options that would allow freedom of speech and the pluralism of the media to be safeguarded."
"A third group believes we should draw up a directive that sets limits for media ownership, or propose restrictions on the appropriate use of advertising resources in order to guarantee free competition."
"All these are ridiculous proposals whose only function is to imply that the European Parliament is a pillar of democracy."
"Most newspapers and some television channels belong to press groups which, in turn, belong to proprietary trusts of companies in many other fields: the likes of Vivendi, Lagardère, Bouygues and a few dozen others play a decisive economic and social role and are more powerful than the State and far more influential than the electorate."
"In the face of these powers, governments like the European authorities only bow down and respect the speculative stock market profits and board secrets."
". (PT) The best way of combating media concentration at European level is for no internal European market to be created."
"The increased concentration of large media groups and their greater market share is also a result of public authorities, which have liberalised and privatised this area, recently divesting themselves of responsibility for the media. An example of this is the current situation in Portugal."
"I deplore the fact that a specific defence of the role of public service and the need to ensure the survival of publicly funded television channels has not been included in the resolution, as the motion tabled by my group proposed."
"The best way of ensuring democracy and pluralism is to promote a strong, diverse and modern public sector, in other words, public ownership of the media, with mechanisms and instruments that provide genuine democratic control, not to mention the fact that this sector is of strategic importance in guaranteeing a country's sovereignty."
"I proposed an oral amendment to this resolution."
"I wanted to make it clear that within countries like Scotland and other so-called 'constitutional regions' there must be protection against concentrations of media ownership that threaten fair and pluralistic public debate."
"In Scotland today, there is a serious risk that the owners of The Scotsman newspaper may purchase its chief rival The Herald."
"Other similar regions have similar concerns, for example Catalonia, the Basque Country and Wales."
"The serried ranks of British conservatism, together with their EPP allies, blocked the oral amendment that would have given a high profile to this aspect of media freedom."
"That lies upon their conscience."
"Even without the oral amendment, the resolution makes a vital point about the relationship between free media and real democracy."
"I therefore voted for it."
"Mr President, as a member of the EU-Bulgaria Joint Parliamentary Committee, I am pleased that the Brok report has been adopted."
"In particular, I should like to underline the importance of paragraphs 121 and 122, which mention the Commission's intention to propose an increase in financial assistance and pre-accession aid for the countries that will still be candidates after 2004, which means Bulgaria and Romania."
"I hope that such aid will be substantial, and that there will not be just a modest increase in these resources because, while it is true that both countries - Bulgaria and Romania - still lack the economic prosperity that has enabled the other countries to be admitted first, it is also true that, for that very reason, they have greater need of aid to turn around their economies, which were particularly badly damaged by the years spent under the Soviet regime."
"Mr President, although the content of Amendment No 6 represents an improvement on the original Bene? compromise, it does not take account of the requirement in respect of the amnesty law before the accession of the Czech Republic."
"This law has no place in a European Community of values that calls for the protection of basic rights."
"We have therefore rejected this amendment."
"A newly reunited Europe cannot legitimise collective expulsion."
"Recital O in the report gives an important signal here and therefore has our unqualified support."
"Even if paragraphs 46 and 47 are basically welcome, what is missing from the report are specific demands in relation to the serious safety problems with the Temelin nuclear power station and the possible decommissioning of the station."
"We were able to support all the amendments and points concerning the closure of nuclear power stations that cannot be retrofitted and we support the highest possible level of nuclear safety."
"Whilst the report is deficient in more binding proposals as regards the Bene? decrees and the Temelin nuclear power station, it comes out clearly in many places against fraud, corruption and discrimination."
"We are very much in favour of specific demands for these problems to be overcome in advance of accession."
"With regard to Turkey, my group is in favour of the recommendation in Amendment No 7 for the creation of a special partnership between the EU and Turkey."
"We believe that it cannot be in the interest of Europe as a whole to allow Turkey to join the EU."
"On the other hand, delaying tactics holding out the prospect of the start of membership negotiations should be fiercely opposed."
"In conclusion I would like to say that we stand by the common European peace project and the historical need for future enlargement."
"However, as the quality of the enlargement process is and will continue to be very important, my group abstained during the final vote."
"I voted in favour of the Brok report on enlargement because I believe that plenary should send out a positive signal to the 10 countries applying for membership of the European Union."
"Nonetheless, I have serious reservations about certain aspects of the resolution."
"I think that the European Parliament should throw off its present financial straitjacket and call for a substantial increase in the Community budget, so that the cohesion countries can continue to receive structural aid and new members are not treated, financially speaking, as second-class citizens."
"I also think that our main priority should be to support the large sections of society in European countries being swept aside by neo-liberal policies, the sell-off of public property and the dismantling of welfare systems."
"In keeping with what I said yesterday, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece had no choice but to vote against the Brok report. Especially as today's vote was rejected by a conservative majority:"
"1) our amendments on Cyprus, including an addendum to the effect that the political solution must make provision for a two-zone, twin-community, federal state with one sovereignty, one international personality and one nationality , the amendment expressly calling for refugees to be allowed to return home and the proposal to replace the expression 'northern Cypriot leadership' with the expression 'Turkish Cypriot leadership'."
"The European Parliament also put a stranglehold on the Cypriot people by adopting an amendment calling on both sides to sign a framework agreement before Copenhagen."
"It is obvious, now that the Annan plan has been submitted, that the European Parliament is openly renouncing the framework of UN resolutions to the point at which it is denying refugees the right to return;"
"2) our amendments calling for the ban on Communist parties in numerous candidate countries to be lifted and for full recognition of the political rights of the Russian minority in Latvia."
"This result illustrates yet again that the pompous pronouncements of the European Parliament and of the European Union in general on respect for and the defence of human rights are pure hypocrisy and that enlargement is an anti-grass roots, anti-democratic exercise."
"- (DA) The Brok report contains numerous directions for the future Member States, which on some points beg the question as to whether this is really something the EU should interfere in."
"The report also supports NATO's plans to admit new countries: a line of action with which we totally disagree."
"The report contains some very positive elements."
"First of all, it shows clear support for the whole project and stresses that Turkey, too, should be taken seriously as a candidate country."
"Turkey must of course meet the requirements on human rights and democracy before there can be any talk of proper negotiations for its accession, but we oppose the reactionary line of thinking that wants to turn the EU into a white, Christian - it is tempting to use the word 'Aryan' - club."
"Even if the report is federalist on a number of points, therefore, we have to support its final adoption."
"When the Iron Curtain came down 13 years ago everyone in the West thought that the great changes in the East would consist mainly of greater freedom of speech and greater freedom for the voters to appoint politicians of their own choice."
"These changes have since been overshadowed by others."
"We now see a growing divide between rich and poor, a substantial collapse in employment, dilution of public service, uncontrollable numbers of cars, growth projects that are at odds with environmental protection and growing dependence on expensive imports and foreign companies."
"The people in these countries have been prepared to accept sacrifices, dilution and chaos in the hope that they would be rewarded with major inflows of money from the EU from the time of their accession."
"In their view therefore 2004 is coming too late and the subsidies for agricultural and regional development are far too low."
"Politicians in the west of Europe who are still unwilling to admit these newcomers or who want to economise on their accession are creating the impression that they are only interested in benefits for their own country and the companies established in them."
"As an Eastern European I would perhaps reject accession to the EU, but as a Western European I feel obliged to show solidarity with those peoples if they themselves wish to accede."
". (PT) I have voted in favour of the Brok report, although I did vote against paragraph 31 for two reasons:"
"1."
"Portugal did not participate in the Second World War and it therefore makes no sense for my country to sign a common 'European Declaration'."
"We cannot admit to having committed crimes and atrocities against humanity when, fortunately, we did not commit or condone any such action;"
"2."
"No mention is made of the crimes and atrocities committed in many of the candidate countries after the Second World War by Soviet communism, from which this round of enlargement is providing definitive deliverance."
"History cannot use two different sets of balances for facts which should inspire in us equal ethical and moral repulsion."
". (PT) Despite some disagreement where the separate votes are concerned, I have voted in favour of the Brok report, in line with the support that the CDS/PP has always given to this process of the European Union's enlargement."
"As a matter of fact, as we have frequently said, our position is that in the dispute between enlargement and the so-called 'deepening' of the EU, priority should - and must - always be given to enlargement."
"We consequently felt that Maastricht in particular was an historic error of timing and that, at that time, in light of the fall of the Berlin Wall, which had taken place just a few months previously, Europe's leaders should have had the political vision to give priority to enlargement instead of launching straight into political union and EMU."
"Many of the additional problems that enlargement is, unfortunately, facing today stem from this error of timing."
"On the same theme, I regret the fact that the Brok report does not affirm and recommend a serious basic compromise with regard to these new future Member States: the last revision of the Treaties before the accession of these countries was undertaken in Nice and no new revision of the Treaties will take place until at least the first set of new Member States is able to participate in it, with full rights and with sufficient time for debate and reflection."
". (PT) I wish to congratulate Mrs Sudre on her report, which concerns extending exemption arrangements for dock dues, authorising partial or total exemption from this tax for local production in the French overseas departments."
"As I have argued both in interventions in plenary and in explanations of vote, there cannot and must not be doubts about the appropriateness of maintaining support instruments for the outermost regions under the recent Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty."
"I therefore fully support the proposal to extend the validity of this scheme to 31 December 2003. Such an extension is justified by the persistent disadvantages of these territories and by the consequent need to adopt measures that compensate for these conditions."
". (PT) There are various factors that contribute to corruption as a transnational problem."
"What is crucial is an integrated and flexible common strategy, which will enable us to achieve greater transparency, less bureaucracy, a greater simplification of rules and effective control mechanisms, in the aim of preventing conditions conducive to the proliferation of corruption from arising, and to increase opportunities for detecting and punishing such practices."
"We must fight against corruption both in the public sector, where it undermines the operation of the democratic system and citizens' confidence in the integrity of the democratic rule of law, and in the private sector, where corruption tends to distort the rules of competition and prevent healthy economic development."
"I therefore regret the fact that this proposal for a framework decision is intended to regulate only the private and not the public sector, especially given that national legislations are still not harmonised - there are, for example four Member States that have still not ratified the EU Convention on corruption in the public sector - which could give rise to situations of objective legal uncertainty."
"Furthermore, establishing a different regulatory approach to corruption in the private sector, which is the subject of this framework decision, and to corruption in the public sector, the subject of the 1997 EU Convention, could also create problems in implementing the framework decision on the European arrest warrant."
"I therefore call on the Commission to present a proposal to regulate these two types of crime."
"This report was voted on under Rule 110a of the Rules of Procedure, which allows for no debate and no amendments to the report."
"The British Delegation of the PPE-DE Group has previously sought to amend reports which it did not support."
"The new rule, however, leaves no option but to vote against certain reports."
"Although Conservative MEPs wish to combat corruption, we believe that this matter should not be legislated on at a European level but should be dealt with internally by Member States."
"We are willing to cooperate with other Member States' authorities, but we will not go down the path of harmonised maximum penalties."
". (PT) On this matter, our vote was determined by the position, adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which we felt was well founded."
"Although we believe that there is a need for legislation that punishes the types of crime we are discussing - corruption in both the public and private sectors - the issue requires more extensive study in order to prevent the adoption of vague and indeterminate concepts, non-observance of the principle of subsidiarity, the risk of obstacles to fundamental freedoms or distortions of competition and even the use of different legal approaches to the two types of crime in question."
"These, in brief, are the reasons for my vote against the report."
". (PT) Despite the fact that, on almost all points, I agree substantially with and subscribe to the rapporteur's concerns, I have decided to vote against the report because I, like the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, feel that the proposed text breaches the principle of subsidiarity and that, particularly at a time when the Convention is discussing this matter in the context of the future of the European Union and is attempting to clarify the definitive distribution of competences between the Union and the Member States, all Community bodies - and Parliament in particular - have a responsibility to demonstrate scrupulous respect for this fundamental principle."
"Furthermore, I also believe - as does the Committee on Legal Affairs - that legislation is needed to regulate these two types of crime, corruption in the public and private sectors, which will enable us to establish a more coherent and effective regulatory framework."
"It should be added that the European Commission is getting ready to present an initiative in the form of a communication to this end."
"I believe that this initiative will provide some positive approaches to consider, specifically with regard to the need for coordinated action by the European bodies responsible for encouraging cooperation between Member States in suppressing crimes of corruption, such as Eurojust, Europol, OLAF and the European judicial network, in both the public and private sectors."
"Indeed, coordinated action between these bodies ought to strengthen action by national police forces and facilitate cross-border investigations on the ground, through the sharing of Member States' information capabilities."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group, I am particularly happy that Parliament has today given a strong signal of cohesion on a matter as important as combating corruption."
"Parliament has given a clear answer to the citizens, who are facing a serious lack of confidence in the transparency of the markets and many institutions."
"The European reference framework on combating corruption is still fragmented, non-binding and in need of a bold step forward."
"The Danish initiative on corruption in the private sector is an initial step in the right direction, but we need to go further, especially in view of enlargement."
"Parliament has asked those Member States who have not yet done so to ratify the European Union Convention and the Council of Europe Convention on corruption in the public sector."
"If this does not happen, Parliament has asked the Council to submit a new framework decision on corruption in the public sector."
"This is the focus of the report."
"Some States are anticipating the implementation of the European arrest warrant, like the United Kingdom, which was the first country to transpose the arrest warrant into national law with the Extradition Bill."
"(Text abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1))"
". (PT) Once again, we are considering a Member State initiative that errs on the side of being too cautious and unambitious and will not lead to the changes in legislation that are desirable and necessary in this field."
"Changes introduced by the rapporteur, Mr Ribeiro e Castro, have improved on the initial proposal."
"Effectively combating cross-border crime requires special attention to be paid to stepping up cooperation on posting liaison officers to third countries and to international organisations."
"Although cooperation contributing to the prevention, identification and investigation of crimes is already in place, we must strengthen certain aspects of this cooperation between liaison officers in order to make the best use of Member State resources, thereby providing greater world coverage."
"Combating international crime must be a joint action based on maximum cooperation and trust between Member States."
"It is crucial that binding instruments are in place at Community level, establishing common rules on the competences of liaison officers and on data protection and to subject the legality of this exchange of information to judicial control."
"The huge variety of laws in force creates enormous difficulties for the effective cooperation of national liaison officers and Europol, as well as complicating judicial control."
"Hence this proposal for a decision, which is intended to update and improve cooperation in this field and to be legally binding on the Member States, unlike the Joint Action of 1996."
". (PT) The proposal of the European Commission already warranted our opposition, but the report by Mr Ribeiro e Castro warrants even greater opposition, because it accentuates the negative aspects of the original proposal."
"I shall highlight the following examples:"
"the seriousness of the prospect of there being 'liaison officers who are dispatched by the various Member States' without any monitoring by the police authorities;"
"the term 'cooperation' is not confined to the exchange of information, specifically about crime, but also covers the prevention and investigation of criminal offences, which is unacceptable."
"Due to the undisputed need for police cooperation in the EU in order to combat multinational crime organisations, cooperation could be undertaken by institutional, judicial and penal means without undermining national sovereignty."
"It would be more useful, then, for the European institutions to focus their concerns on the myriad police organisations already in place, created under the Maastricht and Schengen agreements and which operate without any democratic control or monitoring and which constitute serious breaches of the citizens' rights and freedoms and of the sovereignty of the Member States themselves."
". (PT) It appears that the report has largely been well received by the Members of all political groups, given that all the amendments tabled by the rapporteur and those which, although not produced by him, have his agreement, have been adopted."
"Only one new recital, proposed by Mrs Buitenweg, which proposes the creation of binding instruments at EU level, has been adopted without Mr Ribeiro e Castro's support."
"The report mirrors the caution of the Danish initiative, which respects the current legal framework, and we therefore feel that we must support it and at the same time congratulate its rapporteur, my colleague, José Ribeiro e Castro."
". (PT) I have, of course, voted in favour of my own report."
"This Danish initiative is extremely positive and timely as well as being well balanced, fully respecting the status quo of the Union's institutional development and the Member States' own competences and now seeking to adopt a binding legislative instrument."
"In fact, it is an attempt, by means of its provision for joint working methods, to strengthen the global capabilities of liaison officers posted to third countries by Member State police authorities, which will provide a clear common benefit to all of them."
"This specific stepping-up of police cooperation is particularly relevant in the field of information and will doubtless have an increasing role to play in combating organised crime, particularly given the rate at which this type of crime is increasing."
"The proposals for amendments that I tabled, with the support of the specialist parliamentary committee, are all intended to increase the effectiveness of the mechanisms for cooperation and shared use between police liaison officers, whilst at the same time attempting to remedy various shortcomings, specifically in the following areas: guaranteeing fundamental rights in the field of data protection, the regular monitoring of the liaison officer system, through annual reports and the study of these reports; similar treatment for Europol's liaison officers and, lastly, funding."
". This Report was voted on under Rule 110a of the Rules of Procedure, which allows for no debate and no amendments to the report."
"The British Delegation of the PPE-DE Group has previously sought to amend reports which it did not support."
"The new rule, however, leaves no option but to abstain on certain reports."
"This is a very sensitive area of policy."
"The British Conservative Delegation is particularly keen to protect children and their rights, and the standards which are applied in the UK are generally very high."
"We therefore believe that improving standards and protecting children is something where best practice should be shared but that introducing a regulation of this kind might well slow down the process of general improvement in approach."
". (PT) The common fisheries policy is of the utmost importance to Portugal."
"The reform that is currently underway has extremely serious implications for my country and for the Algarve region."
"Implementing the reform in its current state would seriously damage Portuguese fishermen, economically, socially and in terms of their industry."
"Nevertheless, despite the consequences, I believe that stepping up the fight against illegal fishing is a priority that everyone accepts."
"Such activity prevents the effective and sustainable management of fish stocks. I therefore give my unequivocal support to the Busk report and to all measures to eradicate illegal fishing."
"In this context I agree with the call to close European ports to vessels flying flags of convenience or which are engaged in illegal fishing."
"We will thereby prevent the entry of these products onto the European market."
"We cannot, on the one hand, impose strict fishing quotas and, on the other, not take action to prevent illegal fishing activities."
"I am therefore, in favour of new control measures at Community level, specifically through:"
"clearer marking and identification of vessels,"
"compliance with the rules, to be monitored by regional organisations,"
"dissuasive and uniform sanctions."
"To this end, the Commission must make available financial resources that are appropriate to this fight."
". (EL) The collapse of socialism in central and eastern Europe had disastrous consequences on research, as it did on all social achievements during the socialist era."
"Funding fell to a minimum, research institutes closed, researchers abandoned research, there were no incentives for new researchers and, worst of all, there was a brain drain, with the most experienced researchers moving to the west."
"Former socialist countries with advanced research facilities were reduced to living on miserable handouts from abroad and the ?U."
"The report recommends the participation of candidate countries in the EU framework programme on research almost as a panacea."
"At the same time, however, it advises linking research to industry and creating a favourable business climate; in other words, it is pushing for the EU model to be adopted and wants research to operate in accordance with market rules."
"Although no one could object to international scientific cooperation on equal terms, we cannot under any circumstances allow research to serve and be controlled by major financial interests."
"That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece did not support the report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we should support the fundamental health protection efforts being made in the European Union."
"I am against the tobacco advertising directive for several reasons of principle. Firstly, because it does not have a legal basis, and, secondly, because tobacco is after all still a legal stimulant."
"If we were to accept the Commission's logic, we would also have to rethink our position on advertising sweets, fast cars and alcohol."
"Thirdly, a policy that simultaneously subsidises tobacco and bans its advertising is neither logical nor consistent, and cannot therefore really be taken seriously."
"As I see it, this is an issue of principle, and needs to be addressed accordingly."
"Mr President, is it really not naïve to think that this directive is the panacea for the adverse consequences of smoking?"
"Does the European Commission really believe that a complete ban on tobacco advertising is going to stop people smoking?"
"This is wishful thinking as far as I am concerned."
"I also take the view that people must have the freedom to find out about products as long as they are not prohibited products."
"I also think that there are better ways of tackling this problem, for example by drafting European guidelines that lay down standards for tobacco goods."
"Finally, I should like to draw your attention to the fact that what we have here is a contradiction in se."
"We are going to ban tobacco advertising, but each year millions in European subsidies go to tobacco growers."
"Make of that what you will."
"I voted in favour of the amended proposal to ban the advertising of tobacco products because all the amendments by the Committee on Legal Affairs were rejected."
"These amendments, one : watered down the restrictions in the proposal, two : allowed advertising companies to circumvent them and three : put a question mark next to the legal basis, especially following the annulment of the first proposal by the Court of Justice."
"However, even this second Commission proposal still has a question mark next to it, based as it is on the internal market rather than the protection of public health."
"No doubt this is the first move in the next set of proceedings in the ECJ."
"Money is earned from the production and sale of tobacco, but it shortens the lives of many people and makes them less healthy."
"Advertising that encourages people to start using tobacco products or to start using more of them is extremely damaging."
"In Directive 98/43/EC an attempt was rightly made to make advertising and sponsorship at European level impossible."
"According to the Court of Justice this is not allowed because Article 152(4) of the Treaty excludes the harmonisation of statutory and administrative provisions of the Member States for the protection and improvement of human health."
"Further proof that the EU is about free competition and economic growth, but not about the protection of human welfare."
"In the meantime the EU continues with its subsidies for Greek tobacco farmers."
"The solution now proposed of nothing more than the selective prohibition of tobacco advertising will lead to the companies concerned looking for the loopholes in the legislation to continue with their advertising."
"Lawyers and the courts will have their work cut out scanning the boundaries of these loopholes, in particular to decide what is or is not to be regarded as cross-border advertising."
"I therefore support the organisations that are objecting to this severely weakened proposal."
". (PT) Whilst I understand many of the rapporteur's aims to give the directive greater legal strength - and thereby avoid seeing the courts reject its implementation - I believe that the rapporteur has ultimately compromised the directive's public health objectives."
"I find this intolerable. I therefore prefer the European Commission's original position to that produced by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"Amendment No 26, which I support, seeks to prevent this excessive weakening of public health protection."
". (PT) As we all know, the Court of Justice annulled Directive 98/43/CE, on the grounds that the article of the Treaty chosen as its legal basis precludes harmonisation designed to protect human health, and that its action should instead be to complement that decided on by the EU's Member States."
"In fact, the general ban on the advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products it provides for exceeded the competence enshrined in the Treaty and was even in breach of the rules on freedom of movement shaping the internal market."
"The new proposal for a directive therefore seeks to establish, in terms which are in accordance with the EC Treaty, a less restrictive framework, with new objectives for public health protection, in the conviction that tobacco is a product that is harmful to health, that deterrence from its consumption must be promoted, particularly where younger people are concerned."
"The proposal also seeks, whilst respecting the rules of competition and of the internal market, to prevent its widespread promotion in the media."
"These are the reasons why I agree with this report."
". (PT) I wish to congratulate Mr Di Lello on the quality of his work."
"The Citizens of the European Union have the right to expect the Union to effectively confront the problem of increasing threats of crime, which does not recognise borders and which attacks their freedom and their rights."
"What is required is rapid, concerted and joint action, which effectively coordinates all efforts to combat and prevent crime throughout the territory of the Member States."
"One of the most effective instruments with which to combat organised crime is the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of crime."
"Difficulties arise, however, as a result of the disparities between the various Member State legislations."
"The Union must make efforts to approximate criminal law and procedures on money laundering and the confiscation of goods."
"The adoption of the framework decision on money laundering has enabled us to make progress but has proven to be inadequate, because there remains a considerable margin for criminal impunity insofar as this decision only established sanctions for serious crimes."
"This matter has come to be regulated by two acts of differing legal value, because Joint Action 98/699/JHA has not been revoked."
"This proposal for a framework decision is a step in the right direction, because it aims to ensure that all the Member States have in place effective rules providing for confiscation when an offence is punished by deprivation of liberty for a period of more than one year."
"I agree with the rapporteur's position on the proposals by the Danish Presidency on the possibility of 'more extensive' confiscation and the inversion of the onus of proof."
"Any legislative initiative must respect the individual rights and fundamental freedoms of our citizens."
"Whilst Conservative MEPs support anything which enhances cooperation between Member States' law enforcement agencies, we cannot support any prescriptive European measures such as those proposed in this Report."
"Such matters should be dealt with internally by the individual Member States."
". (PT) As the rapporteur points out, one of the most effective instruments for combating organised crime is the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of illegal activities, particularly when such proceeds are destined for laundering."
"The lack of coordination between the various crime-fighting bodies can only benefit those involved in such activities, which means that we must, to this end, improve mutual assistance in the fight to capture the proceeds of organised crime."
"These initiatives and the rapporteur have both sought to establish a designated framework for action under the framework decisions, to safeguard the necessary independence of the national authorities when dealing specifically with incidents that have occurred within their territory - whilst at the same time providing for common mechanisms for regulation in order to pursue the shared commitment to combat all forms of organised crime, in line with the conclusions of the Tampere Council."
"The rapporteur has also taken care to ensure that, when considering the illegal origin of property, the inversion of the onus of proof only applies when the prosecution can prove that the property possessed is disproportionate to declared income or the activity pursued, with the person convicted then having the onus to prove the lawful origin of the property."
"I have therefore voted in favour of the report."
"Mr President, I should like to add my support to your speech on The Scotsman and The Herald."
"Before I begin on the Stevenson and Souchet reports, I find it quite disgraceful that colleagues in this House do not recognise that half a million EU citizens die every year because of tobacco use."
"A tobacco advertising ban would be an extremely good measure to try and help public health and save lives."
"On the Stevenson report, I should like to point out that we voted to maintain the 6-12 mile zones to preserve historic fishing rights and derogations relating to boxes in the North Sea."
"We also believe that benefit from fishing agreements should be taken into account in quota setting and that poverty eradication is a key aim of fishing agreements."
"We are very sceptical of an amendment deleting the recital which noted that joint ventures can be used to massage fleet reduction figures."
"On the Souchet report, we voted against Amendments Nos 10 and 11, and Recitals H and I for sustainability reasons and abstained on the final vote for very similar reasons, i.e. the environmental impact and making sure sustainable development is at the heart of the policy."
"Mr President, as you all know, I was the original rapporteur for this report."
"The document was totally destroyed in the Committee on Fisheries and I felt compelled to give up the task of drafting the report, which was given to the Committee's Chairman, Struan Stevenson."
"I know I am in a minority, but I must say that the main reason for my attitude is that the report we have just adopted ignores the main issue."
"By this I mean that the reform of the common fisheries policy in 2002 is purely and simply a result of the fact that the transitional period of 16 years granted to the Spanish State and to Portugal, so that they need no longer be intruders in Community waters and have the same rights as the other Member States, has come to an end."
"I cannot, of course, accept this situation."
"I am also, of course, in favour of the conservation of stocks - I have nothing against this, in fact - but the report and the committee have not given due consideration to the economic and social consequences of the reform."
"Nor do they discuss a budget for a reform of such importance, but uphold the principle of relative stability, which is now discriminatory and grants privileges, because it was established when the EU had only six or nine Members."
"Furthermore, the report heaps scorn on international fisheries."
"I therefore dare say that there will soon need to be a new real reform of the CFP, to ensure that it is a genuinely common policy."
"It is now less of a common policy than it used to be!"
". (PT) The Souchet report is quite positive and warrants our support."
"Firstly because of the importance it attaches to the participation of fishermen and their professional associations in the field of research and information on the state of fish stocks, given that fishermen are in favour of protecting the environment, since these are amongst the first people to suffer from its impairment."
"Secondly, I agree with the rapporteur's statement that the pressure fishing places on stocks must not be dealt with in a uniform and global way and must instead take account of the particular characteristics of each fishing area and the specific nature of each fish species."
"The report rejects the use of rigid instruments such as the scrapping of vessels, which have irreversible consequences and major socio-economic effects and prefers other, more flexible instruments for managing stocks."
"I support the maintenance of public aid for modernising the fishing fleet, which has a direct impact on working conditions, on safety and on the quality of products, thereby rejecting a philosophy which, whilst claiming to be concerned about the environment, is attempting to undermine aid, in what we could call a liberal 'greenification'."
"First, we think the motion for a resolution on environmental protection under the common fisheries policy is a good idea and we support it."
"It rightly notes that the European Parliament is opposed to the horizontal application of restrictive measures, that is, measures which take no account of fishing zones or fish species."
"The European Parliament is therefore taking an indirect stand against the basic option of reforming the common fisheries policy, which would mean an end to public aid for the modernisation of fishing vessels."
"It likewise rightly identifies the dangers to the economies of coastal areas affected by these measures."
"It rightly notes that the Commission's arguments in favour of the application of restrictive policies are not based on scientific data and that specific studies need to be carried out in order to evaluate the real state of fish stocks."
"Although it calls for these studies to be carried out, it also calls for restrictions such as TACs and quotas to be maintained."
"We would point out that proposing such measures without first carrying out the aforementioned studies is a contradiction in terms and that we have reservations about and are opposed to any further strengthening of the role of the Commission which helps bring about further integration."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.37 p.m. and resumed at 3.03 p.m.)"
"Mr President, I do not doubt that is what the President's notes say, but one of the problems with accepting it is that my notes and those of other Members and of the general rapporteur say differently."
"The problem is that my notes are in Brussels, not here in Strasbourg, so when I saw this in the Minutes I asked to raise it."
"Could I ask that we check the audio or video tapes of that voting procedure to establish the actual position?"
"I am of course convinced that what I say is correct, but if I am proved wrong then I am more than happy to accept that."
"Very well, Mr Wynn."
"We will of course check these tapes as you have asked."
"We will then be able to be absolutely sure about the result."
"- (DA) Mr President, the tenth EU-Russia Summit took place in Brussels on 11 November with satisfactory results."
"The meeting reflected the intensity and depth of the cooperation between the EU and Russia."
"It showed that this cooperation is now entering a new phase; the framework for the strategic partnership has been laid down, and now it remains to flesh it out with practical actions."
"As you know, there was a major problem, which has been discussed many times in Parliament, that is, Kaliningrad."
"Consensus was reached on a joint declaration regarding transit between Kaliningrad and the rest of Russia."
"The agreement represents a balance between the interests of the candidate countries, Russia and the EU."
"The fact that a solution could be found to the problem confirms the strength of the cooperation between the EU and Russia; and at the same time the EU asserted that it attaches the utmost importance to respect for the sovereignty of the candidate countries and effective border controls on the EU's external borders."
"We stood firm on the principles that Lithuania is a sovereign country and that it has as much right to join cooperation on Schengen as all the other candidate countries."
"This is something that was respected, even by President Putin."
"Consensus was reached, and I can add that President Adamkus of Lithuania, too, accepted the agreement which was entered into."
"Consensus was also reached on a joint declaration on the fight against terrorism."
"This was a key point for both parties."
"The summit condemned terrorism in all its forms."
"The declaration and the accompanying cooperation plan are indications that cooperation between the EU and Russia on this point is moving on from an exchange of information to practical cooperation."
"Lastly, consensus was reached on a declaration on the situation in the Middle East, which confirms the existing consensus between the EU and Russia on this matter."
"There was a frank debate on the situation in Chechnya."
"The parties were agreed that the conflict cannot simply be regarded and treated as a problem of terrorism and that a political solution is the only way to lasting peace, stability and development in the area."
"I know that Commissioner Patten has already spoken of the extraordinarily open debate which took place."
"The European Union will monitor developments closely."
"Both sides must respect human rights, and the EU must insist that those who do not are brought to justice."
"The EU will also demand that the international community be given the opportunity to provide the urgently needed humanitarian aid to Chechnya."
"Regional conflicts, particularly the one in Moldova, were also discussed."
"It is important to maintain that there are no geographical restrictions on the scope of the political dialogue between the EU and Russia."
"The European Union stressed the need for progress on the economic and legal reforms in Russia in order to ensure Russian membership of the WTO."
"In addition, the need for Russia to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and the Energy Charter was emphasised."
"By way of conclusion, I am able to call the summit a success, with a constructive dialogue in all fields."
"The cooperation between the EU and Russia has entered a new phase in which no topic for discussion is ruled out; and that will be to the advantage of both parties."
"Mr President, the European Union/Russian Federation Summit that took place on 11 November in Brussels succeeded in producing an understanding, as you already know, on the issue of transit between Kaliningrad and the rest of Russia."
"As you are also aware, as a result of the discussions held at the May Summit in Moscow, the EU had agreed to carry out a review of the matter, taking further into account Russia's concerns about unimpeded travel of Russian citizens throughout the whole territory of the Russian Federation, including Kaliningrad."
"In the relatively short time between the two summits, the Union completed a comprehensive review of the situation."
"Following a communication from the Commission in September, this review formulated a new position on Kaliningrad transit issues, which was adopted in October by the European Council meeting in Brussels."
"In parallel discussions with both Russia and Lithuania, the Presidency and the Commission managed to develop ways and means to ensure that the vital interests of all parties concerned would be respected."
"In addition to Russia's legitimate interests, the EU was very much aware that any arrangements requiring further definition could not undermine the sovereignty of Lithuania - a future member of the Union - or carry negative implications for Lithuania's future accession in full to the Schengen regime."
"Last but not least, the European Union must adequately protect its borders at all times, a task for which it was essential to respect the Schengen acquis."
"The European Commission is confident that the understanding reached at the Brussels Summit strikes the right balance between these parameters, making it possible to resolve the issue of Kaliningrad transit in a manner which is acceptable to all parties concerned."
"The Commission has already started work to prepare for the implementation of the understanding reached at the Summit."
"Time is short and we are fully aware of the need to launch preparations without delay in order to meet the deadline of 1 July 2003, when Lithuania will introduce the new regime for Russian rail travellers crossing its territory."
"We are confident that by then the conditions will be in place to allow the introduction of simplified travel documents."
"I would like to add that resolving the issue of Kaliningrad will allow us to substantially deepen and accelerate our cooperation with the Russian Federation in a number of important areas."
"Among these, the European Commission regards justice and home affairs as particularly important."
"Indeed cooperation with Russia on issues such as the fight against organised crime, illegal migration, drug trafficking, women trafficking and child pornography among others, is crucial."
"On this matter, Russia confirmed at the Summit that the agreement between Europol and Russia will be rapidly concluded."
"In addition, Russia and the European Union will immediately launch negotiations with a view to concluding a readmission agreement as soon as possible."
"In this context, the Summit also produced a joint statement defining areas for further cooperation in the fight against terrorism, which is a clear priority for both sides."
"We intend to increase the exchange of information in a number of relevant areas, as well as to deepen cooperation against terrorism in multilateral arenas and in regard to the provision of assistance in this field to third countries."
"Other important issues were discussed at the Summit."
"The on-going conflict in Chechnya featured prominently among these."
"In this regard, the European Union raised its serious concerns over Chechnya."
"I would like to assure you that the well-established position of the Union on the matter was put forward to President Putin in quite clear terms."
"While expressing its support for Russia against terrorism in all its forms, the Union explicitly stated that the fight against terrorism cannot be conducted at the expense of basic human rights."
"This is also valid for Chechnya."
"The Union raised again the problem of unimpeded and safe access for humanitarian workers on the ground in Chechnya."
"In addition, the EU urged the Russians to promote without delay a political solution that provides a framework for lasting peace, stability and reconstruction in Chechnya."
"At the Summit we also had a good discussion on a number of international issues, including the Middle East, on which we agreed a joint statement."
"We reviewed the situation in Afghanistan, as well as the need for Iraq to comply fully with UN Security Council Resolution 1441."
"We also exchanged assessments regarding the threat of nuclear proliferation in the Korean Peninsula."
"Finally, we reviewed the situation in Moldova and Belarus."
"Russia has already agreed to the withdrawal and destruction of ammunition in the breakaway region of Transnistria."
"The EU stated that it is essential that this takes place rapidly in order to promote a solution to the conflict which continues to impede the development on Moldova, which is now the poorest country in Europe."
"We also made it clear that we expect Russia to use its influence on the government of Belarus to adopt a more positive approach towards democratisation and respect of human rights."
"On the economic side, progress was less marked, except for the change in the EU anti-dumping regulations, which now accord Russia market economy status."
"In addition, the Summit endorsed progress reports on the energy discussions and on the concept of a common European economic space."
"The EU also raised a number of its commercial concerns, including the discriminatory charges levied by Russia for European aircraft flying over Siberia."
"The EU pressed Russia to confirm expectations of early Russian ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and to commit itself to conclude a long-delayed agreement on the clean-up of nuclear waste in north-west Russia, the Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Programme in the Russian Federation (MNEPR)."
"I trust most of you are already aware that the 11th EU/Russia Summit will take place in St Petersburg, in commemoration of the 300th anniversary of the city."
"Taking this into account, Russia has invited all EU leaders to this special summit, which should serve to deepen our bilateral cooperation with Russia even further."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my group advocates a stronger strategic partnership between the European Union and Russia, because we are convinced that peace in our continent is largely dependent upon our ability to maintain a strong and effective European Union and an effective and democratic Russian Federation."
"We also recognise the progress that Russia has made in recent years in overcoming the legacy of the Communist era."
"We are, however, amazed at some of the circumstances surrounding the Brussels Summit."
"This negative view really needs to be aired here."
"It concerns both Chechnya and Kaliningrad."
"With regard to Chechnya, I would like to say that we are constitutional states and Denmark is also a constitutional state."
"It is the indisputable right of the Chechens to hold a peaceful conference in Copenhagen if it is their wish to do so."
"I do not wish to criticise the presidency for the fact that the summit ended up being held in Brussels."
"But I believe that we need to be courageous and not always give in when our partners in talks put pressure on us and demand concessions."
"On the contrary, we need to stand firm."
"We are in favour of resolutely fighting terrorism, because terrorism is an obstacle to the peaceful coexistence of peoples."
"We very much declare war on any form of terrorism."
"However, we also believe that the war on terrorism should not be deprived of its legitimacy by surrendering human rights in its name."
"That is why we are demanding that the war on terror should go hand in hand with a global ethic based on human rights."
"What this means in practice is that the human rights of the Chechen people should not be sacrificed at the altar of the war on terror, necessary though that war may be."
"I was extremely surprised by what I read in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung of 13 November. Russia's President Putin was reported as having responded to a journalist that 'if you want to become Islamic radicals and are therefore willing to be circumcised, than I invite you to come to Moscow."
"We are a country of many different faiths, and we have excellent doctors."
"We would recommend carrying out the operation in such a way that nothing grows again'."
"That is typical of the way human rights are breached in Chechnya. I would be very pleased, Mr President, if in future the issue of Chechnya could be addressed in writing in the communiqués issued following these summits."
"I have not been able to find a single word about this in the communiqué, even though reporters told me that Mr Rasmussen championed this cause, and Commissioner Patten also informed the Committee on Development and Cooperation about this."
"However, this should also be included in the conclusions of a summit of this kind."
"Now let me turn to Kaliningrad."
"I read today in my local paper, the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung, a well-written article entitled 'Russia offers little hope."
"People of Kaliningrad expect much from EU, but little from Moscow.'"
"I naturally welcome the fact that the thorny issue of visas has been resolved."
"However, the people in the Kaliningrad region or 'oblast' - and this is the heart of the matter - look far more towards the West than they do towards Russia."
"Igor Rudnikov, the managing editor of the courageous newspaper Novye Kolyosa, which means 'New Wheels', has said that the rhetoric and fuss issuing from the Russian Federation on the subject of Kaliningrad has only damaged its cause."
"They look towards the capitals of Europe - to Paris, to Warsaw and to Berlin."
"The central issue is that the Kaliningrad region should be developed so that it does not become a no-man's-land in Europe, but becomes part of a development axis running through Poland and into the Baltic states."
"It would do Russia credit to put this on the agenda, so that these human problems can be solved."
"I would like to encourage you, Mr President-in-Office, and the Commission, to act with this in mind."
"If you do that, you will have our support too."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my group thinks it is important that we have a programme of extended and comprehensive cooperation with Russia."
"Now we are starting to reap the rewards of bringing down the Iron Curtain."
"Now too conditions in Russia are stabilising, except with regard to certain aspects, which I shall return to."
"This being the case, we are in favour of establishing a Common European Economic Space."
"It will be an important step on the path we are developing towards normal relations with Russia."
"The Union has said Russia is a normal market economy."
"That is saying quite a lot, perhaps, although Russia is on the right track and this is consequently a step towards accession to the World Trade Organisation."
"We have to remember that one consequence of enlargement is that the border between Russia and the Union will lengthen and that is very significant."
"Russia will lose its markets to some extent in those countries joining the EU, and that is something we also have to take into consideration to some extent."
"I am pleased that the heated controversy over Kaliningrad was resolved at the summit."
"I do not think this was perhaps the major problem it sometimes appeared to be in the debate."
"We are also responsible for developments with regard to Kaliningrad, and I agree with Mr Poettering that we have to be able to provide help and assistance and work together to improve conditions for the people who live there."
"We are of the opinion that the war in Chechnya is a problem for Russia, for us and for the Chechen people, who are at the centre of the war."
"We believe that human rights must not be violated under the pretence of the fight against terrorism."
"This has to do with Russia and it also has to do with other countries that we have been praising here or which are perhaps our older allies."
"The fight against terrorism has become an umbrella that allows violent actions to be carried out by countries against their own and other citizens."
"This must not be allowed to happen."
"The question of Chechnya is being raised because we have a delegation leaving for Chechnya, and I am its chairman."
"There has been a development regarding this in that today, after lengthy negotiations, I received a letter from Dmitri Rogozin of the State Duma, inviting us to go there on 20 January."
"It had been suggested that we should go in late December, but that is Christmas and we asked if the visit could be rescheduled."
"This being the case, January seems a good time to go, if the members of my delegation agree: all this has happened so very recently."
"Russia is a big partner for us."
"Trade between us is worth approximately 25 billion dollars a year, while the figure for the United States of America is just 3 billion and for the former countries of the Soviet Union only just over 10 billion dollars."
"We are thus a giant trading partner of Russia."
"I should therefore like to ask the Commissioner in what state the energy dialogue can be in if all of a sudden Gazprom decides on a gas pipeline - coolly decides to build a gas pipeline."
"The energy dialogue between us has not been very visible in this project."
"We are the world's largest energy area, and the energy issue is therefore very important."
"I should furthermore like to mention the state of the press in Karelia and elsewhere too in Russia, where there are pressures that are simply not acceptable."
"Mr President, Russia is of interest to us and is a partner that presents challenges."
"For some reason, when we give our opinions we often stress in particular Russia's various problems instead of concentrating on its positive achievements and the potential that exists in future cooperation."
"Many things are obviously better in the Union but we also have problems Russian Members of Parliament could seize on if they so wished."
"To their credit, they do not."
"I do not mean that we should keep silent, for example, about environmental problems, lack of democracy or human rights violations in Russia."
"It is a matter of how we weigh things and how we handle them."
"Right now it is important for us to discuss the effects EU enlargement will have on cooperation between the EU and Russia."
"We have been able to resolve problems to do with Kaliningrad's status but there is still much work to be done."
"In this regard the ball is very much in Moscow's court."
"We need them to be unbiased in their approach to implementing changes in Kaliningrad so that there is investment there coming from the rest of Russia and abroad too."
"Now that the border between the EU and Russia is to lengthen we must make renewed efforts to develop northwestern Russia and boost cooperation in the border regions."
"The Union must make a more serious effort than it has until now to engage in programmes of cooperation in the Barents Sea and Baltic Sea regions and furthermore direct substantial economic resources at those areas."
"Another question of current importance is the development of cooperation in the area of energy."
"That would enable us on the one hand to help Russia develop its energy economy and protect its environment and, on the other, safeguard our own energy economy."
"It is in this spirit that progress must be made in the area of cooperation."
"Mr President, my group notes with satisfaction that an agreement has been made that guarantees traffic connections with Kaliningrad after Lithuania and Poland join the Union."
"We in the EU must focus special attention on basic repairs of railway tracks in Lithuania."
"For that purpose we have to provide adequate financial support."
"It is believed in the European Union that the need for energy grows at a rate of 1% a year."
"The intention is to meet the extra demand by increasing the use of natural gas."
"Russia is an important partner for the EU because the reserves of gas in the North Sea and North Africa will run out in twenty years or so."
"The EU's demand for gas has to be met with exports from the east."
"Cooperation on the issue of energy is not progressing satisfactorily."
"The best form of cooperation would be if pipelines were built linking Russia and the EU."
"If the pipelines go through Poland, Belarus and Ukraine there will be needless waste."
"Early this week Gazprom announced, as Mr Paasilinna stated, that it was constructing, on its own, a gas pipeline from the Shtokmanovsk deposit in the Barents Sea to Central Europe."
"That is good news, as in that way the EU countries' increased demand for the use of energy is satisfied."
"It is bad news if looked at from the point of view of cooperation."
"The EU is not now a party to the project and it will pay in the future."
"Adherence to market conditions in the EU will not solve the problems of the energy market."
"Liberalisation of the market makes it impossible in practice to finance new investment by means of long-term supply contracts."
"If those who need gas shared in the costs of its delivery onto the market that would improve reliability of supply and over a time span of twenty years that is what will be the most important thing."
"With Russia we have to speak about factors that unite us."
"One issue that separates us is the civil war in Chechnya."
"We all hope for a peaceful solution to the war."
"At the same time we note that at the summit attended by leaders of the EU and Russia no demands were made by the EU regarding Chechnya's independence as a state."
"The region is therefore regarded as a part of the Russian Federation."
"Human rights cannot be trampled on in Russia using terrorism as an excuse, nor in the United States of America either."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make four comments."
"The first one is about Kaliningrad."
"I believe that enormous efforts have been made in this regard in recent months."
"The Commission and the Council had meetings with Mr Rogosin, the presidential envoy, and with Minister Rasov."
"At the instigation of our President, Mr Pat Cox, they also had parliamentary support at two meetings with our Polish, Lithuanian and Russian colleagues."
"I believe that we can be satisfied with this and my group is satisfied with the result achieved."
"Secondly, Chechnya."
"Yes, it is clear that the events in the Dubrovka Theatre must of course be condemned, and as Chair of the Russia delegation that is what I immediately conveyed to Mr Lukin."
"We can condemn it and we do of course also want an explanation of the gas that was used, of the circumstances in which action was taken and of how the forces of law and order acted."
"I believe that some additional clarity about this is required."
"We also note that there is a tougher stance on the part of the Russians with regard to Chechnya."
"Nonetheless, the European Parliament has taken the lead in this debate in recent months."
"We have said that we are in favour of negotiations and talks, because a military solution is not going to produce a result."
"I find that our Russian friends, President Putin not least, have now adopted an extremely rigid attitude and since 11 September have put the whole struggle in Chechnya in the context of the war on international terrorism."
"I believe this to be an aberration."
"Only holding talks, even with the people around Mr Maskhadov, will lead to a genuine solution."
"Thirdly, I should like to express my concern here about the general state of human rights in Chechnya."
"Amnesty International has recently published a report about the freedom of the press, about the lack of religious freedom and about the general human rights situation in Russia."
"I believe that this warrants some attention on our part."
"Finally, I would draw your attention to an environmental problem."
"At the beginning of October my delegation visited Murmansk."
"There we studied the nuclear inheritance of the Soviet Union."
"All the local people and all the local authorities there are asking for a multilateral nuclear environment programme."
"I should like to ask the Commission and the Council very clearly how things stand with the negotiations on this treaty?"
"It is absolutely essential that there is one, otherwise no one can take responsibility for clearing up the nuclear inheritance of the Soviet Union properly."
"I should like to put this question to you Commissioner and to you Mr Haarder, for which my heartfelt thanks."
"Mr President, the partnership with the Russian Federation is placing heavy responsibilities on the EU."
"How to deal with the ambivalence of Moscow's policy?"
"This ambivalence is manifesting itself in openness to the outside world and growing uncommunicativeness at home."
"Putin's paradox can, harrowingly enough, be tellingly illustrated by the Chechen tragedy."
"The just war on terrorists is combined here with the dreadful disenfranchisement of an entire population group, including the muzzling of its own media on the subject."
"What can the EU do about this constant mutual bloodletting on Russian territory?"
"Little more, but also certainly no less than always having the Chechnya question on the agenda in the consultation with Russia."
"I was therefore pleased to hear the statement by Commissioner Patten of Tuesday 12 November."
"He said that the Danish Presidency had raised the situation in Chechnya both fully and forcefully at the summit with Russia."
"In this context I would ask Council and Commission to offer political backing to the OSCE mission in Chechnya."
"I wish Council and Commission persistence in the search for a well nigh impossible political settlement between Russians and Chechens."
"At the same time the EU must be candid in raising with the Kremlin other evil manifestations of Putin's political system of a 'guided democracy'."
"The list of Russian taboo topics of parliamentarian Yavlinsky can provide good service in this regard."
"Think for example of the attempts of the powers that be to silence agreeable politicians and other citizens or of corruption in the upper reaches of power."
"Finally, I would like to stand up for full respect on the part of the EU for Lithuania's sovereignty in the transit agreement concluded for Kaliningrad and the Russian Federation."
"Serious doubts about this have arisen on the Lithuanian side."
"I spent last week with an EP delegation in the United States."
"I took soundings in the press where I heard very many concerns from Lithuania about this settlement."
"Council and Commission, are these serious doubts on the part of Lithuania justified?"
"Mr President, we are becoming increasingly aware - and we are also acting accordingly - that fundamental changes have taken place in Russia."
"Fortunately we can now talk of constructive cooperation."
"We mention the northern dimension in this regard and all kinds of things that are in our mutual interest."
"We hear a great deal about this from our Finnish fellow MEPs in particular."
"Rightly so."
"There is also talk of the pursuit of a common European economic area."
"I think that this is a good thing, because with the enlargement of the European Union with so many Central European countries on the horizon, we must also look at what is happening on our borders."
"Do we have a clear policy with regard to adjoining areas, in particular Russia, the Ukraine and Moldova?"
"We are going to have to devote some attention to this, so that we can continue to talk of regular cooperation."
"The problems of Russia are mostly very clear to us."
"We have done our utmost to help bring the Kaliningrad problem to a successful conclusion."
"The Lithuanian Government in particular was of course very interested in this."
"I am therefore very pleased that President-in-Office, Mr Haarder - we did not expect anything else - in particular underlines the sovereignty of Lithuania."
"Yet I would also really like to know how things are going with the development of the solution of the Kaliningrad problem?"
"If I have read the situation correctly, it is all tied up with an enormous number of technical issues."
"At a certain point Schengen comes into play and really we have to know at any point whether or not the arrangements with Russia are a hindrance for Lithuania."
"I think that we must make this a priority."
"Russia is large enough, it can look after itself."
"You have to stand up for a small country, especially if it has a history with Russia that is as tragic as that of Lithuania."
"I should like to see a situation in which, ultimately and in all fairness, the guidelines that continue to apply permanently give priority to Lithuania's sovereignty and interests."
"I should also like to raise the problem of borders."
"The borders with Russia and for example Latvia."
"On this point ratification continues to be a long time coming."
"The reason why is unclear and at delegation meetings in Moscow we are told that it has no priority."
"This too is, in my view, another example of a big-country strategy: 'the small fry will just have to wait'."
"I think that we as a European Community are well past this kind of thinking and that we must make clear to Russia that this authoritarian approach, even to the outside world, - internally it is already far too prevalent - comes across to us as very distasteful."
"If we help Russia with all kinds of problems, then Russia itself must be constructive too and say: okay, we are going to solve a problem with this candidate country immediately, we will ratify."
"In fact nothing else needs to happen."
"I should now like to turn to the problem with Chechnya."
"It is very clear that even in Russian politics they are at a complete loss as to what to do."
"It has indeed changed to being first and foremost a war on terrorism, but the damage for the civilian population is so disproportionate that we cannot take it lying down."
"I think that it is very important for military people, possibly those from NATO and Russia, to talk about it - to ask why are you doing that, is there not another way - and in particular to keep hammering away with the message that a political solution will in the end be the only one that can finally bring peace."
"Mr President, as a Christian I feel ashamed at the way Mr Marchiani has misused the concept of Christianity."
"I do not regard the murder of Muslims as a Christian duty."
"Terrorism, arms trading and drug trafficking also exist in other states, including our own Member States."
"Nevertheless, no one is suggesting that we should simply be bombing those Member States, including Mr Marchiani's own country."
"We need to be clear about the fact that people are indulging in emotional manipulation here."
"We are certainly not talking about a war on terrorism - we are talking about the creation of terrorism."
"The Chechens have been the victims of colonial persecution for 150 years."
"They were deported by Stalin."
"In the modern era, they have twice been overrun in brutal wars serving oil interests."
"Mr Putin's election campaign was one of the factors underlying the intensification of the second of these wars, which is still being waged."
"So it has to be said for once and all that this is not a war on terror, it is more likely to encourage terrorists!"
"We have a share in the responsibility for all this."
"So how have we reacted?"
"The beautiful city of Copenhagen was boycotted by Mr Putin simply because the Danes exercised their democratic right to respect freedom of expression and freedom of association."
"So why did the Council then shift to Brussels?"
"Commissioner Nielson, who is responsible for humanitarian issues in Europe, has not announced that he is to visit Chechnya, but rather that he is to attend a banquet for Heads of State and Government in St Petersburg."
"Let me say this very clearly: it makes me sick to be part of a Europe that is sipping Crimean champagne in St Petersburg while people are bleeding to death on the streets of Chechnya."
"I believe that Europe's most noble task is to advocate freedom and human rights."
"Yesterday we were celebrating the presence of our Baltic colleagues in our midst for the first time."
"Our colleagues from the Baltic states also owe their freedom to a Chechen, General Dudayev, who at that time refused to take part in the bloody repression of the Baltic freedom movement as he had been ordered to do as a Soviet officer!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that the fate of the entire European Union is far more closely intertwined with Russia than we imagine at present."
"After 70 years of the Soviet system, the future development of Russia is of course problematic, based as it is on a combination of deep-rooted structures and a new system."
"As I see it, the position of the European Union can only be to provide active support during this massive restructuring process."
"Over the next few decades, Russia will be Europe's most important energy supply partner."
"Even during the Soviet era, Russia has always been a key player in stabilising world peace."
"That should not blind us to the problems in Chechnya, and those problems cannot be denied, but we have to see the overall picture."
"Furthermore, Europe does not have the right to treat Russia differently from other countries that are also in breach of human rights."
"I would like to stress once again, for the avoidance of any possible doubt, that this by no means justifies the situation in Chechnya, but we do need a careful analysis of that area."
"Europe needs to proceed on the basis that only a fair and open partnership between equals can succeed in the long term."
"The most important steps to be taken are systematic actions to build trust, to establish fair trade relations, and to reinforce Russia's economic development and provide any form of assistance that will promote the development of democracy, a process that has still not been completed after 12 or 13 years."
"It must be evident that without a stable, democratic and strong Russia world peace will be at even greater risk than it already is at present."
"Mr President, last week in the EU-Lithuania Joint Parliamentary Committee we had an in-depth and critical discussion of the solution arrived at for Kaliningrad."
"Mr Haarder called the solution 'balanced', but I regard it as being, above all, balanced in terms of allowing Russia to save face and to please our own Schengen purists."
"The Commissioner has told us that the European Union needs to secure its borders at all times and in all places."
"That is a statement that even Erich Honecker could have signed up to, because transit through Lithuania will be more difficult for passengers than transit from West Germany to west Berlin via East Germany was in the old days."
"I think the European Union should be hanging its head in shame to have agreed to this thirteen years after the wall came down."
"The practical difficulties will be a matter for the Lithuanian border authorities and the passengers themselves."
"Russia will be able to exploit this situation for other purposes as well, because of the enormous potential for technical problems and the likelihood that those affected will complain."
"Have you ever considered that the eastern end of these journeys is not in Russia at all, but in Belarus, a country that has not been mentioned in these discussions at all?"
"So what would happen if relations between Russia and Mr Lukashenko deteriorated to the point that Mr Lukashenko decided to exploit this situation?"
"The whole arrangement would then not even be worth the paper it was written on."
"We can also easily imagine what will happen in practice when an application is made for a facilitated rail travel document."
"In an extreme case someone in Khabarovsk in eastern Russia would have to give his address with his ticket in the hope that everything would be forwarded to a central Russian office which would then send everything on to the Lithuanian authorities, which would in turn have to process everything on time, so that when the passenger on board the train arrives at the border the Lithuanian border official would hopefully have the transit permit for that passenger with him."
"However, it is all too easy to imagine how well all this will work in practice, given the administrative capacity of the Russian authorities."
"I therefore urge you to keep an eye on this problem and not to imagine that we can now assume that it has been dealt with."
"It has certainly been a lively debate."
"I almost saw myself in the role of one of those Members of Parliament who demanded that now the Presidency should do this and that and pointed out that the Council had failed to do this or that or the other."
"That is how it should be, and I would call upon Parliament to continue to hold the Council to the democratic ideals on which Parliament is based."
"I will not, moreover, continue now with a 'but'."
"I will continue with an 'and', because I have always understood our common approach to mean that we must also be good neighbours, that we must also be able to solve common problems and that we must also have sufficient contact with each other to allow a dialogue, so that we can say the things that need to be said."
"I would say to Mr Posselt that if we are to move Russia in the right direction in the area of human rights, it is necessary for there to be a place where we can have a dialogue with Russia."
"This place existed a week ago in Brussels, but it makes no difference whether it is in Copenhagen or Brussels."
"We had the dialogue, the necessary things were said and Mr Patten was a witness. Mr Nielson has confirmed this today."
"The Council said exactly what had to be said to Russia, on the subject of Chechnya too."
"With regard to Mr Zakayev, who is currently in custody in Denmark, I should like to tell Mr Dupuis that the Zakayev case is being dealt with entirely in accordance with the principles of the rule of law, in accordance with European extradition rules and in accordance with our established policy on combating terrorism."
"Not a single political decision has been taken in respect of Mr Zakayev."
"Everything has been done by the book."
"We have followed the textbook of democracy to the letter."
"The same applies, moreover, to the holding of the conference which created the conflict between Denmark and Russia."
"This conference was held because it is a democratic right to hold conferences."
"That is not something we can prevent, and we stand by that right, just as we have held firm in all other aspects to our democratic ideals."
"I completely agree that, as has been pointed out by Mr Poettering and many others, we must not sacrifice human rights on the altar of combating terrorism."
"Of course not."
"It was precisely this, moreover, on which the dialogue with Russia at the summit was based."
"We are in agreement on the fight against terrorism, but we are not in agreement in our appraisal of what has gone on, and is still going on, in Chechnya, and this was stated very, very clearly."
"A solution was successfully found to the Kaliningrad problem, and one which respected the sovereignty of Lithuania and Lithuania's right to accede to Schengen."
"The fact that we managed to solve a problem in the region around us in this way is very important for enlargement."
"Moreover, with regard to the yet to be ratified border agreement between Russia and Lithuania, I can state that, during the summit negotiations, the Presidency made it very clear to Russia that we are assuming that the border agreement between Russia and Lithuania will now be signed."
"So nothing was forgotten."
"There was nothing that we should be ashamed of."
"Everything was done by the book of democracy."
"Fortunately, the dialogue was maintained, and the problems which were to be solved at the summit were solved."
"I would like, however, to end by saying that it is important for Parliament to hold fast to its ideals and take the Council to task if there is a risk of our not doing the same."
"Stick at it."
"I do not, however, think that there is any reason to admonish the Council or the Presidency for the way in which they handled this very difficult summit which has just taken place."
"Mr President, I shall start by saying very clearly that I can agree 100% with the statement just made by Mr Haarder."
"That is a good clear description of the reality."
"It is also a reminder of what the Union needs to do and how it needs to do it."
"I have listened very carefully to all the contributions."
"I shall repeat what I have said before in Parliament when discussing the problem of Chechnya."
"The division of responsibility in the Commission is quite meaningful."
"If we were not careful in defining the tasks and responsibilities of the Commissioner responsible for humanitarian aid, we would blur the whole issue, especially when it comes to ensuring that access to delivering humanitarian aid is respected."
"That is why I am very careful to give a clearcut definition of my responsibilities as the Commissioner responsible for humanitarian aid."
"If I were to fall into the temptation of engaging in political discussion on this issue, I would reduce the legitimacy and efficiency of my efforts to protect the access of humanitarian workers in places like Chechnya."
"That is why I resist becoming involved in political manoeuvres or political projects, even if I might sympathise with them."
"It is for the Commissioner on external relations to do that, and it is important, especially in this case, for us to be careful in our use of the instruments and commissioners available."
"If, with my responsibilities, I fell into the temptation of politicising, we would reduce the weight of our efforts and our attempts to insist on having access."
"I have, on the other hand, publicly criticised the Russians on that issue, and do so quite frequently."
"I feed elements of this kind into every summit that we have with Russia."
"Unfortunately there has been no progress."
"There are the well-known issues of work permits for humanitarian workers, the ability to use the UN VHF radio system which is important for the safety of people moving around there and the situation of refugees and internally displaced persons in the camps."
"All these issues are raised over and over again, and I would repeat my call for Parliament to view the Commissioner responsible for humanitarian aid as keeping to a relatively narrowly-defined remit, which is what I do."
"We have others who deal with the political side of the discussion."
"This is important not only as regards Chechnya, but also for many other places."
"You will see the same approach when we talk about accessing victims of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
"Being a political animal myself, I will not engage in a more substantive political discussion on the nature of the conflict and these other issues, however tempting that might be."
"Mr Paasilinna and a few others raised the question of the energy dialogue with Russia, and especially cooperation in the area of natural gas."
"It is quite difficult to rush into a conclusion in an area where negotiating realities also have to reflect who engages commercially and who does not."
"The issue of the gas pipeline negotiation is a long-term one."
"There is a risk of contradictions between establishing the very long-term basis of those kinds of deals and the liberalisation of the gas market inside the Union, to which we would give priority."
"Against that background it is not that simple to accommodate the desire shown by the other side to have a very long-term, stable kind of contract as a basis."
"In any case, it would not be for us but for the companies and the market to establish such a contract, which is another reason why things are not that simple."
"Furthermore there are other interesting strategic issues concerning the geopolitics of Europe's energy supply in the years to come, including issues relating to natural gas, and it is no surprise that this is a complicated and demanding question."
"For tactical reasons I would urge some caution as to how Members of Parliament pursue this issue."
"It may be worthwhile and important to ensure that we have long-term cooperation and supplies from Russia, but it is also important not to jump into negotiations that ultimately meant our not getting as good a deal as everyone thought we should."
"I would therefore advocate caution."
"Finally, as regards Mr Oostlander's clear question about whether Lithuania can join Schengen after this agreement on Kaliningrad, this has been one of the defining points in our approach to negotiations."
"This is why we find the solution in which there are no complications of that nature to be a good one."
"I will end by commending the cooperation between the Council and the Commission on this issue."
"This is one of the areas in which we have been quite successful."
"It is also something which has been duly recognised by Lithuania and which has certainly demonstrated to the other candidate countries that we take their situation seriously."
"Madam President, there is a political dimension to this, which Mr Haarder mentioned."
"I had in mind the arrest of Mr Zakayev, the Chechen representative."
"Why has he been in prison for so long without any evidence being brought against him?"
"This is a very worrying situation."
"I was there two years ago."
"My area of responsibility is not being neglected."
"We are continually working on this and also in relation to the UN initiative and as the main funder of humanitarian aid to Chechnya."
"We are, in fact, the only ones keeping funding activities alive and functional inside Chechnya."
"I do not want to discuss my travel schedule here."
"For the reasons I gave previously, I remain resolved to avoid mixing up my main responsibility with general political work in this respect."
"Madam President, having heard the debate, I would like to draw your attention to a fact: following the terrorist action by Chechen rebels, 120 hostages have died, but also 50 terrorists."
"I would like to draw your attention to the fact that, although we are talking about terrorists, there can never be any justification for an entirely summary execution such as that carried out by Russian troops when those people were probably fast asleep."
"I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that no section of the press has spoken about this, which is very serious, because it is an offence against democratic and human co-existence - whether or not they are terrorists - and also to the fact that there has been no mention in this House of this action, which was outrageously barbaric."
"I would just like to repeat to Lord Bethell that not a single political decision has been taken in Denmark concerning the imprisonment of Mr Zakayev."
"Some charges have been brought, which the Danish police have investigated."
"A judge has decided that Mr Zakayev is to remain in custody for a further period, but if it proves that the charges brought have no basis, then naturally he will be released again."
"That is how the judicial system works, and Lord Bethell can be certain that the Danish legal system functions in accordance with all the principles that we uphold in this Union."
"Thank you for that illuminating response."
"In conjunction with this debate, I have received six motions for resolutions, which were submitted in accordance with Rule 37.2 of the Rules of Procedure"
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, just over three years ago General Musharraf took power in Pakistan in a military coup."
"This caused great concern in the democratic world and led to much condemnation."
"The coup was later approved by the Pakistan Supreme Court provided that Pakistan re-established democracy within three years of the military coup, that is, by 12 October this year."
"On 14 August last year, General Musharraf published his so-called 'Road Map To Democracy', which described how he proposed to comply with the decision of the Pakistan Supreme Court and restore democracy in Pakistan."
"This plan was made up of four parts: 1) the establishment of local elected councils (this took place in August 2001), 2) preparation for provincial and federal elections with the establishment of an electoral commission and the preparation of registers of electors, ID cards etc., as well as the implementation of a number of constitutional amendments, 3) the holding of the actual elections, and 4) the transfer of governmental power to elected civil provincial and federal assemblies, as well as election of the presidents of the assemblies, etc."
"The election on 10 October this year was monitored by election observers, especially from the EU."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Cushnahan for the great work that he and the other members of the Mission carried out in this connection."
"For security reasons alone, it was extremely difficult to implement the election monitoring but, despite this, Mr Cushnahan and his team completed the task that they had been given."
"As Mr Cushnahan has remarked in his report on the election monitoring, there are a number of things in connection with the election in Pakistan that one might have wished had been different."
"We have noted in particular the report's criticism of the circumstances in the run-up to the actual elections, especially the constitutional amendments introduced by President Musharraf this summer."
"There were unequal opportunities to conduct election campaigns and unequal access to resources and to the media, and there were reports of manipulation in connection with the elections."
"Taken together, these factors gave cause for concern."
"Nonetheless, it is the Council's assessment that the holding of the elections was an important step along the way towards the restoration of democracy in Pakistan."
"Throughout the process, the EU has conducted an ongoing dialogue with Pakistan concerning the reintroduction of democracy and, in the course of this, has also had the opportunity to express criticism of factors which have moved in the wrong direction."
"The result of the election of 10 October meant that a coalition government is to be formed."
"Negotiations are not yet complete."
"The transfer of executive power to the future prime minister is expected to take place in the course of this month."
"The EU and Pakistan issued a joint declaration on signing the cooperation agreement between the EU and Pakistan in Islamabad on 24 November last year."
"In the light of the current situation, the EU and Pakistan confirmed the importance of the international efforts to combat terrorism."
"In the same declaration, Pakistan also confirmed its commitment to the restoration of democracy in accordance with the said Road Map, something which was welcomed by the EU."
"It must be stated that President Musharraf has stood by his promise to implement the promised Road Map."
"The conditions are thus in place for taking the agreement further."
"Also on the positive side is the fact that the President has implemented a number of reforms aimed at re-establishing the economy and combating corruption."
"It is crucial to state that implementation of the cooperation agreement does not rubber-stamp Pakistan's democracy."
"As I have mentioned, there are many things that we might wish were different, as can be seen from Mr Cushnahan's report."
"The agreement includes an initial paragraph in which the parties to the agreement confirm their respect for human rights."
"With this agreement in our hands, I believe that we have a better instrument with which to discuss democracy and human rights with Pakistan than has previously been the case."
"The Council will continue to expand the dialogue with Pakistan with a view to helping strengthen Pakistan's democracy."
"With these words, I would like, moreover, once again to thank Mr Cushnahan for his outstanding work and for the basis he has provided for assessing the democracy in Pakistan."
"Madam President, the Commission agrees with the Presidency that the National and Provincial Assembly elections held in Pakistan on 10 October should be seen as a first step in the gradual transition from a military to a civilian administration with permanent and well-functioning democratic institutions."
"The elections resulted in a fragmented parliament which in turn delayed the inaugural session of the National Assembly."
"This finally took place on 16 November."
"The extensive negotiations among political parties demonstrate that a revitalised democratic process has been initiated following the elections."
"We expect that the new government will be equipped with full executive powers."
"The Commission will continue to stay engaged with Pakistan throughout the transition process."
"The Commission would like to congratulate the EU election observation mission, led by Mr Cushnahan, on the excellent work achieved under very difficult circumstances, notably a particularly challenging security environment."
"His dedication went far beyond what would normally be expected of a chief election observer."
"The Commission appreciates that the mission was able to carry out its task in full compliance with internationally accepted criteria used for election observation."
"Let me also take this opportunity to express the Commission's satisfaction with the cooperation with the European Parliament in the observation of the election in Pakistan."
"In particular I would like to thank the members of the European Parliament delegation, led by Mrs Grönfeldt Bergman, for their invaluable work."
"What is more, this is not an isolated case."
"The Commission and Parliament have developed very good working relations in the field of election observation in general."
"The Commission believes that the presence of the EU election observation mission has served to enhance the democratic process in Pakistan."
"Moreover, its recommendations on how to further strengthen this process and improve the election framework will be raised in the dialogue with the Pakistani authorities."
"The Commission is also prepared to look into possible follow-up activities on the basis of its report."
"The Commission agrees with the EU election observation mission that a general election does not in itself guarantee the establishment of democracy and that those who support the restoration of democracy should work together to achieve that objective."
"Concerning the methodology we applied to observation of the election in Pakistan, the Commission would like to stress that we followed our standard approach."
"Elections are not one-day events and the whole process, including the pre-voting period, has to be assessed."
"The criticism made in Pakistan that the mission was exceeding its mandate because it arrived too early and interfered with the internal affairs of the country by analysing the overall election framework is therefore groundless."
"As far as the new cooperation agreement between the European Community and Pakistan is concerned, the Commission would like to recall that exceptional circumstances in the region called for a response commensurate to the risk President Musharraf took in siding with the international community on Afghanistan."
"The aim of the agreement is to engage significantly and visibly with Pakistan, both in political and economic terms, and to encourage Pakistan to adhere to the implementation of the roadmap for the return to democracy."
"The reasons why it is important for the EU and the Commission to engage Pakistan in an enhanced political dialogue are well known."
"They include the fight against terrorism, Pakistan's difficult relations with India, the need for stability in neighbouring Afghanistan, Pakistan's deep-rooted economic and social problems and, last but not least, the continuing transition to democracy."
"Relevant topics to be raised in that dialogue include basic education, where our aim is to strengthen the secular education system, fostering trade and business links and human rights issues, which are an essential element of the new agreement."
"In this connection, Pakistan has been designated a focus country under the European Initiative for Human Rights and Democracy."
"The Commission is aware that continuing uncertainty over the role and functioning of political institutions in Pakistan means that we need to monitor closely whether there is genuine progress on the transfer of power to the elected parliament in the coming weeks and months."
"Ratification of the new cooperation agreement would allow us to re-establish the full cooperation dialogue with the new government."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to pay tribute to all who served on the recent EU election observation mission to Pakistan, particularly the members of my core team and also the European Parliament delegation led by Miss Grönfeldt Bergman."
"Secondly, I would like to thank the EU Commission personnel involved in election observation."
"Thirdly, I would like to express my appreciation for the moral support and political solidarity extended by Commissioner Patten."
"Regrettably, I am unable to add the name of the Council and the Presidency to the list of those I would like to thank."
"The reason is that I am very angry at the statement issued by the Presidency concerning the election and I regret that the same sentiments were expressed today."
"I would like to seek clarification on aspects of the statement."
"How can the Presidency commend the Pakistan authorities for their cooperation with the mission when it was fully aware that we never received a formal invitation from the authorities and that they also refused to sign a memorandum of understanding, including an agreement to provide security cover."
"This information was officially reaffirmed in a démarche to the Danish Presidency six weeks after we arrived in Pakistan."
"The Presidency should also have been aware of the public attacks on the EOM by several government ministers, using such inflammatory language as 'these Western whites have no interest in peace in Pakistan; these people come from unfriendly nations and have hostile objectives; this Mission is interfering in the internal affairs of Pakistan'."
"How can you regard this as cooperation?"
"Security cover was indeed finally provided for the second half of our mission, but it came from the provincial governors and not from the federal authorities."
"Furthermore, in its statement the Presidency expresses 'concern' about reports of manipulation - very mild indeed - and you ask the Election Commission to follow up such complaints."
"Did you actually read our report?"
"Surely you are aware that we expressed serious criticism of the Election Commission and its lack of independence?"
"To ask the Election Commission to investigate election malpractice is like asking Saddam Hussein to head the UN weapons inspection team in Iraq."
"I would like to remind the Council that the mission I led was not a Parliament mission, it was an EU mission consisting of 88 dedicated people, who discharged their task professionally in line with internationally accepted criteria for election observation."
"As you and the Commissioner have said, they worked in a particularly sensitive political and security environment at great personal risk to themselves."
"Yet within four days of our preliminary report being published in Islamabad you effectively distanced yourself from our conclusions that it was a seriously flawed process."
"You did so despite the fact that Member States received full weekly reports of our observations."
"I and members of my core team also briefed heads of mission in Islamabad on a weekly basis."
"Yet never once did anyone challenge our ongoing assessment."
"And even at the final debriefing of heads of mission in Islamabad, little or no opposition to our analysis was expressed."
"Ironically, by comparison, the Presidency strongly criticised the elections in Togo on 27 October, where there was no EU observation mission, yet you chose to ignore the conclusion of the Pakistan mission that had been operating for two and a half months."
"Why was the initial draft of your reaction to the election toned down?"
"Who influenced you?"
"Who pressurised you?"
"And because your statement is being used by Pakistan's embassies worldwide to undermine our report, you betrayed the EU mission you sent into the field and I say on their behalf, shame on you."
"I would also like to take the opportunity to refute the untrue allegation made by the Pakistan ambassador in Washington that the EU/EOM leaked an interim briefing report."
"In fact this was leaked by an Islamabad-based diplomat for a Member State government, who was in Europe at the time, and was designed to undermine the work of the EU/EOM."
"Returning to your reaction, not only does your response betray the EU/EOM, it is a betrayal of the interests of the people of Pakistan, especially those who are courageously working for the restoration of democracy."
"Your failure to endorse the conclusions of the EU/EOM and other observer groups such as ANFREL, NDI and the Commonwealth, compounds your predecessor's mistake in failing to criticise the farcical presidential referendum and is directly responsible for encouraging the Government of Pakistan to behave as it does."
"But as well as betraying the EU/EOM and ordinary Pakistanis, you are also betraying the ideals of your own Presidency."
"Let me remind you that in your own Presidency programme, you set yourself the twin tasks of 'increased effectiveness and greater openness in the field of human rights'."
"The statement on the Pakistan election showed little commitment to this."
"But worst of all, tailoring your response for geopolitical reasons was a total betrayal of the principles underlying election observation, which is designed to enhance democratisation and human rights."
"Madam President, I should like to get straight to the point: although today's discussion should remain focused on the issue of the recent elections in Pakistan, it is clearly a time to assess the entire process of transition to democracy in that major south Asian country."
"It is also clear that, now more than ever, international relations at various levels, including the economic and commercial levels, must involve honouring commitments that have been given and the careful management of expectations."
"We all welcomed the support given by the President of Pakistan to the fight against terrorism, which has helped to soften an extremely negative image created by the military coup that removed the elected government led by Nawaz Sharif."
"We also know that it is impossible to speak of consolidated democracy whilst the military is interfering in the political arena; but we also know from various examples in southern European and Latin American countries, that it is possible to start a process of transition to democracy by making a pact with civilian political representatives, provided that the various phases and arrangements agreed on are respected."
"It is precisely the respect for these requirements that, in the period of transition to democracy, provides the necessary if insufficient legitimacy for the military to continue in some political role."
"This is precisely where our main concerns lie."
"In August 2001, the Pakistani president announced the road map for democracy, which included the elections due to take place on 10 October."
"This was an historic moment."
"In the end, however, we are sorry to say that this opportunity was largely wasted."
"We do not wish to issue any kind of judgment on the process of transition to democracy in Pakistan but we can say that this a poor way of promoting it and we hope that the elected members will have the clear-mindedness, the political ability and the courage necessary to lead a new phase of genuine transition to a democratic political power."
"Madam President, I should like to make it clear that I am not speaking on behalf of the ELDR or in favour of this resolution."
"Although I understand some of the concerns of the people who wrote this resolution, especially in the run-up to the election in Pakistan, particularly that anyone standing for election should have to have a university degree, I do not agree with them."
"I agree that President Musharraf took over in a coup."
"But let me make it clear for the record that this was a bloodless coup; political parties were not banned and no restrictions were placed on the media."
"Yes, the legal framework order was reintroduced by the president, giving him powers to dismiss the parliament."
"But my understanding is that such powers exist in some EU countries."
"The French president, for instance, can dissolve parliament."
"I think we are looking at it too much from a European perspective."
"There have been allegations of corruption for centuries in Pakistan."
"These elections are a step in the right direction."
"The fact that many who oppose President Musharraf were elected surely speaks for itself."
"All parties in Pakistan welcomed these elections."
"They have just elected a Speaker."
"They are about to elect a prime minister."
"President Musharraf actually met his commitment - as the Council said - to hold these elections."
"Let us now look forward instead of looking back."
"Madam President, I believe we should always pay great attention to our behaviour and political actions towards the countries with which we have relations and agreements in matters of cooperation and aid."
"There are times when our certainties or our model of democracy disregard the historical and political context of European integration and new forms of an old colonialism can appear, creating mistrust and feelings of injured dignity, or even injured sovereignty."
"We know that democracy is measured not just on election day but on the basis of effective grass-roots participation, civil liberties, equal opportunities, justice and development."
"Having said that, I do not in the least intend to give up the widely - and internationally - shared view that human rights are universal, which is why no specific context can justify the death penalty, whether in Pakistan or in the United States."
"I took part in the election mission to Pakistan led by Mr Cushnahan, to whom we must all be grateful - I am, at least - for the rigorous and thorough nature of his work."
"I agree with the EU report and the criticisms it contains not so much about the day of the elections, which, as far as I could see, were carried out correctly - we were given a very good reception by the people and the electoral representatives, and, moreover, I am talking about Peshawar, an area where the Islamic religious party prevailed - but rather the entire electoral process, with its restrictions and the erroneous decision to allow only those with a degree to stand as candidates."
"I believe the transition from military domination to democratically elected political representation will be difficult: the path of democracy in Pakistan is difficult and, without a doubt, is hindered by the military."
"I also think it will be extremely difficult to eradicate corruption and poverty, which goes hand in hand with its defeat, and I say so because I myself come from a country that is not poor but where there is still, in actual fact, a lot of corruption."
"I believe we must make a major effort in the fields of cooperation and trade and carry out political analysis in the areas of development and education, and I also believe that the human rights of all people should be upheld, even those accused of terrorism."
"We must therefore call upon the Pakistan Government to comply with the international treaties."
"Madam President, I would like to start by saying that I agree with the statements made here by the Commission and the Council, but I would like to stress a few key points."
"Pakistan is now a nuclear power that is even engaging in trade in nuclear technology, if you include North Korea."
"The war in Afghanistan was pretty much an acid test for Pakistan, and I believe that it was only the current regime, the Musharraf regime, that made the anti-terror coalition possible in Pakistan at all."
"The Kashmir problem has not gone away, and it is one of the major focuses of conflict in Asia."
"Unfortunately, the anti-terror strategy has meant encroaching upon human rights and slowing down the process of democratisation in Pakistan, as has regrettably been the case in many other countries as well."
"For its part - and in saying this I am simply describing the situation and not wishing to be judgmental - the Musharraf regime is essentially a consequence of the fact that there was previously a string of corrupt governments."
"I share the view that we have heard expressed here: Pakistan has for generations been run by corrupt governments whose leadership of the state has given no evidence of responsibility."
"That meant that military governments repeatedly came to power."
"All those governments made a show of democratisation for the benefit of the West and at the same time had to keep the extremists at home happy."
"That was bound to lead to tensions."
"One comment about the election: we know that only about 30% of Pakistan's population voted, for a variety of reasons."
"In Baluchistan and in the north-west of the country, religious fundamentalists were the victors in the election."
"That is a problem, because it means the country is becoming more and more unstable."
"The MMA, the party that brings together the various fundamentalist strands, will create problems for Musharraf and for the government that is to be formed."
"Madam President, this afternoon we have heard three very important statements on the core issue of this particular debate - one by the Council, one by the Commission and one by the chief observer on the European Union mission, who was officially representing the three institutions during the election itself."
"I am particularly pleased and happy with the statement made by the Commission."
"I very carefully note the balance and the content and I say to the Commission representative here this afternoon that it is a statement that is exceptionally relevant to the situation that developed."
"I say to the Council that I expected more."
"I expected honesty and I expected the facts."
"I say to the President of the Council that his statement embarrasses me, and if it does that to me it must surely embarrass our colleague, Mr Haarder, who we all have known and respected as a man of principle and integrity since his time in this House."
"His statement is totally irrelevant to the true situation that emerged."
"We have heard from our colleague, Mr Cushnahan, who went there at great personal risk to fulfil a mission, who reported honestly and in a principled fashion on the situation that he witnessed."
"But before his statement could be taken for what it was worth, it was totally undermined by the Council."
"Mr Haarder, on behalf of his colleagues in Council, did not tell us on what Council's judgement was based."
"He said: 'Council's judgment was', and the statement that was issued was 'Council's judgment'."
"It is most regrettable that the Council described the situation in this way."
"We all want to see democracy restored in Pakistan."
"The general took over in a coup."
"Bloodless or not bloodless, a coup is a coup."
"We in this Parliament decided to terminate our parliamentary relationship with Pakistan."
"Now we have the chief observer on behalf of the European Union being somewhat rubbished by a statement from the Council, which was excellent in its artful dodging and with no reference to the serious flaws in the electoral process, just a bland reference to the reports of manipulation."
"Elsewhere the Presidency commends the Pakistan authorities for their cooperation with the observer mission for assuring a widely secure and free election day."
"In conclusion, I welcome the statements made by the Commission and Mr Cushnahan, but regretfully the statement made by the Council does this House an injustice because it is an insult to our intelligence and for what we stand."
"Madam President, I believe that in this debate we must distinguish between two things, as the representative of the Commission has said."
"Firstly, the genuinely exceptional circumstances in Pakistan and the strategic role it plays in relation to stability in Afghanistan, to the international coalition against terrorism and to the stability of all the countries of Central Asia."
"However, on the other hand, I do not believe that this fact bears any relation to the internal situation in that country, to the increase in Islamic fundamentalism, the interests and people, our allies, who are being attacked in Afghanistan and the human rights situation in the country."
"There are horrendous cases such as kidnap, extortion and the captivity of the so-called 'child jockeys' and, of course, I am also referring to the result of the evaluation of the elections."
"Mr Haarder, you know what affection and respect I have had for you since we worked together in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, but I would like to ask you what the point is in sending a mission of European Union electoral observers, the members of which behave in an exemplary manner at great risk to themselves, to carry out an assessment of the situation which furthermore is shared with other international missions, such as that of the Commonwealth and that of ANFREL, if then the representative of the President-in-Office of the Council fails to authorise it."
"Do we not already have enough differences in the United Nations Security Council, the General Affairs Council or at European Councils without this further demonstration of disagreement and division?"
"I believe, Madam President, that we must take note of this attitude and work together to prevent any recurrence of this type of situation which presents an image of total fragmentation which, of course, jeopardises the image and prestige of the European Union abroad."
"Madam President, hearing Mr Cushnahan and Mr Collins speak I find I must go back to my script and see whether it can really be true that what I said was so terrible."
"Can it be true that I did not even mention Mr Cushnahan's criticisms?"
"And I see in the script that in fact I did mention and praise Mr Cushnahan and that I mentioned five vehement points of criticism: 1) the constitutional changes which preceded the election, 2) the unequal access to conduct election campaigns, 3) the unequal access of the political parties to resources, 4) the unequal access to the media, and 5) the reports of manipulation in connection with the elections."
"I would like to reiterate my thanks to Mr Cushnahan for the fact that he drew attention to these fundamental faults in the democratic process so clearly."
"But it may be that what made him and also Mr Collins so angry was my subsequent sentence, and I quote: 'Nonetheless, it is the Council's assessment that the holding of the election was an important step along the way towards the restoration of democracy in Pakistan'."
"That is not a backward-looking sentence; rather, it states that despite everything, we are talking about the step from pure dictatorship to something that is less pure dictatorship, that is, something that also has a democratic element, even with all the criticism that can otherwise be mentioned."
"Of course we can ask, as Mr Cushnahan does, why the Council should make a declaration at all?"
"But I think it is important to establish - for the sake of future election observers as well - that the EU's observers act entirely independently of the Council."
"Thus a declaration by them is also entirely independent."
"That is how things are and it means that even if the Council has said something, the election observers can say something completely different; and if the election observers have said something, then likewise the Council can choose to refer to this a great deal or a little, can choose to look backwards or forwards. The two parties are independent of each other and I think we should retain that."
"The fact that the Council found cause to make a declaration in this case must naturally be seen in the light of the following."
"Since the turn of the year the security situation in the region has severely deteriorated, with extensive build-ups of troops in both India and Pakistan."
"The situation was so acute that there was an increased risk of war."
"And both countries have nuclear weapons."
"The Council has been very much involved in the international work to encourage de-escalation, and in this connection the Council saw the election in Pakistan and the provincial elections in the Indian provinces of Jammu and Kashmir as an important step along the way towards an improvement in the situation."
"The Council's declaration also called upon both India and Pakistan to take advantage of the opportunities following the elections to improve their bilateral relationship."
"It is in the light of this hope for the future that the Council's declaration is to be seen."
"The Council's declaration does not diminish Mr Cushnahan's criticism - absolutely not. I would ask Mr Cushnahan to believe this and take comfort from it, and I would like to assure him that Mr Cushnahan's criticism has not been weakened in any way by the fact that the Council said what it said."
"Indeed, the Council refers to the criticism and I referred to the criticism."
"So can we not now allow each other this: that there is a need for election observers, that there is a need for independent reports which draw attention to everything that is not as it should be."
"I have mentioned five major points of criticism here, but at the same time in such a crisis-ridden region of the world there is a need for the Council to attempt to find something to hold on to in terms of a little bit of progress which can provide a hope of peace and which at any rate provides a hope of avoiding war."
"I feel strongly that it is possible to work towards both - both towards complete democracy and towards pragmatic attempts to improve the opportunities for peace."
"I would like to start off with a few words on the more general subject of observing elections, repeating one sentence from my statement: the Commission would like to stress that we followed our standard approach in the methodology we used to observe the election in Pakistan."
"That is important."
"It also illustrates the professionalism in the way we do this and also in the way we work with the European Parliament."
"In general we have, over the years, managed to build up a global position as a quality electoral observation party."
"What has been achieved and contributed in this case certainly adds to our track record."
"However, it is important not to confuse the task of election observation with handling the relationship in general, the overall agenda vis-à-vis the country in question."
"I liked what Mrs Lynne said about the process."
"Very shortly after the signature of the cooperation agreement in November last year when Mr Verhofstadt and President Prodi visited President Musharraf, I visited him on my way back from Afghanistan in the first week of December last year and had a very long and frank exchange with him."
"I share the view that on balance he seems to be more part of the solution than part of the problem for Pakistan today."
"We must avoid over-simplification."
"We talk more about democratisation than democracy."
"Working constructively and consistently on the situation as a whole is a better way of dealing with the problems than dwelling too much on the pure and perfect principles of democracy."
"That is how we are trying to make a difference in Africa and elsewhere."
"Let me make one comment about the cooperation agreement."
"What we are trying to achieve through the agreement is a contribution to the process of democratisation, to the promotion of economic development and progress."
"I strongly urge Parliament to see this cooperation agreement as a positive European contribution to stability in the region and to foster the dialogue with President Musharraf and the emerging democratic Pakistani leaders in order to speed up progress."
"That is the thinking behind the cooperation agreement and I hope Parliament will see it from that point of view."
"Without wishing to set a precedent, because we are not going to continue the debate, I am going to give the floor to Mr Cushnahan for a clarification."
"Madam President, in response to Mr Haarder may I ask that he read very carefully the declaration of the 12th and then maybe he will understand why I am angry."
"Would he not be convinced by the fact that Pakistan embassies are using this worldwide to rubbish our report and to say that there is something wrong with it?"
"Would he also accept - and I agree with his point about the strategic importance of Pakistan in the region, especially at this critical time - that failed states, abuse of human rights and abuse of democracy are the very things that feed terrorism?"
"The best way to eradicate terrorism is to restore democracy, rather than turning a blind eye to a military regime that is abusing democracy, wants to retain power and does not want to return it to a civilian administration."
"Mr President, I agree, but I also agree with the last sentence in the summary of your report, the so-called preliminary statement of 12 October."
"You end up by saying 'the EU EOM hopes that following the completion of this election all parties will work together to achieve the establishment of good governance in Pakistan'."
"I believe that is our common hope."
"I think we need both views on the situation in Pakistan: your criticism and my point on the strategic importance of Pakistan."
"I have received five motions for resolutions"
"The next item is the Council statement on the tripartite social summit."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has been asked to make a statement on the subject of social dialogue and the tripartite social summit."
"The Council is fully in agreement with Parliament's positive assessment of the significance of the European social dialogue and notes the good progress and the encouraging results that have been achieved in connection with the informal summits to date, despite the lack of a formalised institutional framework for these meetings."
"Close contact based on reciprocal trust between the public authorities and the parties of the labour market at European, national and local level is of crucial importance for strengthening economic progress, prosperity and social integration in Europe."
"The parties stated in the declaration of the European Council in Laeken that the Standing Committee on Employment was not living up to its aims and that the parties would like to see the committee replaced by an established practice of holding tripartite social summits."
"The Laeken European Council and the Barcelona European Council concluded that such a social summit should be held prior to each spring summit."
"On 26 June this year the Commission submitted a proposal for a decision by the Council on the establishment of a tripartite social summit together with the abolition of the Standing Committee on Employment."
"The Danish Presidency gave the proposal high priority and worked towards a rapid resolution."
"However, during the initial work in the Council it emerged that the proposal gave rise to a number of issues and legal and institutional problems which could not be resolved immediately."
"The Presidency wishes to work towards a position being taken at the Council summit on 3 December on how the efforts towards establishing the social summit are to continue."
"Should it be decided to continue working on a proposal for a formal decision, then devising the further details will not be possible until during the Greek Presidency."
"However, there is nothing to prevent the social summits being held on an informal basis without the basis of a decision, as has been the case to date."
"I hope that this answers the question of what the Council intends to do to establish the social summit."
"The issue of consultation with Parliament has not yet been discussed by the Council."
"Once the Council has decided the details of how the social summit is to be established there will be a basis for discussing how Parliament can be involved."
"I would like to end by thanking Parliament for having raised the issue of social dialogue and the tripartite social summit."
"Indeed, it provides a good opportunity to discuss various aspects of this important issue."
"I hope that we will have a good discussion and I can assure you that the Danish Presidency will take care to include the points of view put forward today in its further deliberations."
"Mr President, as the President-in-Office has already said, the Commission has presented a proposal for this tripartite social summit for growth and employment by means of a Council decision."
"This proposal was not isolated; it was within the framework of the need to change and modernise the European social dialogue."
"The aim of this proposal is to formalise the social dialogue summits held in Stockholm in March 2001 and Barcelona in March 2002."
"There is nothing to stop us from holding another informal meeting but, as the President-in-Office has already said, it is very important to formalise this tripartite social summit, because the social partners agreed to it at the European Summit at Laeken."
"In any case, it will be a summit on growth and employment and it will replace the existing Standing Committee on Employment."
"This forum will play a very important role as far as the implementation of the Lisbon process is concerned, because it is the proper forum for the social partners to submit their proposals and their common agenda for the implementation of the Lisbon strategy."
"The Commission chose Article 202 as the legal basis for the establishment of the tripartite social summit, since that was the legal basis for the Standing Committee on Employment."
"Although there is no provision for consultation of the European Parliament under that article, the Commission anticipated in its proposal that Parliament would be consulted on the introduction of a tripartite social summit because it is a very sensitive and important issue."
"The prerogative as to whether to follow this suggestion or not rests with the Council."
"The Commission considers it of the utmost importance for the proposal to be rapidly adopted."
"As I have already said, this view is strongly endorsed by the European interprofessional social partners."
"It will ensure greater consistency between the different dialogues in which the social partners are involved."
"We held informal discussions in the Council and a large majority of Member States agreed on this issue."
"We believe we will overcome some of the problems - legal or not - which exist in some Member States."
"I hope that this proposal will receive political support in the Social Affairs Council on 3 December, which would allow it to be adopted at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 9 and 10 December, so that we can have a formal tripartite social summit during the Greek Presidency."
"Mr President, what we have here is something of a difficult discussion."
"I am very pleased that the response has been given in this way, but I have to say that the answer is rather unsatisfactory."
"We have before us a proposal on which, as far as the objective is concerned, everyone is actually probably agreed."
"This objective is of course the holding of such a tripartite meeting."
"This is where all the problems start, however."
"The Commission is making reference to Article 202; the Council evidently does not agree with this, because it is deliberating about it."
"In anticipation of the result of these deliberations there is no wish to seek an opinion from the European Parliament, in particular the opinion that is being prepared by Mr Ettl."
"We consider this a totally unacceptable situation."
"As coordinators of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs we have also spoken about it and it is our view that if things go on this way we shall have to seriously consider going to the European Court of Justice, because the rights of the European Parliament are being violated."
"I also think, Commissioner, that even if Article 202 is used as a basis, you are not applying the Article correctly."
"You must read the second part of 202, which states that there are indeed cases in which an opinion is not sought from the European Parliament, but that the matter must then have been determined in advance and with an opinion from the European Parliament or that a kind of mandate must have been given."
"Now, to the best of our knowledge, no mandate has been given here."
"In any event, everything requires full investigation."
"I have to say, and this goes for the Council as well, that a lot of trouble could have been saved if the European Parliament had been asked for an opinion."
"Failure to do so gives this whole affair a rather sinister undertone."
"We are ourselves currently in the process of consulting Parliament's Legal Affairs Department on this matter."
"It is of course possible to use a different legal basis, but I am sure that it will be extraordinarily difficult for the Council and the Commission to find a legal basis where no opinion from the European Parliament is required."
"After all, that is what this is all about and we are standing up for our rights."
"The rights of Parliament are already relatively limited when it comes to matters of this kind."
"That is partly perhaps with good reason, partly also it arises from the Treaty itself, but we cannot in any event accept further erosion of the already limited rights of Parliament in this way."
"That is the message I would like to give the Council and the Commission in their future deliberations."
"Finally, I have one further question."
"If you indeed proceed to act on the basis of Article 202, should the costs of this operation not be covered by the Council rather than the Commission, as has been the case to date?"
"Perhaps it will be possible to give an answer to this question as well."
"Mr President, I would first like to thank Mr Pronk for pointing out that Article 202 is by no means a legislative soft option, and it does not make life easy for the Council or the Commission."
"I would also like to thank the Commissioner for her clear statement about the arrangements for the tripartite social summit, and to thank the Danish Presidency for attempting to accommodate us."
"What I do not understand as the nominated rapporteur, however, is that at a moment when we are anxious to tackle employment policy and growth in an active way, we are wasting time."
"The intention was to begin making arrangements for this standing tripartite social summit now, before the spring summit, so that the social partners could start work straight away."
"The approach we have now adopted means that we are wasting time again, possibly a whole year, at a point when we want to play an active role on employment issues."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has virtually been neutralised - we do not have an appropriate mechanism here."
"This means that the social dialogue will not be particularly mobilised as a fundamental mechanism for the social partners to be able to - or in fact be obliged to - achieve something practice-related."
"At a point when the term 'social dimension' and thus all the mechanism that involves - notably the social dialogue - are constantly on everyone's lips, and when we are talking about deepening social issues in Europe, we are wasting time."
"I just cannot understand that."
"One more point: today we stand on the threshold of the enlargement of the European Union."
"I have discussed these issues with many partner states and they all want a properly functioning mechanism in this field, and one that would help all the new Member States."
"However, I do not believe that it will be easier, if the mechanism does not become operational under the Greek Presidency, to sort matters out later on, once the new Member States have joined us. Things can only get more difficult then, because the existing social partnerships, industrial relations that is, are not so robust."
"That is the problem we face."
"I do not need to use all my speaking time; I have already expressed my indignation about the fact that Article 202 is constantly referred to as a soft option."
"Parliament's Legal Service will give us its opinion on this next week, and I hope that will help us somewhat."
"I would like to thank the Danish Presidency and Commissioner Diamantopoulou once again for their support."
"I hope that 3 December will be a productive day in this area."
"Mr President, the ELDR Group fully endorses the argument that Parliament has a right to be heard."
"In this particular week, however, I agree with Mr Ettl that it is appropriate to add something about the need for early involvement of the prospective new members in the tripartite social summit and the state of dialogue within those countries."
"The way in which trade unions and employers' organisations are organised varies considerably from one country to another, as does the manner and extent of collective bargaining."
"The development of employers' organisations is recent and sporadic and their activities are not always coordinated."
"Where confederations of trade unions and employers' organisations exist, they vary in the extent to which they participate in their equivalents at European level."
"Much therefore still needs to be done to develop the basis for social dialogue."
"I know that this issue is one that the Commission has already begun to address through a variety of measures."
"Its work is of major importance, since cooperation between the authorities, trade unions and employers' organisations is vital for economic and social development and thus for increased employment."
"As the Danish Presidency has recently said, tripartite cooperation and the social dialogue need to be strengthened if the new Member States are to be able to participate in the work on equal terms with all the other Member States."
"We must ensure that their voices, as well as our own, are properly heard."
"Mr President, I should like to say the following: this Council position on social dialogue is contradictory."
"On the one hand it claims to be interested but on the other, it continues to obstruct its implementation, as is clear from its postponement of the formal creation of the Tripartite Social Summit."
"The Commissioner has already provided important information, for which I thank her and which allows us to draw this conclusion."
"Unfortunately, this demonstrates the little importance attached to social issues by most Member State governments."
"I would emphasise the case of Portugal, with which, being Portuguese, I am most familiar."
"In addition to the questions that other speakers have already raised about Parliament's participation and also about the significance of postponing the creation of the Tripartite Social Summit, I should also like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council the following: what measures are you planning to adopt in order at least to increase the participation of women in the social dialogue, in terms of the decision-making bodies, in terms of legal bases and also in terms of the content to be addressed in this entire process?"
"What measures are you intending to adopt to ensure that priority is given to social issues, specifically in the field of employment, social inclusion, equal rights and opportunities and compliance with the social agenda in general?"
"What measures are you planning to take in order to effectively protect social and labour rights and to ensure that they are complied with in practice?"
"Mr President, the Council's answers to our questions this afternoon have been clear, albeit not as full as many of us would have liked."
"We are well aware of the importance that Denmark itself attaches to the work of the social partners in that 80% of Danish workers are covered by collective agreements, but we are also aware that, as we have been hearing, a number of Member States do not share this view."
"Parliament is beginning to feel a sense of urgency about the need to give greater coherence to the work of the social partners."
"As has been said, this becomes crucial as we look towards enlargement."
"We would be interested to hear what involvement is foreseen, and at what point, for the social partners from the accession countries."
"We are also aware that there are many areas where such consultation is already being advocated, in the temporary agency work directive for example, and in a whole range of other areas relating to family-friendly work, quality of work, modernisation of work, organisation, active ageing policies and so on. So we are also hoping that this new approach will be able to look at the qualitative aspects of growth and employment, which are all too often forgotten, and the social repercussions as a whole."
"I would echo much of what Mrs Figueiredo has already said."
"In terms of funding, I find myself agreeing with Mr Pronk as to the source of funding and again this is going to have to take particular account of the enlargement process."
"As far as the role of the European Parliament is concerned, we are beginning to find an increasing number of forms and areas of cooperation in which Parliament is not fully involved."
"Open coordination is one area where we are still getting no clear response as to where Parliament actually fits into the whole process."
"We are also aware that certain governments do not want to see any extension of parliamentary powers in the convention process."
"Some of them seem to be starting early in looking at issues such as the tripartite summit and Parliament's involvement there."
"Whilst we are looking at questions on the legal basis, this is not the only issue where the question of Parliament's involvement arises."
"I am thinking of the coordination of social security for third country nationals."
"We look forward to the legal opinion and we look forward to greater involvement for Parliament so that in future this will not be an issue."
"Mr President, we make no secret of the fact that there is a certain amount of disagreement concerning the legal basis for these activities."
"However, first I would like to emphasise that nobody has raised any objection to the idea of holding tripartite summits."
"Indeed, it was supported by everyone both in Laeken and in Barcelona, so there is no disagreement on that."
"Nonetheless, there are certain legal problems which are fairly involved."
"In brief, I can say that the Commission proposes to use Article 202 as the legal basis."
"The Legal Service of the Council is however of the opinion that this provision cannot be used because it does not give the Council unrestricted decision-making competence."
"It merely refers to the articles in the Treaty that specify the measures which the Council can take."
"And according to the Council's Legal Service, that does not provide a legal basis."
"And when the Commission proposes that the summit should consist of the Council's presidency at Head of State and Government level, the Council's Legal Service believes that the Council (employment, social policy and health and consumer protection) is not able to make a decision on the introduction of a summit at Head of State and Government level."
"This might be able to be solved somehow or other if there is a will to do so."
"Neither does the Council's Legal Service agree with the Commission's proposal that the results of the summit - which is to take place the day before the European Council - are to be presented to the European Council in the form of a report."
"It points out that this would contravene the rules on the organisation of the work of the European Council which the Council itself adopted in Seville in June and that it would be contrary to Article 2 of the Council's Rules of Procedure, which oblige the Council to prepare the European Councils, including the necessary coordination of all the preparatory work."
"Moreover, Article 2 sets out time periods for drawing up the provisional agenda of the European Council and the submission of contributions to the discussions and these time periods are not complied with under the proposal."
"However, concerning this point I would like to say that it can probably be solved with the right will."
"It simply requires some further discussion."
"I believe that the first problem I mentioned, namely the use of Article 202 as the legal basis, is the biggest."
"But let us see whether we can make any progress with it."
"I have now given an open and honest account of where the disagreement lies."
"Sometimes you want to ask the lawyers if they cannot try to reach agreement before letting us politicians know, but that is probably easier said than done."
"Perhaps the Treaty basis is not always equally clear, in which case we have to find a political solution which allows us to do what we want to without it being claimed that we are breaking the rules which form the basis of our work."
"These were a couple of issues."
"I can assure Mr Ettl that we are not wasting time."
"However, until we find a correct formal solution we may have to continue with informal summits, that is, follow the informal procedure."
"I would like to say to Mrs Figueiredo that I am fully aware of what she mentioned concerning the representativeness of the parties, but this has not yet been discussed in detail."
"I do not want to start a major legal debate here in Parliament."
"I simply felt that I had a duty to state the reasons why the Council is not yet ready to start a formal dialogue as requested."
"However, we are prepared to continue the more informal dialogue until a solution can be found."
"Mr President, the Council was quite convincing."
"The question is why the Commission proposed this."
"I would ask the Commissioner whether it is feasible for the Commission to propose another legal basis."
"Under Article 308, for instance, which is very often used in situations like these, Parliament has a direct right to give its advice."
"Was that why the Commission did not specify Article 308?"
"Mr President, the reason the Commission has chosen Article 202 is that this is the basis used for the Standing Committee on Employment and it has worked for many years."
"Some of the legal aspects of the proposal have already been referred to."
"We believe that these can be overcome with cooperation between the Councils, if from the Employment Council we go to the General Affairs Council and a final paragraph is inserted into the conclusions of the General Affairs Council."
"I completely agree that, with political will, we can overcome these problems."
"The Council is responsible for the budget, but it is a very small one."
"That is because it only allows for the invitation of eight or ten representatives of the social partners."
"Since I have the opportunity, I would like to say a few words on the participation of the applicant countries."
"These countries will, of course, become members of the European partners, the ETUC and UNICE, and they will participate in the social summit through their European institutions and organisations."
"In any case, we are working closely with governments and social partners in all the applicant countries because some of them are having to start from scratch and there are great problems with the functioning of social dialogue."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the Council and Commission statements on the extension of the Lamfalussy procedure to the entire financial services sector (for the Copenhagen Summit)"
"the report (A5-0370/2002) by Mr van den Burg, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the rules on prudential supervision in the European Union (2002/2061(INI))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure for me to have this chance to discuss the expansion of the Lamfalussy procedure to include all financial services."
"I greatly appreciate being given the opportunity to give an account of the Council's proposal to the European Parliament so that we can have a constructive and open dialogue between the Council and the European Parliament on this important subject."
"The European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has raised some issues concerning the restructured FSPG and the European Parliament's participation in the discussions on policy in the financial sector."
"I hope that these issues can be resolved before the report is adopted by the Ecofin Council on 3 December."
"The financial markets are playing an increasingly great role in Europe's economy."
"They are an important factor in the creation of growth and employment, and financial integration in the EU and the realisation of a single market for financial services will make a substantial contribution to increased prosperity."
"A report published last week by the Commission shows that full financial integration in the EU will in the long term increase the EU's GNP by 1.1%."
"Increased financial integration, however, also creates a need for improved cooperation on financial supervision in the EU and greater vigilance as regards financial stability."
"The development of the financial markets in recent years has underlined these needs."
"The Ecofin Council therefore wishes to extend the structure for financial legislation, supervision and stability in the securities market on which the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed in February this year to cover all financial services."
"The interinstitutional agreements that were entered into in connection with the securities markets will naturally also apply in the extended structure."
"And the monitoring of financial stability in the EU will be similarly strengthened."
"For several reasons it is important and imperative that this new structure be extended to include the banking and insurance sectors:"
"Firstly, the new structure will contribute to financial stability and effective harmonisation of financial regulation by creating a framework for effective cooperation and convergence between the financial supervisory authorities."
"The increasing integration and reciprocal influence of the financial markets in the EU makes this a necessity which must not be postponed."
"Secondly, the circumstances which gave rise to the introduction of the Lamfalussy procedure in the securities sector are also present in the banking and insurance sectors."
"The way in which rules are formed at present is inflexible, slow and ponderous - and I am fully aware that the Council can also be a delaying factor in the present process."
"The common rules are also implemented differently in the various Member States."
"The financial sector as a whole is developing fast, and rapid and effective cooperation on legislation and supervision is just as necessary for the other sectors as was the case for the securities markets."
"There is a need to be able to react faster than the current structure allows."
"Initiatives for new directives such as the implementation of capital adequacy rules in the area of banking and the Solvency II rules in the area of insurance will require certain detailed technical regulations and it is therefore appropriate to apply a more effective legislative procedure in this area, such as that used in the securities market."
"The new structure also paves the way for drawing a better distinction between the heart of the matter, that is to say, what is politically central, and what can be left to implementing decisions that can be adjusted on an ongoing basis in line with changing market conditions."
"Although the Commission is not expected to produce its proposal on Basle II until spring 2004, it would nonetheless be useful for the new structure to be in place at an early stage."
"Thirdly, the new structure is necessary in order to secure efficiency in connection with the EU's forthcoming enlargement."
"The new structure will be more serviceable and effective in an EU with 25 Member States."
"The Banking Advisory Committee, which currently carries out both level 2 and 3 tasks, has 3 members from each state (that is, one from the ministry, one from the supervisory authority and one from the central bank)."
"Following enlargement it will have 75 members, plus a number of observers."
"Harmonisation and convergence of European supervisory practice can best be promoted by establishing a uniform structure for all sectors."
"The structure from the securities market provides a suitable model here."
"The new supervisory structure will ensure that organisation of the exercise of supervision remains a national task and will create a more transparent committee structure without mixed mandates as is the case at present in the banking and insurance sectors."
"It creates a permanent and clear structure for cooperation across the various supervisory committees as well as for the relationship between supervisory committees and the 'level 2' committees."
"It thus establishes good cooperation on supervision across the sectors and creates a good and clear distribution of responsibility."
"In summary, therefore, we can state the following concerning the significance of the new structure:"
"There will be a greater degree of focus on political issues - and thus on the overall principles of the rules."
"The political and technical discussions will initially take place in separate fora, allowing the process to take place more quickly because work can be carried on at a technical level in parallel."
"Greater openness and commitment will be created in respect of the financial sectors in many countries and the implementation of the rules contained in the individual directives in the individual states will be more uniform, creating a basis for more uniform supervision."
"And finally, it will create a greater correlation between the rules in the individual parts of the financial sector."
"It is necessary to find a good structure for the role of the European Parliament in connection with the devising of overall policy guidelines for the financial sphere and I am convinced that this will be possible."
"As a starting point, I imagine regular meetings between the chairman of the restructured FSPG, the Commission and the European Parliament in order to strengthen the dialogue on the main policy guidelines for financial services."
"However, a rejuvenation of the 2005 Group is also feasible if this is preferable; this is, after all, mentioned in the European Parliament's decision on this issue."
"With regard to the restructured FSPG and its role in the devising of policy in the financial sphere we would take into account the European Parliament's concerns."
"The role of the restructured FSPG is not to be described as 'devising of policy in the financial sphere' ('policy shaping') as is stated in the text."
"Rather, the restructured FSPG would provide an overview and advise the Council and the Commission."
"This will be shown in the final report which is to be adopted on 3 December."
"The Council notes that if the new structure is to be able to take effect the European Parliament considers it essential that the legislative system in the EU is altered such that a clear distinction is made between primary and secondary legal acts and that there are the necessary revocation clauses."
"The Council is aware that the Commission intends to propose to the Convention that Article 202 of the Treaty be amended so as to reflect the powers of the legislative institutions - the European Parliament and the Council."
"As is well known, the Council cannot, as an institution, make decisions that impose obligations on the Convention or the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference."
"That is solely a matter for the Member States, which will define their own positions in the Convention and at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"As president of the Ecofin Council I can assure you that I both can and will encourage my colleagues to make their Heads of State and Government aware of the importance of this topic and at the same time call upon them to deliberate and discuss this issue during their preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference."
"We in the Council are aware that the role of the European Parliament must be respected."
"It is very important that the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference give consideration to a legislative system that allows greater efficiency in the legislative process and respects the principle of subsidiarity and the powers of the institutions involved."
"It is essential that a solution is found in respect of both the challenges faced by the financial sectors and the challenges faced by the Community as a whole."
"We must all be aware, however, that this is a broad issue which does not solely concern financial legislation."
"In conclusion, I would like to express my hope that the European Parliament's final position on this issue will take account of the actual opportunities open to the Council and the assurance of goodwill that I have given the European Parliament today."
"Mr President, this debate concerns both the resolution introduced by Mrs Randzio-Plath and the report prepared by Mrs van den Burg."
"With your agreement, I shall first speak on the subject of the resolution and then come to the report produced by Mrs van den Burg."
"As you may know, the ECOFIN Council has broadly endorsed the EFC reports on extending the Lamfalussy arrangements to insurance, banking and financial conglomerates."
"At the request of the Council and the Presidency, the Commission has organised a public consultation which ended last week."
"Overall the response of market practitioners, consumers and other interested parties has been supportive."
"We shall shortly make those responses available on our website, which is consistent with the open and transparent approach that Parliament wishes to be applied to the whole Lamfalussy procedure."
"The Commission supports the Council in extending the Lamfalussy arrangements, fully respecting all aspects of our arrangements with parliaments and our agreement with this House."
"I believe it will, in time, bring real benefits as the legislative process becomes faster, more flexible and more transparent."
"Let us remember what we are trying to do."
"One of our aims is to encourage the convergence of regulatory structures which, for securities, is now beginning to happen."
"We strongly believe that this is needed in the other sectors as well."
"I acknowledge your concerns about the lack of experience with the Lamfalussy approach hitherto."
"Inevitably this is a learning-by-doing process."
"We must examine any shortcomings, a task which has been specifically assigned to the interinstitutional monitoring group."
"But we still have to prepare, in time, for the decisions ahead, not least because we need time to put in place the framework and the structures to extend Lamfalussy."
"Moreover, whether or not we extend that process will also shape the type of directives we introduce in relation to banking, insurance and conglomerates."
"We must also take into account the need to establish efficient decision-taking structures before enlargement."
"We should not wait, therefore, until the year 2006 and beyond."
"Having said that, I fully understand the arguments put forward by this Parliament concerning the need for proper democratic and accountable standards and safeguards."
"The EFC's proposals have benefited significantly from the input of my services."
"In particular they respect existing interinstitutional political and legal agreements and the prerogatives of this Parliament."
"We have insisted on this throughout, as well as urging that the proposal should be submitted to public consultation."
"Incidentally, I do not accept that handing over chairmanship of the financial services policy group to a Member State will weaken the Commission's role."
"The FSPG will have a forward-looking prospective and strategic role but the Commission's right of initiative and indeed its role in the comitology procedure will not be compromised."
"That is explicitly stated in the EFC's report."
"I have noted Parliament's continuing interest in participating in the FSPG."
"But I should also like to note that the role of the FSPG is to advise the Council and the Commission."
"It is not an interinstitutional group."
"However, we have the 2005 Group - the President of the Council referred to that - within which the three institutions could regularly discuss strategic issues."
"I have also noted Parliament's call for a clear and unequivocal commitment to reform Article 202 of the Treaty."
"As you know, the Commission has repeatedly stated that it supports the amendment of this article."
"President Prodi said just that in this House on 5 February 2002, when we agreed with Parliament the democratic safeguards for moving forward with the Lamfalussy procedure."
"It is also in the Commission's governance White Paper, in the Commission's communication on better regulation and in the Commission's contribution to the Convention, its communication of 22 May entitled 'a project for the European Union'."
"In all those documents you will find the same opinion expressed, namely that we support Parliament in its wish to change Article 202 of the Treaty."
"The Commission will shortly come forward, probably on 4 December, with its communication on institutional architecture."
"The content of that is yet to be finalised but I can say that we believe that both branches of the legislature - the Council and Parliament - must in future be treated in an equal manner as regards control of the Commission and the whole comitology process."
"That is clear."
"What I would counsel against - and here I should like to end my comments on the resolution introduced by Mrs Randzio-Plath - is the adoption of a resolution today which you know in advance is politically undeliverable by the Member States."
"They cannot give their approval in advance of an Intergovernmental Conference that will not start until 2004."
"They cannot give their approval to a particular outcome."
"Surely the reasonable course of action would be to ensure that these important issues are firmly on the IGC agenda when it begins."
"Turning to the van den Burg report, the Commission broadly welcomes this report."
"I should like to thank Mrs van den Burg for having produced a report which is indeed timely, given the current debate on extending the Lamfalussy procedure, a debate which is under way in Parliament, the Council and, as a result of public consultation, also among more widely dispersed interest groups."
"In my view the report is very focused."
"It concentrates on the key developments in the financial sector such as the supervision of conglomerates, the globalisation of financial sector issues and responses to shortcomings in the American regulatory approach."
"It strikes a realistic note in recognising the different supervisory approaches adopted by Member States."
"The report calls on the Commission to act in a number of areas."
"Some of those suggestions are either being addressed or are in the pipeline."
"Let me mention four of them: firstly, a dialogue with associations representing the financial and consumer sectors; secondly, a dialogue with the United States; thirdly, sound regulatory and supervisory principles for the relevant authorities in the candidate countries; fourthly, impact assessments for new legislative proposals."
"The Commission may decide not to take forward all the suggestions in the report but we will certainly give them due consideration."
"I am pleased to note that the report is supportive of the Commission in a number of areas."
"For example, it reaffirms the Commission's leading role in framing legislation, enshrined in the Treaty as the right of initiative."
"Indeed it is a monopoly of initiative."
"The report also endorses the Commission's role as a fair power broker."
"It notes the important work the Commission services are doing on creating an integrated financial market which, as Mr Pedersen said a little while ago, is vital to the European Union's medium-term goal of creating the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy by the year 2010."
"Mr President, at the end of last week the Dutch Finance Minister announced measures to restore confidence in the financial markets. I welcome this announcement."
"Better late than never, and I notice that similar steps are being taken in many other Member States."
"It does look, however, as if each Member State is independently trying to re-invent the wheel."
"While we at EU level are busy integrating the financial markets under the inspiring leadership of Commissioner Bolkestein, the capitals are, in my view, overlooking the fact that a great deal of what goes on in the financial markets transcends the borders of Member States and also transcends the borders of sectors."
"We began discussing the options for increasing the effectiveness of supervision and European cooperation in Parliament before the summer."
"Hearings were held with leading figures from the supervisory world and the report you have before you is a reflection of the discussions that we have held."
"Regulators and market players themselves are pressing for further European cooperation and integration."
"That is what struck me in this debate and I believe that as politicians we are duty-bound to react adequately to the new risks that are presenting themselves."
"In my report I have opted for a pragmatic approach, as Mr Bolkestein said earlier, and proposed a great many practical measures, the details of which I shall not be going into now, but the intention is indeed little by little to work on better cooperation and integration."
"I have deliberately chosen not to give a blueprint of what an ideal situation might be, which would then have to be imposed top down, but to work mainly on the basis of current practice to lay the emphasis not on the interinstitutional debate, but in fact on the quality and the effectiveness of the implementation of supervision at the moment."
"I believe that this is an important starting point for the debate that we must continue to pursue."
"In this way we can work towards further European integration step by step."
"What has struck me is that the debate in Brussels, and I am referring in particular here to the EFC report and the discussion in the ECOFIN council, has been about the institutional setting and the mutual balance of power instead of about strengthening structural cooperation and coordination at European level."
"Power struggles are being fought over chairmanships and secretariat functions, perhaps with locations already in the back of the mind."
"I do not find this sensible."
"In my report I have tried to keep my distance from power games of this kind and to focus on the substantive arguments."
"Mr Bolkestein has already said, and for me it is beyond dispute, that we need a strong European Commission, which works from the perspective of an integrated market and fulfils the role of an independent broker capable of bringing providers and consumers of financial services together."
"For my taste, the Council is still basing this a little too much on the national level alone and I fear that this will lead to large Member States making up most of the team and in the process allowing other interests to weigh more heavily than the interest of better cooperation and more effective supervision."
"Another point of criticism is that the discussion within the Council and within the EFC has for the most part taken place behind closed doors, without any national parliamentary involvement."
"I think that it has been good that as a result of the debate in Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we have forced this situation into the open and also made it more transparent."
"Well, this discussion is by no means at an end as far as we are concerned."
"We call on the Finance Ministers to broaden the discussion."
"A number of ideas are being suggested for this, but, as I have already said, no final choices have yet been made in the resolution."
"This is precisely why this broader debate is needed."
"What I really want to emphasise and also insist on in this debate is the 'enabling clause' we have included in the report to provide a legal basis for the possibility of the performance of European supervision at European level too."
"Perhaps this can be discussed at the IGC and perhaps also by the Convention."
"There is currently no provision for this in the Treaty, either for the ECB, nor for other possible regulators that we might imagine at European level."
"We are leaving it entirely open as to how and when this issue might be raised, but we do think that it is important to make provision for it now, as a condition for such a development."
"Mr Bolkestein was evidently fairly surprised by this proposal when we discussed it in the committee."
"I hope that he has since given it some more thought and can now be rather more positive about it, because that is precisely what we have missed with the Lamfalussy procedure, namely that this has been considered in advance and that you must also make conditions for it."
"Finally, a word about this Lamfalussy procedure."
"I have to say that I myself have no objection to this extension to include banks, the insurance sector and the conglomerates and pension funds."
"This is what clearly appears in the resolution too, but I consider it highly essential for us to look at the conditions that have to be created to enable Parliament to play a full part."
"We shall, however, be taking a closer look at this in the remainder of the debate."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to say something about my own and my group's views on the Lamfalussy procedure and on the van den Burg report."
"Firstly, we are very much in favour of a swifter, more flexible and more transparent procedure."
"That is why we are also in favour of the objectives of the Lamfalussy procedure."
"However, it needs to be said here and now that we would not have a problem either with the timing or with the content of the results if the Council were able to work as rapidly and in such a Community-oriented way as the European Parliament."
"By way of example, I would like to mention the pension fund directive on company pensions."
"Parliament presented its report in nine months, whereas the Council took twenty-six."
"My second point is that all dossiers affected by the Lamfalussy procedure are covered by the codecision procedure for the European Parliament."
"It has to be said that rules concerning technical details are very often not without some political angle."
"Nevertheless, we welcome the objectives of the Lamfalussy procedure - there can be no doubt about that."
"Nor are we fundamentally opposed to extending it."
"But I hope you will understand if we say that we do not believe in giving blank cheques."
"Furthermore, I admit to having some concerns that the Lamfalussy/von Wogau procedure was only ever regarded as an interim measure, a transitional solution, and never as the end product."
"The end product, the final result, must be parity between the European Parliament and the Council."
"And we have not yet achieved that final result."
"We therefore welcome the amendments presented by Mr von Wogau to the Bourlanges report in the Committee on Institutional Affairs."
"We support the motion for a resolution adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"We expect the Commission to take this point on board in view of the statements made by President Prodi and Commissioner Bolkestein in the 'shopping list' presented to the convention."
"We also call upon the Heads of State and Government to make a declaration of intent at the summit in Copenhagen."
"I would like to propose a joint hearing of the Commission and of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with representatives of the CESR and of the market participants' committee on experience with the Lamfalussy procedure in relation to the market abuse and prospectus directives. Part of the purpose of this is to take account of this experience, which is not entirely positive, when preparing the next steps."
"We also welcome the van den Burg report, and not only because some of my own amendments were adopted! A majority of us will be voting in favour of this report."
"However, I would like to point out that we do not think that the time has yet come for determining the optimum format for pan-European financial supervision."
"We are therefore also advocating that the Ministers for Economic and Financial Affairs and the national supervisory authorities should be called upon to arrange a comprehensive dialogue with all the relevant actors on an integrated European supervisory system, taking account of the role of national supervisory systems and the responsibilities of the ECB."
"I also support the enabling clause in connection with the convention, because we do not want to tie our hands in the event of a different political outcome occurring."
"This is not about setting the EU and the Member States against each other, but about an integrated supervisory system suitable for a new internal market in financial products."
"Mr President, I would like to emphasise very strongly that the van den Burg report has come before Parliament at exactly the right moment, because this debate on supervision in Europe is one we need to have."
"Having said that, it is more important than ever to distinguish between the issue of supervision and that of regulation."
"I approve of the very open approach that Mrs van den Burg has adopted in her report."
"I also approve of the way she has accordingly examined the various supervisory models that we have within the European Union without prescribing a definitive model."
"I say that because we need to develop a common approach, we need to learn from our experience, and we need above all to endeavour to keep this debate free of any dogmatic or ideological attitude towards a single position."
"That is why I believe that this report provides us with a good basis for the dialogue with the other institutions."
"I would now like to concentrate on the problems we face in connection with extending the Lamfalussy procedure, as what we are chiefly dealing with here is regulation."
"Mr President-in-Office, you were quite right in saying how necessary financial integration is, but that financial stability is also necessary."
"This is an area in which Parliament will not let itself be trumped by the Council or the Commission, because we believe that financial market stability is a good thing for the public and that we as Members of Parliament need to champion the preservation of that stability."
"We must, however, constantly ask ourselves whether the process selected will help to contribute to that stability."
"When I consider that just nine months ago I supported - with a very heavy heart - an agreement that meant the Lamfalussy procedure was introduced for the area of investment regulation, it seems rather premature for us to be discussing the 'birth of the Lamfalussy triplets', by which I mean the extension of the Lamfalussy procedure to the three new areas of banking, insurance and financial conglomerates, let alone support it."
"The issue here is not only, as I see it, that we do not yet have any experience whatsoever in this area."
"You know as well as I do that the first Lamfalussy directive, on market abuse, is still a long way from being transposed and that the second one is still waiting for a common position."
"No, the issue here is that the Commission has very clearly conceded that we still have no idea what urgent legislative proposals we may have to deal with."
"That is why it is so important for us to obtain an assurance from the Commission and from the Council that the eleventh commandment, transparency, will continue to be respected in the event of any extension of the Lamfalussy procedure."
"I think - and I am saying this expressly on behalf of this House - that we have scored some successes here."
"Transparency is certainly a core issue for a properly functioning democracy."
"We are not, however, just dealing here with the institutionalisation of further transparency mechanisms."
"No, we are also dealing with how we can make further progress with legislation."
"I believe that we have still not achieved institutional balance in the legislative procedure, and that we need to amend Article 202."
"Mr Bolkestein has on several occasions pointed out to us that Parliament always has the option of blocking a further directive through the codecision procedure."
"But it is not a question of us blocking anything."
"This is all about constructive mutual cooperation."
"That is why, Mr President-in-Office, I am expecting the Finance Council, and also the European Council in Copenhagen, to agree upon a political declaration on the need for a treaty amendment in relation to secondary legislation, in relation to Parliament's will as regards enablement, and also in relation to the right of call back, and that they will work to achieve this, not forgetting all the legal implications which are bound to flow from this."
"There must be parity between the Council and Parliament as parties to the codecision process."
"This is a core issue for the future of this parliamentary democracy, which at the end of the day we all wish to achieve through the convention and through the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference."
"Mr President, my group is broadly supportive of Mrs van den Burg's efforts on her report."
"Therefore, if she will excuse me, I shall concentrate on the Lamfalussy procedure extension."
"This group is in favour of extending the Lamfalussy procedure to banking and insurance."
"You have only to see the detail of the decisions being taken in Basle on banks' capital adequacy to realise that it would be a nonsense to incorporate them into primary legislation."
"Our American counterparts have already allowed the introduction of all the Basle decisions by secondary legislation and to delay unnecessarily would put European banks at a competitive disadvantage."
"However, the Council of Ministers sometimes seems to have forgotten two important things."
"First, that Parliament is fully committed to the democratic oversight of committees that establish implementing legislation."
"Secondly, that the deal on applying Lamfalussy committees to the securities market was a strictly temporary measure, which is why there are four-year 'sunset clauses' agreed by the Council in both the prospectus and the market abuse directives."
"Temporary means temporary."
"If our democratic role in monitoring is to be effective, Article 202 of the Treaty must reflect codecision over implementing committees, otherwise there will be always be a bias in this House against the delegation of powers that are necessary to deal with some extremely technical matters."
"For the sake of good governance and democratic oversight, the Member States should commit themselves - whether in a Council declaration or elsewhere - to a revision of Article 202, which not only introduces equivalent powers for Parliament and for the Council but also ensures there is proper oversight by this House and by the Council."
"Then we can proceed to extend Lamfalussy, again on a temporary basis."
"This week the plenary session is largely dominated by European Union enlargement."
"The debate about enlargement and its consequences for existing and new legislation makes us aware of the differences that exist, alongside many similarities, between the Member States and the candidate countries."
"There is a major difference in the area of the social market economy and the independent supervision of its performance."
"A social market economy in good working order is one of the conditions for accession of the candidate countries to the European Union."
"There is no precise description of what a social market economy in good working order is."
"What is apparent though is that our own market economy is not yet performing to optimum effect."
"A report has after all been written under the direction of Mr Lamfalussy with recommendations for the improvement of the financial markets."
"A prime objective of the Lamfalussy procedure is improvement of the control and the supervision of the financial markets."
"I do however have serious concerns about the developments regarding independent supervision in the accession countries."
"The creation of frameworks within which the financial markets can operate is in my view a task for government."
"Given the development of the markets to a global size and a worldwide sphere of activity, it is very important that supervision and enforcement are organised effectively."
"In this way the citizen can be protected and undesirable excesses can be controlled."
"It is clear that the developments in the financial markets will have an impact on the countries that will be acceding to the European Union over the next few years."
"I should therefore like to ask Commissioner Bolkestein how he thinks independent supervision in the accession countries can be adequately achieved."
"Do you expect the candidate countries in the short term to be able to meet the guidelines that cover the area of the financial markets at the same level as the present Member States?"
"I apologise in advance for not being able to wait for the answer, but I shall read it carefully afterwards."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to express my appreciation of the work Mrs van den Burg has done on a subject - prudential supervision - that is as vast and complex as its boundaries are ill-defined, especially in relation to an emerging, if only imaginary for the time being, European supervision."
"Of course, the cases mentioned most often in the report - Enron and WorldCom, and Vivendi and others in other respects - force us to reflect on the effectiveness of the systems that protect the interests of savers and, in more general terms, market operators, not least in order to satisfy the interest of European consumers, users and investors."
"I think it timely that the report points out that there is no evidence that Europe is immune to such dramatic crises."
"It is good there has been an Enron scandal, not so much because of the new laws that have resulted and will result from it, but because the scandal has made investors and pension funds more aware of the need for supervision."
"Before we condemn the American system, we must first remember that the overall fall on the Dow Jones index this year has been 16%, while in the euro area the stock exchange indexes have recorded a fall of 34%. Savers have seen a far greater value knocked off their savings in Europe, therefore, than has happened in this annus horribilis for the United States - and in Germany there has been a fall of up to 40%."
"Just as much prudence is needed, I believe (and the report gives a very well-balanced definition in this regard) when citing new rules as a panacea for the ills or difficulties that the markets may encounter, especially if public control is mentioned."
"I shall conclude by mentioning a more specific point concerning the integration of the financial markets."
"I think keeping prudential and credit supervision at a national level, that is in the central banks, is more and more questionable, especially when - as is the case in Italy - the same institution, the central bank, not only deals with prudential supervision but also takes on antitrust functions in the credit market, thus creating a conflict of interests that does not encourage market efficiency."
"Mr President, I support the extension of the Lamfalussy procedure in principle and I hope the interinstitutional difficulties can be resolved as soon as possible, so we can move forward and modernise decision-making structures in relation to banking, insurance and financial conglomerates."
"All the institutions need to work together to make this possible and I hope in particular that the Council will be able to make a declaration signalling its willingness to review Article 202 in 2004."
"We welcome significant parts of the van den Burg report: its focus on improved enforcement, its call for supervisors to be given some discretion and to be allowed to exercise judgement rather than inflexibly and unthinkingly enforcing rules and ticking boxes."
"We also support the call for a regulatory cost-impact assessment by the Commission and by Parliament for its amendments."
"We agree that there is a need for more cooperation between national supervisors and enhanced links and dialogue with the US."
"On the issue of a single pan-European supervisor, we have some divergence of views within our group."
"We are united in our view that it would be wrong to set up a pan-European supervisor now or in the medium term."
"Some of us in the British Conservatives would rule it out in principle, others within the PPE-DE Group would like to keep the option open as a very long-term possibility."
"I oppose a pan-European supervisor because it would have too much power."
"The concentration of power in, for example, the UK's Financial Services Authority, is very daunting in itself."
"A European equivalent would be a bureaucratic behemoth, unable to keep up with the dynamism and innovation of financial markets."
"A pan-European regulator would not have the expertise to deal with transactions and markets as diverse as, for example, the London derivatives market and the many thousands of small German savings and public banks."
"An effective regulator must be close to and must understand the markets it regulates."
"A single enforcer for financial services in the EU would have an impossible job, given the divergence of rules and legal systems across the EU."
"Financial regulators play a key role in prosecution and criminal justice, and these are matters which should remain within the remit of the Member States."
"There is so much other work to be done to create a single market in financial services and to really deliver those benefits that the Commission report talked about only a few days ago."
"EU decision-makers should accept that a centralised solution is not always the best solution."
"Mr President, Commissioner, there is support for an integrated financial market in Europe, and to this end we must draft appropriate rules speedily and in line with the interests of the market and implement them in Parliament."
"This was why the Committee of Wise Men created the Lamfalussy procedure."
"The goal is to achieve faster and better legislation."
"That was the original intention, and that was why Mr Lamfalussy launched this project, which was then supplemented by the von Wogau report."
"In general terms, we endorse it."
"However, we must measure the process as a whole in terms of whether the objectives are being achieved."
"Fast and better legislation is the goal, as has already been stated."
"It is not primarily due to Parliament that the legislation did not go through as speedily as had been hoped, and the Council must certainly examine its own role in this context as well."
"Before we deal with the issue of implementing the extended CESR-Lamfalussy procedure in other sectors, such as banking, insurance and conglomerates, we must ask one critical question first: how is CESR working today?"
"Is CESR effective in the areas in which it operates?"
"A great many questions and outright criticism can still be heard from various sectors of the market."
"I think that the first issue we should raise here is that of transparency, and of whether it is sensible for CESR to begin its work already, in parallel with draft directives."
"The question is whether we are willing to accept this in this form."
"I am in two minds here: on the one hand, I am fundamentally opposed to CESR working in parallel to a draft directive."
"We have this situation at the moment with the Prospectus Directive."
"Here, CESR should wait and see what Parliament and the Council decide before it embarks on its work."
"On the other hand, I am actually quite grateful for the fact that CESR does work in parallel, because this means that we find out in time what is going on in CESR's minds and can put the brakes on during the legislative process if necessary."
"In this context, the issue of technical details undoubtedly arises as well."
"I almost have the impression that technical detail is regarded as almost anything which, from the Commission's perspective, an average MEP is unlikely to understand - which would cover quite a lot."
"However, with regard to the technical details, we should not overlook the fact - and Basle II has already been mentioned - that there is of course political potential here too: there is conflict potential which will only become apparent over the course of time."
"For this reason, it is not enough merely to review Article 202; it must be amended."
"I would have liked to hear braver words from the Presidency today."
"These brave words must be heard in Copenhagen, at the latest. We need clear words that send out a clear signal that the Council and Parliament stand side by side on an equal basis."
"There are constant calls to Parliament to the effect that the interests of the market demand fast legislation."
"There is general agreement with this position, but I urge the Council to take Parliament's arguments seriously."
"There will be discussions and serious debates, and we do not want any buck-passing on this issue."
"This is why Copenhagen will be a good opportunity to send out a clear signal on Article 202."
"The same applies - and I endorse Commissioner Bolkestein's comments on this point - to the future role of the Commission."
"The Commission must retain its central role, for it is the Commission which implements and monitors the interests of Europe as a whole."
"Finally, let me say a few words about integrated financial supervision in Europe."
"We must ensure that regional aspects are taken into account."
"For this reason, I broadly endorse my colleague Mrs Villiers' comments that we do not need an integrated financial regulator at present."
"We must, of course, also give some thought as to how large European companies will operate in this area in future."
"Here, I see positive models in the Financial Conglomerates Directive, which sets out a course which we can follow."
"Mr President, to outside observers, this afternoon's two issues could seem too esoteric and technical, but, as various speakers have pointed out, these are issues which are affecting the lives of the citizens and, at the moment, as a result of the great international scandals, they are affecting consumers."
"The Enron case in the United States has been mentioned, but, in my country, Spain, for example, we have a great financial scandal going on, the Gescartera case, which has led to the resignation of several top government figures and which could threaten others - the Spanish Parliament is investigating the situation at the moment."
"When we talk about financial services, we are talking about something which affects the lives of ordinary citizens."
"It affects their pensions and the future of their savings."
"We are currently trying to create pan-European financial services, which transcend the borders of Europe."
"We are concerned to guarantee our companies the greatest possible freedom and the greatest possible opportunity to act within Europe, but, unless we establish a pan-European system of monitoring, so that the operation of these companies is controlled, we run the risk of the kind of frauds and scandals currently taking place on an exclusively national level taking place throughout the European Union."
"I believe that a system of liberalising financial services throughout the Community is inconceivable unless it is accompanied by a system of monitoring financial activities throughout the Community."
"We all agree that this issue requires democracy."
"Democracy means 'people's government', and this is only possible by means of parliamentary representation - in Greece direct democracy was possible because all the citizens met in a public square."
"The attempt to replace democracy with a system of public consultation, without recourse to the ballot box, by means of computers or public consultations for example - as Commissioner Bolkestein said - is deceitful."
"The only consultation there is room for today is a public consultation by means of the ballot box and by means of legally elected representatives."
"At the moment, for example, there is talk of a procedure according to which the Commission's proposals could be blocked by a simple consultation with business sectors."
"I believe that nothing could be less democratic than to name the interlocutors who would represent that democracy."
"We therefore move on to the final point: the proposals of Mrs Randzio-Plath."
"Co-decision is not something arbitrary, it is a procedure that has meant the participation of Parliament and is the result of a political process."
"It is true that there is an execution phase and a delegation phase, and that it could be argued that, since the execution falls to the Governments of the Member States, Parliament should get involved in this phase, which is outside the actual activity of control."
"But, in the legislative field, if we speak for example of delegated rules, I cannot see that it is possible to follow the Lamfalussy procedure unless we establish clear participation by Parliament, by means of the so-called call-back measures."
"In other words, Parliament, as the legally elected representative of the people, has the right and the obligation to participate in the monitoring of legislative development."
"As Mrs Randzio-Plath has pointed out, we have just adopted the Lamfalussy procedure, we do not yet have any experience of how it is working and we want to continue to restrict the possible participation of Parliament without verifying whether this procedure is working effectively."
"Let us see how it is working first, let us see that democratic guarantees are really maintained and, if they are, you may rest assured, Commissioner and Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that this Parliament will be prepared to participate to the full."
"But democracy cannot consist of participation - for example - by companies, in arbitrary fora, in consultations of a particular nature."
"No committee can replace the will of the people and that will is only expressed by means of elections, Parliaments and parliamentary representation."
"This Parliament's operating system can be improved, the parliamentary structures can be changed in the new constitution, but anything other than the adoption of legislation by means of an instrument elected by the people, with a normal electoral procedure, would be deceitful and would be a way to put decisions into the hands, perhaps, of the very people who would then act as predators to the detriment of the consumers."
"I believe that we must strengthen our monitoring procedure, strengthen our mechanisms and make them as flexible as possible, and this should be done by means of parliamentary participation throughout the legislative process, from top to bottom."
"Mr President, like many of my colleagues I am pleased to note that the recommendations in the report by Baron Lamfalussy have been implemented."
"There is certainly a need to extend them to other financial sectors and to include appropriate provisions in the Treaty for this."
"But before taking this step, a proper assessment must be made of these measures in the light of experience."
"The issue of secondary legislation was also noted in the Convention Working Group on Economic Governance, of which I was a member."
"The Hänsch working group and later the plenary Convention meeting noted that this raises horizontal questions in the area of comitology, such as the role of the European Parliament, which go beyond the terms of reference of the Hänsch working group and should therefore be addressed by other groups."
"We are expecting the Convention to look at the issue in the near future."
"In the Hänsch working group, MEPs like Mrs Berès and I tried to secure an agreement from the working group that the Treaty should be amended in order to give Parliament a formal call-back right within the framework of this procedure."
"I challenge Mr Bolkestein's view that it is impossible for the Council to give us a political commitment."
"If there is enough political will in the Council, anything is possible."
"It is nonsense to say that Treaty changes can only be made in the IGC."
"That is legal mumbo jumbo."
"If there is a real political will in the Council, it can be done."
"I still feel that Mr Petersen could be more precise in his words."
"The Lamfalussy procedure should also be taken into account in the national development of the financial services sector."
"We also need more transatlantic dialogue in the financial services sector at a legislative level."
"That is very important."
"I would, in addition, like to emphasise the role of consultation."
"Consultation processes, as Mr Herzog said, must be formalised and as transparent as possible."
"I endorse our rapporteur's point about the enabling clause."
"If it were to be decided that we need a supranational financial supervision authority, that possibility needs to be provided for in the Treaty after the Convention at the next IGC."
"Mr President, I would like first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs van den Burg, for the excellent work she has done in preparing this report on the future of financial regulation in Europe, which is such a complicated and controversial subject."
"I would like to emphasise that after the global economic downturn which started through the collapse of the new technology market, what was stunningly shown in the United States was the danger of laisser faire regulation in a booming market."
"Would the financial accounting scandals have occurred had regulation been as intensive as it is now?"
"I wager it would not."
"Of course this question can be countered by asking whether it would have been possible to introduce such strict regulations in a booming market."
"A booming market has been known to act as a great catalyst to taking liberties with the law and even with honesty."
"It is perhaps one advantage of the market slump that we have at the moment that we can use this opportunity to introduce the kind of regulation that will stand us in good stead when euphoria takes over in the financial markets again, as it inevitably will."
"One can ask whether the down-turn would have been as steep had we not had wave after wave of revelations about the lack of internal controls and external oversight."
"Again, one would say no, but now is the time to strengthen the rules for when the good times return, in a reversal of the fat cows, lean cows story."
"I am not arguing in favour of heavy-handed regulation nor for regulation that goes against the spirit of the internal market or the financial services action plan."
"I am quite sure that the vast majority of Parliamentarians are in favour of creating a single market in financial services in Europe, as we have shown over the past couple of years in the various positions adopted on financial services action plan legislation."
"I do not share some of my colleagues' compunctions about a European regulator."
"I do not see that the Securities and Exchange Commission has done any harm in the United States."
"There is much evidence, including the Gyllenhammar report, supporting the benefits of a unified financial market and showing that the integration of the financial services market in Europe would bring substantial economic benefits."
"That is only to be expected."
"Anything that would prop up the investment process in our economy is bound to bring financial benefits because we are so weak in this area."
"According to the report, gains could be in the region of at least half a percentage point per annum in additional economic growth."
"One could also call upon the evidence of the results of the new survey published only last week by the Commission, which suggested that total European employment could increase by half a percentage point over the next decade as a result of financial markets integration."
"One must accept that increased integration increases the responsibilities of the European institutions to actually discover the best form of regulation, to consult as thoroughly as possible, to implement and interpret legislation as consistently as possible and, when problems arise, to be flexible."
"So far, I fear that under the new Lamfalussy procedures there is not sufficient evidence that the Commission has been operating according to these consultation principles."
"Lack of initial consultation over the draft market abuse directive and last minute changes to the draft of the investment services directive are not good signs."
"I would argue, therefore, that we must be very cautious in extending the Lamfalussy procedures to other financial services fields."
"We must have time and the proper analysis of how the process has been functioning."
"The institutional monitoring group on the Lamfalussy procedure has not yet produced their first report."
"Under these circumstances I am against any hurried extension of the Lamfalussy procedure."
"Mr President, I must say that the interesting views and observations that I have just heard have convinced me that the European Parliament and the Council have a common interest in resolving the issue of expansion of the Lamfalussy procedure."
"As far as I can see, we agree on the essence of the problem that we are attempting to solve."
"We agree that there is a need for financial stability, for effective harmonisation of the legislation in this area and for effective cooperation and convergence between the financial supervisory authorities."
"I see too that note has been taken of the Commission's report on the growth opportunities in the financial sphere through the introduction of the new structures, the inference being that we can contribute to growth and employment."
"The Council and Parliament have a common responsibility in respect of the major problems that we see in the Member States in these areas."
"I also have a couple of individual comments, particularly to Mr Herzog, who says that I said, or let it be understood, that I was in favour of unitary supervision."
"On this point, I must not have expressed myself clearly, because unitary supervision is precisely what I am not advocating."
"We are advocating national supervision, that is to say a national solution, and then we must cooperate within the EU."
"It is not a case of unitary supervision."
"To Mrs van den Burg, I can say that I understand her views regarding the content."
"Regarding the comment that the Council should look more to a market structure, I can say that we would like to get out of the dilemma that has characterised previous attempts to solve problems whilst discussing market structures, for we wish to signal that we respect Parliament and the role of Parliament."
"We particularly mention this in order to put a stop to the eternal power struggle between Parliament and the Council."
"We each have our own responsibilities to deal with, whether we are elected to the European Parliament or elected in national parliaments and are members of a government."
"I can well understand Parliament's various wishes. I would wish the same, were I a Member of the European Parliament."
"I consider them entirely legitimate."
"The problem is simply that if, like Mrs Kauppi, one says that the Ecofin Council can simply decide to amend the Treaty, that is not in fact the case."
"Moreover, it would be a poor principle if the Ecofin Council had those powers."
"Consequently, it is necessary for me to refer to the fact that it is for the Convention, and subsequently the Intergovernmental Conference, to amend the Treaty."
"What I am able to offer is the fact that we are taking these matters seriously and that we in the Ecofin Council are doing what we can but will also tell our Heads of State very clearly which attitudes prevail in the European Parliament, because the Ecofin Council does not have a vote in the Convention, but our Heads of State do, the countries do, and we should exploit this opportunity."
"This leads me on to say to Mr Blokland that the European Parliament is able to exercise influence, our wish in this connection being for the directives to be equipped with the same sunset clause as we are familiar with from the securities market."
"That means, moreover, that there must be a review in 2004 and that, if there is not then agreement on the Convention's conclusions or on the governments' conclusions at the Intergovernmental Conference, then these directives will lapse."
"Parliament is able to exercise that influence."
"I would simply call upon you to take account in your statement of what the Ecofin Council is able to do and deliver and refer to the responsibility that we have to get the capital markets to work effectively so that we each make a contribution to growth and employment in Europe."
"I would like to express my thanks for the debate. Thank you very much for your views, which I shall pass on."
"Mr President, I gather from the various interventions made this afternoon on this subject that there is general acceptance of the extension of the Lamfalussy procedure into new areas such as banking, insurance companies and conglomerates."
"There are differences of opinion about how precisely that ought to be done, but the general principle seems to be accepted, which is a good thing."
"Many Members of this House have mentioned the matter of Article 202."
"This is only natural, and in my first speech this afternoon I indicated that the Commission agrees with Parliament on this point and that the Commission has been quite clear."
"Having made these two points, perhaps I may go into further detail as to what the Members of Parliament have said."
"Firstly Mrs van den Burg said that she wants a practical approach - which is always a good thing - and I would certainly agree with her on that."
"She wants more cooperation and more supervision, but as part of a steady process and not all at once."
"Again I agree with her."
"She supported the Commission, saying that it ought to be strong, and I would not disagree with that statement."
"Indeed, a strong Commission is necessary in order to preserve the institutional balance."
"She then mentioned the intriguing subject of the enabling clause, and whether there should not be an enabling clause in the Convention or IGC."
"From the debate this afternoon I notice that there is a difference of opinion on that subject."
"Mrs Villiers is very much against."
"Mrs Kauppi is very much in favour and Mr Radwan, like Mrs Villiers, is also against, so the score is two against two - at least in this debate."
"We should follow Mrs van den Burg's careful approach because the present Treaty already contains points which may be used by the ECB to do a lot of important work in this area."
"These concern the interface between macroeconomic developments and microeconomic solutions and you will find the text in Article 105(6) of the EU Treaty."
"There is no obstacle, at least on the part of the ECB, to it doing this work."
"The whole subject will have to be thoroughly considered in the years to come and the Lamfalussy procedure is essential for that particular point."
"In parallel to that discussion, the supervisors must cooperate more actively than at present."
"As for myself, I remain somewhat sceptical about that enabling clause."
"It does not commit you to anything."
"However, let us wait and see how these things develop."
"I am very much aware of the various sensibilities of supervisors in this area, so let us remember the good old British saying: that fools rush in where angels fear to tread."
"I then come to Mr Karas, who unfortunately has had to leave."
"He calls the Lamfalussy procedure the Lamfalussy-von Wogau process."
"I shall allow him to attach the name of a member of his party to this process, although I would rather call it the Lamfalussy-Randzio-Plath process."
"However, that is a detail and I do not wish to be controversial."
"He said that it is a temporary solution. Mr Huhne also mentioned this, referring to the 'sunset clause' and so on."
"I agree. It will come under discussion again in the 2004 IGC."
"However, let us use the time between now and then to clarify our thoughts and to agree as far as possible on the best way forward."
"Mrs Randzio-Plath said that it is too early."
"That is an argument that she has used before."
"Let me repeat what I said earlier."
"It seems to me that we should start relatively soon to prepare for the decisions ahead."
"New committees and new structures will need to be set up."
"New legal acts will be required and all that takes time."
"As I have already said, it will also shape the type of directives which we aim to bring forward."
"We must also take into account the need to advance so that we have efficient decision-making structures before enlargement."
"Mrs Randzio-Plath repeated the same arguments that other Members of Parliament have used, i.e. there must be equality between the Council and Parliament and the change to Article 202."
"I agree with her."
"Mr Huhne also expressed his support for the extension of the Lamfalussy procedure."
"He mentioned its temporary nature and pointed to the 'sunset clause'."
"He thought Parliament should have the possibility of calling back implementing measures."
"That hangs together with the equality between the Council and Parliament, and I cannot but agree with him."
"Mr Blokland asked me how I could be certain that there would the same independence of supervisors in the candidate countries as we have ourselves."
"He is right to say that independent supervision in all candidate countries is of great importance."
"Furthermore, we have been examining the systems and the organisations of the candidate countries with the supervisors of all Member States over the past four years with precisely that aim in mind."
"May I also say that quite considerable progress has been made by the candidate countries."
"We must realise they have come a long way and made quite considerable progress, even though not everything is as it should be in certain areas."
"Therefore we must monitor the developments in the candidate countries because there is an essential need for an independent regulatory and supervisory agency there."
"We have organised a programme of cooperation so that we can help candidate countries improve the quality of their supervision."
"Mrs Villiers devoted much of her time to opposing the decision to steer the developments in the direction of having a single European supervisor."
"I have already spoken about that issue and, as far as the Commission is concerned, it will defer to Parliament and it can take a decision."
"The Commission itself would leave this matter somewhat in abeyance."
"Mr Radwan spoke about CESAR and asked how CESAR was working."
"To this I would like to say that CESAR is a new organisation which needs time to develop itself and to find a proper way of acting."
"As far as I know CESAR has already accomplished remarkable things in the short time it has been in existence."
"I have indeed heard some criticism and complaints about CESAR - I stress the word 'some' - which I have drawn attention to."
"The complaints basically refer to its lack of transparency and consultation."
"I have made those points and I remain convinced that CESAR will become a very useful committee which we can all make use of."
"This is also why we have the interinstitutional monitoring group."
"Mrs Randzio-Plath, myself and others have decided to establish this interinstitutional monitoring group so that complaints, such as those mentioned by Mr Radwan, can be dealt with in a proper manner."
"Mr Medina Ortega has made reference to certain scandals in the country which he knows best."
"He has said that only democratically elected representatives should have the possibility of calling back implementing measures."
"This is the same argument which has been made by others and, as I have said, I can only agree with him."
"Then I would like to congratulate Mrs Kauppi on her use of language - the expression 'mumbo jumbo' is not often used in Parliament but it is very colourful and it explains precisely what she means."
"That is always a good thing, after all, what would we do if there were no clarity in what we said?"
"She wants the call-back rights for Parliament which we discussed earlier."
"She also says that there must be a political will in Council."
"Let us not be distracted by 'mumbo jumbo' is what she has said."
"I must refer Mrs Kauppi to the President of Council, Minister Pedersen, present here tonight."
"She also says there should be a more active transatlantic dialogue and I can assure her that dialogue exists and is active."
"In particular, the Director General for Competition, Mr Alex Schaub, has just come back from Washington today where he has these discussions on Capitol Hill in Congress about the so-called Sarbanes-Oxley Act which indeed presents a lot of problems to European auditing companies and other companies quoted on US stock exchanges."
"I myself will be visiting Washington in a few weeks' time and I intend to discuss these matters with the chairman or acting chairman of the securities exchange commission."
"This would be a continuation of the discussion we had with Mr Harvey Pitt in Brussels about a month ago."
"That discussion was very fruitful."
"Unfortunately, as we all know, he has now resigned and we shall have to pick up the thread where we left it when he visited Brussels."
"However, I can assure Mrs Kauppi that this dialogue is essential because we want to achieve this great big transatlantic integrated market for financial services."
"We cannot do without it, but those relations should be on the basis of reciprocity and mutual recognition."
"I can assure all Members of Parliament that it is a top priority in my view to join with the United States in a programme of convergence."
"That is what I would like to say to Members of Parliament who have spoken tonight."
"Lastly, Mr Katiforis has enjoined the Commission to be cautious."
"I am certainly cautious in all I do."
"So I would like to reassure Mr Katiforis in this regard."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein."
"I have received one motion for a resolution, pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The next item is the report (A5-0373/2002) by Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on additives for use in animal nutrition (COM(2002) 153 - C5-0143/2002 - 2002/0073(COD))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I would like to thank the Commission for this generally very positive proposal on additives for use in animal nutrition, which I welcome in principle."
"I would also like to thank the Danish Presidency and my colleagues on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"This proposal aims to consolidate existing rules on additives in feedingstuffs and clarifies certain procedural aspects related to dossier evaluation and the types of authorisation granted to feed additives, thus making them more transparent for producers and consumers alike."
"An aspect of fundamental political significance in this proposal is the ban from 2006 on the four antibiotic growth promoters that are still authorised."
"This is not an arbitrary ban, but is based on reports by the Scientific Food Committee, and is consistent with the demands repeatedly voiced publicly by medical experts."
"As cross-resistance to drugs used in human medicine can also no longer be ruled out, there is a need for action in order to protect consumers."
"In this regard, pressure must be brought to bear by granting temporary authorisation only so that other methods, such as appropriate vaccines, are developed."
"In principle, I am in favour of the Commission's proposal."
"I too think it is inappropriate, on the antibiotic issue, to give what amounts to a blank cheque for unrestricted use of coccidiostats in the future."
"It is not plausible to ban antibiotics on health policy grounds if these health policy arguments then do not apply to the use of coccidiostats."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as the committee responsible, wants coccidiostats and histomonostats to continue to be authorised for use until 2008."
"The Commission should then submit a report, before 1 January 2008, on the use of these substances, together with a proposal on further use."
"Where, then, are the points of difference?"
"First of all, Amendment No 2 regulates imports from third countries of additives for use in animal nutrition, and states that the rules governing imports must at least be as strict, in terms of application and monitoring, as those which the same Member States apply in order to safeguard human and animal health."
"In Amendments Nos 4, 7 and 9, I speak out very clearly in favour of guidelines for the authorisation of feed additives."
"I call on the Commission, in cooperation with the European Food Safety Authority, to establish and submit guidelines for the authorisation of feed additives."
"In its vote, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development clearly endorsed the adoption of guidelines in the interests of simplifying the authorisation of additives."
"Once an additive has been authorised, it is surely sufficient for the relevant dossier to be regularly updated, rather than being subject to a full review every time."
"Parliament is calling for mixtures and premixtures containing flavouring and appetite stimulants to be exempt from the labelling requirement."
"It is stated explicitly that this will not apply to flavouring and appetite stimulants subject to a quantitative limitation when used in feed and drinking water."
"There are of course now calls in this House for the use of coccidiostats to be permitted only when prescribed by veterinary surgeons."
"I myself take the view - and I speak from experience - that we must have preventive healthcare for animals as well."
"Some form of animal protection is required, and it is obvious that an animal which is already sick needs to be treated with far higher doses, so my own practical experience makes it difficult for me to understand the reasoning behind these calls."
"As regards the ban from 2006 on the four antibiotic growth promoters, I would like to say to Commissioner Byrne that my Amendment No 31 offers a sensible compromise here."
"Finally, I would like to reiterate my sincere thanks to everyone who worked so hard on this issue."
"Mr President, I am pleased and impressed that the European Parliament has prepared its report on the Commission's proposal on additives for use in animal nutrition so swiftly."
"This underlines the importance that Parliament attaches to the sensitive issue of animal nutrition in relation to human and animal health."
"I would like in particular to thank and congratulate Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert for her hard work on this report."
"This issue is also a high priority for the Danish Presidency of the Council."
"I hope, therefore, that we can make rapid progress to show the outside world how important the EU considers human and animal health issues to be."
"This proposal represents a major streamlining of the current rules on safety evaluation and marketing authorisations for feed additives."
"This overhaul is both timely and welcome."
"The current legislation has been revised over one hundred times."
"The new rules will be much simpler and clearer."
"We will have a clear and transparent authorisation procedure."
"The European Food Safety Authority will be the first port of call and will be in charge of evaluating all feed additives."
"In future, the validity of authorisations will be limited to ten years. The new system also includes an in-built review and re-evaluation process so as to allow new scientific information to be taken into account."
"Companies will be required to demonstrate the positive effect on the animal and the absence of any risk to human or animal health or the environment when applying for authorisation or re-authorisation of a feed additive."
"Wherever required for the sake of public health, the European Food Safety Authority will propose to the Commission maximum residue limits to be laid down in legislation."
"At present, only four antibiotics are authorised for use in animal feed as growth promoters. The EU has already phased out the use in feedingstuffs of all antibiotics that are used in both human and veterinary medicine, in order to avoid cross-resistance."
"The four antibiotics in question are not used for any human antibiotic drugs."
"The Commission announced its intention to phase out these remaining antibiotics in feedingstuffs in the White Paper on Food Safety."
"This reflected scientific advice that the use of antibiotics as growth promoters is undesirable for human and animal health, owing to concerns about increased resistance of diseases to treatment with antibiotics."
"The Scientific Steering Committee has also recommended the progressive replacement of the remaining four antibiotics by non-antimicrobial alternative products."
"The Commission proposes to withdraw the authorisations for these four antibiotics on 1 January 2006."
"With regard to coccidiostats - substances used to prevent coccidia infections - the proposal contains stricter rules for their authorisation and placing on the market."
"The reason for this is that hygiene precautions and improved husbandry practices are not sufficient to keep poultry free from such diseases."
"However, in order to ensure the safety of these substances, I propose that current authorisations be reviewed within four years of the entry into force of the regulation."
"These are some of the major issues that Parliament has considered."
"I hope and expect that we will be able to reach constructive solutions."
"I will address the various amendments proposed by Parliament at the end of this debate."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert for her very practical report."
"We need to be sure of how we are going to deal with these additives, especially in poultry."
"You do not find out that a chicken contains coccidiostats until it is dead and by then it is too late."
"The welfare problems of actually handling chicken also have to be considered."
"We need to be able to sort out this problem and look at it very practically."
"We are very concerned in Europe that consumers should be protected, and rightly so, but what is the Commission going to do to protect European consumers from imports of poultry that have probably been fed growth promoters?"
"Millions of chickens are imported from China and Thailand."
"The problem is that the poultry meat cannot be tested for growth promoters or, if it is, some time may have elapsed and the meat can no longer be tested for it."
"It will be impossible to determine whether growth promoters have been fed to the chickens, and so chicken producers in Europe will be at a complete economic disadvantage."
"This will not protect consumers in Europe, because the meat will still be imported."
"We will find that European consumers are consuming meat from poultry produced in China and Thailand containing substances banned in Europe."
"I would like to ask Commissioner Byrne how he is going to stop this problem arising."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of animal nutrition has become something of a regular feature on this House's agenda."
"Over recent years, we have played a very successful part in shaping EU legislation on animal feedingstuffs."
"Let me remind you of some examples: the open declaration of feed ingredients, the establishment of a positive list, and the new regulations on the production and use of meal made from meat."
"Today, we are embarking on a new round which focusses on feed additives."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists supports much of what the rapporteur has just mentioned, such as the ban on antibiotics, etc. She has done sterling work, and has been receptive to many of our proposals."
"I would like to express my sincere thanks to her for that."
"Overall, then, we are pleased with the report which was voted on in committee."
"There are two point which should be corrected, however, and which I would like to explain as follows."
"Coccidiostats and histomonostats should not be authorised for use as feed additives; instead, they should be authorised, in the long term, as veterinary medicinal drugs."
"We must be consistent here."
"If we impose a general ban on antibiotics in animal nutrition, we cannot immediately make an exception for one product category."
"This cannot be justified to consumers."
"As regards coccidiostats, these must be subject to controlled use as prescribed by a veterinary surgeon who is familiar with the situation in the farm concerned and can respond appropriately."
"Otherwise, the general preventive use of these products, which are also antibiotics, could conceal possible hygiene problems on the farms."
"I strenuously refute any accusations that I am trying to generate a new source of income for veterinary surgeons."
"We have tabled amendments on this issue, and I would ask you to support them."
"My second point relates to the duration of authorisation."
"We support authorisation for an unlimited period, provided that this does not impact on product safety."
"A re-evaluation of the additives should therefore be carried out every ten years, taking account of new scientific information and research data."
"This ensures reliability for the applicant, on the one hand, and animal and consumer safety, on the other."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to thank the rapporteur sincerely for a very balanced report."
"The major issue in this report is a ban on the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in agricultural production."
"I ardently support the ban."
"In certain EU countries this has already been done voluntarily."
"The long-term use of antibiotics has serious adverse effects when microbes develop into mutations that are disease-resistant."
"The rapporteur has drawn up a very balanced report, as I have already said."
"There are, however, different views in our group also."
"What should our attitude be towards coccidiostats as a remedy against parasites for use with poultry?"
"It would be wrong if their use were not regulated at all and they remained a 'grey area'."
"The aim must be to abandon the use of coccidiostats, but that cannot be done at once as they cannot yet be replaced by vaccination."
"A certain period of transition is therefore required."
"I enthusiastically support the rapporteur's proposal."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert for her excellent work in this area."
"This proposal is one of the measures provided for in the Commission's White Paper on Food Safety."
"I welcome it and largely agree with the assessment and authorisation procedures it proposes."
"The current directive has been amended five times since 1970 and has never been consolidated."
"It is a complex and very un-user-friendly piece of legislation regulation at the moment."
"In the current climate, it is right that we should do what we are proposing now."
"We are amending or reviewing this directive in parallel with the veterinary medicines directive and they are related."
"However, I would caution against moving too quickly from a food additive definition to a veterinary medicine definition until alternatives have been put in place and we are ready to cope with them."
"I, like others, have concerns about proper controls on third-country imports."
"There is one way to ensure peace of mind, not only for our farmers and poultry producers but also for consumers, and that is to increase the resources of the Food and Veterinary Office so that it can keep the situation under surveillance."
"To go to Taiwan, Hong Kong or South America once every five years is not sufficient and nobody is fooled by this any longer."
"This issue has come up under the Temporary Committee on Foot-and-Mouth Disease review."
"It is a major issue, along with exotic diseases and imports of diseases and problems."
"If we want to ensure that the regulations are there to create a level playing field within the EU, we have to see to it that our inspectors have sufficient resources to be able to meet our expectations."
"I would like the Commissioner to address that particular point."
"There is much I welcome in this report and I would like to thank the rapporteur and the Commissioner again."
"Let us hasten slowly and be sure we have replacements, rather than moving at a pace which will drive people into veterinary medicines, away from their current practices."
"Mr President, I should also like to first of all extend my compliments to Mrs Keppelhoff."
"I always feel that reports of this kind are safe in her hands."
"I can broadly support the Commission's proposal."
"From time to time there has to be a review of all the additives in animal feed."
"I think that this is entirely in keeping with the White Paper on Food Safety."
"I also agree with the ban on antibiotics in general in the year 2005."
"The ban on their prophylactic use can be supported."
"I have rather more problems with coccidiostatics, because, if we were to ban them too, what then is the alternative?"
"I am told that if you were to do that, the next treatment of animals with antibiotics would have far more damaging consequences in general than if we were to leave things as they are."
"I can consent to this being evaluated as well and that we look at what must happen on the basis of the outcome."
"I would like to reiterate what Mr Peres had to say: we are imposing very strict demands on European farmers."
"How can we ensure that the same demands are imposed on farmers elsewhere in the world who want to sell to us, in order to prevent unfair competition?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the Commission for presenting this proposal on additives for use in animal nutrition to us, and I would also like to express my warmest thanks, and those of my colleagues, to our rapporteur for her outstanding report."
"In general terms, let me say that the debate about guidelines for a re-evaluation of additives should be viewed positively."
"In particular, additives which are authorised for an unlimited period and which the report describes as harmless would no longer be available for use in animal production if a complex and cost-intensive authorisation procedure were introduced."
"We have already seen this happen with a wide range of drugs after re-authorisation was required."
"Re-evaluation, rather than re-authorisation, may therefore prevent a thinning-out of the product range."
"The key issue in all aspects of food safety legislation, however, is the principle of traceability and transparency, as well as risk assessment."
"There must also be genuine openness for us as consumers, and also for producers."
"If an additive proves to constitute a risk, its use must continue to be ruled out."
"Let me stress that I am in favour of a central agency."
"In my view, the European Food Safety Authority would be the most suitable body to carry out this evaluation of additives."
"I also welcome a simplified authorisation procedure for additives which are already permitted in foods."
"Let me touch on one further point, namely imports from third countries."
"The same stringent rules must apply to imports of meat and animal products from third countries as those which apply in the European Community."
"For us farmers, this is vitally important."
"I urge the Commission to submit a report to us on the use of antibiotic growth promoters by the end of 2007."
"Mr President, I certainly have no intention of keeping you here until midnight."
"Allow me to explain my position on the major points of this proposal and in particular the differences which in some cases still remain between our institutions."
"Concerning the date for the phasing out of antibiotics, I am happy to note that the Commission's approach has your broad support."
"But there are some slight differences concerning the date of withdrawal of authorisations."
"The scientific advice on which this risk management measure is taken mentions the need for a transitional period to allow for animal rearing practices to adapt and also for the development of alternative antibiotics."
"For these practical reasons, I cannot accept the amendment which envisages the phasing out of antibiotics from 1 January 2005, despite my recognition of Parliament's desire to get rid of antibiotics in animal nutrition as soon as possible."
"I agree with that sentiment but would add that this should be in accordance with scientific opinion and should take account of possible effects on animal health and welfare."
"Concerning the external dimension of the phasing out process, let me clarify my position."
"This has been raised by a number of people, including Mr Parish and Mrs Doyle."
"The prohibition of antibiotics will also apply to feed imports."
"With respect to the imports of food of animal origin, the residues testing system currently in place will be used to check for the use of banned substances."
"This testing system protects human health, since it is designed to reveal residues of medicines, additives and substances in food at levels that present an unacceptable risk to the consumer."
"It is not sufficient to verify whether forbidden substances were used in the feeding of animals in third countries, as the residues of such substances may not be present at the time of importation."
"I welcome any suggestion that may be made to increase the resources of the FVO and particularly welcome that observation from a member of the budgetary authority."
"I believe that the control of imported products and the condition of equivalency between EU rules and third country rules on the rearing of animals should be considered under horizontal legislation."
"The Commission will propose a regulation on feed and food controls that will impose rules on this issue."
"That proposal will take account of your concerns."
"The draft legislation we are discussing today aims only - and I stress only - to lay down rules for the authorisation of safe additives."
"On the time limit of the authorisations, I repeat what I said in my introductory statement: I cannot accept anything other than time-limited authorisations for all feed additives."
"As regards the status of coccidiostats, I am aware that some take the view that coccidiostats should only be authorised as veterinary medicinal drugs and not as feed additives."
"I refer to the point made by Mr Kindermann in this regard."
"My position is that the rules imposed by this proposal will ensure that coccidiostats are used in a safe manner, respecting human and animal health."
"Precipitate action, not allowing enough time for the authorisation of the same kind of substances as veterinary drugs, or the setting of a cut-off date without prior assessment, would have disastrous consequences for animal production, animal health and animal welfare. I am pleased that a number of you agreed with that proposal."
"I am willing for a report to be drawn up on this matter, but I cannot agree to a cut-off date for the authorisations."
"Concerning the introduction of flexibility in the authorisation procedure, some amendments improve the Commission's proposal as they take account of the needs of minor species and non-food producing animals."
"The setting of specific conditions for data protection when applying for authorisations for minor species is another welcome amendment."
"The Commission can accept these amendments."
"However, it is necessary to recognise the impossibility of making special rules for all types of additives and for all animal categories."
"In conclusion, I would like again to thank the rapporteur and Members of Parliament for broadly supporting the policy initiated by the Commission which protects public health while taking proper account of animal health, animal welfare and agricultural production needs."
"Parliament's Secretariat is being provided with a full list of the Commission's position on each of the amendments."
"I trust that this will be included in the record for this sitting"
"I invite the rapporteur to speak again briefly."
"Mr President, the Commissioner must listen to me for a moment, otherwise there is no point in my speaking!"
"Then it might be simpler for you to address your comments to him directly, right now!"
"Commissioner, I have a further question."
"I believe that your response to the problem of third-country imports was simply that you are introducing more stringent controls on imports of feedingstuffs."
"However, Mrs Doyle and, indeed, Mr Parish were referring to the end product."
"After all, throughout Europe, we have ready-made foods from these countries in our freezers."
"This is why we are asking to what extent we have to impose controls, reject the products, or even tolerate distortions of competition with the European Community."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0365/2002) by Mr Nisticò, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the Directive 2001/83/EC as regards traditional herbal medicinal products (COM(2002) 1 - C5-0026/2002 - 2002/0008(COD))."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Nisticò, as well as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, for the work and effort they have put into this report."
"Mr Nisticò is a well-known expert in the field, but it has been quite a challenge for me and my services."
"Let me start with the objectives."
"What are the main objectives of this proposal?"
"There are three."
"First and foremost, to guarantee a high level of health protection for European patients."
"They will have access to the medicines of their choice, as long as all necessary safeguards are met."
"Secondly, to promote the Single Market for herbal medicines."
"Laying down harmonised rules and procedures will facilitate the cross-border trade in herbal medicines, which currently is very limited."
"Thirdly, to create a clear and favourable environment for the mainly small and medium-sized companies working in this sector."
"As far as specific proposals are concerned, I will concentrate on three key issues."
"First, the scope of the new simplified procedure."
"The use of herbal medicines is a long-standing tradition in Europe."
"Back in the Middle Ages they were already well known and widely used."
"For new medicines, providing fresh scientific data is indispensable if patients are to be treated with safe medicines."
"But if we already know enough about a medicine, new pre-clinical and clinical tests impose an unnecessary burden and unnecessary testing on humans and animals."
"To protect the patient's health, the information on the product's traditional use must be reliable enough to enable us to conclude that the product is safe."
"Such information exists for many traditional herbal medicines."
"For that reason, the new procedure should initially be limited to herbal medicines."
"Secondly, the minimum period of use."
"To ensure that the information is soundly based, we consider that 30 years should enable us to decide whether the product can be considered safe and effective."
"The assessment has to be for use in the EU."
"I stress this because the effects of a medicine depend on the setting in which the product is used as well as on the product itself."
"As a rule, therefore, the product should have been used for 30 years within the EU."
"At the same time, we recognise that there are important medicinal traditions outside the EU. For that reason, we propose that up to 15 years of the use can be outside the Community."
"Finally, the new Scientific Committee."
"Herbal medicines are different from other categories of pharmaceuticals in various respects."
"For some years now, an informal working group has been working on herbal medicines at the European Medicines Evaluation Agency."
"Our proposal offers an opportunity to establish an explicit legal basis for this working group and to give it a clear mandate for herbal medicinal products."
"This will also allow us to rely on specific national expertise to ensure quality, safety and efficacy of herbal medicines on a European level."
"At the same time it helps to improve the free circulation of these medicines."
"I am looking forward to the debate in the House today and call on the European Parliament to support this initiative."
"Mr President, Mr Liikanen, we are delighted that, at last, after so many years, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has adopted the proposal for a Commission directive on traditional herbal medicinal products, which I am pleased to see takes a responsible, scientific approach."
"First of all, I must thank the shadow rapporteurs of all the groups, particularly Mrs Roth-Behrendt for her competent amendments, as well as my other colleagues, Mr Bowis, Mrs Doyle, Mr Schnellhardt, Mrs Müller, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and Mr Whitehead, for their constructive help in improving the directive."
"Thanks to the directive we are examining, it will, at last, be possible to register traditional medicinal herbs in the individual European Union Member States through a simplified procedure, provided that - as the Commissioner stated - they meet certain effectiveness and safety requirements."
"The directive both recognises the full worth of medicinal products of plant origin and, at last, puts some order into a highly confused and controversial field."
"For instance, the scope of the directive is specified and the use of traditional herbs in other areas, such as foods, food supplements and cosmetics is excluded."
"In addition, for the sake of safeguarding consumer health, certain features of quality and good manufacturing practice are specified that must be complied with by both medicinal herbs produced in European Union Member States and those imported from third countries."
"Parliament has decided to recognise that medicinal herbs are still an inexhaustible source of active ingredients for therapeutic use."
"Nonetheless, while the therapeutic value of drugs of plant origin must be recognised, it must not be forgotten that improper use can give rise to a whole range of undesirable and seriously toxic side effects, which, I am afraid, may even be lethal."
"In this respect, Commissioner, the US Food and Drug Administration has so far recorded about 2 900 cases of toxic effects, including 104 deaths, principally due to the misuse of ephedrine, a drug that releases catecholamines, causes tachyarrhythmias and can lead to heart failure."
"The Food and Drug Administration has also stressed the lack of quality control for such herbs that come onto the market from distant countries like China and India: most of them are, I regret to say, adulterated with a number of contaminants."
"This is why Parliament and the Commission have attempted to ensure that the directive will be directed mainly at consumer health protection, both by requiring high quality and safety standards and by making it compulsory for labels and information leaflets to provide citizens with simple, clear information on the product's potential toxicity and possible interactions with other drugs and foodstuffs."
"We draw the Commissioner's attention to the fact that, by traditional medicinal herbs we mean those that have been used for at least 30 years, at least ten years of which within the Community and 20 outside, as suggested by Parliament."
"As a specialist in the area - I am a pharmacologist - I believe that ten years' use in Community Member States added to 20 years' use outside the Community is sufficient to assess any potential toxic effects."
"I am therefore in favour of reducing the 15 years laid down in the initial Commission proposal, but I do not agree with Chris Davies's amendment, which does not provide for at least ten years' use in the European Union, not least in that, given the genetic make-up of different populations, without extensive use in the Member States severe toxic effects might still emerge."
"Another positive aspect is the creation of a Committee for Herbal Medicinal Products at last."
"As you will have noticed, Commissioner, Parliament is concerned that this committee should be independent and given the same powers as the Committee on Proprietary Medicinal Products."
"I hope Parliament's request will be accepted so that the EMEA can, as always, carry out its work calmly and efficiently."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you are quite right."
"We have very considerable experience of the use of traditional herbal medicinal products."
"In the European Union, consumers attach ever greater importance to the use of them."
"This is why, in my view, it is time to establish a harmonised legal framework for traditional herbal medicinal products."
"For far too long, trade in these traditional products within the Community has been hampered by differences in the national provisions."
"I think that in its current form, the directive will correct this imbalance, thanks not least to the excellent work carried out by the rapporteur, Mr Nisticò."
"Let me touch upon two points which are, in my view, especially important."
"Firstly, the establishment of a new committee on herbal medicinal products within the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products: I believe this is a necessary step, and I welcome the fact that the Commission has opted in favour of this approach."
"One of the committee's most important tasks will be to set up a list of herbal substances."
"However, I also think that the classification into various groups, as called for by the committee, is especially important."
"I very much hope that we can achieve this further classification."
"The phytopharmaceuticals with what is termed 'well-established medicinal use' should be included in the group of rational phytopharmaceuticals."
"Let me briefly explain the significance of this distinction: in the case of phytopharmaceuticals with well-established use, monographs containing generally available data can be presented as evidence for an application."
"No extract-specific data are required in this type of evidence."
"A different situation applies to rational phytopharmaceuticals."
"In this case, evidence is provided through the presentation of specific extract-related data which describe the precise effect of the individual extract."
"In order to avoid distortions of competition - and I think this is especially important - the manufacturer, who has invested substantial sums in researching the effects of rational phytopharmaceuticals, should be permitted to draw attention to his special efforts as part of the registration process, thus benefiting consumers through the provision of better product information."
"Mr President, I welcome this directive and Mr Nisticò's elegant improvement of its direction."
"We have had our arguments - indeed, we have had some today - but not about this."
"Herbal remedies are bought and trusted by millions and by many of us here."
"Their use goes back over millennia."
"This directive allows the basic registration of traditional remedies."
"It should be generous in its interpretation of how and where this traditional use established the safety requirements that are necessary."
"Equally, the use of these products in combination with others, including drugs, requires scrupulous attention to the possible side-effects where they may occur."
"This basic safety requirement is a modest proposal indeed."
"Professional herbal practice associations and consumer groups support it across Europe."
"All it requires is that we know about quality and content."
"The better the product, the more the maker should welcome this directive."
"What is in it?"
"What will it do for me?"
"These are questions asked by consumers, which you would indeed ask of anything you took - even a wine gum."
"The fact is that we are here now facing a very simple process and yet there are petitions, paranoid talk of plots and industrial lobbies mimicking consumer concerns."
"What do they fear?"
"The European Medical Control Agency has estimated that in the UK, for example, out of 207 notified substances, all but 2 or 3 would sail through the process of registration without the expensive proof required for chemicals."
"I would ask this industrial lobby, which has embarrassed many herbalists, are your own products so safe and legal? Or could they too be adulterated, irradiated or substituted?"
"How many tests have been conducted on side-effects?"
"How many off-the-shelf shops offer expert advice?"
"When the Consumers' Association in Britain tested this out on a random sample of 30, only 5 were able to offer knowledge in terms of the recommendations they made."
"This is an opportunity to blend tradition and the modern rediscovery of ancient skills."
"It gives the consumer a wider choice and offers expansion for the quality producer."
"Let us welcome it."
"Mr President, any medicine can be dangerous."
"If we need any reminder of that, we need only look at the thousands who die each year from taking authorised prescription medicines."
"By comparison, the risks posed by traditional herbal remedies are minimal."
"So let us keep a sense of proportion and make sure we do not throw the baby out with the bath water."
"Nobody should object to rules intended to safeguard health and to ensure that the consumer can make informed decisions."
"However, excessively restrictive application of regulations may threaten the future of some producers and specialist suppliers such as health food shops, possibly encouraging consumers to buy from unregulated internet suppliers."
"I therefore ask the Commission to be careful in its application of these regulations and to take account of these genuine concerns."
"In particular, I ask the House that if a herbal medicine has been used anywhere in the world for more than 30 years and there was clear evidence that its normal use is safe, then we should not deny it to the people we represent."
"We must not be so arrogant as to imply that Europe has nothing to learn from others."
"Mr President, since the beginning of time people have relied on natural vegetable and mineral substances to cure diseases and to relieve pain."
"Even in present-day medicine, despite the advent of modern pharmacology, herbal remedies still play an important role."
"It is therefore logical for European quality standards to be laid down for herbal remedies just as they are for synthetic medicines and for steps to be taken to ensure that citizens are informed in a comprehensible manner about the effect and possible side-effects of these remedies."
"We are therefore satisfied with the proposal to set up a separate committee for herbal remedies within the EMEA and to make the provisions relating to the monitoring of medicines applicable to herbal remedies as well."
"For many herbal remedies that have long been in use new tests are unnecessary however."
"The associated high costs are difficult to justify, especially if many years' use has never given rise to any problems."
"I consider it right, though, that consumers are given honest information."
"Where the effectiveness of a remedy has not been proven, it is useful to mention this in the instructions."
"This encourages the consumer to make a well-informed choice of the kind which the European Parliament also wants other legislation to promote."
"Finally, Mr President, I want to stress that scope must be allowed for the different needs of different Member States."
"For this reason I would like to propose voting for the proposal in order that if a Member State takes a decision about an application for registration of a herbal remedy it recognises the registrations or licences granted by other Member States."
"With this provision it will be easier for small businesses in particular to market regional products throughout Europe, so that all European citizens can benefit from regional products that have been proven to have therapeutic value."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, herbal medicinal products have been used throughout the world for many centuries."
"In Europe, too, consumers' interest has extended far beyond the household remedies which are customarily used in individual regions."
"Many people swear by these natural products, whether they are Chinese ginseng root or Indian tea tree oil."
"In the European Union, however, herbal medicinal products are not yet regulated on a uniform basis."
"In some Member States, they have to be authorised, whereas in others, facilitated evidence of efficacy is sufficient."
"Mr Nisticò has presented a very good report which creates broadly uniform provisions governing the manufacture, marketing and labelling of herbal medicinal products and sets high quality and safety standards."
"In this context, the following points are especially important."
"First of all, there is the issue of quality and safety."
"The manufacturers of herbal medicinal products must provide evidence of their safety in the same way as is required for chemical medicinal products."
"In the simplified authorisation procedure, the efficacy and harmlessness of a product are proven through its long, that is, traditional, use."
"We also need a new committee on herbal medicinal products within the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products."
"This committee should take over responsibility for the full range of tasks relating to herbal medicinal products."
"It will establish herbal monographs relevant for the precise but speedy evaluation of the applications for authorisation."
"The proposal before us not only enables us to achieve broadly uniform authorisation criteria in Europe; it also allows us to facilitate the marketing of herbal medicinal products in all Member States while maintaining subsidiarity."
"European consumers can continue to choose from a broad range of products which have been submitted by the manufacturer in accordance with the legal provisions and have been carefully scrutinised and authorised by the authorities."
"This guarantees product quality and protects human health to the greatest possible extent."
"Mr President, the more we look into the subject of traditional herbal medicines the more I am convinced that there is urgent need for action."
"Like millions of other EU citizens, I am a user of herbal medicinal products."
"I want a guarantee that when I go into my local health food shop the echinacea or ginseng I buy is of a high quality and standard."
"Sadly, in the UK at the moment you cannot guarantee that this will be the case."
"In front of me I have four certificates of analysis and four different types of echinacea products."
"The first has on its label echinacea root."
"However, the others simply are not good enough."
"One failed to comply because of excessive amounts of acid insoluble ash in the product."
"Another was apparently free of echinacea root altogether, and the last had not been solely manufactured from echinacea root powder as claimed on the label."
"This means that the next time I go and buy my echinacea, I have a 25% chance of actually purchasing what I want."
"This lottery has to end."
"These inferior products on the market are cheating consumers and bringing herbal medicines into disrepute."
"However, we also require a flexible approach, especially on herbal nutrient combinations, traditional herbal medicines from outside the EU and non-herbal traditional medicines."
"Herbal nutrient combinations for products are not classified as medicines."
"Currently they may normally be legally sold as foods and that position would not change."
"Where these combination products are classified as medicines, currently they are not covered by the present UK regime for unlicensed herbal medicines and therefore require a marketing authorisation."
"The EU proposal would offer greater flexibility than what is offered at the moment in the UK because the directive would permit the inclusion of nutrients which were non-active."
"Traditional medicines from outside the EU, such as Chinese medicines, will be able to satisfy the 50 year requirement."
"However, I agree with those in the herbal sector who would like greater flexibility in taking account of evidence from outside the EU."
"The key point is that the quality and relevance of evidence of traditional use is more important than geographical origin."
"This directive deserves to be considered in the light of all the facts, in the interest of public health, consumer confidence and expanded choice on the market."
"Mr President, it seems that a guiding ethos of this establishment is the precautionary principle, which aims to keep risks as low as reasonably practical."
"However, British courts suggest that this requires weighing costs against the measures necessary to eliminate the risk."
"If we are to believe the rapporteur, the risks from uncontrolled use of herbal medicines are considerable."
"But I have looked at just one of his claims: that is that in the US products based on ephedrine have accounted for more than 1 200 cases of toxic effects, including 70 deaths."
"However, the dietary supplement industry estimates that as many as two billion doses of this product are consumed each year in the United States."
"As to Mr Nisticò's claims, the US General Accounting Office has examined the FDA data which he uses."
"To reach its conclusions the FDA used a combination of scientific evidence on the effects of ephedrine and a set of adverse event reports (AERs)."
"According to the GAO the FDA relied upon 'poorly-documented AERs and weak information'."
"Furthermore, it did not perform a causal analysis to determine whether ephedrine products caused or contributed to the adverse effects."
"It did not document which AERs were serious and did not establish criteria to determine which events were serious."
"It did not perform any reliable assessment of its analysis."
"These are just brief extracts from an 83-page report."
"I have similar reports on other risks that Mr Nisticò cites."
"The risks have been seriously overstated on the basis of scandalously poor evidence."
"There is hardly a measurable risk from the use of herbal medicines and it is, in any event, far less than that arising from conventional medicines."
"Given the minimal risk, the cost of this measure clearly outweighs the benefit."
"There is no justification for it."
"I declare an interest. I use herbal medicines every day of the year."
"Mr President, although modern pharmacology and synthetic medicines enjoy uncontested status, herbal medicines are still important for human health and welfare."
"On the other hand, it must not be imagined that natural substances cannot be a great danger to health when they are abused or prepared without care."
"Finding just the right sort of balance is a challenge for us, and I am convinced that my colleague Mr Nisticò, to his credit, has done so in his report."
"Stringent quality and safety standards should be set for herbal medicinal products and clear labelling and instructions are required."
"The instructions must contain information on the potential toxicity of the substances and their interaction with food, drink or other medicinal products."
"In addition, for herbal medicines to be authorised for sale on the market the same practices have to apply, where possible, as with synthetic medicines."
"This is not meant as an attack on traditional medical remedies: on the contrary, the goal is to ensure there is a safe framework within which the herbal medicine industry can thrive in the Europe-wide market."
"Entrepreneurs in the sector will profit as the market grows and reputations are protected, and consumers will gain in terms of safety and price."
"The rapporteur raises some problems that have been encountered with irresponsible manufacturers, especially in third countries."
"Toxic vegetable substances or poisons such as arsenic and mercury, or other medicinal substances such as hormones, have been found in medicinal products."
"When there is such indifference combined with good faith on the part of the consumer, human lives are in danger."
"People associate herbal medicines with something natural, good and safe, and they do not imagine that if the dose is wrong or if there is any other form of abuse this can cause serious harm and even death, or that there may be serious problems of quality with the product."
"The European Parliament is now promoting a worthy human tradition: herbal remedies."
"Mr Nisticò's report lays down for this safe and clear limits within which the industry can flourish and succeed."
"Mr President, allow me to comment briefly on some of the speeches and amendments."
"A full listing of the Commission's position on each of the amendments is provided in writing to Parliament."
"Firstly, on the extension of the scope of the simplified procedure. Let me underline that I am grateful for your support to limit, in principle, the new simplified procedure to traditional herbal medicines."
"It is crucial that we gain sound experience with this new procedure before we can plan any possible extension."
"At the same time, I understand the request from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy to slightly extend the scope of the procedure to those herbal medicines, which contain additional non-herbal ingredients. In principle, the Commission could support such additives as vitamins and minerals."
"However, we have to be prudent and exclude certain substances such as biological ingredients, which involve particular risks. For such substances we must insist on getting the standard scientific data."
"Many speakers have mentioned the minimum time of use."
"As a general rule, 30 years of traditional use in total and 15 years within the Community are the minimum to ensure safety and efficacy of the products."
"However, there will be exceptions."
"It may be that a product has been used outside the EU for thousands of years, but has been available within the Community for only 10 years or less."
"The Committee on the Environment proposed to shorten the minimum usage time within the Community from 15 to 10 years."
"The Commission is ready to lay down specific rules for such exceptions."
"From a European perspective, however, it is preferable to provide a European solution."
"Where a product does not fulfil the general criteria of 30 and 15 years, we could empower the new committee to look into this product and to assess if the available information is sufficient."
"This way of establishing flexibility would have the advantage of meeting the double objectives to ensure the protection of public health while at the same time facilitating the free movement of these medicines within the EU."
"The Commission's proposal already gives the new committee considerable powers."
"The Committee on the Environment wants to go even further and replace the committee which generally deals with medicines for human use (CPMP) with the new 'herbal committee'."
"In principle, the Commission could support part of the proposed extension."
"We agree that the 'herbal committee' should deal with deciding mutually recognised procedures where divergent national decisions on herbal medicines are involved."
"Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0356/2002) by Mrs van den Burg, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on working conditions for temporary workers (COM(2002) 149 - C5-0140/2002 - 2002/0072(COD))."
"Mr President, I should like to thank and make a point of congratulating Mrs van den Burg on her excellent report and on her positive input to the Commission proposal on working conditions for temporary agency workers."
"We all know that this was not an easy procedure; there were serious political and technical difficulties and I really must thank her, because I think that, with the work that has been done, Parliament will help push through this important directive."
"Since the beginning of the 1980s, temporary agency work has become an important cog in the wheel of the European job market as companies strive for more and more flexible employment management."
"Over recent years, this type of work has increased in leaps and bounds."
"Truly massive employment agencies have developed in numerous countries, sometimes with hundreds or thousands of workers, and we see this sort of intervention on the job market as a positive development; it often creates jobs and it is always an extremely important tool for people looking for their first job."
"The growth in temporary agency work is firmly on the agenda of social and economic reform which was strengthened at the Barcelona Summit."
"In many countries, however, temporary employment is looked down on, mainly when flexibility and quality of work are not pulling in the same direction."
"This is the shortcoming on certain job markets which this directive is designed to rectify or prevent in future."
"The aim is to create a broad, flexible framework based on fundamental workers' rights; these rights must be protected in all cases so that we can protect the quality of work."
"The Commission tabled this proposal when talks between the social partners broke down in May 2001."
"I think it is extremely important that the Council and Parliament manage to approve this directive, which sends out a very important political message that the European institutions are prepared to shoulder their responsibilities and take action even where the social partners are unable to agree."
"Mr President, I did indeed intend starting with the difficult legacy of this dossier, which goes back to the early nineties when a number of proposals for directives on atypical work were submitted."
"You have already referred to the agreements of social partners and also to the failure of their negotiations in this regard."
"Considerable effort has been expended on tabling this proposal in the Commission."
"It has taken nearly a year."
"Indeed, that whole legacy shows that it was extremely difficult to draft the directive and that it was also highly controversial."
"People have therefore often asked me what on earth possessed me to think that I would get it through just like that."
"Why have I sunk my teeth into this as I have?"
"In the first place, because I have 25 years of experience of atypical working relationships of this kind and of providing protection for people in the weakest positions."
"Secondly, because I am utterly convinced of the usefulness and the need for flexibilisation of the European labour market and I see temporary work as a worthwhile tool, provided that the protection of temporary workers is also regulated in a sensible way."
"Thirdly, because I believe in the opportunities that temporary work offers workers with specific wishes or problems."
"People who need a leg-up into the labour market or people who are seeking tailor-made work patterns that are not provided by the ordinary employers in the ordinary work patterns."
"Fourthly, because I believe in the entrepreneurship of the temporary sector and the art of combining the wishes of workers and employers with regard to flexibility in a positive way."
"However, I would also say, the art of entrepreneurship is also for example not transferring the risk of underutilisation to the workers, but guaranteeing to workers that as an employer you will ensure that they have work and that they can be deployed at the times that they themselves would want."
"Fifthly, because I believe in the regulating and salutary effect of collective employment conditions, which have an important part to play in this proposal too."
"It is a question not only of collective bargaining agreements in the sectors in which that work is used, but also collective bargaining agreements in the temporary employment industry, the temporary sector itself."
"Finally, because I totally disagree with the trend to declare European regulation in the social sphere out of order."
"I actually think that it is very important, especially in view of enlargement and the developments that are under way, to lay this basis in European legislation and to ensure that from here we also go further in Europe."
"All this I can see in the proposed directive."
"It includes flexibility and security, promotion and patronage, acceptance and protection, liberalisation and regulation."
"I think that there is a good balance in the Commission's proposal, but that this balance has been enhanced by what we in this Parliament have done."
"I therefore strongly oppose the attempts of some in this Parliament to remove precisely this balance of flexibility and security."
"Their assault focuses in particular on three things."
"Firstly, they are trying to remove the equal treatment principle by not linking it to the conditions of employment in the user company, but taking other temporary workers as a reference point."
"Then you have something like the equal treatment of women by comparing them only with other women and not with men."
"Secondly, they are contesting the fact that the directive should have anything at all to do with pay."
"We now have the legal opinions of all three institutions that this is very much possible, because it is a question of a comparison and not of fixing the level of pay."
"With this attempt, however, they are also trying to take the sting out of it, because pay is of course the most important condition of employment."
"Thirdly, they are trying to exclude the exception that was in paragraph 5.4 of the Commission's proposal, concerning short temporary assignments, and to make it general and even to raise it to 12 months."
"That will mean that the directive no longer has any point, because then the majority, if not all, temporary work will fall outside of its scope."
"I know that this is also a major problem in the United Kingdom."
"I have also tried to make a proposal to make this possible for a transitional period, that is for the first six weeks."
"That has not been supported in this Parliament so far, but I hope that further discussion on this subject will prove possible."
"There is one final comment I should like to make."
"Last week, parliament in Germany agreed on a system that is very much in line with the directive."
"I therefore hope - and I would like to conclude on this point - that the Social Affairs Council on 3 December will try to reach a common position, because in any event the way is now open for Germany too to do this in the line of the directive, and because it would be very good and, in fact, be proof that social legislation is indeed still possible if we could have a decision quickly and then proceed under the Greek Presidency."
"Mr President, I find myself with the unexpected privilege this evening of speaking second in this debate."
"I speak on behalf of Mr Gargani, the chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, in whose name our opinion stands."
"That is due to the chivalry of my colleague, Mr Koukiadis, who is here tonight and who is the original draftsman of the opinion."
"He tried in vain to persuade our committee to support the thrust of the Commission proposals."
"By a convincing majority the Committee on Legal Affairs voted in a series of sensible modifications that would have blunted some of the harm that this directive, if it is not changed, is going to do to the economy and employment throughout the European Union."
"I thank Mr Koukiadis for doing the decent thing and laying down his report."
"As the second speaker, I want to pay tribute to Mrs van den Burg."
"I have not had the pleasure of working with her before."
"She has worked in a very open-handed and friendly way."
"As she said, she has taken advice from a lot of people."
"Unfortunately, she has not listened to that advice."
"I am pleased that a number of other groups have supported the thrust of our amendments and I thank members of my own political family for going along with some of our ideas."
"The problem is that, as amended, the proposal from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs does not achieve the sort of flexibility that its advocates, the Commission and the rapporteur, were claiming."
"It has become more intrusive - there is more regulation."
"My concern about this report is that it fails to accept that high-quality temporary work, delivered by a caring and well-run agency, is not just a second best for employment."
"I wish to conclude by thanking the Committee on Employment for accepting one of my amendments which states: 'Member States shall transpose these provisions in a manner consistent with promoting job creation and making temporary agency work more attractive, recognising the different circumstances pertaining to their own territory'."
"If you had achieved that, I would have been delighted to support the directive."
"Mr President, in order to combat mass unemployment, more flexible models of work need to be found."
"Temporary agency work is making an increasing contribution to this process."
"Successful placement on a temporary basis increases the chances of permanent employment."
"This applies to the low-skilled and the long-term unemployed, but also to specialists."
"In the opinion which I have drafted on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, we refer to the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"We have incorporated the right to paid maternity leave and parental leave into the draft directive."
"We are against every form of discrimination, whether it relates to payment for equal work or work of equal value, is based on sex, or discriminates against temporary workers compared with permanent staff."
"For us, it was important to ensure that temporary workers should not be used to break strikes or as a means of imposing radical cuts in full-time jobs or permanent staff."
"Men still account for more than three-quarters of temporary workers."
"It is the difficulty in achieving a balance between work and family life that explains why there are far fewer women in this category ."
"Yet temporary work in particular allows adaptation to individual needs, and offers women good opportunities to enter the workforce or return to work."
"There are problems in practice, however."
"In Germany, temporary work agencies, known as Personnel Service Agencies, are now being established in the Employment Offices; as part of the public sector, they are subsidised from taxation and bear no commercial risks."
"This puts the private temporary work agencies at a severe disadvantage."
"I can tell the rapporteur, Mrs van den Burg, that the Federal Government is not implementing its supposedly groundbreaking concepts on a one-to-one basis, as it had pledged, but is watering them down."
"Temporary agency staff are to be paid as much as the permanent staff in the user company from day one."
"Yet equal pay from the start and the exclusive application of collective agreements are an impediment to temporary work."
"It was unfortunate that my proposal to introduce a six-month qualifying period at European level failed to secure a majority."
"In the Group of the European People's Party, we are therefore developing a compromise which takes appropriate account of the different rules in the Member States and respects the subsidiarity principle."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after months of intensive work, we can now vote for the first time in plenary on the draft directive on working conditions for temporary workers."
"Everyone involved has made great efforts to achieve the best possible solution for temporary workers, temporary work agencies and dynamic economic development in our EU Member States."
"Reaching this outcome was a difficult task."
"I would like to thank everyone who helped to ensure that we could present a fairly good compromise today."
"With around 10 million jobless and a shaky economy in the European Union, we must be sure that our well-meaning intention - to guarantee a basic level of social provision for temporary workers - does not paralyse an entire sector."
"It would be quite inappropriate to term 'temporary work' an atypical or even an unworthy form of working."
"Temporary work can help new recruits find a direction for the future, and it can help prevent employees who are particularly difficult to place from leaving the workforce, or assist them to return to work."
"My group attaches particular importance to flexibility in this sector."
"We must not create new bureaucratic hurdles, and temporary work must continue to be affordable for small companies too."
"Otherwise, the days of temporary agency work are numbered, leaving even more millions jobless in the European Union."
"If, when we vote tomorrow, we are guided by the principle of subsidiarity and the concept of pro-active economic development as a basis for more jobs, we will create more scope for the EU Member States to pursue their own courses towards flexible labour market development which does not conflict with appropriate protection for workers."
"The measures adopted in Germany with regard to temporary work lead to a dead-end."
"I hope we can create a more effective framework here."
"Mr President, I would like to add my congratulations to the rapporteur, Mrs van den Burg, and members of other groups who have helped steer us towards what hopefully will be a successful vote tomorrow."
"We have heard that provision varies from Member State to Member State in terms of the protection afforded to temporary agency workers."
"That is indeed the case and that justifies the laying down of a basic framework of protection for temporary workers throughout the European Union, but I would also underline that it will include the accession countries."
"The numbers of such workers are increasing in those countries, but as far as I am aware they have no existing protection for temporary agency workers."
"My second point is that tonight we are pursuing a strategy which has been under way since 1997, when we adopted the employment strategy at European Union level."
"In the adaptability pillar of that strategy, to which all Member States have signed up, we agreed to strike a balance between flexibility for companies, of all shapes and sizes, and a degree of security for the workers working within, and moving between, those enterprises."
"We have already dealt with that in relation to the earlier proposals on part-time work and on fixed-term contract working."
"We were warned at the time of the part-working directive that it would cost hundreds of thousands of part-time jobs, particularly for women workers within the European Union."
"We now have the evidence and the opposite is the case, because part-time work has come to be seen as a positive option."
"What we are working on now will mean that temporary agency work will also become a positive option in the future."
"We are often told that it is already a positive option, and that many people want to be temporary agency workers."
"Only 10% of the 61,000 temporary agency workers in my own region say that they are temporary agency workers by choice."
"We can increase that percentage quite significantly if we get it right and bring this proposal to a successful conclusion."
"We should pursue that balance between flexibility and security."
"Mr Harbour says we have not done it yet but I would say to him that this is the first stage."
"This is the opening gambit and not the end game."
"This is a codecision dossier."
"We have a long way to go, through common position, through second reading and no doubt into conciliation."
"We can continue to pursue that balance between flexibility and security."
"In my own group, two issues have been of great importance at this first reading stage."
"One is 'day one comparability'."
"I therefore hope that Amendment No 42 will be carried tomorrow."
"The second is the comparator."
"To whom is the temporary agency worker compared in terms of pay and basic employment conditions?"
"None of the potential solutions we currently have on paper are that elegant, but they get us through first reading and I am sure we will be getting back to that at the common position and second reading stages."
"Mr President, I do not believe the Commission has done enough to address the problems in different Member States."
"It is not just a problem for the UK, it is a problem for Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands and various other Member States."
"What we have to do is carry out a proper comprehensive impact assessment."
"We wish to return the directive to the Commission for them to do that assessment."
"I am in favour of temporary workers receiving protection but believe that it is probably best left to Member States, rather than having the 'fit-all' directive which we have in front of us today."
"The proposal in its current form will reduce flexibility, reduce opportunities for temporary workers and lead to more bureaucracy."
"We have, however, suggested various amendments in case the proposal is not rejected outright."
"To make it more workable for Member States we would firstly like to exclude pay and other financial benefits from the directive's scope altogether."
"I do not believe it should be an EU competence in any case."
"The second major amendment is to give an exemption for 12 months for temporary workers placed in user companies."
"That is only for pay and financial benefits, not for health and safety."
"Most temporary workers in the UK and some other Member States are covered on health and safety grounds."
"Another key amendment is to make sure the user company or the agency can be comparative, to give Member States that choice."
"Another area of concern is the temporary-to-permanent contract fee."
"Agencies should get some sort of recompense if the temporary worker is taken on by the user company."
"In my view, these amendments will make the directive far more workable and more acceptable to temporary workers, agencies and user companies."
"Mr President, it is well known that this proposal for a directive has arisen as a consequence of the block that European employers have imposed on the negotiating process on which the social partners had embarked."
"Nevertheless, although the proposal is intended to improve the working conditions of temporary workers, guaranteeing them equal rights and equal treatment, it only guarantees these through minimum standards of protection, based on the principle of non-discrimination, with countless derogations and with the dangerous prospect of an upsurge in temporary work agencies, which will contribute to greater job instability."
"Consequently, in the debate in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we agreed with all of the rapporteur's attempts to improve the proposal for a directive and to guarantee workers' rights, having tabled various proposals for amendments, specifically the removal of various derogations that could undermine the principle of non-discrimination, the guarantee not to use temporary workers to break strikes and the principle that the work undertaken by temporary agencies must not contribute to increasing job instability."
"We regret that most of these proposals have not been accepted, although we welcome the fact that some important ideas have been adopted, specifically on the restriction of derogations, enshrining the application of the principle of non-discrimination from day one with the removal of the six-week derogation, thereby guaranteeing some rights in the field of the information and participation of temporary workers and their not being used to break a strike."
"Other articles, however, are worded in a way that is unfortunate, incorrect and in some cases dangerous to workers, in addition to opening the way to further derogations, to be granted by the social partners. These articles are also intended to ensure an active role for temporary work agencies, contributing to greater labour flexibility."
"Hence the proposals we tabled for the vote in plenary."
"We are attempting to ensure that the European Parliament proposal achieves a significant improvement in the rights of temporary workers and does not pave the way for greater job instability."
"Our commitment is to ensuring that the greatest value is attached to work, by creating more high-quality jobs with rights and not to instability and the devaluing of workers."
"We therefore hope that you will support our proposals and reject all those that will, in practice, create greater instability and damage the rights of temporary workers who, in most cases, only resort to taking this type of work when they cannot find permanent employment."
"Let us not, then, contribute to a dual form of discrimination."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur most sincerely for her hard work and willingness to reach an agreement, difficult though that path has been and will be."
"My group will not be supporting the amendments which oppose this directive, but will generally support the rapporteur."
"It is quite true that there are many reputable agencies which pay well, which engage in training their staff and which provide very good terms and conditions."
"These agencies are generally already used to working within a regulated framework."
"This directive possibly changes part of the regulation."
"We have been told by certain major agencies, some of the largest operating in the European Union, that they do not oppose a regulation, which is not what the Confederation of British Industry and others would have us believe."
"But some of the difficulties raised we found difficult to credit."
"Some of the agencies have told us that they cannot compare the work done by their staff with that of the end-user company's staff as their agency staff do unique work which is highly skilled and is on a project basis."
"So, I found myself wondering on what basis, then, is the pay rate set at which the agency charges the end-user company?"
"What percentage of that income is then paid to the worker?"
"They cannot be working in a vacuum."
"Internal pay rates, some have told us, are confidential."
"Well, how then do reputable companies perform transparent audits on equal pay for equal work?"
"I believe that good agencies have nothing to fear from this directive."
"We would like to think that those who should be worrying are the disreputable ones who exploit the poorly-skilled, or people in areas of high unemployment who have little choice as to who they work for and under which conditions."
"These include cleaning agencies who employ shifts of temporary night workers and then pay them at training rates for longer than necessary, and companies who effectively employ long-term agency workers at lower rates of pay than permanent staff, and who replace paid staff who leave with agency workers because they can lay them off much more easily and with poorer conditions."
"For some strange reason, those agencies have not lobbied us."
"We need to ensure that we protect the rights of workers who do not have choices and whose agents know that they can exploit that weakness."
"Mr President, I too wish to congratulate the rapporteur on attempting to find a compromise between the different points of view on this issue."
"However, as was said on a number of occasions in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we are starting with a flawed proposal."
"It is flawed because we have moved away from the social dialogue and social partnership model where there was agreement between both sides of industry before a proposal came before this Parliament."
"This has put us all in a very difficult position, because we who are supporters of social dialogue, of protecting the rights of workers and of increasing the opportunities for employment of all the peoples in Europe want to ensure the best possible conditions for those most in need."
"Whilst I have no difficulty with the general tenor or the general intent of this directive, a number of facts have to be recognised before we give greater protection to those who are in temporary work contracts under the aegis of agencies."
"Firstly, there are various pieces of national legislation which already protect workers and this is merely duplicating or replicating what is already in place."
"Secondly, we have different types of employment systems in each Member State and a 'one size fits all' approach will not necessarily work."
"Thirdly, temporary workers work temporarily by choice and sometimes they can earn more money as temporary workers in an agency capacity."
"Fourthly, there is no provision in the Treaties and no place in this Parliament, the Council or the Commission for laying down conditions relating to workers' pay - that is still exclusively a matter for the Member States."
"My last point is on the question of the six-week period."
"There are amendments tabled for this to be extended to a one-year period."
"This is far more sensible and practical from the point of view of protecting all workers' rights."
"Mr President, I must first say that I find the proposal for a Commission directive highly positive."
"I think it could be improved, and I think it was partly improved and clarified by Parliament when it was voted on in committee;"
"I hope it can be further improved tomorrow when the House votes on it."
"I do not wish to add much, or even anything, to the opinion already expressed in the debate by the Commissioner and so many other Members on the question of temporary work. Such work has made it possible to try out necessary and opportune kinds of flexible working, in some cases it has allowed workers to achieve their own plans in life, and it has provided greater opportunities to enter the labour market, which is essentially the main issue here."
"At this juncture, on the basis of the experience gained so far, we needed to raise the thresholds for certain minimum levels of compulsory protection and to uphold the principle of non-discrimination."
"I reject the argument put forward by some regarding the desire to impose a straitjacket on pay issues from above: no one can specify a Europe-wide level of pay that will be valid in all Member States."
"The principle to be upheld was that of non-discrimination, and that has been done, but even more can be done if, as I hope, certain proposed amendments are adopted by this House, without imposing a single model or, much less, denying the direct role of agencies in the three-way relationship that characterises this type of work."
"We do not want a one-dimensional Europe but rather a Europe that can retain features that give meaning to a Community model and a Community commitment, which, when necessary, stop us from throwing out the baby with the bath water or, worse still, from running the risk of throwing out the baby and keeping the bath water."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, most Member States already have laws on temporary work or collective agreements, but they vary substantially in quality."
"The German legislation formerly in force was certainly not as simple as has been claimed here, and the public, whether they were employers or employed, did not accept it."
"Let me list just some of the peculiarities in the German restrictions: the ban on 'synchronisation', limitation to twelve months, a ban on fixed-term employment, and a ban in the construction industry."
"This is why I think that the German Government and parliament have taken a very courageous and significant step by already incorporating the European directive currently being debated into the qualitative improvements for Germany."
"It was unacceptable for workers in Germany to be earning up to 40% less than the permanent staff."
"No wonder the industry as a whole has such an appalling image."
"This is precisely what we are trying to change."
"What is interesting, however, is that temporary work is most readily accepted by society, and is also increasing to the greatest extent in those Member States where the principle of equality applies, namely in France and the Netherlands."
"Of course, the employers want social acceptance as well."
"The main reason for using temporary agency workers - as our Foundation in Dublin found out - is not the cost savings incurred, but the option of flexible deployment during seasonal bottlenecks, as a response to personnel fluctuations, and in some cases in the extension of probationary periods."
"This is exactly what the European directive facilitates, with Mrs van den Burg's amendments."
"The necessary flexibility is further safeguarded through wage negotiations."
"Let us adopt this directive tomorrow and send out a clear signal that there really is such a thing as a social Europe!"
"Mr President, unlike some colleagues, I do not believe that this House should seek a delay in fulfilling its responsibilities in relation to temporary agency workers."
"If we are to promote flexible labour markets then we must ensure that those working within them are not put at a disadvantage."
"We cannot risk temporary work being used as a way of bypassing normal employment laws rather than, as it should be, a properly regulated means of satisfying employers' short-term needs."
"It is for this reason that we should not emasculate the proposal by removing pay from the scope of the directive or applying it only to workers in assignments of more than 12 months."
"That said, I am not convinced that we have yet struck quite the right balance between flexibility and protection."
"There are real difficulties in implementing a fixed-term worker comparative for pay in the case of assignments of a short duration."
"Accordingly, I urge colleagues to support Amendments Nos 72 and 74 which should overcome this problem."
"Similarly, I hope for a positive vote on Amendments Nos 71 and 73 which guard against any adverse effects the directives might have in both the shorter and longer terms."
"Finally, my special thanks go to the rapporteur for the inclusive manner in which she has handled a very difficult dossier and my personal good wishes to her for the outcome of the vote tomorrow."
"Mr President, although we must have a European viewpoint, we are inevitably influenced by the situation in each of our countries."
"Specifically, in my own country, temporary work agencies - or at least some of these companies - are factories for insecure work."
"At the moment, in Spain, 33% of this work is insecure, more than double the European average, which stands at 13%."
"We therefore have difficulties with some of the amendments which my colleague, Ilda Figueiredo, has already mentioned in that they may possibly lead to discrimination."
"The rapporteur herself, in the explanatory statement, says that she is not very happy with those amendments that jeopardise the principle of non-discrimination."
"In the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, although it points out that these companies have contributed to improving the labour market, it is also stated that these companies, in certain countries of the European Union, employ illegal workers, and that they regularly violate the rights of workers."
"Therefore, as my colleague has already pointed out, if certain amendments mentioned are approved, it will be difficult for us to vote in favour of the report."
"At the Lisbon Council, there was discussion of the quality of work and employment rights."
"We are therefore tabling certain amendments - I am not sure if they are having much luck - inspired by a principle laid out in one of them: we advocate that this directive should be aimed at improving the quality of temporary work, guaranteeing respect for the principle of non-discrimination."
"That is what we are advocating, pure and simple."
"And we will support the rapporteur provided that certain amendments by the honourable Members seated opposite are not approved."
"Mr President, this is an extraordinarily involved directive with an involved previous history, as has already been said."
"We have had great difficulty bringing this directive to a successful conclusion."
"I think that the main point is that the legislation this directive is about is very different in what are very different countries, that temporary work is regulated in a very different way in the different European countries and I would like everyone to recognise that."
"We must nonetheless seek a solution because of the previous history and also because of the fact that we would otherwise be unable to regulate cross-border traffic."
"To move in the direction of the Lisbon process we must develop further the important role that temporary work can play."
"We have considerable experience of it in the country where I come from."
"It is currently still the country with the highest percentage of temporary workers and experience shows that you can deregulate, but that you must then take certain statutory measures."
"That is a fact."
"As each country needs its own balance, the directive must be relatively flexible."
"Thanks to the work of the rapporteur, but also thanks to the work of the two shadow rapporteurs from the PPE-DE, this has been achieved to a very large extent and I would therefore like to thank all three of them very much."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has also, I think, made a significant contribution, as has the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, to the achievement of a result."
"It is very important that there is a result, as I have already said, but there are occasionally some interfering noises."
"These interfering noises often come from people who are thinking only of their own situation, of their own country."
"This we must prevent."
"This we cannot accept."
"Finally, Mr President, I would ask the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party to take another look at their own amendments."
"Amendments have been submitted in duplicate or triplicate, and contradictory amendments have also been tabled to the same Paragraph."
"This is no way to negotiate."
"We cannot deal with codecision this way."
"I would like to ask whether they would like to go through their own amendment list one more time."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her patient work on a difficult issue."
"Parliament can debate today, and tomorrow, I hope, it will be able to adopt a report that improves the Commission proposal."
"It is, as has already been said, a very problematic dossier, because the different countries have very different systems to deal with this matter - they range from situations of all-embracing guarantees to a lack of any kind of protection. I too applaud the Commission's initiative, which is not a straitjacket restricting autonomy and subsidiarity but comes after 20 years of attempts by employers and workers to reach an agreement."
"I believe there are three basic objectives of equality of treatment contained in the proposal: equality of treatment for temporary workers compared with other workers in terms of job security and status; respect for established social standards within the user enterprises, through equal treatment in terms of pay and working conditions of temporary workers and other, comparable workers in the user enterprises; and recognition of the work of agencies supplying temporary workers as a legitimate professional activity, removing unnecessary restrictions, authorisations and prohibitions."
"The purpose of the directive is thus to guarantee and harmonise a common minimum level of protection for temporary workers, without any discrimination."
"It is a directive that places temporary work within its own part of the labour market, recognising its importance and value without, however, pushing it until it becomes almost the only system for hiring people."
"I also believe, since Lisbon has been mentioned, that this directive regulates temporary work in a way that brings it qualitatively into line with the Lisbon objectives."
"Mr President, all of us want to see less poverty and more social justice."
"More jobs can provide both."
"More employment laws like the atypical workers' directive will secure neither."
"The Commission is trying to impose a straitjacket on something that cannot and does not need to be standardised."
"My colleague, Mr Pronk, said a moment ago that he would like everyone to recognise that Member States organise temporary work in different ways."
"That is absolutely right."
"I too would like everyone to recognise that, and we want Member States to be able to continue to organise in different ways."
"The very adjective 'atypical' in the name of this directive says it all."
"Earlier in this debate Ms Attwooll said that Amendment No 71, for example, would guard against any adverse effects."
"That is wishful thinking."
"This amendment offers some help, but the improvements are marginal and all our temporary workers, recruitment agencies and client companies will be saying the same thing - that we are still left with a directive that could cost the UK alone 160 000 jobs."
"I will address my final remarks to the Commissioner, even though she will probably never speak to me again."
"Last week the press reported her as saying that the EU had created a net 12 million jobs over the last six years and that the EU' s rigid labour market was not the main problem facing Europe's economy."
"It is very easy to say that there is no problem or that, if there is, then it is someone else's problem."
"It is a problem for all of us, but you are, with respect, making it worse."
"You are proposing the atypical workers' directive which, instead of promoting job flexibility, will help to kill it off."
"This directive has little to do with protecting the rights of temporary workers, certainly in the UK where happily they already enjoy such protection."
"It is notionally about protecting the jobs of permanent workers by making it more difficult for companies to employ temporary staff."
"The Financial Times yesterday reported on the labour market problems in Germany, describing how reform is being resisted and vested interests are being protected, all under the guise of promoting social justice."
"The Commission should have the guts to strip away this pretence and withdraw this directive."
"To encourage it to do so, the UK Conservative delegation will vote against this report."
"Mr President, I want to congratulate Mrs van den Burg for an enormously well done job and the Commissioner for introducing this directive."
"The kind of detailed work that is involved in this kind of directive is never adequately appreciated outside of this House."
"Anyone who has watched the way in which Mrs van den Burg has worked on this directive will appreciate the enormous amount of commitment and expertise that had to be brought to it."
"We are trying to balance flexibility with security for workers who, in many countries, still do not have any security at all."
"We have been told here that national legislation already exists in Ireland to protect these workers."
"That is not so."
"We are told that it is best left to the Member States to deal with these matters."
"The Irish experience will demonstrate that is not so."
"There are close to 100 000 agency workers in Ireland."
"The European Foundation for Living and Working Conditions, based in Dublin, published a study in May showing that there is no guarantee of equal treatment for agency workers in Ireland and that there is virtually no legal protection for agency workers at all in Ireland."
"That is a study carried out by a foundation funded by the European Union."
"It also points out that Ireland has failed to implement the 1991 Health and Safety Directive covering agency workers."
"Incidentally, Ireland has also failed to implement the Part-time Workers Directive and is now seriously out of line with the rest of Europe on these issues."
"So it is not a good idea to leave these matters in the hands of Member States - and certainly not a good idea to leave it in the hands of the current Irish Government, the ruling party of which Mr Crowley is a member."
"I would challenge him to back up his statement in this House tonight that there is already adequate protection for Irish workers in this area."
"There is not adequate protection."
"There is none."
"Mr President, the directive on temporary agency work marks an even more organised and methodological attack on the right to full, stable employment and social insurance."
"It shows that the policy of flexible forms of work is alive and kicking, it exacerbates the exploitation of the workers and it confuses the fight of the workers' movement."
"The fact that all this is happening with the assent of the compromised leaders of the trade union movement and the International Labour Organisation merely demonstrates their destructive role."
"The claim that the directive safeguards and enhances the professional status of working victims, that it improves health and safety and that it increases employment is pure fraud."
"The truth is that this is a well-organised attempt to step up exploitation and share out unemployment by creating modern slave-trade organisations."
"Protecting full, stable employment with rights for everyone is always a vital objective but it will only be achieved by stepping up the fight against the monopolies and the anti-labour policy of the European Union."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Commissioner on the presentation of this document, as well as Mrs van den Burg on the efforts she has made to find a balance, and I am going to comment very briefly on three specific points."
"Firstly, the purpose of temporary work agencies, as an instrument for flexibility in the labour market, which reconcile the aspirations of workers with the needs of companies."
"I believe they are going to provide greater possibilities and opportunities for employment, for accessing the labour market."
"Secondly, I would like to comment on the restrictions and prohibitions relating to the use of the temporary provision of workers and, from a doctrinal or theoretical point of view, I would like to say that, where there is permission for contracting workers on a temporary basis, there is no reason to prohibit the contracting of workers provided by agencies."
"It must only be objective and duly justified - and therefore restrictive - criteria that regulate prohibitions."
"Thirdly, I would like to stress the need for particularly intense action on the health and safety protection of workers during work and on the health and safety of workers provided by temporary employment agencies."
"There are various reasons for this: firstly, the temporary nature of the employment itself, which seems to increase risk; secondly, the diversity of the work to be carried out in the different contracting companies; and, perhaps, thirdly, the differing methods and procedures, even for a task or post of an identical nature in different companies."
"I believe we should seek different arguments - for example, the voluntary requirement for non-discrimination - which could make a reference to health at work possible, as well as conditions in general and pay, in particular, without regulating them, but making this reference on the basis of support for the principle of non-discrimination."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am especially pleased to add to the words of thanks that have already been expressed to Mrs van den Burg and I would once again like to underline how important it is that we have this directive."
"Some fellow MEPs have already said that the temporary sector is a very fast growing sector."
"If we want to ensure that this sector delivers flexibility in the labour market, at the same time delivers quality jobs for the people who work in it and also does not put permanent recruitment under any pressure, then we need sound protection rules, at European level too."
"Mr Pronk is right in saying that the systems and the regulations in the different Member States differ."
"Moreover, some Member States offer considerable protection and this we may certainly not undo."
"That is why the non-regression clause in the directive is so important."
"There are, however, also very many Member States that do not offer good protection, Mrs De Rossa made full reference to this."
"Nor is this a one-size-fits-all directive."
"There is scope here for various national choices."
"I would very briefly like to make three comments."
"First of all, in connection with what Mr Hughes has just said, for us, it is crucial that temporary workers are protected from day one."
"That was, Commissioner, a point that I found weak in the Commission's proposal."
"You will therefore understand that it is absolutely unacceptable for us to agree to the Liberal amendment that excludes temporary work up to one year."
"That would make the directive an empty shell."
"Secondly, it is important that temporary workers enjoy good employment conditions."
"I still think that equal treatment is best served by the principle by which, as far as essential employment conditions are concerned, a temporary worker is compared with workers of a user company."
"However, then of course, we must also ensure that our definition of essential employment conditions is sound."
"Such a definition without the concept of remuneration?"
"That takes the biscuit."
"That would completely nullify the principle of equal treatment."
"Thirdly, an exception to the principle of equal treatment is acceptable, but only where the systems concerned provide good guarantees internally in the temporary sector itself, also for the period between two contracts."
"The countries where this is properly regulated usually guarantee contracts for an indefinite period of time or long contracts."
"I should like to warn our fellow MEPs from the PPE-DE against stepping onto a slippery slope by reducing these guarantees too much."
"Commissioner, just like you, I hope that we as legislators will be able to do what the social partners have been unable to do, that is to guarantee all temporary workers throughout the European Union solid social protection."
"That will then definitely be to the credit of Mrs van den Burg too."
"Mr President, in the last ten years, there has been a steady growth in temporary work in the European Union."
"This rapid growth is justified because temporary work enables companies to respond better to the need to be flexible and to adapt to the economic climate."
"The aims of the proposal we are discussing are:"
"to ensure that temporary work is a factor in creating jobs that encourage more stable and longer employment relationships;"
"to guarantee the rights and safety of temporary workers;"
"and to increase flexibility in the labour market."
"The basic premise is to extend, at Community level, the principle of non-discrimination between temporary and other workers."
"The guarantee of minimum rights will make this sector more attractive and give it a better reputation, bringing to an end the prejudice against it that still exists."
"This report is balanced and represents a step forwards from the proposal for a directive presented by the Commission and I therefore thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs from my own group for their contributions to it."
"This balance is reflected particularly in the definition of minimum Community requirements, leaving it to the Member States and the social partners to adapt these to the specific situation in their respective countries."
"Other issues have been taken into account and rightly so, such as the guarantee of basic protection, the opportunity for women to reconcile family life with professional life and the integration into the market of young people and individuals with fewer qualifications."
"I should like to point out that, in Portugal, Article 4 is the provision that could cause the most problems: in fact, current national legislation contains a restrictive set of arrangements on this type of work in order to ensure that it is used only to serve employers' occasional needs."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I shall now suspend the sitting for two minutes, and then we will continue."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.06 p.m. and resumed at 11.08 p.m.)"
"Mr President, I regret that the concept of social dialogue has been jettisoned by the Commission with this directive."
"With talks having broken down, it has run with the views of one side, namely the EU trade union, ETUC, and has largely ignored the EU employers' body, UNICE."
"If social dialogue is to work, then there needs to be a more balanced approach to social measures, particularly in line with commitments on labour market flexibility in the context of the Lisbon competitive process."
"The definition in Article 3 of a comparable worker will cause major difficulties, and by adopting a user comparison agency workers will find their conditions of employment varying depending on where they are assigned."
"In Article 4 the inclusion of a limitation on the use of temporary work runs counter to employment policy at EU level and there is no economic or social justification for it."
"It could even constitute gender discrimination."
"In relation to Article 5, the reference to 'essential' employment conditions is unclear and has no precedent in EU law."
"The Commission has departed from normal practice and the wording used in previous social dialogue agreements should be the template, rather than the views of only one social partner."
"The same applies to Article 6 and the matters governed by points 6.2 and 6.3."
"These should be left to the discretion of Member States."
"Point 6.4 in Article 7 reflects a poor understanding of employment and commercial relationships."
"The reference to 'sanctions' in Article 12 again departs from previous approaches and social dialogue agreements, and should be dealt with at Member State level, in line with national industrial relations practices."
"It is inappropriate to include reference to pay as an aspect of basic working conditions, given the limitation imposed by Article 137(6) of the Treaty."
"Six weeks is far too short a period to decide whether a temporary agency worker should be made permanent or not."
"All workers have a probationary period."
"Ireland is behind in transposing EU law in this area but we have true social dialogue and a comprehensive body of national law where there is a general qualifying period of 12 months' continuous service for entitlement to rights."
"In conclusion, the approach of this directive is an example of where an idea in theory has not been thought through in practical terms, both from a temporary employee's perspective and that of an employer."
"My congratulations to our rapporteur, to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities for their amendments."
"We need them, without them this would be inoperable."
"Mr President, this initiative by the Commission - and the Commissioner in particular - on a proposal for a directive to supplement the other two directives on atypical employment deserves our support, and Mrs van den Burg, who has tried to retain the spirit of the directive in the face of huge reaction, of course deserves our congratulations."
"Mr Harbour has reminded me of our confrontation but I can assure him that our confrontations are always exciting."
"Amendment No 87, part two, and more importantly Amendment No 86, should not be adopted because they abolish every safety valve accepted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"If they are accepted as they stand, workers will not in most cases receive the same wages as workers in the user company."
"I do not know whether or not this was an oversight, but may I point out that our committee's Amendment No 40, which relates to Article 5, paragraph 2, stating that Member States shall take appropriate measures with a view to preventing misuse, is deleted under Amendment No 86."
"Amendment No 87 gives Member States the right, wherever derogations are allowed, to pass laws allowing new derogations and, more to the point, the same working conditions as those which would apply to a comparable temporary agency worker."
"Where is the balance between flexibility and balance and where is the protection for economic competition on the internal market?"
"Mr President, Ms Attwooll said that the rapporteur had been inclusive in carrying out this report."
"I would like to go further and say that strenuous efforts were made to understand the situation in some of the highest concentrations of agency workers anywhere in the European Union."
"For example, in my own region of London we have cleaners, nurses, IT specialists and now, crucially, manufacturing workers, many of whom Mr Harbour would have been referring to earlier."
"The situation now is a classic contrast between flexibility and protection."
"There is a need to understand the situation in countries where there is a less-developed temporary agency worker regulation."
"That is why I welcome amendments like Amendment No 71, through the efforts of the rapporteurs and others to understand that situation."
"We are not at extremes in this area."
"We are in a situation where there is evidence that those vulnerable workers looking to us for protection require that protection and good agency employers require growth and flexibility."
"It is a balance which should be struck."
"We want to find that balance."
"As Mr Hughes said, we are at the beginning of that process."
"Let us shape a directive that strikes that vital balance."
"Mr President, my sincere thanks go to Mrs van den Burg for the work she has done."
"For many years now Europe has clearly not managed to fulfil its aim to become the world's most competitive economic area."
"Unfortunately, this proposal for a directive on temporary agency work will take us even further away from our objective."
"The Lisbon targets bind us to a more flexible labour market than before."
"Increased bureaucracy and interference in contracts between companies will constrain the labour market."
"Do we not want supply to meet demand?"
"Since the Treaty of Rome the EU has aspired to the creation of a dynamic Internal Market."
"The Member States take care of the social consequences of that by taking account of the interests of employees in the way they themselves consider best."
"This lies at the heart of the principle of subsidiarity."
"It is not the EU's job to regulate sectors that do not require intervention at EU level."
"For historical reasons there are big differences between the labour market systems in Member States."
"One rigid solution in this sector will not suit everyone."
"If things have not been dealt with properly in Ireland, it does not mean that this directive should be employed to complicate things in Finland, where they have."
"This directive's implementation will clearly worsen the general situation regarding temporary agency work in Finland."
"It would appear that, once again, no thorough cost-benefit analyses have been carried out."
"The results will ultimately be reflected in growing unemployment and weakening competitiveness."
"The committee's decision to allow employment agencies to receive reasonable costs, however, is an improvement on the poor proposal put forward by the Commission."
"Refusing to pay such costs would lead to the work of the agencies discontinuing."
"Temporary employment agencies offer a flexible solution in the way they fill vacancies promptly and speedily in sectors suffering from a shortage of manpower."
"Under no circumstances should we make conditions worse for them."
"Mr Crowley has a comment on procedure."
"Mr President, Mr De Rossa mentioned me in particular and challenged me to an argument."
"Rather than take up Parliament's time explaining how successful my party has been in government in creating employment and protecting workers' rights, I would like to invite him to discuss its merits and demerits over a drink."
"That is a good suggestion!"
"Mr President, I should like to start with three general comments."
"First, several honourable Members raised the question of subsidiarity."
"There is a whole body of evidence on subsidiarity; I should just like to make one very important point."
"At a time when national markets are fast turning into European markets and we are on the threshold of enlargement, highly diverse labour legislation and differing rights from one country to another are obviously creating distortions on the internal market."
"So there is clearly a need, just as in all other sectors of labour legislation, for a common, flexible framework."
"My second comment concerns whether we evaluated the repercussions of this directive."
"May I remind you that this directive will apply to 1.5%-2% of workers in Europe."
"But what is important politically is that this sector is mushrooming and workers' rights are being distorted left, right and centre, which is why we need to be pro-active and regulate it as quickly as possible within - I repeat - a general framework."
"We have taken account and I would ask you to examine the study - available to any Member who is interested - which was carried out by the CIETT, the Confédération Internationale des Entreprises de Travail Temporaire."
"The companies themselves clearly conclude in this study that employment legislation is needed in order to resolve the problems which generally arise on the questions of pay and working conditions and underpin the development of this sector, which has a very bad press in numerous countries."
"There is a clear reference to the Netherlands and the Dutch model, a model which has managed to combine flexibility with social insurance and protection for workers in a country in which some of the biggest and most successful temporary employment agencies are to be found."
"Serious concerns were expressed about the model getting tied up in red tape."
"I would say they are completely unfounded."
"The legislation does not introduce any new procedures for recruiting or transferring workers and each country keeps its present system."
"Flexibility, at least as we interpret it in Europe, means a set of policies and practices to help the company, the worker, the public sector and the law to adapt to new production requirements."
"Flexibility must not be interpreted as meaning fewer or no rights as a prerequisite to job creation."
"Specific references were made to Great Britain, to the effect that jobs will be cut etc. All that will happen in that particular country is that there may be a small increase in labour costs due to the minimum social rights granted to workers on the British job market."
"I should like if I may, Mr President, to comment on specific amendments in order to give the Commission's position."
"There are two types of amendment."
"The first type clarifies the proposal and adds a number of definitions."
"The second type amends the proposal materially by adding or deleting certain important provisions."
"As far as the first type is concerned, I welcome the proposed new title."
"I think it conveys the objective of the directive much better."
"I agree with the amendment designed to convey more fully the triangular relationship between worker, agency and user undertaking innate in temporary employment."
"We support the amendments that redefine temporary agency work, the user company and the temporary work agency."
"We also accept the amendments that clarify the text."
"The definition proposed for the term 'assignment ' is far more accurate."
"The new wording for the group of workers that Member States cannot exclude from the scope of the directive is a vast improvement."
"I agree with the addendum specifying the means to be used to inform employees about any vacant posts in the user undertaking."
"I also think it is helpful to state that agencies may receive a reasonable level of recompense for services provided to user undertakings but that agencies must not charge workers a fee if they enter into a permanent contract of employment with the user company at the end of their assignment."
"I accept the amendment rewording the reference to social services more clearly."
"I also welcome the reference to collective agreements and worker representation because worker representation can indeed be set out in collective agreements."
"I agree with the amendment requiring the Member States to ensure that both workers and their representatives are equipped to press the provisions of the directive."
"That brings me to material amendments to the directive, which add or delete certain important provisions."
"I shall deal first with the amendments that are acceptable and then with the amendments that are not."
"I agree with the amendment extending the scope for lifting restrictions and prohibitions on temporary agency work."
"This scope was very restricted in the proposal for a directive, because it only applied to restrictions or prohibitions on certain groups of workers or certain sectors."
"And of course, I accept the spirit of the amendment designed to ensure that temporary agency workers are not used to replace workers taking part in collective action such as strikes and so on."
"I also think the principle of non-discrimination has been cleverly reworded;"
"I think it is clearer and easier to focus on the working conditions which temporary workers would enjoy were they employed directly by the user company."
"I can allow the exemption for permanent contracts to be restricted solely to pay but I cannot allow this derogation to be extended to fixed-term contracts."
"Nor can I allow the 6-week period which allows temporary agency workers to be used in certain countries for a very short space of time for work of minor importance to be deleted."
"This is a factor which will help significantly in the overall negotiations."
"To summarise, I accept Amendments Nos 1, 4, 22, 28, 33, 43, 46, 47, 48, 51, 52, 85 and 92 in full."
"I accept Amendments Nos 6, 15, 16, 20, 23, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 38, 40, 44 and 49 in part or in spirit, if they are reworded."
"The remaining amendments are rejected."
"I should like to thank you all for helping to bring about a new text which will facilitate the final acceptance of the directive, what is without doubt a politically and technically complicated directive."
"May I again congratulate Mrs van den Burg and urge the Danish presidency to take whatever action is needed in order to reach agreement at the Council on 3 December."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0359/2002) by Mrs Damião, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Commission communication on Life sciences and biotechnology - A Strategy for Europe (COM(2002) 27 - C5-0260/2002 - 2002/2123(COS))."
"rapporteur. (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have been given the delicate task of presenting the report by Elisa Damião, who is ill and therefore cannot be here today, although she has been lucid and clear-minded enough to follow every step of this report which quite rightly, therefore, bears her name."
"I feel very moved to be presenting this report, I send my greetings to Mrs Damião and hope that she is able to return to Parliament as soon as possible, because she is a person of enormous political and parliamentary ability, as well as being a great citizen."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the amazing progress that has been made in biology and in molecular genetics is fascinating and disturbing at the same time."
"Scientific knowledge has moved ahead at such a pace that we are now in a position radically to change not only the vegetal and animal world, but also, eventually perhaps, our own species. This represents a genuine sea change."
"The abilities of science and technology have now largely gone beyond the fictions contained in literary masterpieces such as Huxley's 'Brave New World' or George Orwell's 'Nineteen Eighty-Four'."
"Nevertheless, if the truth be told, the visions contained in those works, of societies and human beings oppressed and dehumanised by the manipulation of science and technology, have fortunately not been fulfilled."
"The concern expressed by the broader public, however, with regard, for example, to genetically modified organisms and to cloning is a very clear sign, which the political, scientific and industrial world must heed."
"An initial response was drawn up by UNESCO when, in November 1997, by consensus it adopted the universal declaration on the human genome and human rights."
"However, of all the revolutions that have taken place in the realm of knowledge, that of molecular biology will, perhaps, be the greatest of all and it is genetics that will have the greatest implications in the economic, cultural and ethical spheres."
"Biotechnologies are part of the technologies of the future. The potential development of these gives us a glimpse of major changes in the coming years in the medicinal products, food, agriculture and environmental markets."
"Nevertheless, these technologies, in their practical applications, raise ethical and philosophical questions that are now part of today's culture. Given their implications, there will always be pessimistic souls, as has always happened throughout history and throughout the history of science and technology, who see apocalyptic threats to humanity, awakening age-old fears and trepidation."
"We must combat those who exploit fears, ghosts and superstitions with a cautious but optimistic attitude towards science and realise that it must be inspired by high ethical standards and legal frameworks that, whilst encouraging intellectual freedom and scientific creativity, prevent excesses."
"The classical humanism expressed in the famous phrase of the philosopher Seneca stated that 'man is sacred to mankind'."
"This classical humanism must inspire contemporary science and all citizens."
"The European Union has availed itself in recent years of a panoply of directives and regulations in the field of biotechnologies and science."
"Nevertheless, the many legislative acts that have been adopted constitute a genuine rag-bag, lacking a coherent, global and systemic vision of this vast sector."
"Some legislation that has been adopted has not been implemented and other legislation has been subject to derogations, moratoria and, even worse, numerous voids and grey areas."
"The global battle in the field of biotechnologies is, nevertheless, crucial."
"The United States clearly lead the field in this area."
"Nevertheless, the Lisbon Summit outlined an ambitious target for the EU for the forthcoming decade: to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world."
"How will this aim be achieved without a strong European commitment to biotechnologies?"
"Europe is lagging behind the United States."
"Although the European Union has 1570 undertakings operating in this field and the United States has 1263, the fact is that these undertakings in the European Union employ 61 000 workers who produce a volume of business of EUR 42 billion, whereas in this same sector in the United States 162 000 workers are employed, producing the equivalent of EUR 365 billion."
"This is a summary, Mr President, of the cultural, political, legal and economic context into which the Commission communication fits. This is broadly supported by Mrs Damião's report."
"In fact, the action plan and the strategy presented by the Commission resolve, with one wave of a magic wand, the diffuse nature, the incoherence and the shortcomings of the legal framework and of European policies in the field of biotechnologies."
"We will clearly not be able to achieve this with one wave of the wand, but they do point us in the right direction."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Damião, in her absence, and I agree with what Mr Lage has just said about a report that voices strong and clear support for the responsible development of life sciences and biotechnology in Europe."
"I also warmly welcome the fact that the report has been produced on the basis of broad political agreement."
"This report marks a very important step: biotechnology is the next wave of the knowledge-based economy and biotechnology research is crucial for strengthening European competitiveness in this field."
"There is a growing realisation among Europeans that this technology is important for our future competitiveness and welfare."
"A consensus is emerging on how we might strengthen its development in a manner consistent with our European values and ethical standards."
"We are faced with a policy choice: either stand aside and see these technologies developed elsewhere, or exploit them ourselves in a responsible manner and to the benefit of European citizens."
"As was made clear in the report that Mr Purvis submitted to Parliament last spring, biotechnology is an enabling technology."
"It affects, or can even transform, broad areas such as healthcare, environmental protection, agriculture and food and industrial production processes."
"It can be a source of innovation for new and established companies alike, and it offers unique approaches to finally solving problems, for example in the fields of healthcare and novel pharmaceuticals."
"Europe cannot afford to miss out on the benefits biotechnology will bring."
"Members of the European Commission under the leadership of President Prodi have worked together to provide a strategy that encompasses all the various applications of biotechnology, but also tries to enable us to come up with coherent answers to the more difficult questions and choices we are faced with."
"The Commission's Communication on 'Life Sciences and Biotechnology: a strategy for Europe' builds upon the common knowledge base in life sciences and will lead to skills-based jobs that sustain the economies of the future."
"We propose a number of actions for the promotion of biotechnology development in Europe, and at the same time, further measures for responsible governance, to ensure that this development takes place in accordance with our societal values and needs."
"The Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, under the leadership of Commissioner Busquin, will provide substantial support for the supply of skilled resources and for overcoming the fragmentation of research and lack of critical mass."
"We need to ensure that research results can be protected by means of harmonised intellectual property protection, and translated into commercial products and processes through effective innovation and technology transfer."
"The strategy also stresses the need to overcome the previous fragmentation in the commercial development of biotechnology in Europe and several actions will contribute to linking up researchers, emerging companies, service providers and financial institutions."
"The present downturn in the capital markets and the lack of risk capital needs particular and urgent attention."
"The success of the biotechnology strategy will only be assured if the technology is built on a basis of societal trust."
"It is vital for developments, and in particular public policy-making, to take place with a maximum of transparency."
"We need to encourage public dialogue throughout Europe to ensure that societal goals are met and public concerns are addressed."
"The strategy pursues the overarching goal of enhancing coherence between policies at the different levels."
"In this way, we can give proper, broad consideration to policy decisions that have an impact on our competitiveness and the future prosperity of our societies."
"The Commission has started implementing measures in its own areas of responsibility."
"We will shortly publish the first regular report on the stage reached in this implementation work."
"However, this strategy will only work well if we all - European institutions, Member States, regions, industry, academia and civil society alike - now make commitments according to our respective responsibilities and resources."
"The adoption of Parliament's report and the forthcoming Council conclusions will provide the essential political backing for the effective implementation of the strategy at European level."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I greatly welcome the Commission's objective of again giving the EU a leading role in the field of life sciences and biotechnology."
"However, the proposed strategy lags far behind expectations."
"I would therefore like to thank Mrs Damião very much for her comprehensive report which clarifies the Commission's strategy document in many respects."
"Europe must take on a pro-active role once again if it is not to lose ground in this sophisticated area of technology."
"This applies especially to 'green' genetic engineering - in other words, to agriculture."
"A prerequisite is the establishment of an effective, predictable and stable legal framework, both for agriculture and for the biotech industry in Europe."
"This framework must comply, in particular, with WTO rules and safeguard the coexistence of all forms of agricultural production."
"The removal of the de facto moratorium for product approvals is the precondition for more planning security for companies and the agricultural sector."
"The moratorium is especially harmful to innovative SMEs in Europe and conflicts with the Lisbon objectives."
"Within the Commission, and within the European institutions, a targeted European policy to promote a 'B-Europe' policy must be promoted."
"Based on the successful concept of eEurope, these same priorities could be pursued on an overarching basis by several of the Commission's Directorates-General."
"Further key points include: support for the development of bioclusters and other models for technological transfer, easier access to risk capital, especially for start-ups and SMEs in biotech research, the introduction of a European patent, and a transparent and scientifically based information policy on the part of the authorities, companies and the scientific establishment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to send Mrs Damião my best wishes for her continued recovery."
"I would like to express my thanks to her and her colleagues, but also to Mr Lage, for their excellent cooperation."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports the Damião report, not least because the whole thing - the action plan and the report - is based on a report by our fellow Member, John Purvis."
"The Damião report sends out a positive signal for biotechnology, but it also makes clear where we need better rules than currently exist."
"The report deliberately does not paint a 'black and white' picture."
"There is, after all, a view that genetic technology may be very positive in healthcare, but must be rejected at all costs in agriculture."
"The report rejects this position."
"We state quite clearly that there are opportunities in both sectors; in other words, there are opportunities in agriculture as well."
"Indeed, the report says that genetic technology can contribute towards finding genuine solutions to sustainable development, and I would like to emphasise this point."
"This is why we are opposed to the de facto moratorium."
"The Directive on the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment was adopted a long time ago."
"The Member States should have implemented it in national law by October."
"I sat on the Conciliation Committee with David Bowe at the time, and I never dreamed that so many years later, this de facto moratorium would still be in place."
"The report says that it must end by 2003."
"I believe that it should actually end now, because the deadline for the implementation of Directive 220/90 has already passed."
"Otherwise, SMEs in particular will suffer considerably, as Mrs Müller has already said."
"Just as there are not only risks but also major benefits in the agricultural sector, there are not only benefits, but also major risks, in the medical field."
"We see a danger, for example, in the uncontrolled use of DNA testing."
"DNA tests are not services like any other."
"They may only be carried out after competent, expert, independent and individual counselling, and this counselling must cover medical, ethical, social, psychological and legal aspects."
"A year ago, our group commissioned an expert report on this issue."
"This report says that the European Union has competence in this area."
"Offering DNA testing is either a cross-border service, or DNA tests are products traded in the internal market."
"This is why we need standards in this area, quality standards and standards relating, for example, to counselling."
"The Commission has a task here, and I ask the Commission to do what the report says, namely to initiate legislation."
"Mr President, I fully endorse the previous speakers' comments, and I assume that there will be a majority in favour of the Damião report tomorrow."
"There are many reasons for this."
"The Commissioner is absolutely right to describe biotechnology as the undoubted key to the future. Some have grasped this already; others will take longer to do so, but it is undoubtedly the case."
"Mr Liese is absolutely right: biotechnology will also help us find solutions for sustainable development."
"I would like to add an explanation here, for biotechnology does not work with 'classical' thermodynamics, but with irreversible thermodynamics; in other words, it works with very small potential differences to produce a very substantial impact."
"Otherwise, we would not grow old, but would leave this mortal coil at the age of 15."
"In other words, biotechnology has many benefits, and this is widely recognised."
"Indeed, 'red' biotechnology is already recognised by large sections of the Green Party today."
"The problem is this: how do we deal with green biotechnology?"
"This may also have to do with the fact that many people in Europe say that they do not need it; they say they have enough to eat, and the problem is distribution, not new products."
"There is a very different view in the developing countries, however."
"For example, if I have a product which can be produced using a minimum amount of water, or have a species of rice which contains specific vitamins, this is a matter of survival for many people in the developing countries."
"It does not matter to us, because we can buy other products with our large amounts of money."
"What does this mean in practice? It means that the development of biotechnology, including green biotechnology, in Europe could help many other people."
"Let me clear up one misunderstanding at this point, which has also played a role in our own group."
"It has been claimed that we aim to combat hunger in the world with biotechnology."
"This is not what is said here."
"What we say is that biotechnology alone cannot defeat hunger in the world, and that other measures, such as better distribution of the food available, are far more important."
"That is what it says here."
"Let me clear up this misunderstanding from the outset."
"However, biotechnology can make its contribution to reducing hunger in the world."
"Let me conclude with one further comment: our conflict here in this House is not that we will reject the Damião report tomorrow, but that we will vote differently during the legislative process."
"This is why I call on everyone to conduct a much more far-reaching dialogue here in this House, and with the Commission, on these issues."
"Otherwise we will continue to live with this dichotomy, which we are finding so difficult to cope with."
"Indeed, Mrs Damião's report is warmly supported by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party."
"There are two points I should like to make."
"The climate in the European Union, the business climate, and also ethics and environment."
"Despite being a key technology, biotechnology is still a poor relation in Europe and also in my own country the Netherlands."
"I therefore welcome the strategy of the Committee for biotechnology and life sciences, which is contributing to research and development in Europe."
"Not only for industry, but also with regard to health care and food safety."
"This does not, however, alter the fact that the committee has been overtaken by events."
"After all, did we not, in March 2000, adopt the Purvis report whose intention was to improve the business climate in Europe?"
"Did we not also criticise the Member States over the moratorium on the import of genetically modified products?"
"There is still much to be done in Europe in terms of access to launch capital and to patent rights to create a favourable climate."
"The patent directive for biotechnological inventions is a demonstrable improvement."
"This directive from 1998, however, has simply been ignored by the majority of Member States."
"It has only been implemented by four of the 15 Member States."
"What does the Commissioner intend to do about it?"
"Another major obstacle to progress and application are the ethical and environmental concerns."
"It is of course entirely proper that we as legislators do not ignore these concerns of the consumer."
"The Commission's action plan, however, already provides for the initiation of a social debate."
"It does not therefore seem necessary to me to strengthen this report with paragraphs that regulate communication with society in detail."
"We do not, after all, have to hold the consumer's hand."
"The consumer is perfectly capable of making up his own mind if we provide the right information."
"Mr President, I should like to send my greetings to Mrs Damião in her absence and to wish her a speedy recovery."
"I disagree, however, with her report, which her colleague Carlos Lage, has presented to us: it should be noted that this report transcribes in their entirety the positions and interests of the huge biotechnology, agro-chemical and agro-industrial multinationals, as can be seen if we compare the report with the position of UNICE."
"We call for the de facto moratorium that has been in place since 1998 for the approval of new genetically modified organisms in the food chain to be maintained and we totally reject the report's support for lifting the moratorium, which we feel would be a real environmental crime."
"Apart from the profound ethical and human rights questions about the commercialisation and patenting of life and natural heritage, we must understand that releasing GMOs into the environment is an irreversible and uncontrollable factor which has direct consequences on the pollution of both conventional and organic farming, and for the destruction of biodiversity. It also has incalculable effects on ecosystems."
"What this means is that organic farmers and consumers will not actually see this much vaunted but fictional freedom of choice."
"Furthermore, it reinforces the dependency of farmers and of Member States' food policies on the multinationals."
"The degree of interference and pressure exerted on developing countries to introduce GMOs into their food chain is shocking."
"It is truly mystifying and unacceptable that, once again, the idea is being aired that food shortages and world hunger can have a technological solution when the issue - as has been stressed in many international fora and organisations - is a political one and is a matter of policy."
"We only need think back to the much-feted 'green revolution' of a few decades ago."
"We are committed to promoting the scientific and technological progress of mankind, but we must always respect the precautionary principle."
"Mr President, we increasingly see that when biotechnology is referred to, genetic technology is actually what is meant, but this is not stated clearly."
"For more than 20 years, promises have been made which have then been broken in practice."
"Genetically modified foods and agricultural products are a flop."
"The consumers do not want them."
"In the field of medicine, it is imitation products, above all, which are manufactured in a slightly modified production process so that patents can be obtained and phenomenal prices achieved, with the health insurance funds being ripped off as a result."
"I often wonder why we have been discussing these key technologies here for so many years and why these supposedly key technologies do not succeed in the marketplace."
"Where is the market, in reality?"
"Biotech companies are complete flops on the stock exchange."
"We have no products which are successful and are accepted in the market."
"We have simply been 'talking up' this genetic technology for years."
"Let me come to my real point."
"For us, it is completely unacceptable to remove the de facto moratorium, as very few of the Member States have actually implemented the directive on the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment."
"I also find what is happening here quite unacceptable."
"We have the Scheele report, and we have held a debate on the de facto moratorium."
"We also discussed the Fiori report in very wide and detailed terms, and it was made very clear that we do not want any patenting of human genes."
"The current report demands the very opposite."
"There is an obvious reluctance to accept the implementation of what has been called for, for a long time, in the other committees."
"I think this is farcical and quite unacceptable."
"I think we must recognise that we need absolute transparency for consumers, as well as safe foods."
"Then no one can claim that we are prepared to put the interests of industry ahead of consumer protection simply to push these products on to the market."
"With this in mind, I would like to state quite clearly, once again, that much of what is written here does not have our support."
"Nonetheless, I think it is quite good, and ask you to support our Amendments Nos 26 and 27, which make it clear that coexistence is very important in agriculture, and that the sustainable co-existence of conventional and organic farming should be ensured."
"The Commission calls for this as well."
"Mr President, firstly I too would like to wish Mrs Damião a speedy recovery and sincerely congratulate her for an excellent report."
"It will add to the encouragement which the biotechnology sector needs in order to realise its potential in my Scottish constituency and throughout Europe."
"The thrust of this report is fully in line with the Lisbon Summit objectives and continues the forward-looking attitude consistently demonstrated by Parliament."
"It should also serve to bolster the Commission's new-found courage as regards biotechnology and the life sciences."
"But how dreadful the contrast with the Council of Ministers who yet again this week demonstrated their abject failure to follow through on the goals they set at Lisbon."
"The grossly mistitled 'Competitiveness Council' could not reach consensus about the proper jurisdiction for Community patent disputes."
"What hope is there of achieving Europe's potential in this area when the Council is at least one year behind the deadline it set itself for agreement on this vital matter?"
"Without a cost-efficient means of patenting intellectual property rights, what incentive is there for our scientists?"
"This is only one example of the chronic foot-dragging we see endlessly in the Council and by individual Member States."
"Moratoria, legal uncertainty, backtracking and dithering over ethical guidelines, transposition delays, lack of support for those going about their legal business with field trials, elaborate red tape for labelling and traceability."
"Mrs Damião, thank you for giving us hope that there is real hope in Europe for biotechnology and the life sciences."
"Mr President, you do not have to be an implacable opponent of GMOs - and I am not - to challenge the undiluted advocacy of them in this report."
"Many Liberal Democrats will be challenging the report in the vote tomorrow."
"We want to see a reduction in the use of pesticides and herbicides."
"We want to see insects and wild plants flourish in our countryside."
"We want sustainable agriculture in developing nations."
"But we need to know that the proposed solution is not the cause of even greater problems."
"We hear claims from the manufacturers, intent as they are with stuffing their pockets with gold and making sure that farmers across the globe are locked into their supply chain."
"But where is the scientific evidence about the medium- and long-term effects of GM crops upon biodiversity?"
"Who is going to compensate organic producers whose crops become contaminated and lose their value?"
"We need answers to these questions before we open the floodgates."
"The jury is still out regarding GM crops and, given the irreversible nature of these decisions, there is no sound basis for making claims that biotechnology will be the answer to all our problems."
"EIB Annual Report (2001)"
"The next item is the report (A5-0364/2002) by Mrs van den Burg, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the European Investment Bank annual report for 2001 [2001/2256(INI)]."
"Before giving the rapporteur the floor, I would like to welcome Mr Maystadt, President of the European Investment Bank, who will speak later on."
"Madam President, let me first start with a word of welcome, also to Mr Maystadt."
"I should also like to thank the EIB for the fruitful cooperation which, in the tradition of the past three years, has developed as we have commented on your annual reports."
"I think that Parliament can be pleased with the way in which you have taken on board the suggestions from those previous reports, and I hope that this will also be the case with my report."
"In your introduction to your 2001 annual report, you described the EIB as a policy-driven public bank whose mission is to help achieve economic, social and, ultimately, political goals."
"I could not agree with you more."
"The EIB can play an important macro-economic role and underpin EU policy in key areas."
"The EIB is a public bank, accountable to the public for the policy it pursues."
"It is with these considerations in mind that I have written my report and I have emphasised a number of aspects in this respect."
"Today, I should like to single out five elements from my report."
"They are: capital increase, pension funds, labour market policy and employment policy, EU enlargement and adequate supervision of EIB policy."
"First of all, capital increase."
"In its annual meeting of 4 June, the Board of Governors decided to increase the capital by EUR 50 billion."
"Parliament welcomes this decision and believes that funding this capital increase from the bank itself is a wise decision."
"We condemn, however, the Board's refusal to agree at this stage to a further increase in the next five years."
"Parliament also applauds the decision to increase the funding of some projects in the sectors hardest hit by the economic slow-down from 50% to 70% of the total project budget."
"I should also like to draw your attention to the facility which the EIB offered during the autumn floods in Central and Eastern Europe to bolster emergency programmes to as much as 100%."
"I think that this fits in well with the image of an active bank which supports the EU's goals."
"In that way, the EIB also becomes visible to the citizens."
"I should next like to turn to the subject of pension funds."
"In my report, I enlarged upon the role of the bank as borrower on the capital markets."
"The EIB plays a major role in this area too, particularly on relatively new markets, such as in some accession countries."
"With its triple-A rating and long-term bonds in different currencies, the bank is a major protagonist and a very safe investment for pension funds, for example."
"A drawback is that EIB bonds are not always freely accessible."
"Government restrictions often apply precisely to investments made by pension funds and insurance companies."
"The EIB can play the role of icebreaker in order to promote long-term investments and, as a result, give investors more scope for riskier investments in their new economies."
"For example, the EIB could be an interesting partner for pension funds."
"This is why I tabled one more amendment before the plenary's debate on my report, and I should like to invite the bank to play an active part."
"I should also like to hear Mr Maystadt's opinion on the matter."
"My third point concerns labour market policy."
"The Amsterdam action programme has been more effective in drawing attention to projects in the social sectors."
"Since time immemorial, the majority of investments have been in the area of hard infrastructure."
"It is, however, also important to invest in social infrastructure."
"I would apply the two-pronged Lisbon objective, both economically and socially, to EIB policy."
"Like last year, Parliament calls on the EIB to assess the impact on employment of the projects and activities implemented and supported by the EIB and to enhance the internal and external expertise in this field within all the bank's different activities and directorates."
"I am interested what Mr Maystadt's intentions are in this area too."
"With regard to enlargement, we discussed the first round of the EU's enlargement in Parliament on Tuesday."
"The EIB can also do its bit by giving a high priority to activities in the accession countries and by allowing those countries to take part as fully-fledged participants."
"I have a feeling that the new Member States take too little advantage of investment opportunities."
"It seems as if they are imposing restrictions on themselves because they do not want to run up excessive debts."
"A creditable ambition which can bring them closer to monetary union, but something against which I would put question marks at this stage."
"Parliament has advised the EIB at any rate not to overlook the social dimension and to set up a special programme for the candidate countries and other partner countries, which should address the objectives of social cohesion."
"Mr Maystadt may be able to enlarge on this point too in his response."
"Finally, Parliament urges an intensified co-operation of the EIB and the EBRD on the basis of a well-considered and efficient division of tasks."
"In fact, this will be discussed in a separate report by Mr Markov in our committee and in this House in the foreseeable future."
"My final point concerns monitoring."
"The importance of transparency and of the adequate supervision of the EIB group is something that has always enjoyed Parliament's undivided attention."
"As a public investment bank, the need for adequate monitoring is obvious, but there is still room for improvement in this respect."
"This is largely due to the EIB's dual position as, on the one hand, originally a tax-funded public institution and on the other hand, a normal bank which, in the case of the EIF, which also forms part of the group, is also a venture capital fund."
"As financial institutions, they are not subject to the normal prudential supervision that is set up for other institutions at national level."
"This monitoring at national level was the subject of a report which I supported here yesterday."
"I think that this can also play a part in the case of the EIB."
"A final point concerns the recommendations tabled by the Committee on Budgetary Control and I shall leave Mr Sjöstedt to put the case for these."
"I have given almost all of them comprehensive coverage in my report."
"Madam President, President Maystadt, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the European Parliament for having once again taken the initiative of organising a debate on the work of the EIB."
"I would congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs van den Burg, on her extremely interesting and comprehensive report which emphasises the EIB's role as the Community's primary long-term financing institution for key sectors of the European Union, the candidate countries and other partner countries."
"I would briefly like to consider the following four points: collaboration between the EIB and the Commission, the EIB's work in the partner countries, the EIB's work in the candidate countries, and the Tripartite Agreement between the EIB, the Court of Auditors and the Commission."
"The first point: the EIB is a policy driven public bank."
"Its task, as President Maystadt himself pointed out, is to contribute to the achievement of the political goals of the European Union in cooperation with the Commission."
"In this respect, the Commission warmly welcomes the growing cooperation with the Bank in various priority sectors such as regional development and the environment, and also areas addressed by the 'Innovation 2000 initiative' such as research and development, the audiovisual sector and information technology."
"The Commission supports the EIB Group's consolidation of its activities concerning SMEs."
"It agrees with the European Parliament's point of view whereby the Bank should adopt the Commission's definition of SMEs."
"The Commission acknowledges Parliament's wish to evaluate the impact on SMEs of the 'Multiannual Programme 2001 - 2005 on small and medium-sized enterprises', known as the MAP."
"In this respect, the Commission intends to draw up an interim progress report on the MAP in 2003, including its impact on SMEs, as required by the Council decision on the MAP."
"Furthermore, again as required by the same decision, the Commission will submit an external assessment report to the Council and Parliament by the end of December 2004."
"The second point: the EIB has increased its financing activities in partner countries, working in close cooperation with the Commission."
"In this context, the Mediterranean Investment and Partnership Facility, launched in Barcelona last October, will constitute an important initiative to boost economic development in bordering countries in the south."
"The Commission has given substantial backing to this initiative, pledging EUR 255 million of the Community budget over the next four years."
"Moreover, the EIB, again in conjunction with the Commission, is preparing to implement the new investment fund for ACP countries laid down by the Cotonou Agreement."
"As regards the Balkans, the Commission and the Bank are currently looking into the possibility of granting the Bank a mandate to operate in Kosovo."
"The third point: with regard to the EIB's work in the candidate countries, the Commission endorses Parliament's view that absolute priority must be given to the Bank's activities in these countries."
"We believe that the funding requirements are considerable and that the EIB and the EBRD must work closely together in order to contribute to the growth of the new Member States of the European Union."
"With regard to the integration of the candidate countries into the EIB structure, the Commission is pleased to note that the Member States have, at last, reached an agreement on amendments to the Treaty with regard to the governance of the EIB and on its subscribed capital following accession."
"Once the agreement of the candidate countries has been obtained, this will enable the new Member States to be integrated into the EIB structure immediately after accession."
"Lastly, the fourth and final point: a very brief comment on the Tripartite Agreement between the EIB, the Court of Auditors and the Commission."
"The Commission feels that the basic principles of the Tripartite Agreement reflect a fair balance between the rights of the Court of Auditors and those of the EIB, and that these principles must not be altered."
"As for the Community budget, in accordance with the Tripartite Agreement, the Court has access to a wide range of information about the Bank's operations under mandate and is entitled to additional information whenever it so desires."
"The Commission warmly welcomes Parliament's initiative calling on the interested parties to review the agreement, an initiative which will doubtless constitute an opportunity to update a number of technical and administrative aspects in the light of changes which have taken place."
"Madam President, I want to say a few words about the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control regarding this report."
"My committee and I are grateful for the fact that the rapporteur and the committee responsible have chosen to take on board so many of the views we have presented."
"Thank you very much."
"The European Investment Bank has for many years been one of the EU's more anonymous powers that be."
"At the same time, the EIB has very great influence by virtue of the extensive loans both to the Member States and to the candidate countries."
"It would be sensible to have a more comprehensive political debate on the bank's approach and also more comprehensive scrutiny of the bank's activities on the part of the other EU institutions."
"The reason for the European Investment Bank's having been a fairly anonymous wielder of power in the EU is no doubt the special status of this body."
"It is a bank which, moreover, is basically owned by the Member States, at the same time as being a part of the European Union."
"We suggest, partly by means of the following proposals, that it be scrutinised more carefully."
"We wish to increase the Court of Auditors' access to information from the European Investment Bank."
"In the long run, this access to information should be similar to the access that exists to information from the European Central Bank."
"This is something that can be brought about through the tripartite agreement, which is subject to future review."
"We should like to see increased cooperation between our committee, the Committee on Budgetary Control and the European Investment Bank."
"It should, for example, be possible to welcome the chairman of the bank to our meetings."
"We should also like to acquaint ourselves with more documents concerning the European Investment Bank's internal audit."
"We should like to see the environmental dimension strengthened through the EIB's incorporating the Århus Convention and the obligations under it into its policy."
"We are concerned here with public access to environmental information."
"In a year or so, we should also like to see a progress report made on the task taken on in Gothenburg concerning impact on climate change."
"Finally, I just want to add that there is a need to evaluate the system of global loans which is at present a little too vaguely defined."
"A thorough evaluation needs to be made of the actual impact of the loans."
"Madam President, Mr Maystadt, this is the third time that Parliament has been able to give its opinion on the EIB's annual report."
"The report by Mrs van de Burg is balanced and consistent, and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has therefore adopted it unanimously."
"I would nevertheless like to make some observations."
"First of all, I should like to comment on the role of the Bank."
"The role of the EIB is important."
"The Bank is a major investor on the European market and outside, with considerable macro-economic clout."
"This macro-economic clout does not require the EIB to have its own macro-economic policy."
"The agreement is that the Bank serves the EU's goals."
"The Bank deploys its investment funds in order to strengthen the EU's macro-economic policy."
"In other words, the Bank's mission does not require it to adopt a pro-active role."
"The EIB is to promote economic and social cohesion within the EU by financially supporting the goals which the European Union has in mind."
"As a result, the EIB naturally has macro-economic influence, and, indeed a great deal of it, but this influence is not a goal in itself."
"I should now like to turn to the plan by the Group of the Party of European Socialists to include in the structure of the EIB a body to define the scope for employment and the effects on employment of EIB projects."
"Creating employment is not one of the Bank's tasks as such, but it is sometimes, of course, a side-effect."
"The Bank's task to modernise means the effect could also be the complete opposite, intensifying the eternal dilemma between productivity increase through high-grade investments and employment."
"Given this dilemma, there is no point in setting up an extensive employment barometer."
"In my view, employment is not a goal in itself as far as the Bank is concerned."
"In order to avoid unnecessary administrative costs, we have agreed to the simple registration of employment effects - or employment impact assessment, to use a fine phrase - but without any snags."
"In other words, employment impact assessment should not take on the scale of the Bank's environmental section."
"Sustainable environmental policy is one of the Bank's explicit tasks."
"We are thus opposed to a comparison of the employment barometer with the environmental section."
"We will try to prevent the comparison between the two, suggested by the word 'similar' in the amendment, by a split vote."
"We believe that the EIB funds should be used for investments and not for the system itself if this can at all be helped."
"Finally, there is the question of monitoring."
"At present, the Bank's outgoings are covered by the EU Member States."
"It also generates money itself by issuing bonds."
"In our view, the issuing of bonds to pension institutions, as proposed by the rapporteur, is unwise for the time being because there is as yet insufficient transparency within the Bank."
"We hope that the amendments we have tabled will prevent the link being made to pensions in the final report."
"We expect of the Commission that, after three years of debating the issue of monitoring, it will finally produce proposals on how better monitoring can be arranged and what the Court of Auditors' exact role might be."
"I believe in the Dutch saying: 'vertrouwen is goed, maar controle is beter' - trust is good, but control is better."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are currently considering, which I must commend for its quality, clearly emphasises the importance of the European Investment Bank as a crucial instrument for the funding of projects throughout the European Union. It also, however, highlights the decisive role that this bank plays in the economies of the candidate countries for which it proposes, as a matter of fact, to create a special social policy programme."
"For this reason, the increase in social capital recently decided on can be considered to be in line and consistent with these structural objectives, which are so important to achieving a global European economy that is prosperous and fully sustainable."
"The European Investment Bank is already responsible for more than 5% of all investments made in the Union, which has enabled more than 400 000 jobs to be created, specifically through the support that the bank gives to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"It should be remembered that the European Union has recently taken on increased responsibility for the funding of venture capital, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises, through the EIB."
"Unfortunately, as the rapporteur also points out, the work of the European Investment Bank is sometimes limited by the orthodox and rigid rules for the consolidation of public finances, which must be complied with under the growth and stability pact."
"We must remember that a large part of the EIB's remit is geared towards investments of a structural nature, such as infrastructures or venture capital for small and medium-sized enterprises, and that the success of these investments is often dependent on the possibility of mobilisation in partnership with public spending."
"The understanding that has just been reached, therefore, is not indifferent, in the framework of the current budgetary rules, to the flexibility that is crucial to the correct implementation of the growth and stability pact."
"Today it is increasingly clear that Europe has an aim which is also an undeniable need: that of becoming a highly competitive area and therefore, of creating wealth and of harmonising its distribution."
"This aim can only be achieved, however, through support for structural investments and is, consequently, unfettered by restrictions that could endanger these investments."
"The quality of expenditure, whether public or private, must be the guiding framework for investment policy and the European Investment Bank has an irreplaceable role in this framework."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on the content of her report and on having been able to interpret these aspirations."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Maystadt, I want to begin by thanking Mrs van den Burg for the sterling work she has done."
"There is also cause, I think, for sincerely commending the EIB and Mr Maystadt for the way in which the dialogue between the European Parliament and the EIB has developed in recent years."
"From having been, as Mr Sjöstedt pointed out, a fairly closed institution, the bank has since opened itself up to dialogue and the exchange of opinions."
"My first coming into contact with the EIB a number of years ago was due to the fact that independent organisations complained about the EIB's lack of transparency and its failure to appreciate the need to contribute significantly to the EU's efforts to devise a policy in favour of a sustainable environment."
"Crucial progress has been made within both these important areas."
"As we all know, nothing is so good, however, that it cannot be improved, and that applies too to access to information in several languages."
"Madam President, the rapporteur's ambition has been further to emphasise the EIB's overarching role in macro-economic and financial terms and in terms of political strategy."
"I share that approach in principle, but I would at the same time warn against we in Parliament's expressing too many wishes, legitimate enough in themselves but meaning that we cease to focus upon the EIB's main tasks, namely those of promoting regional development, supporting forward-looking technology, taking account of the environment and concentrating on the candidate countries and what are termed the partner countries."
"As you can hear, the EIB now already has more than enough on its plate."
"I would emphasise, however, that the EIB's efforts in the Balkan countries, which are part of its remit, deserve increased attention."
"Where supervision of the EIB is concerned, we would repeat our proposal that the issues be addressed at the forthcoming intergovernmental conference."
"Finally, I should like to ask Mr Maystadt how he views our desire for a panel of experts to be set up, of the type to be found within the World Bank."
"I know that there is a certain scepticism within the EIB where the view is that the EIB cannot be compared with the World Bank and that, moreover, the EU has the institution of the Ombudsman."
"What does the EIB intend to do to disseminate further knowledge concerning the global loans, that is to say the loans to small enterprises?"
"Madam President, as permanent rapporteur on loans and guarantees for the Committee on Budgets, I have only positive things to say on the whole about the EIB."
"I have, it is true, been astonished at the levels of bureaucracy that exist between the Bank, the Commission and the Council, evident from the financing of environmental protection investment in Russia's Baltic basin."
"What happened showed that the Bank is not just a financial institution but also a political playing field."
"The environment suffered as a result of the political games played by representatives of the Member States."
"The European Union guarantees a large portion of what the EIB lends and its loans in this respect do not carry any risk."
"A 3A credit rating keeps the cost of borrowing low in other forms of fund-raising on the part of the Bank."
"As the EIB has a good credit rating and the bad debt risk is low, it should adhere to stringent social and environmental criteria when granting loans."
"We have to promote aims that work for the common good."
"With that purpose in mind, the Bank must listen very attentively to the totally justified opinions of the NGO, Bankwatch Network."
"Our group backs the calls for improved monitoring of the Bank."
"Madam President, I warmly welcome this report."
"My group has submitted a small number of amendments which aim to highlight the importance of greater transparency and environmental commitment in the work of the EIB and also, in particular, to ensure that the EIB applies the highest ethical standards possible in project financing, including withdrawal from any project carried out in breach of national legislation or where corrupt enterprises are involved."
"In connection with that last point, I am sure Mr Maystadt is aware of the ongoing court case in Lesotho, where European companies are on trial for allegedly paying bribes to win contracts in the Lesotho Highlands water project, a project part-funded by the EIB."
"Since corrupt practices in the award of contracts for development projects represents a major threat to the provision of good governance, would you agree, Mr Maystadt, that it is crucial that the EIB examine its due diligence procedures, with respect not only to the Lesotho project, but also to all future projects, and will you report back to Parliament on its findings?"
"A brief question to the Commission: will the Commission honour the commitment made several years ago to provide the necessary financial support to the Lesotho Government, so as to enable it to pursue these court cases to their conclusion and thereby guarantee good governance?"
"Madam President, Commissioner Monti, President Maystadt, please allow me to congratulate the rapporteur on her calls for the EIB to attain higher targets in terms of support provided for the Member States' economies."
"This Bank performs a special task: the distribution not of all funds, but only of funds intended to contribute to the achievement of the Union's objectives."
"This institutional task has helped to create new wealth and to support entrepreneurial initiatives in the regions of the Union which are most lagging behind."
"The Bank's efforts to support certain sectors, such as the environment sector, where EUR 5.9 billion has been allocated to environmental protection projects, are certainly commendable."
"The most important aspect for territorial development is still support for SMEs."
"In this case, partner banks which also distribute funds need to provide detailed information about the investments."
"It has therefore been suggested that a credit ceiling is set in advance for SMEs and that, at the end of the financial year, a report is submitted to the European Parliament on the actual use of the pre-established ceiling and on any reasons or difficulties encountered which caused it not to be used, or only to be used in part."
"I certainly support the major undertaking of the EIB in the candidate countries, but objective 1 regions should not be forgotten: even after they no longer have this status, they should be monitored as appropriate and given substantial credit support so that they can conclude their development process - certainly not fully completed - by 2006."
"We should pay special attention to the Bank's Statute, which can only be amended in accordance with the procedure for amending and revising the Treaties laid down in Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union."
"In particular, Article 5, which provides for 6% to be paid in by the signatory Member States, should be amended."
"An increase in this percentage would lead to higher loans and, consequently, greater support for the areas concerned, and greater profitability for the Bank or, alternatively, with the same amount of revenue, a reduction in the applicable rates."
"Mr President, I should like firstly to commend the rapporteur, and also Mr Sjöstedt for his opinion on this report."
"I have had the satisfaction of working on EIB matters for many years, and I often say that it is more difficult getting into the EIB than into Fort Knox."
"It is still a hard fight to obtain greater transparency and supervision where the EIB is concerned."
"The bank is still very unwilling to open its accounts and projects up to external supervision."
"It is almost impossible for the Court of Auditors to obtain access to documents."
"The bank always refers to banking secrecy or to the fact that the money does not come from the EU budget but from its own resources."
"In March 1999, the EIB, the Commission and the Court of Auditors signed an agreement concerning the Court of Auditors' being able to supervise the EIB, but I firmly believe that the agreement must be altered so that it gives the Court of Auditors the same right to supervise the EIB as it has to supervise the ECB."
"I am extremely pleased, moreover, that Parliament is now making this demand."
"Why should the EIB have special status?"
"That is something I absolutely cannot accept."
"I would compare the EIB with the goblins' bank in the Harry Potter books, namely a totally closed institution in which no one must interfere."
"Madam President, allow me first of all to tell you how much I appreciate having this opportunity to continue the dialogue with the European Parliament, in particular at a time when this House is opening up to members of parliament from States that are soon to join the European Union."
"Two weeks ago in Vienna, speaking before the annual European Investment Bank Forum, President Cox recalled the historical importance of enlargement and emphasised, with particular eloquence, that this move is the essential extension of the work towards peace and stability commenced by the founders of European integration."
"For its own, modest, part, the European Investment Bank, which was created by the Treaty of Rome for the purpose of providing financial support for the political objectives of the European Community, is trying to contribute to successful enlargement."
"The European Investment Bank, which already has a portfolio of loans of around EUR 18 billion in this region, making it by far the main backer, will, of course, continue to back the necessary investments in the future Member States."
"Three areas in particular are targeted: infrastructures, with particular regard to transport, energy and telecommunications; the environment, because tremendous investment is needed in order to achieve compliance with Community standards; and, lastly, direct foreign investment, because it is a particularly powerful tool in bringing conditions in the candidate countries into line with those in the current Member States."
"The preparation of the candidate countries for accession is therefore one of five priority axes adopted by the Council of Governors of the EIB last June, when it agreed to a 50% capital increase for the European Investment Bank."
"I shall briefly mention the other four priority axes."
"First of all, regional development, with a view to devoting 70% of our direct loans and at least 50% of our global loans to projects based in regions eligible for assistance under the Structural Funds."
"Then what we call the i2i (Initiative innovation 2000) programme, which was implemented following the Lisbon European Council and which aims to encourage investments that contribute to transforming the European economy into an economy based on knowledge and innovation."
"Over EUR 13 billion of loans have already been approved within the context of this initiative."
"Another priority axis is environmental protection and improvement, with the objective of devoting between one quarter and one third of our total loans each year to environmental projects."
"The fifth and final priority axis is our support for the European development aid policy, in particular with the launch of two new facilities: the Euro-Mediterranean Facility, which was established by the Barcelona European Council, and the new Investment Facility created by the Cotonou agreement between the European Union and the ACP countries."
"Having thus briefly summarised the five priority axes for the coming years, I would now like to try to respond to the various speakers. I confirm that I will be available to give fuller, more precise answers at committee meetings."
"I would like first of all to respond to your rapporteur, Mrs van den Burg, who has put a great deal of effort into preparing this excellent report."
"I would like briefly to raise a subject close to her heart: the use of EIB bonds by pension funds."
"In the United Kingdom, pension funds have already invested in long-term EIB bonds."
"We have not yet had the same success on the euro market, but we are trying to find formulas that might be of greater interest to pension funds and insurance companies."
"Employment, which many of you have continued to focus on, clearly constitutes a final objective."
"I believe, however, that it would be dangerous to make the number of jobs created directly by a project the deciding factor in the decision on whether to finance the project."
"In this regard, I share some of the reservations expressed by Mrs Peijs."
"We consider that our project must have a positive impact on the economy, through the innovation-productivity-growth-employment chain, but that it would be dangerous to establish too direct a link between the number of jobs created and the choice of a particular project."
"With regard to the financing of SMEs, I would remind you that we finance small and medium-sized enterprises in two ways: on the one hand, through global loans, as half of our global loans go to small enterprises, and, on the other, through the provision of risk capital from the European Investment Fund."
"I would say to the Commission, in response to the comment by Commissioner Monti echoing one of the report's recommendations, that, in fact, we plan to adopt the Commission's definition of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"We must, however, first solve one problem, which is that of medium-sized enterprises."
"The latter are in danger of being considered too large to receive global loans but too small to benefit from direct loans."
"When we have found the appropriate method for medium-sized enterprises, we will in effect be able to adopt the Commission's definition."
"With regard to the important matter of monitoring the European Investment Bank, I would say that, naturally, we are entirely open to monitoring by the Court of Auditors within the scope of its competence."
"Mr Blak, I can assure you that the Court of Auditors has access to all the documents it wishes to obtain within the context of the tripartite agreement concluded between the Commission, the Court of Auditors and the European Investment Bank."
"This agreement operates to the satisfaction of all three parties."
"The President of the Court of Auditors confirmed this to me and you have just heard Commissioner Monti say that the Commission, too, is satisfied with this agreement, which will be renegotiated and renewed."
"In this regard, there is therefore no problem."
"The Court of Auditors has the power to monitor the use of Community funds and, insofar as the EIB uses Community funds, the Court of Auditors must clearly be fully able to exercise its monitoring powers."
"There is also, however, the sector of EIB activities which have nothing to do with Community funds and are financed by our earnings from financial markets all over the world."
"These activities, naturally, also need monitoring."
"Moreover, it is in our interests to be monitored effectively, and we are already monitored by a verification committee and external auditors who report directly to the governors."
"That said, I think it would be desirable to find a form of supervision that is appropriate for a bank."
"I have already said this before the House, and I confirm it today."
"We are entirely open to the idea, and even keen to be subject to a form of banking supervision."
"Furthermore, that is why we are following with great interest the discussions taking place on the possible creation of a European banking supervisor."
"Mrs Lucas raised some interesting points, but I have already exceeded my speaking time."
"I will be able to give her more information in committee, in particular with regard to the Lesotho project she mentioned."
"I can simply confirm that, as soon as we became aware of signs of possible fraud, we ordered a detailed audit and communicated the information assembled during this audit to both Olaf, the monitoring body with which you are familiar, and to the Lesotho legal institutions."
"We did not uncover any fraud with regard to the use of EIB funds, but our enquiry at that time enabled us to discover other factors which we communicated to the competent authorities."
"I shall be able to say more about this in committee."
"Madam President, I hope that the House has found my response informative and that it has given you an idea of the way in which we and all the Bank's staff view our responsibilities and intend to put them into practice over the coming years, in close cooperation with the Commission and maintaining dialogue with Parliament."
"Mr President, thank you for coming here today and for the information you have kindly shared with us."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"report (A5-0352/2002) by Mr Lipietz, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission's XXXIst Report on Competition Policy 2001 [SEC(2002)0462 - C5-0282/2002 - 2002/2142(COS)]"
"report (A5-0353/2002) by Mr Herzog, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the 2001 scoreboard for state aid (spring 2002 update) [2001/2196(INI)]."
"Madam President, in the short time available, there being two reports to be discussed, I will try to consider a number of different issues."
"First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Herzog and Mr Lipietz, for their excellent reports."
"Once again, they both reflect Parliament's overall support for European competition policy, support which is so important for the Commission and its departments."
"Allow me to set out the main features of our competition policy in the state aid sector."
"The Commission has continued its efforts in this sector in order to simplify, modernise and clarify the rules and practices."
"New regulations and Community guidelines have been drawn up."
"For example, at the start of this year, new multisectoral regulations were adopted setting out a much clearer body of rules for the assessment of regional state aid for major investment projects."
"Another important example is the use of block exemptions, which allow Member States to grant aid without the need for prior notification."
"Block exemptions for small- and medium-sized enterprises and for training have been adopted and, recently, an exemption for state aid for employment too."
"With regard to the reduction and adjustment of state aid, the Member States undertook to reduce the level of aid in the Conclusions of the Stockholm and Barcelona European Councils."
"In effect, we have seen a clear downward trend, but undeniably, the cumulative effect of aid totalling EUR 82 billion is continuing to substantially distort competition in the Union."
"I will now, if I may, respond to some of the points raised in Mr Herzog's report."
"I firmly believe that the best way to promote overall Community industrial competitiveness is precisely to maintain a firm policy on state aid. state aid policy is criticised at times, in that it is said to be at variance with measures seeking to attain certain Community objectives."
"In my view, this variance is, in the majority of cases, more imagined than real."
"The aim of state aid control is to ensure that the positive effects of one particular measure are not counteracted by the distortion in competition which the measure itself creates."
"I also endorse the view, expounded in the report, that we need to focus more on assessing the effectiveness and efficacy of aid."
"This is one aspect of the aid policy for which the Member States are chiefly responsible."
"They must develop ways to assess aid schemes, whereas the Commission, for its part, intends to help this process by providing a forum where experiences can be shared."
"As regards competition law, our activities have been characterised by our debate on the Commission proposal to update its procedural rules."
"Work being carried out by the Council regarding the Commission proposal - a proposal fully supported by Parliament, which once again, I would thank - is now nearing completion."
"It is expected that the Council will agree on the text of a new regulation next week."
"I am sure that we will also see considerable improvements in our procedures with regard to the aspect which Parliament emphasised most in its resolution, that is the fact that European competition rules should be applied in all cases where trade between Member States could be affected."
"Updating Regulation 17, ladies and gentlemen, is an example of the permanent culture of reform which the Commission is seeking to encourage within the institution and which - as we shall soon see - also applies to mergers."
"I would like to point out, moreover, that as regards updating competition rules, it was the Commission, three years ago, which took the initiative."
"You will also recall that it was not all that easy, at the start, to persuade the Member States that it would be in the interest of better European governance to have more decentralisation in this respect."
"As regards mergers, the number and complexity of cases which reach second phase investigations has increased rapidly."
"In 2001, the Commission issued five prohibition decisions."
"Even though this is the highest number of prohibition decisions issued in a single year, this figure continues to represent only around 1.5% of all final decisions."
"In this connection, it probably will not have escaped your attention that, in October, the Court of First Instance overturned two of these prohibition decisions, in the Schneider/Legrand and Tetra Laval/Sidel cases, and there was also the judgment in the Airtours/First Choice case, already referred to in your report."
"A detailed discussion on the consequences of these judgments for the Commission's work would take more time than we have today."
"I would, however, like to make a few comments."
"We are carefully considering the judgments, both in order to decide whether to appeal to the Court of Justice, and in order to take appropriate action for the future."
"Nevertheless, we should not allow these specific, individual cases to distort our view of the Community merger control policy."
"As you know, we initiated a vast reform of merger control procedures a long time before these recent rulings."
"If necessary, it may be appropriate to take advantage of the lessons we have learnt from these judgments in order to put into effect an even more radical reform than that originally planned: this is precisely my intention, as I have already said."
"Regardless of whether or not we appeal to the Court of Justice, it is right and proper that the Commission learns as many lessons as possible from certain assessments which have been made and, accordingly, the reform will be even more far-reaching and sweeping."
"I am, however, keen to specify, quite clearly, that the improvements which we expect to see in the instrument will in no way mean a more lenient policy."
"We believe that merger control policy - just like competition policy in general - must be fair but, at the same time, strict."
"I intend to propose to the College a sweeping reform of the merger control system by the end of December, and I would like to briefly highlight some of its aspects now."
"The first point concerns the length of investigations."
"A major advantage of the European system is the short investigation times, as is widely acknowledged."
"Nevertheless, these short time frames also create some drawbacks which translate, as it were, into a certain tension, at times quite charged, in the final dealings between the parties and the Commission."
"Therefore, we will not relinquish the benefits derived from these short investigations - which exist in Europe but not in the United States - but we will also propose the introduction of a certain amount of flexibility through a series of provisions to extend certain deadlines."
"The other improvements to the decision-making process which I plan to propose include: the formalisation and extension of the existing system of cross-checks in all cases which reach second phase investigations; greater transparency, allowing access to the dossier and dialogue between opposing market views at an earlier stage than is currently the case; more human resources in the Competition Directorate-General, both in order to work in a more appropriate fashion with regard to the high standards set by the Court and to improve our economic analysis capabilities."
"I would also like to touch briefly on judicial control in the event of company mergers, which I am aware is of great interest to the European Parliament in general and to Mrs Riis-Jørgensen in particular."
"Recent judgments have shown that the European courts exert strict, meticulous control over the Commission's analyses in merger cases."
"Judicial control, which exists and is strict, should not, however, only be effective in terms of thoroughness, but also in terms of speed."
"In this respect, there is still substantial room for improvement, in terms of the speed with which judgments are issued."
"A fast track system has already been introduced, and we sincerely hope that the Court of First Instance will be able to deal more swiftly with and increase the number of fast track cases."
"The Commission is willing - as we have already stated - firmly to support the granting of further resources which the Court will certainly need to implement these improvements."
"Furthermore, it may be helpful to consider whether it would be appropriate to have judicial panels of experts handling certain categories of cases at first instance or a unit specialised in mergers at the Court of First Instance."
"Whatever kind of reform is considered in order to achieve a successful system, it is, in any case, important not to lose sight of the many merits of our administrative system."
"I must say that, following the publication of the Commission Green Paper, there were very few calls to abandon or make radical changes to the current system."
"If forced to choose between our system and the US system, many businesses - several of which are American - have indicated a preference for the European Union's system during consultations."
"Moreover, as you know, systems grounded on administrative decisions in this field are certainly not exclusive to the Commission."
"Indeed, this is the model used at national level, in the majority of Member States, and it reflects European legal traditions."
"My proposals will therefore significantly improve the current system: in some fundamental aspects, they will completely transform the present system."
"My ambition is that what we propose will be the most modern and effective merger control system, and it will improve the European model by incorporating certain aspects of the US model."
"As time is short, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will not expand on other important points addressed in the two reports by Mr Lipietz and Mr Herzog."
"In particular, I am unable to consider one point which I know, however, to be of great interest to the Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mrs Randzio-Plath, and that is international cooperation, an area in which considerable progress has been made over the last year."
"Madam President, Commissioner, please excuse the absence of my colleague Mr Lipietz, who has had to stay in Paris this week because a loved one is very ill."
"Our committee was not, in actual fact, unanimous on the report I am about to present to you on his behalf, in contrast with its unanimity on the report on the European Investment Bank."
"That is why around 40 amendments, including, moreover, a dozen or so tabled by my own group, have been tabled for discussion in plenary."
"Despite the differences of opinion that are quite traditional within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on this type of report, I shall emphasise the points on which we agree, first of all highlighting our warm support for the work carried out by Commissioner Monti and his staff."
"Everyone in our committee is in favour of a well-organised European competition policy and the Commission's report for 2001 bears witness to the efforts that you and your staff have made."
"International action, to which you have just referred, does not present any more of a problem."
"We are in favour of establishing global rules."
"The report therefore emphasises the need to strengthen international cooperation in the field of competition."
"The majority, if not all of our colleagues are opposed to renationalising competition policy, and this is a strong political message."
"You have just referred to the recent judgments of the European Court of Justice."
"Paragraphs 4 and 5 of our report clearly state: 'the European Parliament does not consider the recent judgment of the Court of Justice (?) as disqualifying the work of the Commission'."
"The issue we should be raising instead is the reorganisation of the Court of Justice."
"You mentioned various alternatives."
"The report describes the creation of a new legal chamber."
"I do not know what your opinion is on the problem of state aid, which is the subject of the report by Mr Herzog."
"If I understand correctly, next year we shall have a single report on competition policy and state aid policy."
"I am delighted to hear it."
"Another point of agreement of great political importance concerns the fact that state aid should, as laid down by the Treaty, focus on horizontal objectives."
"In committee, the disagreements tended to concern the way in which the objectives were defined and implemented."
"We have already discussed this with you at length."
"A great deal of progress remains to be made."
"I have just learnt of the conclusions of the Competition Council in this regard."
"We must work towards making the various actions of the Commission compatible and coherent with European policies."
"In this context, the opportunity for recourse to state aid in order to achieve these horizontal objectives should be reiterated."
"There is one last point of agreement between Members: we need to strengthen the legislative role of the European Parliament in all aspects of competition policy."
"The report specifically calls - this work is naturally the responsibility of the Commission - for Parliament to have the right of codecision with regard to legislative procedures concerning competition."
"Two points have caused a great deal of controversy and a number of amendments concerning them have been tabled in plenary."
"The first concerns our stance with regard to the candidate countries."
"There is a consensus within the committee that competition rules should be considered to apply without discrimination to all the Member States."
"The effective implementation of competition policy, however, has led to debate."
"Although we must be strict in combating corruption - and the Commission's reports emphasise how serious these problems still are in many of the candidate countries - some of us would like to see a degree of flexibility in the assessment of this state aid, along the lines of the attitude of the European Union during German reunification, when it seems that we adopted a particular attitude towards the new, reunified Länder."
"The last point of agreement between committee members is their favourable view of the liberalisation of several economic sectors."
"Some consider that the processes underway are generally balanced and satisfactory, while others believe that these liberalisation processes do not comply with all the objectives of the European Union."
"Madam President, in order to avoid having to speak again, I would like very briefly, on behalf of my group, to highlight the importance we give to a number of amendments we have tabled on our assessment of the examination of state aid in the candidate countries."
"Then there are our Amendments Nos 19 and 22 on services of general interest, both at international level - WTO negotiations - and national level."
"Lastly, Commissioner, I would like to hear from you."
"As you know, the Convention has already received a number of contributions on the subject of services of general interest."
"Others will follow and I believe it would be appropriate politically for the Commission, also, to communicate to the Convention a contribution on the way in which it envisages the relationship between competition policy and services of general interest."
"Mr President, I would like to thank all my colleagues who have supported me and in particular those who share the view of this report, which I believe to be balanced and concerned with real situations."
"I note that the amendments tabled by Mr Evans and Mrs Riis-Jørgensen ruin that balance and in fact condemn any state aid in market activities."
"I therefore hope that these amendments will not be retained and that the balance achieved in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will be preserved in plenary."
"I worked together with the Directorate General for Competition, which very carefully manages state aid policy, and I am very pleased with how the dialogue progressed."
"Like any competition policy, the policy on state aid is facing new challenges."
"Its prime objective remains to reduce all aid that distorts or could distort competition, but other objectives should also be taken into consideration: competitiveness and growth - the Lisbon objectives - and social cohesion, which involves support for struggling regions to catch up and develop."
"This is why the Stockholm and Lisbon European Councils made the commitment not to reduce all aid, but aid in the sense of Article 87, in other words aid that creates unfair competition."
"They particularly advocate redeploying aid towards the horizontal objectives."
"All of these Council decisions must be implemented firmly, but with discernment."
"I stress in my report that the effectiveness of horizontal aid must be evaluated."
"For example, the legitimacy of aid for research, the environment, training and employment is clear, and increases in this aid are often desired."
"However, it is not always effective in terms of the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives, and we should therefore move forward with our recommendations."
"It would be dangerous to ban any notion of sectoral aid, however."
"This aid could prove to be essential for strategic projects on which Europe is falling behind and the market is declining, but also for dealing with unfair competition on the global market, or to save production operations that are faced with very serious economic shocks."
"We are aware that the Commission has also itself opened the debate on the interaction of competition and industrial policy."
"The enlargement of the Union to the Central and Eastern European countries also poses difficult problems which must be dealt with fairly."
"If the private sector will not fund the modernisation of the steel industry in Poland and the Czech Republic, in a global context of excess capacity, should we nevertheless ask those countries to give up developing that sector?"
"A re-examination of steel aid is essential."
"In the same way, while it is legitimate to aim to eliminate special tax arrangements and convert them into regional aid, it should not be forgotten that countries such as Ireland benefited a great deal from them until recently and that as the economic level of the Eastern regions concerned is particularly low, it will not be possible to create viable companies straight away."
"Regarding services of general interest, a perspective of progress is emerging."
"The Council and the Commission are re-assessing their interest for the Community."
"In accordance with the wishes of Parliament, the Court of Justice recognises that financial compensation, in return for the obligations imposed, is not aid."
"We therefore want the Commission to speed up its discussions on this basis and to propose new tools soon in order to ensure free choice, resources for services of general interest, and competition, as well as to safeguard non profit-making activities."
"Finally, we ask it to speed up the work on considering tax systems, described by the Primarolo group as encouraging unfair competition, in terms of state aid that should be eliminated."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the scoreboard is a step forward in achieving transparency and in the public debate, and we welcome this."
"However, the Commission is aware of the limits that we have highlighted."
"The comparability of data between Member States is not guaranteed, the effectiveness of aid has not been evaluated and a comparison between the Union and its major world competitors has not yet been provided."
"These are also areas to work on in the future, and in view of which, it would be desirable to increase the involvement of civil society."
"Allow me to add a few words on competition policy as a whole."
"Competition is essential for the viability and efficiency of the internal market."
"However, the European Union has a great deal of progress to make in terms of industrial and technological development."
"We should not move backwards in terms of competition policy, but we need to bring industrial and competition policies to the same level in the treaties and in practice, otherwise the Union will fall behind in terms of innovation, scale effects, networks and creation of companies."
"Experts already believe that its potential for growth in terms of production and productivity has slowed down, while we wish to speed it up."
"The process of mergers is only one aspect of the problem."
"We are aware that the general centralisation of powers within the DG poses a problem, but we do not want to swing towards the American model."
"In the reform under preparation, we would prefer a much more open, deliberative instruction procedure, which allows for reasonable timescales, while the decision would still be the responsibility of the Commission."
"Mr President, thanks are due to the Commissioner for the competition report, but congratulations also go to both rapporteurs for presenting us with their analysis of the issue."
"The competition report is based solely on the accountability of the Commission."
"This means that our comments carry about as much weight in the Commission as Economic and Social Committee opinions, and no more; we must be clear about this."
"This is not to say, however, that the Commission, which has been given considerable competence here, wishes to restrict its rights in the field of competition."
"Allow me to make a number of critical comments about the further development of competition policy per se."
"Progressive globalisation, the fact that the European economy is characterised by mergers, and an ever tougher competition policy have consequences for the situation on the ground in that they bring changes for the labour market."
"This does not mean that I wish to bring this process to a halt;"
"I want to put to you the view of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which is that the employment guidelines are no longer sufficient on their own to compensate for the labour market problems arising from increased competitive pressure combined with today's weak growth."
"I know that we should not, indeed we must not, pin excessive blame for current problems on competition policy;"
"I am clear about that."
"But what I wish to say is that the possible extension of competition rules to services of general interest would appear to me to be problematic."
"It is not for the Commission to define these on its own; it must be done by politicians in general."
"Competition policy is undoubtedly of value in itself, but must be reconciled with socially important areas of general interest, and this is even more important as the European Union prepares for enlargement."
"I hope that you will have sympathy for this view, Commissioner."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I should like to make a few comments, which are mainly procedural in nature."
"We welcome the abolition of the notification requirement for competition agreements."
"I think this is a positive development that will reduce the administrative burden on companies and the authorities."
"We would, however, urge the Commission to fulfil a justified desire on the part of companies to obtain more legal certainty, particularly in complex matters."
"We would ask the Commission to investigate whether it would be possible at all in exceptional cases, involving large investments, to make general statements about the compatibility of agreements with European competition rules, as is common in America with the Business Review Letter."
"The modernisation of competition policy can only succeed if the competition rules are applied in a uniform and consistent manner across the EU."
"What we need is a European appeal option against decisions taken by national competition authorities."
"We would ask the Commission to take the necessary steps in this direction."
"As Mrs Peijs said a moment ago: trust is good, but control is better in cases like these."
"Thirdly, the network of national competition authorities requires a clear and transparent statute."
"At the moment, it is still unclear how cooperation goes on, and there is no real statute for it."
"Such a statute should clearly set out how the Commission and national competition authorities should relate to each other and how mutual cooperation takes place, particularly, for example, in the exchange of confidential information."
"I think that very sound and clear agreements are needed in this respect and I also believe that the candidate countries should be involved in this."
"Finally, we take the view that it would benefit the democratic legitimacy of economic competition legislation if Parliament, too, were to be given codecision rights in this area."
"Mr President, the control of state aids is one of the three pillars of competition policy."
"Many of these aids concern industry, the energy sector, the transport sector or agriculture, which is why the Committee on Industry has issued an opinion on the Herzog report."
"In this opinion, which was adopted by a large majority, we firstly welcomed the State Aid Scoreboard, which provides greater transparency and openness and gives a clearer overview of the situation."
"Secondly, in conjunction with this, we adopted a series of demands in the Committee on Industry, which are addressed to the Commission."
"Firstly, we welcome the objective of continuously reducing overall aid allocations."
"Secondly, we say that future scoreboards should include subsidies in the accession countries."
"Our third demand - and this is an old request - is for the thresholds applied to the 'de minimis' rule to be raised."
"In the future we want the smaller cases to be exempted so that local decision-makers have more room for manoeuvre."
"In addition, we want the special tax arrangements to be subjected to more intensive scrutiny and to be included in this Scoreboard."
"Finally, in particular where services of general interest are concerned - other Members have already commented on this - we want the Commission to at last get round to doing its job, as it has been saying it will for so long."
"We know that a Green Paper on the provision of services of general interest is currently being prepared."
"We hope, Commissioner, that this Green Paper, which is of course being drafted primarily under the authority of the Commission President, will encompass all aspects of services of general interest."
"We do not think that in general these services should be exempt from the competition rules, as has just been said, but that where the picture is unclear, clarity can be achieved."
"Our final point in the Committee on Industry is a long-standing demand on the part of Parliament."
"It concerns the regulations on which you have just reported, Commissioner, and which will entail an update of Regulation No 17."
"We want these regulations - including the forthcoming rules on services of general interest - to be classified as internal market legislation and to be subject to the codecision procedure."
"I know that this is not in your interests, but it is in ours."
"Nevertheless, we hope for your understanding on at least some of these points."
"Mr President, I am speaking today on behalf of Mr Evans, who is the shadow rapporteur for the PPE-DE Group."
"He very much regrets that he cannot be here today."
"We have presented some amendments to these reports, with the general aim that they should provide more encouragement for free trade."
"In the last few years, the European Union has rightly focused on the need for greater competition and consumer choice and has often used its powers to great and beneficial effect."
"Increased free trade and the reduction of unfair subsidies have been a most positive result."
"Just as policies of this kind produced handsome rewards for businesses and consumers when my country, under a Conservative government, rediscovered and pioneered these practices in the 1980s, they are now doing the same in the rest of the European Union."
"Encouraging greater competition is an enormous task."
"For the first three decades after the Second World War, state aid and protectionism were less controversial."
"It is still difficult to combat these traditional ideas and entrenched interests, especially in a climate where the opponents of free trade often have the catchier slogans."
"We are most fortunate that we have, in Commissioner Monti, someone who is convinced that the opening of markets and the freeing of trade is in everyone's interest."
"We are most grateful to him for his persistent and hard work in combating anything, be it cartels or subsidies, that impedes the operation of a fair market."
"The report by Mr Herzog concerns the newly-introduced scoreboard for state aid."
"This is a most useful tool."
"We fully support its introduction and are anxious that it should be used enthusiastically."
"It is most encouraging to note that it points to a decline in state aid, although we would like to see a further decrease."
"The disparities between countries show that some Member States provide up to three times as much state aid as others."
"It is our hope that the scoreboard will serve as an encouragement to Member States to continue and accelerate their reforms and that the scoreboard will also assist the reforms of the new Member States after their accession in 2004."
"Mr Lipietz's report focuses on general competition policy and we are pleased to see that it reflects many of our concerns."
"In particular, the report highlights the lack of progress in the liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets and urges action in the opening up of European markets in energy, transport and postal services."
"The report rightly congratulates Commissioner Monti and his staff on their approach."
"We in this Parliament should urge him further along the path he has chosen to take."
"I would like to conclude by commending the continuation of the European Union's policies in these areas to Parliament."
"I hope Parliament will support our amendments and I look forward to even greater progress in the years to come."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Monti, on the subject of the report concerning the scoreboard, I wish, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, to say that we are not satisfied with the outcome of the vote in the committee and have therefore, together with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, tabled a number of amendments."
"On condition that these amendments are adopted, we shall vote in favour of the report."
"I would also thank the Commission for the work done on the scoreboard, which is a very useful tool for achieving the objective of a general reduction in state aid."
"I welcome the report on the Commission's 31st report on competition policy."
"I am especially pleased with the support given by the committee to my proposal that consideration should be given to setting up a competition court, Article 225 A of the Treaty of Nice having paved the way for such a possibility. A competition court would increase the legal protection of European enterprises."
"A competition court would have to operate as a counterweight to, and supervisor of, the Commission's experts on issues relating to competition policy."
"It would ensure that the Commission was no longer viewed as the body that both investigates and judges enterprises. It would make for greater transparency of the enterprises concerned."
"I absolutely do not want to see a weakening of competition policy in general."
"On the contrary. Nor do I want to see the Competition Directorate-General's role in competition policy weakened."
"I want to support Commissioner Monti and all the other forces for good in their view that, in the future too, competition policy should remain precisely that, with no interference from other policy areas, such as industrial policy."
"I am delighted that Mr Monti is well disposed towards a European competition court."
"I would also take the liberty of looking forward and commenting on the Commission's motion for a resolution for reforming EU competition law."
"Throughout the reform process, the ELDR Group has supported the Commission in stating that reform is necessary."
"At the same time, we have maintained that this must not lead to a renationalisation of competition policy."
"The Commission has assured us that this will not happen and has referred to a network's being set up, consisting of the Competition Directorate-General and the national competition authorities."
"I am confident that this network would be effective. At the same time, I would, however, put forward a proposal that I hope the Commission will consider."
"It is about creating a special unit or task force in the Competition Directorate-General whose task it will be to ensure, and monitor the fact, that the competition rules are applied equally in all the Member States."
"This is a large and important task that will become still greater with the forthcoming enlargement."
"I shall go into this in more detail in a letter to the Commissioner."
"Mr President, Commissioner, now that the internal market is complete, our regions are obviously operating in a more competitive environment."
"That is why it is necessary constantly to improve European rules in this field."
"Since, however, the European Union does not exist in isolation from world trade, a competition system is also needed in the WTO context."
"If we are to take seriously the task that we set ourselves at the Gothenburg Summit, following on from the Lisbon Summit, then competition policy must not only be limited to economic conditions, but must also take into account social and environmental factors."
"An economy cannot be competitive if it does not have a highly skilled workforce at its disposal, if wages and salaries are so low that competition does not bolster domestic demand but chokes it, and if manufactured products carry no guarantee that they are not harmful to public health."
"That is why we need a change of thinking here, to transform the internal battle for subsidised locational advantages into a debate about how we can make the way people live more sustainable."
"Competition policy must champion the concept of equal opportunities."
"It will not, however, be possible to achieve equality of opportunity if technical standards are insufficiently harmonised, if Member States' tax policies differ so greatly that it is impossible to compare the actual cost burdens, and if social standards in the Member States diverge widely."
"I do not oppose state aid;"
"I support it, provided that these aids have a binding legal basis that is the same for everybody and provided that they do not help to perpetuate the use of old, environmentally damaging techniques and technologies but instead promote investment for the future."
"In short - and this brings me back to where I started - competition policy is about creating an equilateral triangle around economic policy, social policy and the environment."
"Mr President, the report by our colleague Mr Herzog is excellent, and the amendments tabled by our group only add to it."
"However, the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party really destroy it, in that they delete at least ten articles and paragraphs from it."
"I am therefore surprised, as in a way it is the whole human aspect of this report that is deleted by those amendments."
"You are aware that the Treaty establishes that aid provided by Germany to regions of East Germany is in line with the single market."
"Our colleague quite rightly states that this aid could be allocated to regions of the candidate countries."
"But there is just deletion and more deletion, and given the extent to which the PPE-DE declared its support for the social market economy in Estoril, I must admit that I do not understand."
"Mr President, in sport, an opponent is needed in order to win."
"Football is such a sport, which can only exist by virtue of there being an opponent present."
"In a fair game, an opponent should have the same means available as the other party."
"This is, after all, about fair competition in which a battle can be fought for first place, but also for honour."
"In professional football we have noticed, in the Netherlands for example, how a Commission measure on state aid triggers reactions."
"For example, I gleaned from a Dutch newspaper this week that our Socialist fellow MEP, Mr Max van den Berg, would like to exempt professional football clubs from European rules on state aid."
"However, in my view, this reaction overshoots the commercial goals pursued by professional clubs."
"Unlike Mr van den Berg, I would therefore express my support for the measures which the European Commission has taken to reverse, if possible, the aid granted to professional football."
"In my opinion, the granting of state aid is, and continues to be, a measure which is explicitly temporary in nature."
"If aid is granted for a longer period of time, then competitiveness becomes distorted."
"An aid-based relationship of dependence between industry and government is an interference in the functioning of the market."
"I would also at the same time acknowledge the positive effect state aid has."
"After all, if thanks to a temporary measure, socially useful goals are achieved, temporary aid is quite justified."
"This is to give companies an incentive to achieve such goals."
"I should at this point like to draw your attention to the importance of granting aid in order to implement environmental legislation."
"It is a fact that industry is hit by high costs as a result of a plethora of new measures."
"If, as a result of environmental measures, Europe's competitiveness were to suffer compared to non-EU countries, I would deem it justified for costs to be borne by society to a limited extent and subject to clear conditions."
"With regard to the accession of the candidate countries, a new chapter should be added to competition policy and the question of state aid."
"A number of candidate countries provide foreign investors with favourable fiscal conditions."
"This is with a view to protecting local employment."
"Paragraphs 17 and 18 of Mr Herzog's report expressly refer to the issue of aid to the steel industry in different accession countries."
"In this connection, I am of the view that Amendment No 16 concerns a change that leaves no room for doubt."
"I would call for the unambiguous and fair treatment of the candidate countries with regard to state aid and competition."
"I therefore endorse Amendments Nos 20 and 21 to the Lipietz report which clearly state that the accession countries are faced with problems that are different from those of the current Member States."
"However understandable state aid is from the standpoint of the candidate countries, this is, and always will be, a form of state aid that does not fit within the rules on state aid and competition."
"A clearly defined exemption position gives the new Member States the scope to improve healthy economic relations."
"I should like to conclude with a question to Commissioner Monti."
"Over the past couple of years, it has become clear that the accession countries have an economic structure that is different from that of the EU Member States."
"This structure and mentality change less quickly than we would like them to, so the accession countries require an approach customised to the needs of each of them."
"Application of the rules in full is a measure that does not do any justice to the development of a social market economy in the accession countries."
"How do you propose to find a fair solution to the problem of state aid in the accession countries?"
"Mr President, the Treaty establishing the European Community does not prohibit dominant positions, only the abuse of them."
"It does not establish a system of prior approval for mergers."
"Therefore the creation of a dominant position following a merger does not have to be negotiated in advance with the Commission and such a dominant position is not in itself contrary to the Treaty."
"Once again the Commission, in order to maintain its importance, has taken on powers that it does not have, inventing entirely arbitrary, or worse, ridiculous criteria to serve its cause. An example of this is when it analyses market shares country by country and product by product, while taking advantage of the frivolity or even absence of the French authorities when it comes to safeguarding French industrial interests."
"Meanwhile, while the Treaty establishing the European Community in no way forbids the development of state companies, the Commission in Brussels hounds French public companies as symbols, which in its eyes are intolerable, of triumphant Colbert-style state intervention."
"In this respect, any attempt at forcing the French Government to privatise public sector companies will provoke a vigorous response from all employees or, and why not, a general strike across all sectors of industry."
"It is not only the services of the Directorate General for Competition that need to be reformed, but also Commissioner Monti, who knows nothing about industry, who should be disowned, and the Commission in Brussels needs to be put back in its place."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you can see we have before us a whole host of topical matters and decisions related to competition policy."
"Given the short time available to me, I will have to confine myself to state aid policy and therefore to Mr Herzog's report, which we Social-Democrats fully support."
"Allow me first to make a comment, Commissioner: do not be too disconcerted by what the previous speaker has just said."
"This really is far removed from what the vast majority of Members of this Parliament thinks."
"I believe that the vote on the two reports later on will also show that we do not agree with what has just been said."
"As I have already mentioned, we endorse this report by Mr Herzog on state aid, which supports the strict policy of state aid control that is implemented by the Commission on the basis of the treaties."
"It is a balanced report, which points out that state aid policy also has to meet other EU objectives, in particular competitiveness, growth and employment, and this in accordance with the Lisbon strategy."
"That is why I am very pleased, Commissioner, that you also mentioned this principle explicitly in your introductory remarks and expressed your support for it."
"It is good that there has again been a decline in state aid."
"This is the result of the Commission's tough aid control policy."
"Because not only do these aids carry a risk of distorting the market, but also aid must of course, in each instance, first be obtained from elsewhere and may then be lacking in another area."
"Neither can they be rejected wholesale, however."
"Instead qualitative criteria must be used to assess each grant of aid to ascertain whether the objective sought might not justify distortions to the market, which may be limited in time, or whether these measures might even eliminate existing distortions to the market in the medium term."
"In this context, Commissioner, I should like to recall two points, in connection with which I asked questions and made requests during a debate on the same subject all of a year ago."
"It is true that the most competitive region, which is of course what we want to be, has to distinguish itself by having competitive companies."
"This means that the companies should manage as far as possible without aids and that any aids have to be directed at increasing the competitiveness of these companies."
"In the process, however, it is not only the individual company that needs to be assessed; the entire net product chain of which the company is part needs to be taken into account."
"If you wish to apply qualitative criteria it is not enough to focus solely on one single company."
"My second point concerns a request that I wish to make in the field of regional policy."
"Today we are already discussing how regional policy will actually work after 2006."
"Much will change for the present EU of 15, for the old Member States, and it is right that it should."
"But in this context we really do need to consider how we are going to rebalance regional aids across the Member States."
"We need to discuss this and we need to do it in good time."
"We might conclude that everything can stay the same, but we might also conclude that we need a new mechanism of some kind."
"Do not make us wait until the end; let us start this discussion now!"
"Mr President, solely in terms of free competition and the free market, any aid, whether it is state aid, European aid or local aid, disrupts competition."
"Incidentally, I believe and would like to say that this influence on competition is positive when it enables land to be developed, the provision of efficient public services, a reduction in inequality, better social management, consideration of the long term and more research and development."
"By approving the approach of Mr Herzog, whom I would like to congratulate and whom I support, I therefore confirm that state aid is necessary and justified, as he says, on at least two conditions: on the one hand that it clearly and solely fulfils the objectives set in terms of amounts and duration, and on the other hand that it is transparent and that its results are monitored and evaluated."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I agree with what Mr Monti said in a recent interview, namely that the considerable gap between growth and unemployment rates, which puts Europe at a disadvantage compared with the United States, is caused to a large extent by economic structures in this continent which continue to be much less open to competition."
"In my view, a competitive economy open to competition would bring tangible social benefits in the European countries."
"The Commissioner thus concluded that we need an even more vigorous competition policy than that in the United States, and we should give him credit for having pursued it, even accepting the risk of making mistakes or in any case, making judgments different from those made by judicial bodies called upon in some cases to decide."
"With regard to state aid, in particular, Europe is set to face an extremely important challenge over the next few years in the current negative economic climate."
"Efforts to recover state aid are being made alongside protectionism and state intervention in the economy: a perilous path to take."
"The Treaties wisely set strict limits on state aid and these limits must be preserved and confirmed, not least where governments seek to misuse or liberally distribute state aid, something they will increasingly seek to do."
"There are other unresolved issues: former state monopolists - starting with EDF, Enel, France Télécom, Deutsche Telekom - state aid for broadcasting, state aid in the event of structural adjustments and, in this context, also state aid disguised as something else."
"Mr President, I will close by saying that the Italian Radical Members will vote for the Riis-Jørgensen and Evans amendments, which will make the Herzog report more balanced."
"Mr President, European competition policy is one of the European Union's central policy instruments and that is why I would very much welcome it if the Commission were to stand alongside Parliament and also include this sector in the codecision procedure."
"I really do think it is important for us to make competition policy more democratic and invest it with greater legitimacy than it has had so far, because after all the decisions that the European Union makes on the internal market, the market economy and competition are justified by the fact that competition has a distributive function and is therefore said to contribute to fair income distribution, increase social welfare and act as a mechanism to ensure that the factors of production are efficiently allocated."
"This should improve supply to the benefit of producers and consumers and finally it should also act as an incentive to promote technical progress and maximise the national product."
"Obviously we all consider market power and processes of concentration to be damaging."
"These considerations should also play a role in our debate about a constitution and in the revision of the treaties, and I very much hope that they will also be even more visible in the application and reform of competition law."
"Finally, this policy must also be brought into line with the Lisbon process and its objectives."
"That is why the annual report is certainly a successful report and it is also positive that for the first time it addresses the issues surrounding services of general interest."
"Unlike Mr Langen, I expect the Green Paper to provide not only a thorough analysis of how to handle the provision of public services of general interest, but also a decision on a starting point for future legislation."
"In this context, I welcome the fact that you wish to put the public service guarantee on the same footing as the principle of free competition."
"I hope that the Commission will produce a proposal for a framework regulation or framework directive as quickly as possible and that it will take account of national specificities and traditions and in particular leave it up to the Member States to define public services."
"Commissioner, you were right to say how important it is to control cartels and mergers."
"I should like to stress once more here that there is certainly a need to analyse the individual parts of the latest court rulings in precise detail and to draw conclusions from them."
"But these court rulings do not in any way dent Parliament's confidence in the Commission's competence, which has been amply proven over the years."
"Commissioner, I should like to ask you to take greater account of workers' rights in your merger control work ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, as a result of competition policy, large sectors of European industry have lost jobs and a significant share of the global market; more to the point, they have lost hundreds of thousands of workers to the dole queues."
"This policy has helped create huge monopolistic groups which have acquired a dominant position on the market by promoting mergers, alliances and takeovers and greater unaccountability when it comes to price fixing, thereby ousting competitors - mainly small and medium-sized enterprises - from the market, and has resulted in massive waves of redundancies, spiralling unemployment and loss of wealth."
"The view that competition policy is the sine qua non to job creation has proven to be misguided, because exactly the opposite is happening in practice."
"What worries the European Union is the delay in finalising the liberalisation of the natural gas and electricity markets, the energy markets, and transport and postal services, and the delay in completing the full liberalisation of the markets and privatisations and making temporary and provisional forms of employment the norm."
"The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece support the workers standing up against and opposing this liberalisation ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"We will vote against the three reports by Mrs van den Burg, Mr Lipietz and Mr Herzog, which complement each other in the field of so-called competition policy."
"Your economy based on private profit is entirely incapable of dealing either with long-term expenditure on infrastructure or with all the social and human consequences of a competition that could turn out to be fatal to society."
"This is why we need, on the one hand, a European public bank to fund infrastructure projects and, on the other hand, a degree of state interventionism in order to do what private capital scorns and to dress some of the many wounds opened up by your economic system."
"We are in favour of defending public services that are useful to the population."
"We are against the state being used as a crutch for private capital."
"Our vote against these reports as a whole expresses our opposition to the whole current economic system, which only serves to provide maximum wealth for a privileged few and in no way to properly satisfy the needs of the majority of the population."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as the final speaker in this debate I should like to stress once more that competition policy lies at the very heart of the internal market and I believe that for the European Union it is a very important policy instrument for strengthening Europe's position in the world and pursuing the Lisbon objectives."
"Competition policy is supposed to protect European consumers, lead to fair market prices, create increased supply and increase all market participants' dynamism and capacity for innovation."
"Competition policy prohibits both State and private monopolies."
"It fights measures that distort competition and it is a precondition for all companies to have fair opportunities in and on the market."
"We are on the right track, but unfortunately we have not yet reached our goal."
"We are on the right track because we are seeing a fall in the number of cases investigated and because there has been an increase in the fines imposed."
"We have not yet reached our goal because obstacles to fair competition abound and there are many different bodies with responsibilities in this field, which allows distortions of competition to creep in, and because we are too slow in implementing some directives."
"We have not yet reached our goal because we have not completed our work in the interests of public welfare, because services of general interest do not yet have the clear exemptions and rules within competition law to make it possible to allow services of general interest and competition law to function harmoniously together."
"I also welcome the Commission's proposal to apply the 'de minimis' rules to all arrangements between SMEs and call on the candidate countries to implement the competition rules quickly so that there are no distortions of competition between different industrial locations."
"Mr President, I very much appreciate the strong across-the-board support expressed by this House for a vigorous competition policy in Europe."
"It is an enormous task, as Mr Purvis stressed."
"It is also very important to note, as Mr Junker did, that there is a fundamental consensus in favour of a vigorous competition policy involving international cooperation and against a renationalisation of European competition policy."
"I also note the willingness to keep the European Commission as the decision-making body, under the judicial review of the courts."
"Ladies and gentlemen, within the framework of interparliamentary relations, it is my great pleasure to welcome a delegation from the Syrian Parliament."
"The delegation is led by Mr Abdul Kader Kaddoura, Speaker of the Syrian Parliament."
"This is his second visit to the European Parliament."
"In welcoming Mr Kaddoura and his delegation, I should like to highlight the importance we attach to this visit. It is the first of its kind to the European Parliament since 1983."
"Syria is the last remaining country in the Mediterranean basin with whom an Association Agreement has not yet been finalised. Negotiations between the Commission and Syria have been continued since 1997."
"Further, contact between the Syrian Parliament and the European Parliament could trigger ongoing dialogue within the Euromed Forum."
"We trust this visit will help to strengthen links between the European Parliament and the Syrian Parliament."
"Mr Kaddoura, I very much hope that the meetings you and the members of your delegation held proved fruitful."
"I hope too that they will signal the start of a new era in which the people of Syria and the European Union will come closer to each other."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, yesterday we held a debate on Mrs van den Burg's report on temporary work."
"This debate lasted from 10 p.m. to 11.30 p.m. and 28 speakers took part in it."
"When I asked this morning whether there was a video recording of it I was told that there was not because proceedings were only filmed up to 8 p.m."
"Mr President, we say that we want to treat all debates alike and yet those whose reports are debated after 8 p.m. are always at a disadvantage."
"Transparency is not guaranteed."
"We are there; the interpreters are there; only the audiovisual service cannot be there because its resources have been drastically cut."
"I consider this to be an unacceptable situation."
"(Loud applause)"
"I think that your comments, which were also a complaint, should be carefully considered."
"I hope that you will receive a positive response."
"Mr President, MEPs are at present in danger of being scalded since, in the last half hour, there has only been hot water in the showers and toilets."
"Is there by any chance some new scare about new germs spreading here?"
"I would ask the Quaestors to investigate the matter."
"Thank you for your comment, Ms Thors."
"Mr President, we propose to reintroduce, from the original Commission text, the words 'after consultation of the social partners' in the first sentence."
"Mr Pronk, do you have any objections?"
"Mr President, it is possible but we have to say 'where appropriate after consultation of the social partners '."
"We had mentioned this before, and it is also more logical, so: 'where appropriate after consultation with the social partners'."
"Mr President, I would like to ask the movers of Amendments Nos 31 and 37 to clarify whether they intend that this should ban the therapeutic cloning of human embryos."
"Mr President, this amendment has nothing to do with stem cell research."
"It deals exclusively with the issue of human cloning."
"The wording I have used is taken from Parliament's own resolution of September 2000 on human cloning, where we called for a universal ban."
"The debate has already taken place."
"I think that the intentions are quite clear in the text."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I just wish to explain something: Mrs Damião has been suffering from quite a serious illness."
"On behalf of Portugal's socialist delegation, I wish to thank the House, in particular the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, for the support they have given her, which has given a serious intellectual boost to her recovery."
"Mr President, I thought that Mr Herzog would present the oral amendment in his text."
"It will then read: ...'welcome the bank's commitment to improved transparency and efficiency of its global loans and its response to critical questions regarding these instruments'."
"That will be the first line."
"It is the Greens."
"Sorry, I am mixing it up with another report."
"We withdraw the first part of the amendment, which deleted three words, therefore we retain the terms in the report 'financing the economy'."
"If, following the floods that engulfed Central Europe this summer, the earthquakes in Turkey, Greece and recently in Italy, there were still a need to demonstrate the necessity of an aid fund for victims of disasters, the news of the sinking of the Prestige should finally convince us."
"Although this Solidarity Fund is a necessary guarantee, it is not a sufficient one, however."
"Providing aid to the victims of such disasters should not prevent detailed consideration of their causes, our production methods and economic orientations."
"On the contrary, it should encourage us to radically question our economies of profit!"
"These economies produce small profits for shipowners registered in Panama, recruiting Filipinos and flying the flag of Gibraltar!"
"But personal and family tragedies, incalculable losses for the European and international communities caused by each sinking of an illegal tanker, destroying the socio-economic fabric of the coasts for years and damaging ecosystems and marine biodiversity for centuries!"
"What I am calling for is more than a solidarity fund, but the creation of a European bank for environmental protection and restoration, which is permanent and one step ahead of environmental disasters, so that the recent Prestige disaster is the last warning shot for these attacks on the environment."
". (PT) The aim of this report was to propose an interinstitutional agreement on the funding of the EU Solidarity Fund and the conditions regulating the use of this Fund."
"The interinstitutional agreement in question was proposed jointly by the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council, in the aim of laying down the technical arrangements that will enable the revenues necessary for this Fund to be raised."
"Under the terms of the agreement, an accelerated procedure was established, guaranteeing the necessary financial flexibility and the speed of the Fund's intervention, starting in the 2002 financial year and running until 2006, in other words, throughout the current financial perspective."
"The recent disaster involving the oil tanker Prestige, which has already affected the coasts of Galicia and is also threatening the northern coast of Portugal with the crude oil that it has spilt, is a typical example of the effective and rapid use of this Solidarity Fund, which could only persuade me to vote unreservedly in favour of this proposal."
". (NL) At first reading, I concluded my contribution with the words: 'I am pinning my hopes on the Council's good judgment'."
"I can see that I have not been completely let down in this."
"The Interinstitutional Agreement that is now before us is clearly better defined than the draft in Parliament."
"I should like to illustrate this with three points."
"The first one is the Interinstitutional Agreement's scope."
"This is largely confined to major natural disasters, with good reason."
"In the case of disasters of other types, those responsible will be held liable."
"The second point concerns the threshold values."
"The raised threshold focuses the scheme on major disasters and holds out the prospect of this resulting in substantial aid to selected regions."
"Thirdly, with regard to the exemption options, the 7.5% limit ensures that the lion's share of the Fund reaches its actual goal."
"The Commission has now made the first proposal for granting aid from this Fund."
"I hope that as these aid applications are dealt with, it will become clear that the Solidarity Fund functions as a supplement to national measures, both in terms of prevention and correction."
"The current situation will then improve on all fronts, with regard to both the affected states and longer-term mutual solidarity."
"This is why we have endorsed the Interinstitutional Agreement, albeit with reservations."
"I voted in favour of the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund."
"This vote is the realisation of the fast legislative work that has been done since the proposal was presented by Commissioner Barnier on 18 September."
"I would also like to thank him for his efforts in this matter."
"When the political will is strong enough, Europe can move forward quickly and effectively."
"I only regret that we did not reach the same result following the terrible storms in 1999, which hit France hard."
"Today, we can only welcome the mobilisation of this new European instrument of solidarity."
"The EUR 728 million will provide additional comfort for the families that have suffered as a result of the natural disasters in the summer."
"In my region and in several departments in the South of France, violent storms and torrential floods hit around 400 municipalities on 8 and 9 September, causing the deaths of 24 people and causing very considerable damage."
"Today my thoughts go out to those families, the elected representatives of those municipalities and all those, whether civil security forces or voluntary organisations, which have provided help and support during the emergency."
"They know the price of solidarity and appreciate, I hope, the gesture that Europe has made today."
"Mr President, the proposal for a Council recommendation with regard to the prevention of tobacco smoking only partly corresponds with my views."
"In some areas, the Commission goes much too far."
"In addition to the many prevention and control aspects, this recommendation also aims to regulate tobacco advertising."
"Why is the Commission tabling two texts both of which intend to impose restraints on advertising?"
"Surely it cannot be the intention that advertising other than that promoting tobacco should fall within the scope of this recommendation?"
"It is very unfortunate that Parliament is not considering brand diversification businesses. These are predominantly specialist, and often very small, businesses that use an existing brand to market new products."
"However, I can, of course, content myself with the fact that it is ultimately only a non-binding instrument, which must serve as an incentive for the Member States."
"Mr President, as someone completely new to Parliament, I have to say that matters such as Mr Maaten's report on the prevention of smoking and on initiatives more effectively to combat smoking and other tobacco use make it difficult for the individual citizen to appreciate the good work we do."
"I am happy to leave it to children's parents to decide about this issue."
"In this case, it is the form that is dangerous, and not the content."
"I think it should be the other way around."
"We have chosen to refrain from adopting positions on quite a few parts of the report."
"Several of the proposals are such as not to require any common policy at EU level."
"Bans on cigarette machines and rules governing gifts and self-service in shops are better drawn up at national level."
"We consider bans on food made to look like tobacco to be a case of unnecessary regulation."
"The EU should instead immediately abolish the extensive subsidies it pays out for the cultivation of tobacco."
". (DE) Several of the recommendations made by the Commission and Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy are to be welcomed from a health policy point of view."
"I am thinking in particular of information campaigns and programmes to treat addiction to smoking."
"The amendment seeking to introduce measures against involuntary exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in indoor workplaces, enclosed public places and public transport also enhances the recommendation."
"I particularly welcome the call to promote economically viable alternatives for tobacco growers and to promote the gradual replacement of subsidies for raw tobacco with alternatives."
"Obviously we cannot simply take these producers' and their families' daily bread away without offering them an acceptable alternative."
"I am not especially happy, however, with all of the recommendations in this report."
"The recommendation to the Member States to raise the price of tobacco products artificially by increasing the tax burden will not, I think, be effective in the fight against tobacco consumption."
"In the United Kingdom a packet of cigarettes costs twice or three times as much as it does in Luxembourg."
"I have yet to hear, however, that tobacco consumption in the British Isles is much lower than in the other Member States as a result, let alone that the problem has been solved."
"The only ones who could welcome this would be our finance and budget ministers, in particular those who are having to contend with a larger budget deficit and are therefore facing a 'blue letter' from the Commission because they have exceeded the Stability Pact criteria."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137, Paragraph 1 of the Rules of Procedure)"
". (NL) At the time when this proposal was put on the agenda, support from an overwhelming majority was already guaranteed."
"This support is much wider than was the case for previous proposals on the subject of tobacco."
"Perhaps this is because it cannot be objected to on legal or economic grounds."
"This is not a piece of legislation, but merely an initiative that gives an opinion on Parliament's behalf, a non-binding recommendation for the Member States, of which they are free to make use as they see fit."
"In many cases, I wish that decisions from this Parliament had this status, particularly dealing with such matters as the liberalisation of the economy or the reduction of government spending."
"This is different from cross-border environmental and public health issues, in which it is useful to learn from each other and to carry out the toughest protection measures as a joint effort."
"Unfortunately, according to the UN Treaty, the prevention and control of smoking do not fall within the scope of the market but under public health, an area in which the Commission can merely make a recommendation to the Member States."
"I have come unstuck on this point before, when I made proposals for protection against asbestos."
"This time round, the Council has already made known to us its lack of interest in Parliament's opinion."
"I endorse the proposals against smuggling, cinema advertising, and chocolate cigarettes, but do not hold out any high hopes."
". (EL) We are against direct or indirect advertising of tobacco products and [support] measures to reverse the spread and increase of this unhealthy habit, especially among young people."
"May we emphasise once again, however, that an anti-smoking campaign is not the same thing as an anti-tobacco campaign and that the anti-smoking campaign should not take the form of a campaign against tobacco cultivation in ?U member states, as the EU argues in Amendment No 17 of the report."
"To say tobacco farms are to blame and that tobacco farmers should be punished by proposing that subsidies be abolished, is to deliberately confuse the question of protection of public health with maintaining traditional single-crop farms so that tens of thousands of farmers in mainly poor southern areas, who are not being offered any specific alternatives, can survive."
"These proposals are hypocritical and underhand and run counter to consumer interests and public health, given that 70% of the European Union's tobacco is imported."
"Consequently, abolishing aid for Community production will not reduce smoking; it will merely make us dependent on imports and flood the European market with tobacco from third countries."
"(PT) Despite the fact that the European Court of Justice has annulled the directive on advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products, of 14 May 2001 because it overstepped Community competence, we see that this report contains a set of non-binding recommendations, which places the emphasis on reducing tobacco consumption by raising consumer awareness. It also presents a range of proposals designed to deter smoking, particularly amongst children and adolescents, which can only deserve our support."
"We wish our position to further emphasise that the concern the European Parliament is showing for public health must not interfere with the competence of national legislators and particularly with protection measures and measures to find economic alternatives that are needed for all those who are economically dependent on tobacco production."
"Smoking kills, the litany is becoming tiring."
"I will therefore take the liberty of irritating some people by repeating that smoking kills one in two smokers."
"There is no doubt that those who do not want to hear it are tired of it."
"According to the evidence, however, it does not scare people."
"The figures are most edifying: in Europe, 500 000 people are struck down by this plague each year."
"In Belgium, 33% of young people between the ages of 15 and 24 are regular smokers and 51% have smoked."
"More serious is the fact that a quarter of women have tried their first cigarette before the age of 15."
"In short, young people are smoking more and more, and currently no anti-smoking policy is capable of curbing this infernal trend."
"This is why I welcome the adoption by the plenary of the report by Mr Maaten which, by taking up the major anti-smoking measures advocated by WHO, proposes measures to the Council that would be effective in preventing smoking and prevent teenagers from being conditioned by cigarette manufacturers."
"This is why I am also categorically opposed to the sale of chocolate cigarettes or liquorice pipes: mimicking a gesture at the age of 5 carries a risk of registering it and getting used to it."
"The risk is established, the symbol is disastrous, and all for a quite laughable market!"
"The Commission is proposing to make the regulations on additives in animal feed more coherent, and we approve of that approach."
"However, on the grounds of making what appears to be a technical alteration to an existing regulation, it is taking advantage of the opportunity to make fundamental changes to the authorisation procedure."
"Regarding the regulations on additives, we support the proposals aimed at bringing an end to the use of the antibiotics that are still authorised to promote growth, with a transition period, and at simplifying the authorisation procedure for additives that are already authorised for human food."
"We also share the principle of continuing to consider coccidiostats and histomonostats as additives until we find other methods of protecting animals against those illnesses."
"However, we await proposals from the Commission that will assure us that the same requirements will be applied to imported meat."
"With regard to the authorisation procedure, we cannot support the Commission's proposal granting the European Food Safety Authority sole responsibility for investigating applications, which until now was under the authority of the Member States."
"For this reason we cannot vote in favour of the report."
". (PT) I have decided to support this report, primarily because of the knock-on importance that the proposal by the European Commission will have for the quality of the products offered to the end consumer."
"In fact, this proposal is intended to regulate additives intended for animal nutrition, clarifying existing rules in this field and consequently the authorisation procedures for their marketing."
"I think it is entirely appropriate to promote strict quality standards for additives intended for the nutrition of animals that are in turn intended for human consumption."
"This is the way to avoid the future occurrence of further episodes such as the outbreak of 'mad cow' disease, enabling us to trace and identify potentially harmful components, eliminating them from the food chain and from the market."
"Furthermore, it will allow upward monitoring to take place, both through the obligation on companies to prove the effectiveness of the product and the absence of risk to human health, animal health and the environment and by establishing requirements for the use and marketing of additives."
". (EL) First, it is right that there should be controls and rules on the herbal medicinal product market, which is in total chaos, leaving the way clear for quacks to profit at the expense of public health and consumers."
"The question, however, that bother us is how herbal medicinal products are to reach patients and consumers."
"The report explains that these medicinal products will be available over the counter, thereby shifting the entire responsibility for selecting a suitable product on to the patient or consumer, whose only source of information will be the manufacturer's advertisements."
"Basically, therefore, consumers will be at the mercy of misleading information from the private sector and large industrial facilities, who will be able to profiteer as they please."
"The second question which arises is whether these medicinal products should be sold through pharmacies and by qualified pharmacists or whether they will be available on supermarket shelves."
"Probably the latter, it would appear."
"We believe that once these preparations are classified - and they must be classified - as a medicinal product, they should be prescribed through the proper channels by a doctor or pharmacist and should be available on the national health."
". (PT) The use of medicinal herbs dates back to time immemorial."
"Whilst acknowledging the predominant role played by modern pharmacology, it should also be recognised that medicinal herbs still have their place in medicine and that their therapeutic potential can be exploited."
"We therefore welcome the Commission's proposal to create a Committee for Herbal Medicinal Products, which is autonomous and separate from the Committee on Proprietary Medicinal Products, which will be responsible for the regulation and monitoring of all aspects of herbal medicines."
"It is, however, crucial to make the distinction between a medicinal product, even a herbal one, and food or cosmetic products and to ensure adequate deadlines for the herbal product industry to adapt to the new legal situation."
"We are counting on the national authorities to provide this support and, confident that they will do so, we have given our vote to Mr Nisticó's report."
"In line with the commitment made in Lisbon to a future for Europe involving a quantitative and qualitative improvement in employment and greater social cohesion, I will only support this report if Amendment No 42, which deletes the Commission's proposal of applying a deadline for ensuring the essential protection of temporary workers, is adopted."
"I feel it is essential that the so-called principle of 'non-discrimination', which states that a temporary worker should not be treated less favourably than a similar worker in the company using him from the point of view of working and employment conditions should be applied fully and therefore without 'discrimination'!"
"In short, this principle should be guaranteed from day one: there can be no exemptions or waivers, particularly given that this atypical way of working, in comparison with all atypical ways of working, is the one that is most liable to violations, despite Community legislation on the subject, and to shameless exploitation, in other words to a sort of 'reification' of employment."
"In accordance with this fundamental idea, I will also vote in favour of the amendment obliging the Member States to prevent the use of temporary workers to subdue a strike movement."
"This vote entirely distorts the spirit of the directive on temporary work."
"Equal pay for equal work, certainly, but the key issue is the reference point."
"For the Commission, the reference point was clear: the company employing the worker was the reference point."
"Now, the salary of a temporary worker would have to be assessed according to the scale of salaries in the temporary employment agency."
"This is a subtle but decisive shift, because by its nature it legitimises a two-tier employment market, or worse the creation of real networks of slave traders slashing prices."
"Those who welcome this vote are short sighted, because establishing a salary division between temporary workers and the workers in the companies employing them deals a fatal blow to social cohesion, and that is the Achilles heel of temporary work."
"Integration cannot be legislated."
"Temporary workers have more accidents than other workers and suffer more harassment."
"They pay very dearly for their status."
"The social reality is intractable."
"If they are paid less for identical work in a company, they will lose any chance of being integrated into it."
"Are temporary workers just like any other worker?"
"No they are not!"
"And this directive, which is dead before it is born, will certainly not bring them justice."
". (NL) My concern when voting was primarily with the protection of Dutch legislation dating from 1999, which intends to put temporary work on a more equal footing with normal work and to protect against abuses."
"Without such legislation, employers can take advantage of temporary workers and rob groups of employees of their basic security, pay them lower wages, offer them less say, force them to work under worse conditions, make early dismissal possible or break strikes of others."
"The intention is to create dependency by preventing people from moving on to permanent positions at the businesses that originally hired them."
"Temporary work is admissible only if it is a free choice on the part of the people involved, albeit in the service of the temping agency, and if they have all the normal rights of employees."
"The two largest groups have reached a compromise that prevents the more far-reaching protection that my group has proposed."
"Despite this, Dutch employers are trying to persuade their counterparts in other Member States and the Right-wing section in this Parliament to reject even this minimum level of protection and to ensure that the rules are either rejected or relaxed."
"In doing so, they are hoping to cut costs and increase temporary work."
"I can only vote in favour if they are frustrated in what they seek to do."
"With this proposal for a directive, the Commission is seeking to regulate working conditions for temporary workers in the Member States."
"The choice of this restrictive measure is going to force regulations on the Member States that are not necessarily adapted to their specific national characteristics and which could therefore penalise this way of working, whereas the aim was to encourage it."
"Although the only possible reply is that promoting temporary work, which provides flexibility for companies and integration or reintegration into the labour market for some types of workers, is quite commendable, there is absolutely no question of doing it at any price."
"It would seem that this proposal for a directive does not have a sufficiently sound basis."
"Also, this field is the sovereign responsibility of the Member States, which are undoubtedly in a better position to assess the situation of their labour market."
"This is why I cannot vote for a text which, far from achieving its objectives, runs counter to them."
"The UK delegation of the Labour Party recognises the serious UK Government concern over this directive."
"It is important to strike a balance between protecting agency workers and avoiding burdens that could stop business engaging them, particularly for short-term assignments."
"Temporary Work Agencies make an important contribution to the employment market in the UK and should not be penalised."
"Increased administrative burdens could lead to increases in costs, which could be passed onto user organisations or cause the closure of the business and job losses."
"The EPLP has thus voted against Amendment 42 calling for the deletion of the 6-week derogation from the original Commission proposal."
"It feels that it is important that at least a 6-week derogation remains in the proposal."
"The EPLP voted for Amendment 73 to support comprehensive and effective impact assessments."
"This helps SMEs."
"The EPLP submitted and supported Amendment 71, calling for an extra transition period for the UK."
"It is therefore necessary that there is an additional period of 3 years, allowing 5 years in total, for this directive to be implemented in the UK and Ireland."
"The EPLP has supported this report at first reading but with the strong reservations set out here."
". (PT) The main reasons for using temporary workers and temporary employment agencies concern the need to deal with temporary variations in demand."
"Statistical information, therefore, shows that placements in user companies are usually extremely short; between one and six months."
"In the particular case of Portugal, specific legislation is in place that respects this type of work, and which guarantees the basic rights of these workers, whilst also respecting the particular circumstances that determine the use of temporary labour."
"Despite the Commission's view that its proposal is quite flexible, the fact is that the attempt to include in this report the regulation of various basic conditions of temporary work, in my opinion, falls outside Community competence and has no precedent in European legislation, thereby breaching the principle of subsidiarity."
"These, in short, are the reasons for my vote against this report."
". (PT) I have voted against this report because I believe that, by tabling various amendments to the Commission's original text, we have ultimately created a framework that is clearly counterproductive to the interests it is intended to safeguard."
"In fact, as the rapporteur acknowledges, there are some aspects on which the social partners involved have to date never reached agreement."
"Furthermore, equating the factors of the legal relationship of temporary work with permanent work will ultimately lead to this soon no longer being a viable possibility for companies and therefore, one less window of opportunity for many workers."
"It should be emphasised that we cannot and shall not allow the same provisions for safety, health and social rights that apply to other workers not to be applied to temporary workers. This protection already exists, in fact, in various regulatory instruments."
"It would have been more useful for us to have seen a statistical breakdown of the use of temporary labour in Europe, which successive European Councils have seen as another instrument with which to combat unemployment and for the suggestion to have been made to impose limits on its use, thereby combating not temporary work itself but rather the unacceptable abuses of such work."
"We voted against this motion for a joint resolution as, behind its convoluted words and self-congratulation, it is mainly seeking to clear the Russian authorities of responsibility for the dirty war that it is waging in Chechnya."
"While we condemn terrorism in any form, it is shocking that the motion for a joint resolution only expresses its 'firm condemnation' of the terrorist attacks in Moscow, and not of the state terrorism conducted by the Russian army against the civil population in Chechnya."
"As for the progress of neutralisation of Chechen terrorists in Moscow, it not only shows the ignominy of terrorism, but also the total contempt of the Russian authorities for their own citizens."
"We are in favour of establishing the closest possible links between the people of the European Union and Russia, but against the complicity between their leaders, some of which are preparing for war against Iraq while the others are at war against the Chechens."
"Who can honestly be satisfied with the results of the EU-Russia Summit?"
"The proponents of liberalism who only see Russia as another area for the market, competition and privatisations, particularly in the fields of energy, research and transport, certainly can."
"As can Mr Putin, who, legitimised by the post-September 11 attitude adopted by the US, is flouting freedom of expression and increasing police and military pressure on all the peoples of the Russian Federation, particularly the Chechens."
"We cannot acknowledge these results."
"On the contrary, we are firmly on the side of the populations that are the victims of rampant capitalism and fight alongside them to maintain public and social services and to defend the right to work and to retirement."
"We support the right of the Chechen people to self-determination even more strongly."
"We condemn Russian military aggression and the hypocritical attitude of the EU and Denmark who, on the orders of the Russians, arrested Akhmed Zakaïev, the representative of the Chechen president, Mr Maskhadov."
"In short, we cannot vote in favour of the joint resolution of the European Parliament authorising and legitimising military operations in Chechnya."
". (PT) Like all compromise texts, this motion for a resolution combines very positive recitals and conclusions, such as the references to the agreement on Kaliningrad, for example, with a dubious and rather weak speech rejecting the terrorist acts that have recently taken place in Russia and, particularly, the recent attack on the Moscow theatre by Chechen extremists."
"With regard to the fight against terrorism, we believe that this must be constant and unswerving, because what we are seeing are cowardly and anonymous threats to the life and security of defenceless citizens, who will accept no excuses and no less rigorous support for the authorities combating this phenomenon."
"This and this alone is the reason why I have voted against this motion for a resolution."
"We could have voted in favour of this joint resolution, as it contains a number of sound recitals regarding General Musharraf's military regime in Pakistan."
"However, the condemnation does not go far enough."
"Paragraph 2 legitimises the regime following the recent elections in October 2002."
"These elections were not democratic."
"They were conducted like a commercial transaction."
"The rich were able to buy votes from the poor without the electoral commission being able to stop them."
"The military at all levels put pressure on the local administration to help their preferred candidates."
"These elections were about encouraging politicians to follow the instructions and recommendations of the military, the 'new' allies of imperialism in the region."
"All the decisions taken were dictated by economic considerations: continuing with privatisations, deregulations, withdrawing collective agreements and mass unemployment."
"According to the institute for planning sustainable development in Islamabad, 6.8 million Pakistanis fell below the poverty line during the last three years of the Musharraf regime."
"It is the IMF and the World Bank who really give the orders in the regime."
"There is no mention of that in this resolution and the condemnation of the Musharraf regime does not go far enough."
"We therefore abstained."
"Mr President, this time it was Mr Fatuzzo who came to me in a dream and said: 'Do not you think that the time has come at last for you to state clearly, in a forum as important as the European Parliament, that we need to press forward with research into prolonging citizens' lives and research into eradicating as many diseases as possible?'"
"'We are already doing that,' I replied."
"'No, I'm very worried that there are groups of people who, in one way or another, are against cures for all diseases."
"Maybe some pharmaceutical companies, or some hospitals."
"It has been said that to think the worst of someone is a sin, but usually you are spot on."
"I really would like to call for everything possible to be done, and only the European Union can do it, to carry out research into prolonging our lives and ensure that they are healthy, wholesome and free from disease.'"
"Mr President, I voted against Mrs Damião's report because Amendment No 23 was not adopted."
"I am in favour of maintaining the moratorium on genetically modified food, but on no account do I oppose research and biotechnology in general."
". (EL) It is clear from advances over recent years that biotechnology can help us enormously to understand how life develops, to combat disease and to develop new drugs."
"At the same time, it harbours dangers, mainly when it comes to 'playing around' with genetic material, altering genetic codes, cloning, preparing genetically modified organisms (GMOs), patenting living organisms and using DNA for keeping tabs on people."
"The Commission and the European Parliament are not concerned with developing biotechnology for the benefit of society; all they worry about is how the European monopolies can catch up with the American monopolies, but of course that does not surprise us."
"The main battle in this war is being fought with GM foods and a race is being run here with the Americans."
"Who cares about the risks inherent in messing about with life and making artificial changes?"
"Who cares that it is impossible to predict the effect these organisms will have on our planet's sensitive ecosystem?"
"The responsibility for prevention has been shifted straight on to the consumer (such as the starving millions in Africa)."
"This is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report."
"We Swedish Moderates welcome the positive attitude adopted by the European Parliament and the Commission on life sciences and biotechnology in this report."
"We would, however, emphasise that diversity and a wealth of ideas provide the best impetus to successful research."
"This principle should not be lost through EU coordination."
"Research policy within the EU must be based upon the principle of subsidiarity."
"Research cooperation between the Member States is good, but the EU must not take charge of it."
"Except in the case of its own research programmes, the EU lacks competence in the research area, and that is how matters should remain."
"We have therefore voted against the proposal for a special Directorate General with chief responsibility for coordinating the biotechnology strategy."
"We are in favour of the development of life sciences, biotechnology and, more broadly, of science in general."
"This is because it is the means to provide the material basis for the progress of humanity and the intellectual basis for its emancipation from all types of prejudices, starting with the obscurantism that is used by religions and various reactionary ideologies, some of which are very fashionable at present, and which periodically bring back the kind of society in which men are not in control of their destiny but are crushed by an unjust, harmful and abhorrent social structure."
"We reject, however, the many direct and indirect indulgences in the report of private companies."
"These companies are in no way concerned with what is useful to humanity in terms of the development of science, but rather with what can be sold to customers who have the means to pay for it and provide a profit."
"We also reject all the calls for public funding in the interests of private capital, even if those interests are hidden behind the needs of research."
"We therefore abstained from voting on this report."
"I voted against Amendments 31 and 37 as the wording would be interpreted to also include a ban on therapeutic cloning, which I support under proper ethical conditions."
"I do not support the cloning of human beings."
"Mr President, the document concerns the European Investment Bank annual report for 2001."
"I voted for the report because the Bank's work is extremely important, particularly - and I want to stress this - in providing aid to finance infrastructure, especially in the candidate countries."
"It is for this very reason that I want to emphasise the importance of Corridor 5, which links southern Italy, the Puglia region, with Tirana, Skopje, Sofia, Plovdiv and Burgas. Above all, I would call for the European Investment Bank's funds to be increased in order to finance the construction of the stretch of road and railway between Skopje and Sofia, which is completely non-existent at present, something which is preventing the swift completion of Corridor 5, so important for work in the whole of the Balkan area."
"Parliament is right to highlight the impact of the EIB on the growth of SMEs and on employment, particularly through risk-capital transactions."
"This impact must be reinforced by operation structures for access by SMEs."
"In particular, the invitation made to the EIB to adopt and apply the definition of SMEs established by the Commission is essential for access by the smallest SMEs."
"In the same context, increasing investments in the field of accommodation will enhance the important construction sector."
"Mr President, the van den Burg report on prudential supervision in the European Union is particularly interesting for the elderly and pensioners, who give their money both to the State which arranges their pensions, through compulsory national insurance schemes, and to private funds, through shares, bonds and investments."
"Neither, however, are completely watertight."
"To avoid this problem, all we can do, as I saw just now when I closed my eyes, is to undertake to build brick houses. In my view and in the view of the Pensioners' Party, this is the best investment we can make for the future, in whichever part of the world they are built."
"The implementation of careful supervision rules in the European Union will protect saving and give people confidence in investments in stocks and shares."
"The globalisation of risks should further encourage the European authorities to develop supervision rules at international level."
"In this context, the invitation made by Parliament to the Commission and the European Supervisory Committees to organise, jointly with the American Federal Reserve and the Security and Exchange Commission, a transatlantic financial forum, is going in the right direction."
"Other, broader initiatives, should not, however, be ruled out."
". (PT) This report is based on some facts and on one basic misunderstanding."
"The facts are those we saw in the social communication: the disturbing and unprecedented degree of instability in the world financial markets and the repercussions of this on the so-called 'real economy', with the surge in financial crises which become economic crises as a result of the 'financialisation' of the economy, to which the gradual integration of pension schemes for private profit and the increasing volume of pension funds have largely contributed."
"The mistake is to think that, by integrating the EU's financial markets and establishing rules for minimum prudential supervision, under the auspices of new supranational bodies, and by increasing the powers of the Commission, we will resolve the problem of the financial markets' volatility when the main issue is the 'free' international movement of capital and its speculative and parasitical use, with enormous volumes of money concentrated in pension funds and in hedge funds, frequently using the platform of tax havens and instruments that encourage speculation, such as derivatives."
"Furthermore, the fragmentation of the financial markets could be a positive factor in avoiding the risks of this financial globalisation, maintaining more localised supervisory systems and markets that are more flexible and adaptable to specific local characteristics."
". (DE) The appeal to national authorities to cooperate more closely in the fight against so-called white-collar crime is certainly to be welcomed."
"If, however, you want to give examples of this white-collar crime, and mention money laundering, market abuse and financing of terrorist groups, you should be careful not to add tax evasion to the list."
"We all agree that tax evasion should be stopped."
"Everyone should fulfil their duty to pay taxes."
"But this is no reason to confuse tax evasion with tax fraud."
"There is a clear distinction between the two."
"That is why I tabled an amendment in this regard in committee, but unfortunately it was not adopted."
"The same amendment was tabled in the plenary on behalf of the PPE-DE Group."
"This amendment also deletes the reference to the practice of blacklisting countries if they do not yet adhere to the various international standards in the field of fighting white-collar crime."
"The 'naming and shaming' method appears at first sight to be very attractive if the sole objective is to fight against this form of crime, but it actually reinforces the law of the most powerful in international relations."
"You would think twice before putting the USA on a list of this kind."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
". (NL) EU policy aims to give more elbow room to people at the helm of international companies, who are seen as magicians with the ability to guarantee prosperity and prompt economic growth."
"During the time when share prices soared sky-high, these magicians were even allowed to line their own pockets quite handsomely with share option schemes."
"Moreover, they are being encouraged to take on important government functions in the areas of postal services, energy supply and public transport."
"Meanwhile, we have been able to witness in America what these magicians are capable of."
"In some cases, the successes ascribed to them and the options paid out to them are based on forgeries."
"Measures are now being taken in America to increase control, not so much to curb the omnipotence of large companies, as to restore investor and consumer confidence."
"An initiative of this kind is also currently being proposed for the EU."
"My support for it is mainly due to the lack of anything better."
"Without changing the way in which the economy is organised, even the appointment of large numbers of inspectors would not solve the problems."
"We would then be wasting Community funding on bureaucracy."
"What is positive is the proposal to set up a common database collating the most important information pertaining to European financial institutions' business data and making it accessible to the public."
"The unprecedented crisis in the financial system is the result of the deep economic crisis in the capitalist system and the clash of interests and acute competition between monopolies."
"The wave of scandals to hit large monopolies and financial service groups in the USA and Europe has exacerbated the lack of faith in the financial system by highlighting its unaccountability and revealing how the market, small investors and savers, pension funds and insurance companies are constantly deceived, with new ways being found of exploiting and sucking the masses dry."
"And yet no control measures with any teeth have been introduced, which perhaps goes to show that the control mechanisms responsible have been hiding rather than monitoring information and have basically acted as consultants in deception."
"'Creative', 'constructive' accounting has been well and truly adopted even in national accounts as a way of deceiving citizens."
"The only purpose of any supposed controls proposed or applied to date has been to placate justified grass-roots reaction; nothing is being done to prevent or compensate the victims of unaccountable monopolies as they destroy workers and small and medium-sized enterprises, because that would jeopardise the social and economic system itself, based as it is on the principle of exploitation."
"We are here to highlight the political dimensions of the economic crisis as we fight with the workers to overturn this rotten system."
"The effects of constant announcements regarding the liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets that are not followed up with genuine results are a considerable handicap to European credibility with citizens."
"These liberalisations should be genuinely set in motion so that they are perceptible to households."
"Furthermore, based on the European ineffectiveness with regard to South Korea concerning unfair competition on the ship building market, we urgently need to implement the procedure for settling WTO disputes for the sector in question, also in order to open the way for the emergence of a competition policy at international level."
". (PT) We have voted against the report for the following reasons:"
"it reiterates its support for rapid progress towards liberalisation of the European markets in energy, transport and postal services and regrets the lack of progress in the effective liberalisation of gas and electricity, which we reject;"
"we reject the report's position on the acquisition of private companies in the electricity sector by public companies in sectors that have been or are about to be liberalised, which it is attempting to undermine;"
"we disagree with its call for State aid to be reduced and with its misguided approach to State funding of private providers of general interest services;"
"the report does not take account of the social consequences of mergers, specifically employment, or of the abuse of dominant positions, and plays down the importance of workers in merger decisions;"
"we disagree with the report's support for codecision in competition policy."
"We obviously cannot ratify the report by Alain Lipietz, which expresses its 'profound disappointment at the lack of progress in the effective liberalisation of European gas and electricity markets'."
"On the contrary, we call on citizens to rise up against such a plan."
"Like the majority of them, our 'awareness [?] remains very limited' of the benefits of the competition policy conducted at EU level, as it translates into restructuring, redundancies and a low-cost method of satisfying social needs."
"Rather than this policy, which is at least as stupid as the Stability Pact, we are in favour of structural policies, planned at European level, for example in the fields of transport and energy."
"In general, the Commission's approach aims to make such policies entirely impossible, particularly by reducing state aid, which is systematically portrayed as being harmful."
"Unlike the rapporteur, we do not support 'the Commission's continued commitment to reducing state aid still further'."
"We will therefore vote against his text, which is a mark of unreservedly rallying to the neo-liberal ideology."
"I wish to congratulate Mr Lipietz on the excellent report he has drawn up on the Commission's 31st Report on Competition Policy 2001, which I fully support, particularly with regard to ensuring constant and rigorous monitoring to prevent serious distortions of competition and with regard to the need to create a specialist body, at judicial level, in the field of competition and State aid, so that cases in this field can be dealt with quickly."
"I should like, however, to emphasise that although I broadly agree with the rapporteur's support for the Commission's commitment to reducing State aid in the Community, there are still European regions, specifically the outermost regions, in which State aid is a vital measure for supporting their economic and social development."
"This has been expressly acknowledged in Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"In these specific cases, we must continue to see a degree of flexibility in the granting and authorisation of aid which make a justified and effective contribution to the development of these unique territories and economies."
". (PT) I have supported this report, which concerns the Commission's assessment of competition policy in 2001, because I believe it does so in a well-considered way and makes constructive criticism."
"As the rapporteur states, we must acknowledge the fact that the Commission is successfully pursuing its objectives by boldly applying the instruments at its disposal and therefore effectively protecting consumers and their best interests."
"An objective contribution to this conclusion is the verified reduction in the number of cases examined and, at the same time, the sharp rise in fines imposed."
"In fact, given the high speed of technological development, the march of globalisation, and not least the European economy characterised by frequent mergers, the rigour of competition policy and its scrupulous monitoring by the Commission is crucial."
"This policy is crucial to promoting a climate of confidence and to affording proper protection for economic actors, preventing concerted practices, the abuse of dominant positions and other distortions of competition."
"I also particularly welcome the rapporteur's proposal to attach absolute priority to policies involving horizontal aid to help industry adjust to the Kyoto commitments."
"This is the way forward for a European economy that aspires to be increasingly 'more dynamic and competitive' but also ecologically balanced."
"In recent years, the Commission has fulfilled its mission to hunt down state aid with a somewhat blind zeal, seeing aid to be criticised practically everywhere."
"For the first time, the Council recently tried to moderate the Commission by using Article 88(3) which allows it, ruling unanimously in exceptional circumstances, to exonerate some aid from any proceedings."
"We regret that it did not have that courage earlier, for example when the Commission condemned public aid for employment in the French textiles sector."
"The Court of Justice also put on another brake with the Ferring ruling of 22 November 2001, which exonerates public aid when it solely compensates for the excess cost of a public service constraint."
"We hope that this case law will be confirmed."
"It seems to us that now the corresponding section of the Treaty (Articles 87 to 89) should be updated in order to better define acceptable public aid, for example for employment, the environment or compensating for public service constraints."
"Moreover, the Commission should not have exclusive and discretionary powers: the national democracies should also be able to have an input."
"The report by Philippe Herzog proposes some minor adjustments to the scoreboard for state aid and gives some pious wishes."
"Like him, we deplore the freezing of Research and Development aid, and like him, we are in favour of exceptional cases being considered."
"However, the report must be severely criticised in terms of its content."
"It deals with the absence of any evaluation procedure as just one point among many others."
"It is however, the key issue: rather than being called to vote on a table of figures, according to democracy the European Parliament should have the opportunity to give an opinion based on genuine assessments."
"The reason why this aspect is only mentioned in passing is that the rapporteur deprived it of all importance in advance by swearing allegiance to the neo-liberal dogma."
"The report closes the discussion before it opens by stating that it supports 'the objectives of reducing aid granted by states or from state funds, in any form whatsoever, which distorts or threatens to distort competition'."
"The dominant theme of this report is therefore detailed arrangements with a logic of pure competition, and this is also why we voted against it."
". (PT) I wish to congratulate Mr Herzog on the excellent report he has produced on the 2001 scoreboard for State aid (spring 2002 update), presented by the Commission, which I fully support."
"In the framework of competition policy, the half-yearly publication of the scoreboard for State aid since 2001 is an important tool for transparency and debate."
"Nevertheless, I share the opinion that the data included in this scoreboard are still not sufficient or adequate to enable a comparison to be made between the behaviour of the various Member States and the real benefits arising from State aid."
"We would like to see such a comparison made in the short term because this is the only way in which an informed overall study can be undertaken so that decisions can be taken on the level of aid granted and/or its possible refocusing towards horizontal objectives of common interest, such as research and development, the environment, SMEs, training and employment."
". (NL) Within the EU, government aid is a dirty word these days."
"There is no room for it in the pursuit of unlimited international competition and tax reduction."
"However, a great deal of government aid is channelled to companies in a disguised form."
"In some cases, there is an over-capacity on offer for the transport of freight, as new motorways, goods railways and canals are being built."
"Consequently, companies are free to choose which part of this infrastructure they can utilise while keeping their transport costs to a minimum."
"Many companies only managed to start up or survive thanks to government aid, and this is not likely to change a great deal in future."
"This applies all the more if services of general interest, public services in other words, are considered as part of the economy."
"Although those services are vital to the well-being of people and the conservation of our environment, they are, in many cases, running at a constant loss."
"Only nepotism, the giving of government funding to business connections, should be prevented."
"My colleague, Mr Herzog, as rapporteur, has stated all of this in a slightly less emphatic way, but has tabled sound proposals in order at least to bring the figures more on a par, to increase the ceiling for amounts that have to be declared to EUR 200 000, to adopt an active, regional policy in areas of the Czech Republic and Poland with a strong steel industry, to abolish the inspection of aid to services of general interest and to give Parliament more control over policy."
"The right-wing elements in this House will do everything in their power to obstruct this process."
"In Stockholm, in June 2001, the European Council adopted the objective of reducing the overall level of State aid as a percentage of GDP by 2003, particularly ad hoc and sectoral aid."
"The Barcelona Council of March 2002 confirmed this intention, calling on Member States to redirect such aid towards horizontal objectives of common interest, including economic and social cohesion, and target it to identified market failures."
"I believe State aid to be a flexibility instrument that is crucial to correcting disparities and to addressing specific problems under European competition rules, which means that the legitimacy of its use should never be questioned, although it must be undertaken in a moderate and justifiable way."
"In the specific context that led to the drafting of this report, I welcome the clear reduction in State aid granted and its redirection towards horizontal objectives, such as SMEs, the environment, R&D, employment and training, which fall beyond the strict remit of economic efficiency, but promote the better preparation of economic actors and Member States for the internal market."
"Lastly, I disagree with the rapporteur's call for the codecision procedure to be extended to this field. I welcome the amendments that have been adopted in various individual votes which, although the rapporteur might not like it, have significantly improved the final text of the resolution."
"That concludes voting time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.40 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Mr President, I have just seen the verbatim report of the extraordinary debate on Tuesday morning on the Europarl website, and I noticed that the written statements that some Members, including myself, although I was not the only one, had made under Rule 120 of the Rules of Procedure, were quite simply deleted."
"I am told that Rule 120 did not apply, and also that the very Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament did not apply during that extraordinary debate."
"I find this to be very questionable reasoning that we could debate for some time and, in any case, in fairness, I think that it was a sufficiently important debate for written statements to be accepted from Members who were not able to take the floor."
"I am therefore speaking on my own behalf but also on behalf of other Members and, Mr President, I would like our written statements, which were issued within the required time, to be annexed to the debate."
"Mr Berthu, your remark does not pertain to the Minutes for yesterday. Nonetheless, it has been noted and a response will be provided when appropriate."
"Mr President, further to a statement by Mr Gorostiaga last Monday, I wish to make one point clear."
"Mr Gorostiaga referred to a report by the United Nations Committee Against Torture, and subsequently sent an e-mail to all Members of the House."
"I shall forward the aforementioned committee's full report to Members of the House so they can read for themselves the positive comments on action taken in Spain in recent years."
"A number of adjustments have been made to legislation in order to prevent torture."
"I should also like to emphasise that in my view it is somewhat surprising that Mr Gorostiaga himself should be condemning torture when he has failed to condemn the sustained attack on human rights we are enduring in the Basque Country."
"This is particularly true for those of us holding elected office."
"The most significant torture is actually that perpetrated by ETA terrorists as they murder, blackmail and kidnap."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0369/2002) by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Regulation on extending the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 to nationals of third countries who are not already covered by these provisions solely on the grounds of their nationality [COM(2002) 59 - C5-0084/2002 - 2002/0039(CNS)]."
"Mr President, it is with mixed feelings that I stand here, not because this debate failed to be concluded before lunch and I am due to give a speech this evening in my own country, but because on the one hand, I am pleased and delighted that we today managed to settle an issue that will be concluded successfully in the Council of Ministers and on the other, I would have taken the greatest pleasure in defending what we believe ourselves entitled to as a Parliament - and for which I would have been quite happy to go to the Court of Justice - namely the legal basis underlying Regulation 1408, which involves codecision."
"I did not do this and I am also grateful to my fellow MEPs who were dissuaded from fighting this battle."
"Why are we not facing the battle?"
"Because of the great importance of extending the regulation to include third-country nationals and due to the fact that something is finally being done about the legal position of those who reside legally in a European Member State but who subsequently, when they live or work elsewhere, have no rights whatsoever."
"The European Court of Justice has said several times that the coordination regulation should apply to these legally resident citizens as well."
"The Commission has submitted a directive, an amendment to a regulation, on this very subject."
"It chose to use a different legal basis but failed to get the Council to ratify it."
"I am indebted to the Commission, but also, as I have already stated, to my fellow MEPs, for deciding to turn their backs on envy and political squabbling and for opting, with good reason, to bring these citizens within the scope of Regulation 1408."
"I think that an institutional battle over what would have been the correct legal basis would have lasted for many years and would certainly not have benefited these people."
"We as Parliament have therefore seized the earliest opportunity - and I believe that the Council of Ministers will be taking a decision on 3 December next - to establish the rights of these citizens - their duties have already been set out."
"The fact that the Danes and even the British felt they should be involved in this regulation filled me with particular joy."
"It will in any event also create clarity, which is desperately needed."
"When the amendments will be adopted shortly, we will say to the Council that if further amendments are made to our opinion or if the legal position of the people concerned is changed, we will retain the right to join this institutional battle with the Council over these points."
"What we have included is just about acceptable, but in any event, it contains the serious warning that if things are not going as planned and as agreed, we will keep the avenue to the Court in Luxembourg open."
"I would once again like to thank all fellow MEPs who have worked on this system with great commitment and a great deal of dynamism and who, along with me, were prepared to support the Commission in this proposal."
"In addition, I should like to make an observation which concerns one of your officials, Mr Verschueren, who is at the moment unwell at home, but who, in my view, is the best spokesperson on behalf of the Commission on this subject matter."
"I should like to extend to him, via yourself, my warmest wishes for a very speedy recovery."
"I am certain that I am also doing this on behalf of the fellow MEPs who are working on this dossier."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, and the MEPs for the excellent report and for their support for the Commission proposal."
"It is an extremely important proposal and its adoption would be a significant political signal from the Union regarding the integration of third-country nationals legally residing in the European Union, since it offers them, in terms of social security, the same protection which Community citizens moving within the European Union enjoy."
"It is therefore a major contribution to a balanced, coherent Community immigration policy."
"On 27 October 1999, this House called for prompt action regarding the fair treatment of third-country nationals legally residing in the Member States, so that they might be granted rights similar to those enjoyed by citizens of the Union."
"The proposal in question responds to this call and goes even further, granting third-country nationals rights that are identical, and not just similar, to those enjoyed by Community citizens moving within the European Union."
"The proposal will also encourage worker mobility, the importance of which was illustrated by the Commission's action plan presented at the start of the year."
"The proposal will therefore simplify the rules, reducing the number of national and international instruments which govern the coordination of social security systems for this category of people."
"As the rapporteur rightly pointed out in her explanatory statement, this proposal for a regulation, based on Article 63(4) of the Treaty, aims to build a bridge."
"It simply extends the scope of Community regulations on social security to third-country nationals, regulations which are and will continue to be based on Article 42 of the Treaty."
"This means that, for any future amendments to Regulation 1408/71, Parliament will continue to be a codecision-maker."
"As you know, the Commission proposal already contains a recital which refers to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but I agree that there is a need for a specific reference to Article 34(2) of the Charter."
"The Commission is therefore able to support Amendment No 1."
"I fully agree with the assertion that the coordination of social security for third-country nationals is of great importance, but this is so obvious that it - and likewise a recital in this regard - is superfluous."
"The importance of coordinating social security systems for third-country nationals is already amply conveyed in the first nine recitals proposed by the Commission."
"While it agrees with the underlying concept, the Commission therefore cannot accept Amendment No 2."
"I understand that it is appropriate to refer to the forthcoming, imminent enlargement of the European Union in the recitals: the Commission can therefore accept Amendment No 3."
"It is, however, unable to support Amendments Nos 4 and 5."
"With regard to Amendment No 4, it must be said that it is inappropriate to refer in a regulation to a proposal for a Community instrument, the outcome of which is still unknown."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 5 for a number of reasons."
"First of all, the aim of the proposal is to grant third-country nationals legally residing in a Member State the same rights as Community citizens moving within the Union."
"Amendment No 5 seeks to grant third-country nationals different rights to those given to Community citizens."
"I do not see why an Afghan or Indian worker, in the Netherlands or Finland for example, should have to face profoundly different problems - owing to unfamiliarity with the language and/or with the administrative procedures in the host country - from those faced by a Greek or Portuguese colleague."
"The Commission will also launch a vigorous information campaign and, once the proposal has been adopted, all those concerned will be made aware of it so that they can assert their rights when the time comes."
"Moreover, there is already a high degree of media interest in this proposal."
"Lastly, Mr President, I am extremely grateful to this House for having included the proposal on today's agenda, thereby enabling the Council to formally adopt it at the meeting on 3 December."
"You will understand that the Commission does not have enough time to submit an amended proposal to the Council, but my fellow Commissioner, Mrs Diamantopoulou, intends to recommend that the Council adopts the proposal together with those of Parliament's amendments which we have just accepted."
"Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to join the rapporteur in welcoming the prospect of implementing such a legislative provision, i.e. a position on the substance of the draft text."
"Indeed it was high time, and the European Commission had a political responsibility towards the people affected by this draft regulation, particularly since the Tampere European Council in October 1999, which had established, in its conclusions, the need to take swift measures to ensure that nationals from third countries living legally in the European Union are treated equally."
"What we welcome is the respect for equal treatment for residents of third countries with regard to Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 and the social equality resulting from it which, as has been said, provides quite substantial help towards integrating them but also encourages mobility."
"We are aware that this mobility, which we talk about so much, is much more difficult to put into practice than free movement of property and goods."
"I would like to stress, because it should be done, the important contribution that the residents of third countries make to the European Union, both in terms of boosting the economy and in terms of a rich cultural diversity and when we talk about them we are potentially talking about around 13 million people in the Union."
"That is not an insignificant number."
"However, like the rapporteur, I would like to draw your attention to the issue of the legal basis chosen by the European Commission following pressure from the Council."
"The European Parliament had the consultation procedure imposed on it, whereas the first proposal in 1997 was based on Article 51, now Article 42, which assumes codecision."
"That decision, the motivation for which seems to be more than questionable, as pointed out by the rapporteur, and therefore contestable, in fact places the European Parliament in a dilemma, that it can only solve by giving in, because that is exactly what is happening here."
"And unfortunately, it is not the first time that there has been an attempt to genuinely dismantle, as we could describe it, the prerogatives of our institution, which could be seen as a dangerous precedent."
"I fear that there is an underlying trend, and I think that our institution will have to be vigilant."
"The Commission, following the Council's recommendations, knows full well that Parliament is going to choose the path of pragmatism, and that it will prefer to abandon what you, Madam, called, legal hair-splitting, in order not to endanger urgent Community legislation."
"We would not like to take responsibility for the failure of something that we desire."
"We do not wish to cross swords, but the question is there: in the future, should we penalise the citizens who are awaiting decisions from this House simply in order to ensure that Parliament's position is respected?"
"I think that this decision, the quite reasonable position of the European Parliament, should be used to help discussions on matters that will arise in the future or that we know are already being considered by the Council."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group and on behalf of Jean Lambert, I want to warmly congratulate the rapporteur on her report."
"We fully support Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's approach, including the way she handled the legal basis."
"I think it important that agreements reached by way of European coordination now also apply to third-country nationals."
"Speaking quite honestly, it is a scandal that such was not already the case, in view of the fact that these people do indeed pay taxes and social security contributions, but then find themselves falling between two stools when working across frontiers."
"Parliament has already expressed its desire that the Tampere conclusions should be transposed into real action in a similar way as regards the rights of third-country nationals."
"The regulation that we are now discussing has to do with cross-border working, but the others, a naturally far larger category, also have to have their social rights secured in the same way as those of workers originating from the European Union."
"My group hopes that the struggle that must still be engaged in will lead to the necessary consensus being reached in this House."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the Commission statement on climate change."
"Mr President, thank you for inviting the Commission to report to this House on the New Delhi Conference on Climate Change held in October 2002."
"I wish to begin by saying that the European Union adopted a strong and unified position during the talks and we would like to thank the Danish Presidency for its excellent work."
"The Commission is also pleased to acknowledge the sound political support it received from the NGOs present at the meeting."
"However, the Commission and my colleague Mrs Wallström particularly want to express our appreciation of the European Parliament's ongoing support for the EU's position in international climate negotiations and your continuing interest in this issue."
"That interest was reflected by your dedicated parliamentary delegation led by Mrs García-Orcoyen Tormo in New Delhi."
"We hope to continue our effective cooperation in the future."
"Around 170 countries, representing over three-quarters of the world's population, met in New Delhi for their eighth regular meeting as parties to the United Nation's Framework Convention on Climate Change."
"The meeting made good progress on a number of technical issues, such as monitoring and reporting, and paved the way for the use of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)."
"The CDM is an important tool for reaching emission targets in developed countries and, at the same time, for reducing emissions in the developing world and contributing to its sustainable growth."
"During the final ministerial part of the meeting, ministers and senior officials discussed the actions taken so far to combat climate change, the links between climate change and sustainable development and the disturbing findings of the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which show that most of the acceleration in global warming is man-made."
"They also debated the need for further action to continue the fight against climate change."
"The meeting ended with the adoption of the Delhi Declaration."
"Allow me to briefly outline the Commission's political assessment of the New Delhi Conference."
"The Delhi Ministerial Declaration represents the political outcome of the conference."
"Although it includes the call for all countries to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and underlines the need for greater efforts to combat climate change in the coming decades, we would have liked it to be stronger in other areas."
"Let me briefly address some shortcomings."
"First, the Delhi Declaration fails to underline the need for a closer link between science and policy action."
"The findings of the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirm that more emission cuts are needed if the ultimate objective of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is to be attained."
"This must be used as an important input for furthering the work of the climate change convention and the Kyoto Protocol."
"A science-based approach will give us more confidence in our policy scenarios for the future being on the right track."
"Secondly, our mandate as agreed by the Council on 17 October was to seek a forward-looking discussion on more inclusive and longer-term global cooperation based on broader and balanced action and participation consistent with the ultimate objective of the Convention."
"Such discussions should have started at the Conference of the Parties at its first session after the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol."
"Regrettably, the EU did not succeed in persuading other parties to recognise the need for starting such a process."
"However, through a number of bilateral contacts with other parties and groups of parties the EU did seize every opportunity to explain our way of thinking."
"The issue is now on the table and these discussions have provided a solid foundation on which we can build."
"A third but more general point is that the debate in Delhi tended to focus on sustainable development rather than on climate change."
"While there is a clear understanding in the EU that climate change is strongly linked to sustainable development, the UN framework convention on climate change is about just that."
"It is the framework for climate change which is well defined and in place."
"We should not allow the sustainable development discussion to distract us from the climate change process."
"Following this conference, what prospects can we see for the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol?"
"This is obviously a crucial question."
"As you know this requires ratification by 55 parties representing at least 55% of the CO2 emissions of the industrialised countries in 1990."
"The first threshold has been largely met - 97 countries as of 13 November - as ratification continues steadily."
"In this context, we gladly welcome the confirmation by Canada that they will soon ratify."
"However, we have only reached a figure of 37.4% for the second threshold."
"Given that the EU, Japan and almost all the candidate countries have now ratified, this means that ratification by Russia is necessary to bring the Protocol into effect."
"It seems that Russia is still inclined to ratify, especially after the results of the recently published study on the effects of climate change in that country."
"However, a final decision has yet to be made and no specific timetable has been set out."
"It is the Commission's intention to continue to encourage Russia to live up to its responsibility as a key player on climate change and to ratify the Kyoto Protocol as soon as possible."
"Internally, the Commission will proceed within the framework of the European Climate Change Programme to enable the European Union to meet its emissions reductions targets as agreed."
"Internationally, on the other hand, the Commission will continue its efforts to encourage our partners to ratify the Kyoto Protocol so that it can enter into force."
"At the same time we will also continue to build on the good bilateral relationships we have established with some developing countries and with the majority of the developed countries in order to reach a better understanding on what needs to be done in the future."
"Everybody knows that the Kyoto Protocol is only the first step in the fight against climate change and we have to start to discuss how to proceed beyond it."
"I would like to conclude by stressing once again how deeply grateful the Commission is for the Parliament's support and for its very dedicated presence in Delhi itself."
"Mr President, I shall attempt the trick of representing two people here today - myself and Mrs Corbey, who was present at the New Delhi conference."
"That does not mean that I shall convey two different messages. Instead, I shall try to make the message as stringent as possible."
"Having read the Commission's and Parliament's report on the New Delhi conference, there is a question that keeps going round in my head."
"What is it that causes us, or the EU, to fail in communicating our message and our desire for change to, above all, the developing countries?"
"Why is the United States more successful in doing so?"
"The United States's message is, at least in our eyes, worse in terms of combating the climate change that is under way."
"It is essential for the EU now jointly to begin to reflect upon how it might try to reduce the credibility gap that in actual fact exists between ourselves and those whom we wish to get on our side."
"That also applies to the possibility of ratifying the Kyoto Protocol."
"These all no doubt constitute the most important aspects of our continued strategy for trying to progress further."
"It is, above all, a question of making further progress with the important work that will now commence when this part of the Kyoto Protocol has been concluded."
"Mrs Corbey, who was present at the New Delhi conference, made some notes that I think are worth communicating to the House."
"They are, above all, about the Kyoto process in actual fact constituting a serious political danger because political support for the whole process is evaporating."
"There are two essential aspects to trying to increase political support again and to raising the issue for discussion at a more subtle and serious level."
"One factor, for example, is the one I have just addressed, namely the situation in the developing countries and our relations with those countries."
"At the New Delhi conference, quite a few of them reported extreme weather conditions."
"It was not just one country but a number that did so, and they also expressed opinions as to what costs the situation would entail."
"Even though we in the EU cannot accept responsibility for all these forms of climate change, we must nonetheless regard ourselves as one of the parties which, together with the rest of the industrialised world, has contributed most to creating the climate change now under way."
"We must adopt a clearer role in helping the developing countries to protect themselves against climate change."
"We must, of course, also help them find ways of making progress in terms of development that are not merely a case of taking the route that we ourselves do not consider to have been entirely successful."
"What is perhaps most important is that, in spite of everything, the EU should continue to push for something's happening after 2012 and that we should not give up, in spite of the surrounding world's actually wanting something different."
"That is perhaps the most important message to have come out of the New Delhi conference."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to start by congratulating the European Parliament delegation to the New Delhi Conference and I would single out Mrs Garcia-Orcoyen Tormo, who led the delegation."
"I am sorry that once again the Commission and the Council did not allow Parliament's delegation to participate in the EU coordination meetings."
"We knew, even before the Conference started, that the outcome would be extremely hard to achieve: this Conference was designed to prepare for the second phase of the Kyoto Protocol, whereas the political priority is still, unfortunately, to ensure that the Kyoto Protocol enters into force in order for the first phase to begin."
"Although it is regrettable that no result was achieved, it should nevertheless be highlighted that we managed to improve the definition of the Clean Development Mechanism and of emissions monitoring procedures."
"What I believe to be more serious is not so much the failure to reach an outcome but rather the political attempt to water down the Kyoto Protocol."
"There was a definite attempt by some delegations, specifically the delegation representing the United States, to take the debate on climate change backwards in time to 1997, when there were neither targets nor protocols intended to achieve action."
"It is also a pity that the developing countries have fallen into this trap."
"It is precisely in the developing countries that the consequences of climate change are having the most damaging effects."
"We believe the choice remains clear: firstly, the Kyoto Protocol is the only instrument capable of mitigating climate change."
"Secondly, the second phase of the Protocol must be set even more ambitious targets than the first phase, which represents only a tiny step forwards."
"Thirdly, action must first be undertaken in the industrialised countries and only later in the developing countries."
"Mr President, this was the first time I had taken part in one of these delegations."
"I found it fascinating, but also frustrating."
"As has been said, this 8th Conference of the Parties to the Climate Change Convention in New Delhi was intended to be a transitional one - more a matter of keeping the momentum going on the climate change debate than making headline political decisions."
"I concur with what colleagues have said and also express my frustration with the exclusion of the parliamentary delegation from the daily coordination meetings."
"As a result, the Commission ended the last day trying to exclude us from the press conference, albeit very politely and diplomatically."
"When we parliamentarians were briefed that morning, we indicated our frustration with the weakness of the draft declaration."
"The Commission did not want us to express that view at a press conference when it was taking what it thought was a more diplomatic line."
"These differences would not arise if we were part of the coordination meeting and on the inside."
"The Commission was very good to us in that it gave us briefings outside the loop, but we need to be inside the loop if we are to be involved and if we are to be described as 'members as participants in the European Community delegation'."
"The Council and the Commission were on one side and Parliament on the other."
"The draft declaration itself was rather weak and disappointing."
"The title was changed from 'The Declaration on Climate Change' to 'Declaration on Climate Change and Sustainability'."
"That is a precedent we have to be careful of. It is very hard to talk about these issues, be objective and keep the focus on climate change if it is suggested that sustainable development is not included."
"It is a sort of 'hit-me-with-a-child-in-my-arms' argument, i.e. how can you justify what you are saying if you do not include sustainable development?"
"The Americans and others used the serious issue of sustainable development to divert focus from climate change and from the Kyoto Protocol requirements in general."
"It was a fascinating exercise."
"I would like to thank the leader of our delegation, Mrs García-Orcoyen Tormo, and all colleagues for making it that."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what Mrs Doyle said gives great cause for concern in terms of both procedure and the subject matter, and it is this latter aspect which I would like to consider for a moment."
"We are in a situation where agreements on the environment are never observed: the most striking example is the Kyoto Agreement."
"I hope that the Commission will reflect on its future approach to cooperation with Members of Parliament - including outside the European Union - but above all, with regard to the subject matter, I hope that it will work much harder to preserve the conditions necessary for the survival not just of the European Union and its almost 400 million inhabitants - which soon will exceed 400 million - but of the whole planet."
"While I am anything but anti-American, I nevertheless feel that great pressure needs to be exerted on President Bush's administration so that issues such as the climate, climate change and the environment are given more attention and not just addressed from a financial perspective and with a narrow rather than a far-sighted monetary approach."
"We should work much harder in this respect, and I trust the Commission will do so."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the statement by the Commission on the implementation of the so-called Erika package on maritime safety, and on the action required to deal with socio-economic and environmental disasters."
". (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate ought never to have been necessary."
"Sadly, the Commission has today been proved right."
"The Commission proposed the speedy withdrawal of old-fashioned single-hull tankers some time ago."
"Unfortunately the Council did not follow our advice."
"It failed to act with the necessary urgency and adopt the Commission's proposals following discussion with Parliament."
"Had it done so, the Prestige would have been banned since 1 September 2002."
"It would therefore never have broken up and sunk off the coast of Europe."
"There are lessons to be learnt from all this."
"Those were my very words when the Erika sank off the coast of Brittany."
"I must reiterate them today, as we discuss the case of the Prestige which sunk off Spain, off the coast of Galicia to be precise."
"There are lessons to be learnt and measures to be taken."
"The first lesson is crystal clear."
"Speed is of the essence, and so are determination and decisive action."
"These situations need to be dealt with once and for all, to ensure no further similar tragedies happen."
"The immediate action required is obvious."
"The authorities must compensate those affected and they must undertake the clean-up operation required to return the coast to its previous condition."
"I will remind the House that this is a particularly rich coast, both in terms of fish and shellfish production and from an environmental point of view."
"Almost all of it is covered by Natura 2002."
"So, the affected areas need to be cleaned and restored."
"The chain of events leading to the disaster must also be traced."
"It should be borne in mind that back in 1997 a number of oil companies rejected this vessel, on the grounds that it was dangerous and unsafe."
"It appears that the last time the vessel underwent an inspection as required in the European Union under the Paris Memorandum was in 1999."
"Furthermore, the vessel had put into two European ports before this summer. Regrettably, in neither of these was it inspected as required."
"It is important to study all the links in the chain and establish what exactly happened and where responsibility lies."
"The lessons to be learnt to prevent a repeat of such situations should then become clear."
"The present situation involves a vessel with a Greek owner, flying the flag of the Bahamas, inspected by a United States classification society and managed by a Swiss company."
"It has links with other countries too, all of which offer substantial tax advantages."
"We are called on to take all the urgent action in our power to prevent a further tragedy of this kind."
"That involves the immediate application and implementation of agreements and directives adopted by European Union Ministers."
"Application of the Erika I package cannot wait until June of next year, nor can the Erika II package be left until February of 2004."
"They must be put into practice now."
"They must be made effective, which means meeting the target of inspection of 25% of vessels entering a port by the port authorities, 25% of the most dangerous vessels, those posing the greatest risk."
"The standards specified in existing provisions must be applied."
"Single-hull tankers must be replaced by double-hull ones as a matter of urgency."
"The Community system for following up information on maritime traffic in all areas must be set up at the earliest opportunity."
"Steps should also be taken to facilitate emergency intervention, by designating protection areas, mooring areas and areas for emergency shelter."
"The European Maritime Safety Agency should start operations too. It is tasked with ensuring that the correct procedures are followed in all European ports, and also with providing technical support to the various countries and to the Commission."
"Discussions with the COPE Fund ought to be pursued. This fund was set up for the specific purpose of covering compensation and the cost of restoring and cleaning the environment."
"This is over and above standard compensation."
"It complements the FIPOL Fund."
"In addition, at the next Council of Ministers meeting on 6 December, as an urgent measure, I shall propose the adoption of an administrative decision by all Member States of the Union to ensure that heavy fuel oil is only transported in double-hull tankers during the transitional period until single-hull tankers are phased out as already planned."
"Heavy fuel oil is after all the most polluting of all these products."
"Each of the vessels involved in the latest three accidents, namely the Erika, the Baltic and the Prestige, was an old-fashioned single-hull tanker carrying heavy fuel oil."
"Heavy fuel oil is the most dangerous product."
"Consequently, stricter safety measures are needed."
"This could easily be achieved through an administrative decision by the governments of the Member States."
"We need to go further."
"That means working to increase the FIPOL and COPE Funds."
"It also means persevering with the Commission's work on future criminal sanctions in the European area."
"Going further also means that port authorities should improve the application of the directive on inspection."
"It has been shown that there are ports where hardly any inspection takes place."
"These could almost be termed ports of convenience."
"This amounts to taking fraudulent advantage of the present situation and has to be stopped."
"In addition, going further means reconsidering the basis of international maritime law at global level within the framework of the International Maritime Organisation."
"International maritime law is based on Nineteenth Century principles, yet here we are in the Twentieth Century, when our seas are criss-crossed daily by hundreds of thousands of vessels loaded with cargoes that are highly dangerous because of their volume or content."
"A century and a half ago this just did not happen."
"Going further also means strengthening the rights of coastal states in the 200-mile zone, and in straits."
"In particular, these rights need to be strengthened so that they can be defended against the risks of those particularly dangerous cargoes."
"Ladies and gentlemen, going further should also mean talking to our neighbours."
"I have in mind those who share with us a common interest in certain enormously fragile seas."
"For example, the Baltic which we share with Russia, the Mediterranean, and the Black Sea."
"We should cooperate with Russia and with other states in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa."
"In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that the Prestige disaster need never have happened."
"As a Commission, we did everything in our power to prevent it."
"We were unsuccessful, but we must ensure no second Erika or second Prestige founders off our coasts."
"We must also strive to ensure that such incidents do not occur along the coasts of other seas, off other continents."
"We should remember that the seas are a common heritage, and that our concern has to extend to their farthest reaches."
"Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, as a native of Galicia I feel devastated."
"I am quite overcome by the spectacle unfolding before us."
"As a politician, I am keenly aware of the heavy responsibility we bear as Members of this House. We are charged with defending the interests of our constituents and we must succeed in so doing."
"Vague statements and half-truths simply will not do any longer."
"As the Commissioner said, this has to be the last tragedy at sea."
"I should indeed like to begin by commending Commissioner de Palacio on her work."
"To all intents and purposes, before she was appointed there was no such thing as a European policy on maritime safety."
"We now have a substantial package of measures on the table, namely Erika I and Erika II."
"The question as to whether these measures are adequate and whether they are being applied correctly has already been raised in the House."
"Clearly, the answer is no."
"The European Parliament must unite and throw its political weight behind the European Commission."
"It has to send out a clear signal."
"We need to work together to speed up implementation of these measures."
"They must come into force."
"The Commissioner referred to double hulls. The latter are compulsory in the United States, and had that been the case here, this accident probably would not have happened."
"The Commissioner also mentioned inspections at ports within the European Community, which is where we should start, and at all other ports in Europe and across the world."
"All ports should actually be monitored, be they colonies, tax havens or ports of convenience as some have been described."
"The Maritime Safety Agency has to start operating as soon as possible."
"Sadly, as a native of Galicia I am all too aware of the unfortunate record held by that part of Spain."
"Eight such accidents have taken place there over the last thirty years. Six of these accidents happened in the last twenty years."
"In Galicia the Atlantic coast of the Cape Finisterre area is known as the Coast of Death."
"The European Agency should be located in an area affected by maritime accidents."
"It should be in one that has experienced their consequences."
"Perhaps others could offer more than my region."
"Locating the Agency in Galicia could however go some way towards compensating the area."
"I know this falls outside the competence of both Parliament and the Commission, but I feel moved to express my thoughts aloud."
"In any case, the resolution calls for the establishment of special maritime fishing areas."
"Undoubtedly, Galicia does fall into that category because of its rich shellfish and fishing resources mentioned earlier, and also because of its diversity and marine ecosystem."
"We are eager to move what could be termed the lanes of death further away from where they now are."
"We want to prevent our sea from becoming a sewer."
"We want to prevent vessels that are no better than rusting hulks from sailing on it."
"The sea is Galicia's life. Galicia's economy is based on it and I could go so far as to say that its distinctive culture is too."
"Unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, that sea is now poisoned."
"These measures must be strictly implemented as from tomorrow."
"We must insist that Member States do so."
"Mr President, I really feel the time has come for European solidarity to make itself felt."
"I would recall that we have ourselves shown solidarity to other Member States in the past."
"We now call on them to respond in kind."
"Any assistance offered to Galicia will be welcome. I would like to refer in particular to the Solidarity Fund."
"I studied Article 2 and it certainly does apply in this instance, especially if the reports approved by the House are borne in mind."
"It should also be taken into account that Galicia is an Objective 1 region whose fish and shellfish resources represent more than 10% of its gross domestic product."
"Given that these are in danger of being totally wiped out for an unspecified period, Galicia does indeed meet the conditions for benefiting from the Solidarity Fund."
"In conclusion, I should like to assure the Commissioner that she can count on support from the Group of the European People's Party."
"Indeed I am sure the whole House will support her in her efforts."
"We need to be able to start doing what is required as of tomorrow. Then we shall never again have to regret accidents of this kind."
"Thank you in advance, ladies and gentlemen, for the support I am confident you will offer us."
"Mr President, I should first like to thank the Commissioner for her presence in the House today."
"It is evidence of the great interest I know she has in this issue which is causing such concern to us all."
"The Prestige was carrying twice as much crude oil in its tanks as the Erika."
"The oil slick it caused is already an economic, social and environmental disaster for Europe, especially for my home region."
"It represents a mayor problem for Europe and its consequences will be felt for many long years."
"More than 300 km of coastline have been polluted. Three further spills have been detected and the strong wind from the south-west is bringing them closer to the coast."
"Shellfish production, inshore fishing, aquaculture, tourism and the very image of Galicia have all been seriously affected."
"Galicia is known to be an area prone to oil spills, yet it remains unprotected, despite the fact that 70% of Europe's crude oil goes past its coastline."
"No effective lessons seem to have been learnt, even after enduring five oil spills."
"Sadly, it also has to be said that lack of equipment is currently hampering the efforts of many citizens eager to help."
"Pictures of hundreds of fishermen sewing together an enormous net four kilometres long to create an amateur device for holding back the oil speak volumes. So do pictures of people on beaches armed with buckets and spades."
"They show twenty-first century citizens coping with a nineteenth century disaster using Stone Age tools."
"Information has failed too."
"Spanish public opinion believes attempts were made to play down the gravity of the situation."
"This is in stark contrast to the grave concern expressed by European governments."
"The Commissioner rightly said that the disaster could have been prevented if European regulations had been applied."
"In addition, she stated that the Erika package will come into force in 2003."
"She went on to say, however, that despite Parliament's express wish to the contrary, vessels without protective ballast tanks will be able to ply the seas until 2012."
"Those that do have such protection will be permitted up to 2026."
"Furthermore, the requirement for double hulls does not apply to small tankers, so they will still be able to sail also."
"That is why I am delighted with the Commissioner's swift response."
"I welcome it and urge Member States in the Council to accept her proposals as a matter of urgency."
"Nonetheless, further action is needed."
"For example, tankers carrying dangerous goods should be required to set routes along the furthermost part of the shipping lane, and the Finisterre lane should be relocated away from the coast."
"It is certainly true that this issue calls for legislation at world level, but the European Union has to press ahead."
"The Socialist Group calls for a policy on transport and sustainable development based on the principle of maximum safety and prevention."
"Such a policy must reinforce cooperation within the Community, along with the means of inspection and safety standards."
"We reiterate the call for Community funds to be channelled to this disaster."
"Community aid must retain its credibility, however."
"You will recall that Galicia was recently let down when no Community agreement was reached with Morocco."
"The victims' interests must come first."
"We therefore believe that the European Solidarity Fund set up recently is the most appropriate instrument in this case, as it is flexible, immediate, and was devised as a Community instrument."
"Mr President, Commissioner, you stated a moment ago that the sea belongs to all of us, but I should like to see it only being used by people who respect it."
"This was clearly not the case here."
"I have to say, I am shocked and I should like to ask my fellow MEPs from that region to extend the sympathy of our group to everyone involved."
"As a legislator, I am furious, but also a little despondent because this is the second time that we have faced the same problem in less than three years."
"We do not yet have all the facts by a long way, but we have a few."
"The question I am asking is whether the Erika package is sufficient."
"The Erika package is clearly valuable and should enter into force at the earliest opportunity, but is it sufficient?"
"I have a question concerning airports."
"I mentioned airports and safe berthing places in one of my previous reports."
"I do not think that this legislation is completely incontrovertible."
"I should like to know, once we have all the facts, what we can do to improve the situation, so that a ship in distress is not turned down, which, I assume, exacerbated the situation, but can berth somewhere so that the disaster is kept down to an absolute minimum."
"Another reason why we should improve the situation is so that we can also mention compensation - something that was unmentionable in my report - for a port which suffers damage in this case."
"No provision has been made for this."
"We should do this."
"In fact, a start is only just being made."
"Secondly, as you have already stated, Commissioner, we are very weak internationally speaking."
"Would it not at long last be possible within the IMO and if necessary just for our own sake to work with a black list of states that allow their flags to be misused and in that way enhance the power of the port state?"
"Should we not reconsider all our options and use our influence to enhance the IMO's role in the process?"
"This is also a task for the Council; we cannot do this on our own."
"We therefore need to improve our rules."
"This applies to the Commission, the European Parliament, all the groups - party politics should not come into this - but also and, above all, the Council and Member States."
"However, we should, first and foremost, help the people involved and alleviate the despair in that region."
"I believe this to be the duty of the European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, my mother tongue is very rich in popular proverbs and sayings."
"One of those sayings, which my mother and my grandmothers would use when some irreversible domestic accident happened, was 'why cry over spilt milk?'."
"This saying is relevant here because we are once again having to express our regret at something we should have prevented through stricter control measures and by bringing forward the date for the disappearance of single-hull ships - and please note, Commissioner, that I wrote this before hearing you speak and I am therefore in agreement with what you said at the beginning."
"We must demand compliance with the laws we adopt, but also revise those which are not sufficiently rigorous."
"The wrecking of the Prestige once again damages an area which has suffered three serious accidents of this type over recent years: in 1976, the Urquiola, the Mar Egeo in 1992 and the Prestige this year."
"I have not yet been to Galicia - I am going tomorrow - but I am sure that one really needs to talk to the fishermen and shellfishermen in order to understand exactly the extent of the tragedy they are facing and their need for help, help which our Group is fully in favour of providing."
"But we must prevent anything like this from happening again, because, as well as the social and economic disaster it represents, it is an ecological disaster which affects areas belonging to the Natura 2000 network, biodiversity and the wealth of a region such as Galicia."
"Commissioner, when it comes to voting in this Parliament, we must remember this catastrophe, because in the coming months we are going to discuss a very important directive, which relates to responsibility for environmental damage, and all of us here will remember what it is we are voting for."
"Because there are times when stricter measures are required and there is much resistance - on the part of the lobbies present in this very House - to voting for these stricter, more serious and more rigorous measures."
"In the last few seconds remaining to me, Mr President, I would like to say - on behalf of my colleague, Ilda Figueiredo, who has had to leave - that she also would like to express her solidarity with the victims of the oil slick, that she demands more rigorous control measures in order to prevent it happening again, that she considers it important to establish a list of sensitive maritime areas and that they must be subject to special protection in Galicia, Brittany and, as she points out, Portugal as well - which is close by - and she insists that the Erika I and II packages must be applied, and their dates brought forward, and she requests effective measures against flags of convenience and the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund for the repair of environmental damage and compensation for the victims."
"Mr President, Galicia's national poet, Rosalia de Castro, who always felt great solidarity with the fate of the Galician people, coined the phrase 'black shadow' to express a sense of anguish that troubled her."
"Today Galicia, and also the whole of Europe, is suffering from the 'black shadow' caused by political irresponsibility and the contemptible interests of the mafias that control maritime traffic and flags of convenience."
"The Prestige disaster is now the fourth to have occurred off the coast of Galicia in recent years."
"The names 'Urquiola', 'Aegean Sea' and 'Casou' are, together with that of the Prestige, part of our consciousness and of our collective misfortunes."
"On the Coast of Death and in the Rias Baixas and the Rias Altas, these misfortunes are remembered even more sharply."
"Therefore, in these emergency situations, we, the men and women of Galicia wonder: what good to us is the Spanish State - the authority whose main task and responsibility at this historic time is to protect our people, our nature, the marvellous Galician nature, and our economy, the persistent and long-suffering Galician economy?"
"What good to us is the head of the State government who was absent from Galicia at a tragic time, whilst the inhabitants of the Coast of Death and the Rias were under attack from the Prestige, and who, to universal scorn, was in Prague with NATO, dining out and sycophantically applauding President Bush and his unilateral and 'preventive' strikes?"
"As a Galician and a supporter of European integration, I wonder, what major action have the Galician and EU authorities taken in this tragic situation?"
"It is precisely in this Parliament that reactionary positions by Members contributed - and in this context I must agree with the Commissioner - to changing the legislation contained in the 'Erika' package, which would have prevented this accursed ship from continuing to move around our seas."
"Let us not be under any illusion: this disaster has consequences identical to those of a natural disaster, but it is really a political disaster and we know who the guilty parties are."
"Mr President, the location of the European Safe Seas Agency has still not been decided on, in contravention of the 'Erika' legislation."
"Once again, the governments of the Member States have not been equal to the circumstances."
"Following what has happened in Galicia, can any doubt remain that the Agency should be based in a region in which there is the greatest concentration of intercontinental traffic and where there is the greatest risk of accident?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the 'Prestige' was a disaster waiting to happen and this is what makes the matter particularly intolerable and makes it all the more difficult for us to respond to the concerns, fear and desperation of the populations of Galicia and of the Minho in northern Portugal."
"This was a disaster waiting to happen because we know how enormously vulnerable our coasts are, particularly in Brittany, Galicia and in Portugal's seas, both in continental Portugal and in the seas around Madeira and the Azores, which are all busy maritime passages and crossroads."
"It was also bound to happen because of the appalling conditions in which many ships still sail, carrying dangerous and highly polluting cargoes, whilst we are hesitant and slow at European and world level about adopting rigorous and mandatory measures for prevention and guidance, confiscation and destruction."
"The disaster was bound to happen, lastly, because it could be seen that the Prestige would break up and sink, leaving questions as to whether the measures adopted at the time the emergency was declared one week ago and thereafter were correct and adequate."
"We now have a time-bomb sitting at the bottom of the sea; nobody really knows what it is going to do and at the same time the ecological, social and economic effects of the spilt fuel are already terrible for hundreds of kilometres of coastline and the threat hanging over the coast, the river estuaries and the immediate future of hundreds of thousands of people who are directly and indirectly affected, both our Galician brethren and those in the north of Portugal, who are praying for the danger to recede, is enormous."
"We must provide three types of response: to the present, to the future and to the past."
"We must respond to the present in four ways: we must mobilise all available means to monitor and minimise the polluting effects, rigorously investigate the risks arising from the sunken ship with 60 000 tonnes of oil in its tanks and keep them under strict control, we must make those responsible pay, provide sympathetic help for the frightened and worried populations by giving them all the help they need and by assisting the recovery of the local economy."
"Next, we must respond to the future: we must get the European Safe Seas Agency up and running - I personally would like it to be based in Portugal - and increase resources for port and coastal inspection."
"Commissioner, do not hesitate: go right ahead."
"Parliament and the Council must prove themselves able to provide what these communities are calling for."
"Lastly, we must respond to the past: preventing future disasters of this scale and more effectively limiting the damage caused require all the facts and the reactions to such disasters to be verified and established objectively and rigorously, enabling us to make a technical assessment of whether the reactions were right or wrong."
"We must assure ourselves that in the face of any similar emergency in future, all the competent authorities will be able to respond rapidly and courageously in the way that most effectively anticipates real environmental damage and risks and consequently is most able to limit and control these."
"Mr President, everything was said here during the months following the sinking of the Erika, on waste boats, the inadequacy of checks and the complacency of the flag states."
"We voted on two blocks of measures."
"Many of them are good."
"However, nothing has changed, and while Parliament is talking, every day vessels set out into the Ouessant lane ready to pour out their oil onto the coasts of the Vendée or Galicia if by chance there is a storm."
"As a lawyer, before joining Parliament, I spent hundreds of hours with the victims of the Erika, professionals and local groups."
"Tomorrow, will I have to go back and say to them: 'we are moved, very moved, but we cannot be effective in less than three years because of codecision'?"
"Commissioner, you were just saying: 'I want it hic et nunc', but the system replies: 'non possumus'."
"So while the Americans protected themselves in a few months, with immediate measures, we take years to adopt measures with a delayed effect, the content of which will ultimately be inadequate."
"Inadequate for two reasons."
"First of all, because the Treaties do not allow the countries that are threatened, such as France and Spain or Portugal, to protect themselves unilaterally and rapidly when circumstances require it, and equally because those countries have to admit defeat with countries for whom maritime safety is not a priority."
"Also, because we will not have done anything until we have forced the oil companies to take prime responsibility for transporting their goods, so that security is ensured by rich companies that are well-known and laying their reputation on the line, and not by ship owners with no identity or nationality."
"Mr President, what happened off the coast of Galicia was indeed dramatic and we must express our support for the people and our honourable friends from the area; of course, for me it is doubly dramatic because, by coincidence, this has happened in the country of the Commissioner responsible for transport who, as we all know, has made a tremendous effort to improve safety at sea."
"Be that as it may, I think it is up to all of us here to investigate what happened and why it happened as quickly as possible and of course it is not easy to draw any conclusions when you have a ship flying under the flag of the Bahamas, a country which, I may remind you, is not on the black list, it is hardly even on the grey list of the so-called Paris ??U, a ship operated by a Liberian company, owned by a Greek and registered with an American shipping register, in fact one of the best shipping registers in the world, a ship which was built in China, comes from Latvia and Russia, was fitted out in Gibraltar and so on and so forth."
"So we need to find out who of all these was or was not to blame and we must, of necessity, be level-headed and persistent."
"I think that we will get to the bottom of this in the end and the European Commission will be a great help here."
"So what do we need to do next?"
"We obviously need a set of measures."
"I have been talking with a number of Members over recent days who are all in favour of double hulls."
"Others want port controls, others are talking about the responsibility of the shipping registers and flags of convenience, others still point to the lack of ports of refuge."
"I think that those of us who happen to deal with these issues on a daily basis know that there is no universal panacea."
"There is no panacea, ladies and gentlemen, we need a set of measures, we need to proceed on all these fronts at once."
"If we are to do something about this, I think that, first, the European Commission needs to be strict in applying the Community legislation which is already in place."
"Countries which do not comply with Community legislation should be hauled before the Court of Justice and I think Mrs Palacio will do so."
"Secondly, we really must speed up the application of the Erika I and Erika II packages."
"We adopted 5 directives almost unanimously here in Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, and they obviously need to be applied, together with a previous directive on dumping waste at sea which - theoretically - is being applied."
"Now all that remains is to see if it is being applied in practice."
"We also need to push ahead with the European Commission's other proposal on a European Solidarity Fund."
"May I remind you that the European Parliament approved these proposals by the European Commission and that the proposal has stuck with the Council."
"So pressure needs to be brought to bear on the Council."
"I totally agree with a ban on the carriage of heavy petroleum products by single-hull tankers."
"May I remind you that, as rapporteur, I personally proposed this when we were discussing withdrawing single-hull vessels."
"Unfortunately, it is recorded in the Minutes of the European Parliament but was not accepted because certain know-it-alls popped up left, right and centre and said that the proposal was not feasible."
"I believed it was feasible then and I believe it is feasible now and that you should move in this direction, Commissioner."
"What Mr Sterckx said about environmentally sensitive areas is also right."
"We need to mark out corridors for tankers so as to ensure that these areas are not polluted."
"Most importantly at this stage the European Union needs to show its solidarity with the people of Galicia."
"We need to help these people."
"We have the Structural Funds, we have the Solidarity Fund and we need to do our very best to help Galicia get back to normal as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, the 'Prestige' tanker disaster is an appalling tragedy."
"We must show solidarity here, and - as our Portuguese and Spanish colleagues should know - it must be tangible rather than abstract."
"That is why the region and the people there need assistance from Europe quickly."
"I do not think that anyone would question this."
"We should be aware, however, that this disaster could be repeated any day, Commissioner, because for years it has been the same old story."
"The combination of an ancient tanker that is only fit for the scrap heap and a flag of convenience - this time of the Bahamas - is usually the cause."
"Flags of convenience are synonymous with poor quality, a poor vessel, poor technology and a poor crew."
"Usually the story ends with a coordinated reluctance to claim responsibility so that no one knows any more who is actually to blame for what."
"That, Commissioner, is the reason for Paragraph 3 of our motion."
"As soon as all of the information is on the table, we will expect to receive a report from you stating who was responsible for this disaster, when, how and why."
"I think that a few words will also have to be reserved for the Spanish authorities in this context."
"I have been surprised at some of the statements made by ministers of transport over the last few days and at the demands that they are now making."
"Clearly these transport ministers have forgotten that, for example, the regulation on compensation in cases of liability for oil pollution, which the Commission and Parliament have passed, has been lying on the table in the Council for over a year without any action being taken."
"Commissioner, you have Parliament's full support if you want to put a bomb under these gentlemen in the Council so that we finally get legislation soon."
"Where incidents of this kind are concerned, we have to call to account the oil companies, the shipowners, the cargo owners and the classification societies."
"The system of flags of convenience cannot continue in its present form, Commissioner."
"I appeal to you to consider making a proposal on this."
"We need European shipping; we need good European vessels with good European crews."
"Flags of convenience are a blight on the system."
"Help to eradicate them by making a good Commission proposal."
"Parliament will give it speedy consideration."
"Mr President, I as an EU citizen feel greatly affected by the fact that it was possible for this disaster to take place."
"This is yet another disaster, although we said after the last one that it was too late to lock the stable door after the horse had bolted."
"The stable door had clearly not been locked."
"The facts had not been sufficiently spelled out, something for which the politicians are at fault."
"I agree with Mrs de Palacio when she states that the Council has failed to assume its responsibility."
"It has done a disservice to the people who live along the Spanish coast, a disservice to the fishing industry, a disservice to the environment and, above all, a disservice to transport by water, a topic to which we want to devote so much attention."
"It is particularly unfortunate that we need another disaster to put this topic on the agenda."
"I also think that we should adopt this resolution and that we all need to ensure that it is accepted across the political spectrum so as to avoid another repeat."
"After all, citizens are not concerned with which political body is responsible for this."
"They are left to pick up the pieces, so they need help."
"I think it is our joint duty to keep a very close eye on this and also to monitor the implementation of the solution of the problem which we are now facing."
"I see that the first towed hopper dredges are now at work."
"However, according to the weather forecast, the winds will pick up this evening and then we are back to square one tomorrow."
"In short, I hope that, given this thick crude oil, you will also ensure that oil can possibly be drained from the actual tanker."
"Mr President, I am speaking here on behalf of Mr Dhaenen, my Flemish and Green colleague, who is a member of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"First of all, I should like to put on record my and our solidarity with the people in Galicia."
"This is a social tragedy for those who live by the sea and tourism."
"The true scale of this economic and ecological disaster is starting to dawn ever more clearly."
"A true catastrophe is unfolding before our eyes."
"Galicia's green coast is gradually turning black."
"The indignation is growing by the hour."
"Everyone is asking how this is possible after all those previous disasters."
"The disaster involving the Erika is still fresh in our memories and the wreck of the Amoco Cadiz in 1978 awakened an environmental awareness in many of my generation."
"Every time a disaster strikes, we are faced with the disastrous consequences of negligence."
"It is a disgrace that the agency for maritime safety is not to be launched until some time next year."
"It is a disgrace that port control should only be scant and, in many cases, implemented in a questionable manner."
"It is a disgrace that single-hulled wrecks should still be bobbing their way around the oceans and that they should take their course past vulnerable regions."
"There is something fundamentally wrong with our transport sector."
"I would quote Mr Rijnigerd, a former director of the Rotterdam-based recovery firm Smit, who stated that 'trying to transport an oil shipment as cheaply as possible from Latvia to Gibraltar in an obsolete and poorly maintained tanker is asking for trouble'."
"There are therefore bad apples that need to be removed."
"They are sharks that slip through the net."
"However, we should admit that the net that is supposed to catch them is yet to be put in place."
"We as Greens support more transport by water, but those highways at sea should not be accessible to cowboys and environmental criminals."
"We would argue in favour of less transport, less use of fossil fuels and more involvement by a greater, fully-fledged, ecological European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to begin, of course, by expressing my solidarity with the communities that have been affected."
"On these occasions, we must focus on what is most urgent: the need to mobilise technical and financial resources in order to minimise environmental damage, to regenerate ecosystems and to support the economic activities that have been affected by this accident."
"There is, however, a debate which, although not quite as urgent, is nonetheless of the utmost importance: that of responsibility."
"In this matter, the 'polluter pays' rule must be enforced, by investigating, prosecuting and punishing those responsible."
"We must, however, go beyond looking for someone to blame."
"We must determine the responsibility, firstly of those who should have inspected but did not and of those who did inspect but did not act."
"Secondly, we must determine the responsibility of those who managed the crisis, in particular, we must clarify the reason why the EU as a whole was not involved in managing the risk from the very outset, given that it was known that the consequences of the accident would easily move beyond the confines of one country and would affect the entire natural heritage of Europe."
"As for the future, I hope that the Member States will heed the well-drafted call and the leadership of Commissioner de Palacio, with a view to immediately implementing the 'Erika I' and 'Erika II' packages and give a boost to the creation of the European Safe Seas Agency."
"Mr President, first of all, with the sincerity that everyone will acknowledge in a Frenchman from the Atlantic region, I would like to express my solidarity and compassion to all the people and professionals in Galicia and Portugal who are affected by this further disaster."
"I think that the situation that we are in is extremely dangerous, as the public has good reason, as these disasters keep reoccurring, for wondering, doubting, becoming impatient and even rising up against the impotence of the public authorities."
"However, Commissioner, you are right in saying that the European Union has done a great deal, that it has done its duty in a quite remarkable timescale in terms of legislation."
"So where is the problem?"
"I think that it was stated by Mr Varaut."
"The problem is that we are in a field in which there is urgency, in which the task of the public authorities to ensure security is highly desired by the people and in which, in reality, joint sovereignty creates considerable problems."
"My government, in recent days, was upset that measures had not yet entered into force;"
"France is lagging behind in terms of checks in ports."
"I think that we will only overcome this situation if one day, as soon as possible, we manage to create an independent European area of maritime safety, with independent legislation, which would use regulations rather than directives - as the directives are still not practically transposed in any Member State - with independent checks and penalties."
"I think that this should be our ambition, or we will fail and will condemn our people to the sad spectacle of a ping-pong match between the Commission and the European Union, on the one hand, and the Member States, on the other hand, each of them trying to beat the other in dramatic circumstances that the people do not understand."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is very little 'prestige' here, quite the contrary."
"What has happened off the Galician coasts with this peculiar oil tanker, originating from a tax haven, with a flag of convenience and furthermore, in unfair competition and trading oil in a very strange way, cannot and must not happen again in any of the seas of the planet."
"It is clear that we must be increasingly demanding in terms of safety in transport, especially in the transport of dangerous goods and at sea."
"In our case, we must adopt appropriate measures so that there is no repetition of disasters such as the one that has taken place with this dreadful oil slick, the significant ecological impact of which should oblige us Members of this Parliament to reflect."
"It begs the question, how many more oil tankers do we have to endure?"
"Has account been taken of the negative impact of this ecological disaster on fishing, on nature, on tourism, on the society in this Galicia Finisterre?"
"Until when?"
"It depends on us, but we must speed up and review the measures adopted in the Erika case - as the Commissioner has just rightly pointed out."
"Finally, I would like once again to express our solidarity with the Galicians and I hope the European Union demonstrates that same solidarity through its actions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the feelings that we have in the face of this tragedy are feelings of anger."
"Anger at its tragic consequences, and also anger because we have had enough of Europe being accused."
"If we had followed the Commission, if we had followed the European Parliament, we would not be in this position."
"We have had enough of being accused for no reason when we have adequate legislation and there is no further need to legislate."
"The legislation needs to be applied and that is the problem."
"After the sinking of the Erika, France, which then held the presidency of the European Union, and the Socialist government at the time, had made maritime safety an absolute priority."
"If the situation was not so tragic, one could laugh at it."
"You know the result!"
"France was criticised by the European Commission for not respecting the directive on checks in ports."
"That is enough!"
"We have had enough of the failings of the Member States and the Council."
"Indeed, the President of the French Republic, Jacques Chirac, has just asked for maritime safety to be a priority on the agenda of the next European Council meeting."
"I hope that no coastal Member State will fail to answer that call."
"We have the legislation, which is adequate, with the 'Erika II' package."
"It needs to be applied."
"We need to increase checks, ensure the integrity of those who carry out those checks and define which ports should be able to receive vessels in distress."
"We should also express our complete solidarity with the people of Galicia, who are going to suffer terribly in terms of fishing and tourism."
"Having said that, the environmental tragedy is even worse, as it cannot be repaired by just giving subsidies."
"Brittany is suffering and will continue to suffer for a long time in terms of its biodiversity and ecological balance, which are essential for maintaining fish resources and preserving species."
"What is the use of 'Natura 2000' and our protection directives if we do nothing about maritime security?"
"Today the Council is responsible for having blocked the legislation that we adopted."
"Today, it is the people of the coastal States, European citizens, who are asking you, Commissioner, to be uncompromising."
"Mr President, this is without doubt a global disaster affecting all European coastlines and Europe must pool all its resources to combat it."
"That is why I am dismayed by the reports that the Commissioner is suggesting Gibraltar was in some way responsible because it failed to inspect the ship."
"I would like to point out to the Commissioner that the Prestige has only called in at Gibraltar once in the last five years and then it did not even enter the port, it refuelled outside."
"In that period it has also put in at several other ports, including Algeciras, Las Palmas, Dunkirk, Cork, Rotterdam and Kalamata."
"We have a saying in Glasgow: if you live in a glasshouse you do not have sex with your gardener!"
"After the Braer sank off the coast of Scotland in 1992, Neil Kinnock put forward legislation on double-hull vessels."
"As the Commissioner rightly pointed out, that was deferred by the Council until 2015."
"However, we need new legislation now to close up the loopholes."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Prestige disaster once again demonstrates the insufficiency of Community actions to put an end to the strategies of certain ship owners and owners of oil cargoes of ignoring the legislation on safety in maritime transport."
"Despite the fact that history repeats itself, it is still difficult to establish data on the origin and destination of the cargo, as well as its exact characteristics."
"Old ships are still operating, using flags of convenience of countries which are less demanding in terms of safety, with crews which in most cases do not have the necessary professional qualifications and knowledge for this type of transport."
"It is clear that a problem that is repeated so often and which has such serious consequences for the economy of a region and for its marine and coastal ecosystems must be dealt with rigorously and quickly by means of joint measures in all the Member States of the European Union."
"Measures such as the extension of sea corridors should not be made to wait, so that ships transporting dangerous goods are further from the coast, especially when they are sailing through areas of high ecological sensitivity such as the Galician coasts."
"We must also urgently consider bringing forward the obligatory demand for double hulls and intensify and improve the quality of inspections."
"This has been said very clearly by Commissioner de Palacio."
"Furthermore, all the Community legislation must enter into force as soon as possible: the Erika I and Erika II packages."
"But above all it is essential that the existing rules are applied."
"Neither must we forget the human face of this disaster and the importance of the aid reaching its destination as soon as possible."
"Yesterday I was in Galicia, where the desolation of the fishermen is truly striking."
"These people deserve, by means of this debate and the urgent measures stemming from it, a decisive contribution from the European Union aimed at recovering their confidence in the future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the incomparable natural landscape of Galicia's coasts and the Minho estuary as well as the communities living along the coasts are once again under threat, this time from this appalling shipwreck, which is a veritable showcase of everything that should no longer be happening on our seas."
"How many more disasters do we need before effective measures are adopted?"
"There is considerable indignation, but this indignation must be followed up with emergency measures; we must not simply wait for these long deadlines for the 'Erika I' and 'Erika II' packages to be met."
"Expressing moral solidarity and demonstrating sympathy are not enough; we must act as rapidly as possible and, as I said, adopt emergency measures."
"There must now be effective solidarity, particularly with the communities of northern Portugal, which will be the first to suffer the consequences of this accident, of this shipwreck, the likes of which must never happen again on our coasts; unless we adopt such measures, the people themselves will make their scepticism about Europe and European governments clear."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to say firstly that I am speaking on behalf of Mr Pérez Álvarez, a Galician, who has had to return to his region urgently."
"I would like to say that I fully agree with the Commissioner's words and support those measures which offer a clear line of action."
"We also share her desire for their application to be speeded up."
"This is what is needed, and what we do not need is any more political demagoguery such as that expressed in some speeches we have heard here."
"Perhaps these are the thoughts of a Galician countryman, whose future and family situation is looking grim following what has been described as the worst ecological, economic and social disaster in the history of Galicia."
"We understand that the people of Galicia are today sad and angry, and that sadness and anger has known and identifiable faces: each and every one of the people directly affected by the oil slick caused by the oil tanker disaster, and each and every one of the Galicians who, in Galicia and throughout the world, love their homeland and all of those of us who feel solidarity with them."
"On the other side are the people responsible, whose faces are obscured behind flags of convenience and legal procedures distorted to this end, and with a view to fraudulently avoiding the rules of the internal market, without caring about possible ecological damage - which is now real - and social and economic harm, and, without wanting to be alarmist, the damage which may also be in store for other coastal areas as the result of a domino effect."
"I believe that enough has been said and that we must look forward, learning from the lessons of the immediate past."
"The Galician Government has said that it is not going to impose any limits on the aid to the people affected."
"The Spanish Government and the European Commission is announcing measures."
"But situations such as this cannot and must not happen again, and we must repair and prevent the effects which may yet extend to other areas of Galicia or Portugal, because the risk remains there."
"We will all be grateful for the measures taken, especially those who live, work and suffer along our coasts."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to start by expressing my deepest political solidarity with our neighbours and friends in Galicia, for the suffering that this tragedy is causing them now and will cause in future."
"The European Union and its Member States must therefore spare no effort to help to minimise the scale of the effects of the disaster and compensate the main victims as far as possible for the damage caused."
"We must take the opportunity of the Prestige oil tanker disaster to make a few observations."
"The first is that this accident must be subject to a rigorous inquiry, not only with regard to the EU's safety rules covering this type of transport but also into the reason for the course taken by the ship, which having moved away to the west, suddenly headed southwards, and sank only thirty miles outside Portuguese waters."
"My second observation is that we must understand that this disaster could also seriously affect the northern coast of Portugal, if not now, then later, and the European Union also needs to consider aid for Portugal to improve its resources for mobilisation, monitoring and prevention."
"The fisheries sector, as a matter of fact, has already begun to be affected."
"Lastly, despite the fact that the tragedy's effects will clearly be felt in many sectors of the economy, there is no doubt that the most badly affected sector is that of fisheries and aquiculture."
"I therefore feel it is crucial that, in the framework of the aid that is to be mobilised, thought is given to the need for a specific emergency plan for these sectors."
"I do not think that the EUR 117.7 million Commissioner Fischler announced for Spain and the EUR 15 million for Portugal will resolve the problems, not only because of the overall amount, which is limited, but also because, where Portugal is concerned, the option must be left open for this amount to be increased if the situation on its coasts grows worse."
"Furthermore, we will have to bear in mind that compensation for the prolonged suspension of fishing alone will not suffice."
"What is needed, perhaps, is to think about another, more fundamental type of measure to provide alternative employment for these fishermen, for example, fishing in other waters in the medium term."
"Mr President, the wreck of the oil tanker Prestige off the coast of Galicia is a great misfortune the like of which should never again have happened in the Union after the Erika accident."
"Member States have committed to the practice whereby loading ports are obliged to assess the condition of vessels and, if necessary, stop the ship from leaving without repairs being done if the risk is considered to be too great."
"Unfortunately, this practice still does not apply to the applicant countries, and this ship had picked up its cargo at a port in the Baltic Sea."
"The risk is especially great in the Baltic, where there is heavy regular traffic and consignments often consist of materials and substances that the Baltic ecology simply would not be able to withstand if harmed by them."
"As someone who lives on the Baltic coast I now wish to express my deep sorrow for the residents of Galicia and all those whose livelihood is now in great peril."
"Obviously, making ports responsible for the condition of vessels to be loaded is not enough."
"The owners of freight must also be made accountable, as they also have an interest in ensuring that their consignments are organised responsibly and safely."
"Secondly, the practices of insurance companies and the terms and conditions they offer will have to be changed if necessary by means of Community legislation so that the cheapest option for a shipowner is not sinking his ship when it is in distress."
"Insurance law must be based on the notion that rescuing the ship must be possible and the cheapest option for the policyholder."
"We have to switch to these practices swiftly and without making any exceptions."
"It is regrettable that the legislators should become wise and energetic only after an accident has happened."
"When, however, the accident has faded in people's memories no wise or urgent measures are taken to avoid accidents in the future."
"On the contrary, everyone frantically starts looking after their own interests and the struggle to lengthen the periods of transition commences, as people want to dodge the regulations in the hope of getting off lightly."
"We need a Prestige package as an extension to the Erika package, which the Commission should start drafting right away with a view to producing something quickly."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to reply to Mr Miller, because I believe he has the wrong information."
"I have here for your perusal the precise movements of the Prestige during 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002, provided by the maritime authority of the Bahamas."
"In 1999, it reached the port of Rotterdam and that is when for the last time it had an in-depth inspection in accordance with the Paris Memorandum in a European port."
"Then, before the summer, it reached the port of Kalamata, in Greece, and I have contacted the port and authorities there to ask what the state of the Prestige was in Greece and it was not inspected in accordance with the Paris Memorandum."
"It then reached the port of Gibraltar and I have also approached the British authorities to ask why they did not carry out the control."
"It is true, ladies and gentlemen, that I have not just asked them about the Prestige."
"I have asked the Greek and British authorities about the application of the current legislation, of the Directive which demands control by port authorities, in accordance with the commitments relating in practice to the Paris Memorandum."
"I have asked about controls and the application in these ports - Kalamata and Gibraltar - of the Directive currently in force."
"I must tell the honourable Member that I have some statistics."
"I can say that in Gibraltar, in 1999, five ships have been inspected."
"In 2000, six."
"In 2001, two."
"In 2002, twelve."
"Those are the statistics."
"That is why I am saying the legislation must be reviewed in order to guarantee that these controls by port authorities are carried out in all the ports of the European Union."
"Because controls by port authorities have a deterrent effect, they have the effect of keeping away substandard ships, and this must happen in all ports."
"Because if we leave gaps in our network, in our system, the whole thing is automatically weakened."
"That is what I am saying."
"This is not a criticism of any particular port."
"In this case, these two are involved: Kalamata and Gibraltar."
"But the problem is not with any particular port."
"The problem, ladies and gentlemen, is that there has been an ecological disaster, a catastrophe which we should have prevented, and which we could have prevented if the Commission's proposals had entered into force."
"And I would like to extend all the gratitude and acknowledgement expressed here today to all the members of the Directorate-General for Transport who have worked like Trojans, that is, extraordinarily hard, without watching the clock, so that, when the Erika disaster happened, within just three months, we could present an entire coherent and global package to this House and the Council of Ministers so that these problems would not happen again."
"That is what I am talking about."
"And I am talking about the fact, ladies and gentlemen, that only 23 months have passed. And precisely because only 23 months have passed and because there was a lack of ambition - as we all know - there has been another disaster."
"How many more?"
"Well, that is my point."
"Is it not possible that between now and June 2003 or February 2004 there will be a disaster in the Baltic, in the Mediterranean, in the Atlantic or off any other European Union coast, because the measures already adopted have not been implemented?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, what we have to demand - and this is what I have done in a letter to the Ministers - is that they be applied now."
"The problem is that the Governments are behaving incoherently."
"The Heads of State and Government said in Nice that the implementation of these measures had to be brought forward and then they do not apply them..."
"Infringement procedures have been opened against some of them for lack of application, not of the new rules, but of those currently in force, which are much less strict and much easier to comply with."
"Our proposal meant that single-hull oil tankers, of category 1, that is, the largest ones, would have a maximum life of 23 years."
"Because there is clearly a problem with structures associated with the stress on metals caused by blows at sea, which arise after twenty or so years. And what I regret is that this proposal of ours should not be accepted and that it be raised from 23 to 27 years."
"And that is what the current problems stem from."
"Aid, ladies and gentlemen. We are working on this."
"There will be the aid provided by the Spanish authorities."
"What we clearly have are the FIPOL funds."
"And I would point out that there is an expert from the Directorate-General for Transport, in Spain, cooperating with the Spanish authorities, just as it cooperated with the French authorities to facilitate the payment of all that aid and of that compensation for the various people affected."
"We are also looking at issues relating to fishing to see what possibilities there may be for support in terms of the FIFG funds."
"We are looking at the possibility of applying the Solidarity Fund, but I believe it will not be possible - I say this clearly."
"The thresholds for the use of the Solidarity Fund are so high that I hope that the damage does not reach that level, because then it would really be an horrendous tragedy."
"We would be talking about more than EUR 3 000 million, ladies and gentlemen."
"Let us hope that it does not go that far."
"We are therefore also looking at the support that can be provided if, despite everything, that EUR 3 000 million is not reached but there is a significant effect on the region of Galicia, in which case support could also be provided by means of this Solidarity Fund."
"I hope that Portugal can be spared from this tragedy."
"I hope that the winds will not allow the oil slick to reach their coast."
"I would like the Spanish coasts not be to be affected any further, but let us hope, at least, that the Portuguese coasts stay clean."
"In any event, if Portuguese coasts were also affected, the funds would be available to them as well, in the same form and the same way that they are available to the Spanish authorities and the Spanish people affected."
"Ladies and gentlemen, what has been adopted must be put into practice."
"There is a whole range of measures which form a coherent global whole, with a Maritime Safety Agency to guarantee, together with the Commission, the appropriate application of the rules."
"We are going to set up this Maritime Safety Agency provisionally in Brussels, while they are deciding or not deciding on where the headquarters will be."
"I am very sorry, but I am not going to wait for them to come to an agreement."
"I hope it will be set up before the end of the year."
"The second issue. Amongst the aspects which correspond to the countries - the strengthening of port control, strengthening the demands on classification societies - we are of course going to hold a full investigation into what has happened - as I said before - of the whole chain, and I will present the results of our investigations to you: the whole chain of events which has led us to the final result, in relation to the classification societies as well."
"We will also demand that the States of the Union designate ports and refuge areas in order to deal with situations such as that of the Erika, which was also one of the controversial elements, or that of the Prestige in this case."
"Strictness in application. In the application and the demand for compliance with the regulations."
"We are talking about going further."
"I have made this very clear: International Maritime Organisation, corridors for dangerous products, sea room distances, special control in passes and straits, greater capacities for coastal States."
"All of this within the context of the International Maritime Organisation, genuinely adapting maritime law to the demands and new circumstances of the 21st Century."
"Meanwhile, ladies and gentlemen, we also have to deal in more depth with the issue of responsibility, we must present the issue of the COPE Funds once again to the Council of Ministers, as a complement to the FIPOL Fund; we must present the issue of criminal responsibility once again to the Council of Ministers and we must demand of the Ministers that, in all the Member States - and I believe this is possible in all of them by means of an administrative regulation - double hulls be required for the transportation of the most dangerous and polluting products, such as heavy fuel oil."
"Mr Savary spoke of an autonomous European area of maritime safety."
"The truth is that this is an issue which, of course, could be considered in the discussions within the Convention and the next Intergovernmental Conference."
"I am sure you can imagine that it will not be I who disagrees with these ideas."
"I would like to end by saying to Mrs Grossetête that, in fact, all I feel, with everything that has happened over recent days, is a great sense of anger and rage, knowing that we could have prevented it and did not do so."
"(Applause)"
"Commissioner, Mrs Miguélez Ramos would like to ask you a further supplementary question."
"Mr President, I will speak very briefly to say to the honourable Member that she knows I am especially sensitive to Galicia and that I can relate specific names, faces and landscapes to this tragedy, which undoubtedly means that one feels even more."
"This does not mean that when the Erika accident happened - which was off the French coast - I acted any differently."
"I went to Brittany then and tomorrow I am going to Galicia."
"In any event, it will be a pleasure for me to present all the data on the issue of the FIPOL, on the analyses we make in relation to the Solidarity Fund, on whether it can be applied or not, on all the aspects, and I will also ask Commissioner Fischler for information on the fishing aspects, although I imagine he will give full explanations within the Committee on Fisheries."
"Thank you, Commissioner de Palacio."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the debate on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (Rule 50)."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following six motions for resolutions on the situation in Sudan:"
"B5-0593/2002 by Mr van den Bos and Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the human rights situation in Sudan;"
"B5-0594/2002 by Mr Sjöstedt and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on Sudan;"
"B5-0601/2002 by Mrs Maij-Weggen and others, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the situation in Sudan;"
"B5-0604/2002 by Mr Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on the situation in Sudan;"
"B5-0605/2002 by Mrs Carlotti and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on human rights in Sudan;"
"B5-0610/2002 by Mrs Schörling and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Sudan."
"Mr President, this debate on Sudan has had a successful outcome even before it has begun."
"The invitation to the EU/ACP Assembly has, in the meantime, been withdrawn."
"It is detrimental to cooperation in the spirit of Cotonou that the proposal of Sudan was adopted by the ACP states."
"In a country in which women and children are kidnapped and enslaved? In a country in which the people in the south could be scourged by bombing for years on end and where Western oil companies looked after the interests of their shareholders while turning a blind eye to the victims of the slaughter?"
"There now, fortunately, appears to be a truce, but how long will it hold?"
"There can be collaboration with the European Union only when there is a lasting peace and when the government restores all freedoms and puts an end to all the abominable injustices."
"Only then will anything durable come of debates such as this one today."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in this afternoon's topical and urgent debate we must also turn our attention to the war in Sudan, one of the largest and most populous countries in Africa."
"Civil war has been raging there for 19 years."
"More than two million people have lost their lives because of this war."
"It has brought immense suffering for the people in the south of Sudan who are fighting for cultural, political and economic independence."
"In the larger part of Sudan that is under government control there is no freedom of thought or religion and no possibility of peaceful assembly."
"Human rights continue to be treated with contempt."
"Government forces are blanket-bombing regions in the south with heavy civilian casualties."
"More than 200 death sentences have been passed by unconstitutional emergency courts in Darfur State."
"The oil discoveries in Sudan have not yet led to a return to peace."
"On the contrary, they serve to replenish the war chest of the Khartoum government."
"There is a ray of hope: the peace talks in Machakos in Kenya, which have led to the conclusion of a ceasefire agreement."
"This has been drafted, but is not yet in force."
"First, unimpeded access must be provided for aid consignments for the people starving in the south of Sudan."
"This must also lead to a permanent ceasefire on both sides, which is respected by everyone."
"While the situation remains critical and the peace process has not yet made sufficient progress, there is no prospect of holding the sixth meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in Sudan in spring 2003."
"In any case, we will not go there while the current situation persists."
"We do hope, however, that this will be possible at a later stage."
"I should like to stress that Sudan's Ambassador here is doing a great deal through diplomatic channels to hasten a return to peace."
"We therefore call on the African countries to organise the next ACP-EU Assembly in another, more peaceful country in Africa."
"Mauritania, which wishes to take on this task, should be specifically encouraged to do so."
"Mr President, the emergency in Sudan has become very acute."
"We only need to consider the title of the recent report by the International Crisis Group, 'Ending starvation as a weapon of war in Sudan'."
"Indeed, famine and death from starvation on a huge scale are being used as weapons of war in Sudan."
"Yet, as the report also says, we really have no idea of how serious the emergency is, because of the remoteness of regions in which the war is raging unabated and in which these weapons are being used."
"In the meantime, the warring parties appear to have concluded an agreement to extend the memorandum of understanding on humanitarian aid and the suspension of hostilities to 31 March."
"Despite this courageous development, the decision indicates that the final peace settlement has not yet been achieved."
"Fundamental bones of contention such as the fair distribution of power and of the income from oil wells still need to be solved in ways acceptable to both parties."
"Now that the negotiations are only to be resumed in January, the international pressure upon the warring parties to reach a definitive peace settlement definitely must not be relaxed, however, and certainly not now that a solution appears to be in sight to a conflict that has already lasted for 19 years."
"It is estimated that approximately two million people have already lost their lives."
"Twice as many people have been made homeless, and countless atrocities have been committed."
"In particular, the Christians in the south have had to suffer severely from violence committed by the Muslims in the north."
"I would therefore call upon the Council and the Commission to proceed extremely cautiously during the EU Troika mission to Sudan, planned for 9 and 10 December."
"Only when a comprehensive peace settlement has been signed may relations between the EU and Sudan be normalised."
"Finally, I would ask the Council, the Commission and also the Member States, if possible in cooperation with the Sudanese Government, painstakingly to investigate the rumours of a potential revival of al-Qa'ida's financial centre."
"When all is said and done, we must not forget that, as you are all well aware, Sudan played host to Osama bin Laden from 1991 to 1996, and it would therefore be very useful to know whether activities are still going on in that quarter."
"Mr President, we have to bear in mind that the situation in Sudan varies greatly depending on the region."
"In the north we are dealing with a problematic regime, which is however displaying clear reformist tendencies, and which is supported by Egypt."
"In the south we have a brutal and bloody civil war, which it would be too simplistic to describe solely as a conflict between Islam and Christianity."
"There are also conflicts amongst Muslims themselves and amongst Christian tribes, although the main conflict is indeed between Christians and Muslims."
"This shows that this is not actually a war of religion but a series of tribal conflicts, ethnic conflicts, and that interested parties, including interested parties in the oil industry - for once this must be said - are systematically fanning the flames of these conflicts."
"That is why I am very grateful that the motion addresses this issue very clearly: the problematic role of certain parties who have interests in the natural resources - we have seen this in the Caucasus and in Congo too - and who are abusing ethnic conflicts to brutally increase their own profits."
"That is why as Europeans we are not only under a particular obligation to influence the people in Sudan, to work with them on a peace solution and to exert pressure on all of the parties in the conflict, but we also have a duty to hold serious talks with our European oil companies operating out there and to make it clear to them how great their responsibility is for this strategically important region and for the people who live there."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is true that the war in Sudan is the result of certain interests and ethnic tensions, but, in my opinion, the religious nature of the current conflict should be highlighted."
"We cannot accept the application of Islamic law in the institutions, which is why we have to step up pressure on the Sudanese Government to annul it, nor can we accept the severe violations of the fundamental rights of non-Muslims, forced conversions, forced marriages and enslavement."
"We cannot support a political solution which would mean turning back the clock and applying the principle: 'cuius regio, eius religio'."
"The path we choose should be to support the cause of the forces in the south and the north that are calling for a secular state and democratic institutions."
"The solution cannot and must not be that of world division on the basis of religious beliefs."
"Mr President, I may not look like Mr Schulz but I am deputising for him."
"The Socialist Group is deeply concerned by the continuing civil war that has claimed around two million casualties over the last 19 years."
"Of course we welcome the signing on 15 October of the peace agreement between the government in Sudan and the SPLA."
"We will be looking very closely at whether the government's pledge to respect human rights and the rule of law is met and whether there are moves towards democratisation that will result in the establishment of a democratically elected executive and legislature."
"We ask the Commission to provide us with a report on the possible involvement of European oil companies in abuses committed against local communities in the oil- producing areas."
"We certainly do not support the idea that the ACP-EU Parliamentary assembly should meet in Sudan next year."
"It may be possible in the future but we will have to see how things develop in Sudan."
"We need a dialogue between Sudan and the European Union, but before we resume normal relations we would want to see progress towards ending terrorism and support for terrorist groups, religious tolerance, human rights and of course an end to the civil war."
"Mr President, promotion of a peaceful solution and respect for human rights and humanitarian law remain at the heart of relations between the Commission and Sudan."
"The current conflict and the ongoing violations of human rights are the main obstacle to the socio-economic development of the country, as several speakers have rightly pointed out."
"The Commission firmly believes that respect for human rights would enable peace to return to Sudan."
"In accordance with the conclusions adopted by the Council in June 2002, the Union intends to proceed step by step."
"Until a peace agreement has been reached, the Union will continue political dialogue on the basis of the commitments made by the Sudanese Government for 2002 in the field of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, with particular emphasis on reaching a peace agreement."
"Should such an agreement be reached, the Union will begin to normalise its relations with Sudan, within the framework of the Cotonou Agreement, basing them on respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law."
"At the same time, it will encourage the peace process and resolution of the conflicts."
"We plan to endorse a national strategy document and a national indicative programme following the conclusion of the peace agreement or whenever the Commission considers it politically appropriate, following consultation with the Member States."
"I would add, also in relation to specific points which have been raised, that the Commission is going to participate in the visit of the European Union Troika to Sudan, scheduled for December, during which we will assess EU/Sudan political dialogue over the course of 2002."
"I would, however, like to emphasise that the implementation of the measures laid down in the national strategy document is subject to progress in political dialogue."
"Thank you, Commissioner Monti."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following five motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0591/2002 by Mr Johan Van Hecke and Mr van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the torture and crimes committed by the military and on the human rights situation in Bangladesh;"
"B5-0596/2002 by Mr Vinci, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on Bangladesh;"
"B5-0602/2002 by Mr Thomas Mann and Mrs Martens, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on human rights in Bangladesh;"
"B5-0606/2002 by Mrs Carrilho and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the human rights situation in Bangladesh;"
"B5-0609/2002 by Mrs Lambert and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Bangladesh."
"Acts of violence have afflicted Bangladesh ever since that country was founded."
"From the beginning, the political system has been undermined by murder, revenge and rivalry between the most important families."
"The spiral of ceaseless revenge has not been broken."
"On the contrary, the situation is going from bad to worse, in particular through the alarming growth of radical Islamic groups."
"The government's approach is, unfortunately, not aimed at reducing the tension and solving the problems."
"Members of Parliament are put in prison."
"Large-scale indiscriminate arrests take place, and people are tortured and even murdered in prisons."
"The European Union must actively concern itself with the situation in Bangladesh on the basis of the cooperation agreement we have with that country."
"Cooperation cannot continue unconditionally if human rights are being violated on a huge scale."
"We must insist that a national human rights commission be set up to carry out independent examinations, and immunity from punishment must be brought to an end."
"The police and military must prevent and combat violence instead of fuelling it."
"What is crucial to a solution is to restore a minimum basis of trust between government and opposition."
"The future must not forever remain the hostage of the past."
"Nothing will come of the development of this impoverished country if it is possible for the acts of violence to continue unabated."
"Mr President, in the past few weeks the escalating violence in Bangladesh has reached new heights."
"In October alone, around 40 000 soldiers were deployed in 'Operation Clean Heart' on the pretext of fighting rising levels of crime and private gun ownership."
"Several thousand people were arrested."
"We know from reliable, independent sources that this military operation, ordered by the Islamist Government in Bangladesh, was directed primarily at the regime's critics."
"Among those arrested were opposition members of the Bangladeshi Parliament, including the former minister, Mr Chowdhury."
"Leaders of unpopular NGOs were also arrested."
"The army units carried them off without any legal authority."
"Most of the suspects are either Hindus themselves or Hindu sympathisers."
"This minority has however lived peacefully alongside the Muslim majority for decades."
"The growing, and radical, Islamicisation of society and its political leaders is making everyday life increasingly difficult."
"Those in custody are cut off from the outside world."
"Many are being tortured."
"Hundreds of injured detainees had to receive hospital treatment."
"In the last month alone there were 25 deaths."
"The army's claim that they had all died of heart attacks is cynical."
"This action is contemptuous of humankind and in violation of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"The PPE-DE Group's position is clear: we call on the Bangladeshi Government to return to the rule of law, pluralism and parliamentary democracy."
"The imprisoned members of parliament and other innocent detainees must be released."
"I agree with Mr van den Bos: an independent body needs to be set up to investigate the arrests, ill-treatment and killings."
"Only then will Bangladesh be able to recover the necessary internal stability."
"The European Union must also make its contribution, Commissioner Monti."
"In our motion, we have cross-party support for calling on the Commission to send observers to Bangladesh, and this should be done before there is further discrimination and persecution."
"The agreement between the European Union and Bangladesh is based on consistent respect for human rights and on democratic principles."
"Should these continue to be violated to the same degree then we will have to bring political pressure to bear and that means suspending our Cooperation Agreement."
"Such important signals are easily understood throughout Asia as well as in other countries."
"We in the SAARC Delegation can give many examples to confirm this."
"We therefore hope that those responsible in Bangladesh will see reason and that they will do so because of the severe pressure that can be put on them within the SAARC."
"Only then will our respectable counterparts in Bangladesh be taken seriously at international level."
"Mr President, on 17 October this year 40 000 members of the armed forces launched Operation Clean Heart in Bangladesh."
"It resulted in house-to-house raids and searches aimed specifically at the Awami League's voters, party workers, the Hindu community and members of opposition political parties."
"Thousands were arrested and held in incommunicado detention."
"25 people are alleged to have died after being tortured while in detention."
"The claim that these deaths were the results of heart attacks is frankly incredible."
"We call upon the Government of Bangladesh to hold an independent inquiry into who is responsible for this, to release members of parliament and opposition political leaders and to establish a Bangladesh national human rights committee."
"We would ask the Commission to liaise with the Government of Bangladesh under the cooperation agreement to ensure that violations stop and that human rights are protected, and request that the European Parliament be kept informed."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Italian Radical Members fully support the resolution that has been tabled."
"At a meeting with the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Mrs Sheikh Hasina, attended by myself and a number of my fellow Members a few days ago in Brussels, we were told of the situation of ongoing violations, tyranny and improper use of the - de facto - army to repress civil rights, not to mention the political rights, of thousands of this country's nationals."
"The Commission should take steps to demand the withdrawal of the army, which is being used without a proper legal basis as a means of policing the public and of political repression."
"Last January, when answering a parliamentary question, Commissioner Patten said that the situation in Bangladesh was improving and that the Commission would undertake to monitor it."
"All the news, both direct and indirect, which comes out of the country shows that, in actual fact, the situation has taken a very dangerous and worrying turn, which is why we are calling on the Commission to take action."
"Mr President, while politically motivated violence and confrontation, as well as the prevailing law and order situation, have been a major concern for the Bangladeshi population for years, the European Union and the international donor community in general are fully aware that the law and order situation has worsened during the last year."
"The EU has underlined its concern at the deterioration of law and order and the increase in violence against minorities in its 'Human rights in the world' speech at the 58th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights."
"The European Union is very concerned about the general human rights situation and the continued reports of torture and deaths in custody, following the launch of Operation Clean Heart, aimed at halting the decline in law and order in Bangladesh, to which several Members referred to a few minutes ago."
"We are also very concerned about the possible bias in the implementation of this operation and about the delays in implementing or failure to implement reforms such as the separation of the judiciary from the executive, the ombudsman and the creation of an independent human rights commission."
"The EU consequently welcomes the European Parliament's resolution on Operation Clean Heart and the general human rights situation in Bangladesh."
"However, there are a couple of points in the resolution which we believe no longer reflect the current situation or are not substantiated by evidence on the ground."
"If one compares the situation of politically-motivated violence against the Hindu community before and after the national elections, we can see that reported violence and intimidation of minorities has significantly decreased."
"We should send a clear message calling on the government to ensure that the rights and security of all minority communities are fully respected."
"As regards Operation Clean Heart, it must be noted that donor communities, as well as civil society, have frequently voiced their concern over the deteriorating law and order situation during this government's first year in office."
"The government launched the operation as a result of this pressure and the failure to deal with the situation by introducing new laws and tightening up on the existing ones."
"While we acknowledge the need to improve the law and order situation - and we are ready to support the government of Bangladesh in its attempt to restore law and order - we firmly believe that this must be done under the rule of law and with full respect for human rights."
"Under no circumstances can exceptions to these principles be allowed."
"That is why the European Commission, through its delegation in Dhaka, will continue to monitor the situation and the political developments very closely."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following five motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0592/2002 by Mr van den Bos and Mrs Malmström, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on Iran;"
"B5-0595/2002 by Mrs Boudjenah and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the case of Hashem Aghajari in Iran;"
"B5-0603/2002 by Mr Gahler and others, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the case of Hashem Aghajari in Iran;"
"B5-0607/2002 by Mrs Izquierdo Rojo and Mr van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the death sentence against Hashem Aghajari in Iran;"
"B5-0608/2002 by Mrs Boumediene-Thiery and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Iran."
"Mr President, even if Doctor Hachem Aghajari does not receive the death penalty, Iran nonetheless remains condemned to domination by its ultra-conservative religious leaders."
"The success of the student demonstrations cannot conceal the fact that the human rights situation has not improved but has, in fact, deteriorated."
"The stoning of women, public hanging, torture and other barbaric practices mean that Iran still does not fulfil the elementary demands of civilisation."
"It is therefore astonishing that the European Union has not tabled a resolution concerning the situation in Iran in the UN General Assembly Third Committee."
"Many Member States say that they have high expectations of the human rights dialogue but, in reality, instead have high expectations of their lucrative business interests."
"The European Union must not let itself be taken for a ride."
"On the day before the European delegation of negotiators arrived in Teheran, five people were publicly hanged."
"The dialogue must not be a reason for failing to put the human rights situation in Iran on the agenda in international fora."
"That is why, in the spring, the European Union must submit a resolution to the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva."
"Naturally, it is important not to isolate Iran."
"Contacts must be established, but good use must be made of these, and the reformers must be given as much support as possible."
"A political dialogue clause in a future agreement is not enough."
"In my group's judgment, no cooperation agreement can be concluded as long as there is still gross and systematic abuse of human rights."
"Aid to terrorist organisations is also an obstacle to such cooperation."
"The situation in the country is becoming more explosive by the day, and it is therefore also high time that there were genuine reforms in Iran."
"There can only be constructive dealings with Iran if the truth is allowed to prevail and if supreme authority lies with the people."
"Mr President, it was on 23 October, not even a month ago, that we discussed, here in this Parliament, the human rights situation."
"We all condemned the death sentences and stonings and the general way in which this inhumane Iranian regime treats its people."
"At that time we also expressed regret - at least my group did - that the Council had decided not to table a human rights motion on Iran at the next meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights."
"Now, only a short time later, someone is sentenced to death when all he has done is to urge people to think things over, not to let their opinions be decided for them and not to blindly follow religious dogmatism."
"In this situation the European Union is continuing to negotiate a cooperation agreement involving economic cooperation."
"One of the statements in the motion is inadequate in my view."
"It is obviously good if future cooperation agreements contain a human rights clause."
"But I think it would be better - and I am saying this on behalf of my group - if there were no cooperation agreements at all and if they were not even concluded while human rights are not respected."
"It is schizophrenic."
"We only have a limited number of options when it actually comes to bringing pressure to bear."
"We should not give up the possibility of exerting economic pressure on Iran."
"Of course it is positive that the students are going out onto the streets."
"Of course it is positive that President Khatami is saying that this verdict is unacceptable."
"Of course it is positive that the Speaker in the Iranian Parliament is taking the same line."
"But this has not come anywhere near to forcing a restructuring of Iranian society."
"It is no accident either, in my view, that the Iranian religious leaders and the Iranian Government intend to remove the legitimate opposition in Iran by trying to make them out to be terrorist organisations and having them all put on the corresponding list so that they will have eliminated this opposition once and for all."
"I think that we too have a great responsibility here."
"We need to take more notice of who is put on these lists and why."
"We should ask more questions; the European Union should not always stand to one side like a junior prison warder."
"That is why we are calling on the Commission to make it quite clear at the next negotiations that there will not be any cooperation with Iran, economic or otherwise, for as long as this inhumane system remains as contemptuous of human rights as it is at present."
"Mr President, the case of Dr Aghajari has rightly aroused huge interest and concern in Iran and abroad."
"I share the view expressed by the Speaker, the Speaker in the Iranian Parliament, Mehdi Karroubi, who called the death sentence a disgrace to the country's judicial system."
"However, I am not entirely convinced that it is as a matter of conviction that the country's religious leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, has ordered the judiciary to review the verdict."
"Khamenei's previous record suggests rather that he is playing for time."
"The student demonstrations should slowly die down, as should the interest shown in the case by the public both nationally and internationally."
"It has, however, become clear in the demonstrations that the demonstrators are not only concerned about Dr Aghajari, but that they want more democracy altogether."
"In fact this verdict, like many others, is not motivated by religious concerns, but by political ones."
"We are familiar with this from European history, when the State and the church were not yet separate."
"The rulers of the time used Christianity, too, as a means of realising their own claims to power until it could no longer be recognised as such."
"Iranian society is, however, one step ahead of the conservative judiciary and clerics."
"This is clear, amongst other things, from the most recent proposals for reform put forward by the Iranian Parliament, which seek to restrict the absolute power of the Council of Guardians."
"I call on the Council and the Commission to pursue the dialogue on human rights in all their contacts with Iran and to be clear that without the European Parliament there will be no agreement on cooperation and trade."
"The opposition in the Iranian Parliament, both in Iran and abroad, is also very hopeful that economic interests will not be our only reason to hold contacts with this country."
"I think that we will also be able to make our views and basic position known when we welcome members of the Iranian Parliament on the occasion of their return visit to this House."
"For our part, it will always be clear that we are on the side of more democracy and not on the side of those who want to turn the clock back several hundred years."
"Mr President, I disagree with Mr Markov."
"Iran is a complex society."
"There is evidence of some progress towards an Islamic society that is in tune with the modern world."
"President Khatami and his reformist allies are a symbol of that modernisation."
"However, President Khatami is being constantly frustrated by the more fundamentalist elements of Iranian society."
"That is why the EU is currently engaged in negotiating a trade and cooperation agreement with Iran."
"This is not currently in doubt, though it must be clear to the Iranian authorities that at the same time we will expect and require an agreement on human rights."
"The death sentence on Dr Hashem Aghajari for apostasy on the basis of some obscure theological dispute is incomprehensible to the West."
"We welcome President Khatami's intervention, the action of lecturers and students in protesting and Dr Aghajari's own appeal for calm."
"We welcome the threat of resignation by President Khatami, the cabinet and dozens of MPs, should the Council of Guardians veto legislation that is being proposed to limit its current absolute power."
"However, we have to make it clear to the government of Iran that we will be watching the outcome of this and similar cases with close interest, in terms of our future relations with that country."
"Mr President, this motion is about three points."
"Firstly, it is about a man who is threatened with death and whom we must rescue."
"Secondly, it is about a Dr Aghajari who, in the opinion of many prominent Muslims, is defending true Islam, this great world religion, from political abuse by the extremist forces that are in power in Iran."
"And thirdly it is about the fate of Iran itself, because in Iran we are now seeing a power struggle between reformers on the one hand, who want gradually to open up this regime, like President Khatami and the aforementioned Speaker of the Iranian Parliament, and darker characters on the other hand whom to compare with the Middle Ages - I should like to make this clear - is an insult to the Middle Ages."
"These are forces that are unfortunately adherents to a modern, totalitarian form of extremism and that are abusing the great world religion of Islam for their own suppressive and criminal ends."
"In this context, allow me to say a final word to Mr Markov. Mr Markov, I have expressed criticism of the weakness of the West and of the repression practised by a regime myself in the past, when the SED was still in power in East Berlin, and I have to say that you yourself would have described the words that you have just used as a throwback to the cold war."
"At that time I certainly thought that democrats should be uncompromising where totalitarian forces were concerned."
"That was true then, it is true today and it will also be true in the future!"
"(Sustained applause)"
"Mr President, we are greatly concerned about the new series of arrests and sentences which reformists and those who exercise their fundamental right to freedom of expression in Iran have been subject to."
"Following his speech last June on religious reform, given in western Iran, the university professor, Hashem Aghajari, was arrested and, this month, was sentenced to 74 lashes, followed by eight years' imprisonment and the death penalty."
"Professor Aghajari, who lost his right leg during the Iran-Iraq War, needs medical attention."
"He was expected to appeal to a higher court, but Professor Aghajari had the courage to defy the legal system by refusing to go to appeal."
"For several days, Teheran has been the scene of heated student protests and, I am glad to say, President Khatami has announced that he does not support the sentence, which was ordered to be reviewed on 17 November by Supreme Leader Khamenei."
"In the past, we have called repeatedly on Iran to apply the death penalty only to people who have committed the most serious crimes, in observance of the commitments assumed in accordance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights."
"In its Conclusions on 21 October, the Council agreed to initiate a dialogue with Iran on human rights, thereby confirming its concern over this area, including violations of civil and political rights and, especially, freedom of expression."
"The Council also mentioned its traditional, resolute opposition to the death penalty."
"On 18 and 19 November in Brussels, President Prodi and Commissioner Patten met Iran's Foreign Minister, Mr Kharrazi, who undertook to participate in future dialogue between the European Union and Iran on human rights, and challenged, together with other leading Iranian figures, Professor Aghajari's unjustified sentence."
"The dialogue on human rights is, in effect, an appropriate forum for the consideration of individual cases."
"The Commission will monitor developments extremely closely and remain in contact with Parliament and the Member States."
"I would like to add that the Commission feels that initiating the talks, which will also include a political dialogue, is in the interests of Iran and the European Union - see the Conclusions of 17 June 2002 - and, furthermore, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement will contain a clause on human rights."
"In addition, the negotiation process will allow us to exert pressure while, at the same time, supporting President Khatami and the reformists."
"Thank you, Commissioner Monti."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place immediately after this debate."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Mr President, as a point of order I would like to request the floor before the vote on the two amendments, because I would like to propose an oral amendment to each of them."
"I would also like to table a point of order, before moving on to the vote, which will be a joint one concerning the whole text, because there are some linguistic corrections which I would like to point out to the services, since we have worked very quickly and some errors have slipped in which I will now mention, Mr President."
"We negotiators agreed that, by means of oral amendments and corrections, we could adapt the text if the circumstances had changed."
"Recital A mentions 'recent hours', and much has happened since the hull was ruptured; it should say 'recent days', because some days have passed rather than hours."
"In Recital B, where it talks about oil, it should say 'fuel', because we have agreed that 'fuel' should always be included."
"In the Spanish version of Recital F the text 'especially birds' appears and we had agreed that the word 'especially' would not appear."
"I therefore request that the word 'especially' be removed."
"The Spanish version of Recital G says 'sea craftsmen such as oyster farmers and seafood breeders'."
"I would ask that the Spanish version be corrected by saying 'sea workers such as mussel farmers, oyster farmers and other shellfishermen'."
"In point 3, the Italian version does not match the other versions; it is the only one in which, in line 7, seven words have been included which must be removed since they do not appear in any of the other versions."
"And finally, in point 11, it says 'maritime and/or fishing areas ' and, in Spanish, it should say 'maritime-fishing areas '."
"That is all, Mr President."
"Mr Varela, I will see to it that all of the language versions are cross-checked once more."
"(The President established that there were no objections to the oral amendments)"
"Before the vote on Amendment No 1:"
"Mr President, I would like to present an oral amendment, because the amendment by the UEN Group includes Portugal."
"We are not against this, but Spain and France do not appear, but rather Galicia and Brittany, and we believe - and we have discussed this with the Portuguese Members - that it should say: 'Galicia, Brittany and Northern Portugal'."
"Mr President, I should like to do something that I have never done before, namely congratulate the Conference of Presidents in the plenary and thank them for including so many interesting debates on this afternoon's agenda."
"This has set the standard for future plenary sittings!"
"Congratulations are always welcome!"
"Mr President, did the Conference of Presidents take a decision regarding the exclusion of the two Zimbabwean diplomats who are on our banned list?"
"I understand that the Conference of Presidents was to decide whether or not they should be banned from the building."
"I should like to know what was their decision."
"Mr Balfe, neither of the diplomats will be allowed to enter the House."
". (FR) The sinking of the 'Prestige' was not an accident."
"It was the logical consequence of a mixed, national and European decision-making system, which paralyses the Member States without actually imposing the necessary radical measures."
"It thus leaves the way open to certain maritime transport mafias that operate in an area without law...And everything is perhaps done for that."
"Some of my colleagues think that we need to get out of this bad situation by imposing a central and supranational European authority."
"This solution may seem attractive, but there is a risk of it being far removed from the people, badly democratically monitored, and therefore susceptible to the pressure of financial interests."
"Moreover, there is no point in putting together the European Member States that are affected by the problem, and others that are not affected."
"That would only slow down the decisions."
"Without excluding European directives out of hand, they need to be supplemented by re-establishing the Member States' right to protect themselves."
"We also need to admit that the Member States that are threatened must be able to take measures together, outside of Community procedures."
"And the bottom line is that we need to ban from our waters any vessel for which the person responsible is not clearly identified, cannot be located, is not credit-worthy or is not completely insured."
"We are once again going to condemn the sinking of a waste boat that is 26 years old, was last inspected in 1999, belonged to a Liberian company, was flying a flag of the Bahamas, was operated by a Greek company, chartered by the Swiss subsidiary (Crown) of a Russian conglomerate (Alfa Group) that obtained a navigation certificate from the American navigation office ..."
"We have had enough of the opaqueness, impunity and complacency in maritime transport, which present a danger to sailors, the environment and coastal populations."
"We have had enough of the impotence of the European Union, which, on the orders of the United States, is capable of establishing anti-terrorist legislation that is an attack on freedom within a few weeks, but is incapable of applying the resolutions in the Erika I and Erika II packages."
"We urgently need an international maritime law that can break with the complacency that can force shipowners, charterers and oil companies to take on a security attitude and high social standards for those working in maritime transport."
"In short, we need the human (inspectors, checkers, coastguards), material and financial resources to apply the law."
"Without these minimal measures, Parliament will continue to adopt ineffective resolutions every time there is an oil slick."
". (PT) In addition to what I said in the debate this afternoon, I wish to reaffirm my total support for the positions expressed by Commissioner de Palacio, both with regard to bringing forward the entry into force of the 'Erika' packages with immediate effect and to the need to improve, extend and toughen all aspects of their content."
"To anyone who has had doubts or qualms about the measures that were proposed and discussed for the 'Erika I' or 'Erika II' packages, the Prestige disaster has provided the answer."
"Furthermore, we must focus our immediate energies on monitoring and minimising the effects of the pollution and on providing assistance to the frightened and worried communities that have been affected."
"Lastly, I would also reaffirm the need for a rigorous Community inquiry into the entire event, both so that we can be sure that everyone concerned acted as they should and to ensure that we have the best technical and political response capacity in the event of potential future incidents."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 5.55 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"Mr President, I should like to make a brief statement on an incident which occurred this morning at our group meeting."
"This particular group invited Mrs Andreassen to come and give evidence to us on a matter of technical information about the accounting systems."
"We found much to our surprise that when we arrived, she had been gagged by the Commission and was not allowed to give any information to either the assembled parliamentarians or the press present."
"What a clear majority of our political group would like to ask is whether the Commission can justify under what grounds Mrs Andreassen was gagged from giving us technical information about a substantive item which we need to know about."
"Perhaps more importantly, how is it that the framework agreement between the Commission and the Parliament does not now allow us as parliamentarians to talk to people about technical matters and how far, therefore, does the Commission reach into our institution?"
"That is for our Bureau to decide and we would like to have clarity on that issue."
"It is a matter for the Conference of Presidents and not the Bureau."
"But Mrs Schreyer is speaking later, if you wish her to deal with this matter then she may - it will be entirely up to her."
"You have the honour of sitting on the Conference of Presidents and that is a matter for the Conference of Presidents."
"You can write to the President."
"I am sure you can pick up the telephone and speak to him."
"The next item is the debate on the Annual Report of the Court of Auditors for 2001."
"Mr President, Secretary-General, ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to be able to present to you today the Annual Report of the European Court of Auditors for 2001."
"I have organised my comments into four main sections: firstly, the analysis of budgetary management; secondly, the follow-up given to the Court's previous observations; thirdly, the Statement of Assurance (DAS); and fourthly, the reform of the Commission."
"Let us begin with the analysis of the implementation of the budget."
"For the second consecutive year there has been a high budgetary surplus, greater than EUR 15 000 million (16% of the final budget)."
"The surplus is due to the cancellation of appropriations caused mainly by the delay in the implementation of structural measures."
"It would have been appropriate to modify the budget to maintain the balance between the forecast expenditure and revenue."
"Another crucial feature of the budgetary management was the low rate of use of payment appropriations in certain areas."
"In the case of the Structural Funds, percentage of use was less then 70%, the lowest level since 1999."
"Delays were also a feature of the implementation of pre-accession aid, especially in the case of the SAPARD programme, where only 9.2% of the appropriations were disbursed."
"What is more, only EUR 1 million were received by the final beneficiaries of this programme."
"If the pace of implementation does not pick up, appropriations will have to be cancelled in 2003."
"The Commission must continue its effort to clear the accounts by cancelling those commitments which can no longer be implemented."
"Outstanding commitments amount to EUR 12 000 million in the case of external aid and to nearly 3 000 million in the case of the new pre-accession instruments."
"The rate of implementation of the European Development Funds is just as sluggish."
"After four years, only 30% of appropriations under the 8th EDF have been disbursed."
"To conclude, the estimates made for these programmes in terms of implementation and payments need to be more realistic and take account of each country's capacity to absorb aid."
"This would result in a more accurately calculated and balanced budget."
"The Court has analysed the follow-up given to its previous observations."
"Generally speaking, the Commission has taken appropriate steps to remedy the shortcomings highlighted."
"For example, outward processing customs arrangements have been simplified, the legislation promoting joint enterprises in the fisheries sector has been improved and tendering procedures under the TACIS programme have been revised."
"In other sectors developments have been less satisfactory."
"This is the case of the system of aid for durum wheat, where deficiencies that the Court pointed out in 1998 are still in evidence and some EUR 450 million are spent unnecessarily every year."
"This is also true of the Common Market Organisation for sugar, where, despite the 2001 reform, problems of overproduction and high prices persist."
"When the Audit Progress Committee starts work, I am certain that the Commission will be able to be more diligent in following up the Court's reports."
"Let us now move on to the Statement of Assurance."
"It is the opinion of the Court that the accounts for 2001 reliably reflect the revenue and expenditure and the financial situation of the Communities."
"However, the Report does express some reservations and observations which for the most part concern defects in the accounting system on which the Court has previously remarked."
"In its reply to our Report, the Commission acknowledges these shortcomings and undertakes to present a plan to modernise the accounting system before the end of 2002."
"The Court will examine the conception and implementation of this plan and will keep Parliament informed of its progress."
"As in previous years, the Court is of the opinion that the transactions underlying the revenue, commitments and administrative expenditure are legal and regular."
"Nonetheless, because of the errors that we have highlighted we are unable to provide this assurance in respect of the other payments."
"Most errors were detected in payments relating to agricultural policy and structural measures - in other words, in those management areas which the Commission shares with the Member States, and which account for some 80% of the budget."
"Reducing the frequency of errors will be contingent on significant improvements in the administration and control systems of both the Commission and the Member States."
"Take the common agricultural policy, where the declarations submitted by the beneficiaries of subsidies have not improved compared with previous years."
"The launch of the Integrated Management and Control System has not been completed, and almost half of the Member States have not introduced the bovine identification system, which has been compulsory since 2000."
"Other errors are linked to deficiencies in the controls carried out by the Member States (in the case, for example, of olive oil and cotton)."
"The Court's recommendations obviously include the full implementation of the control mechanisms provided for in the Regulations."
"As regards structural measures, further erroneous payments were discovered, caused by deficiencies in the control systems and in the Member States' declarations of expenditure."
"The Court is concerned about national governments' delay in applying the management and control instruments for the new programming period; the inspection units are not operational and there is no independent control of transactions."
"It recommends that the Commission intensify its checks and systematically turn the findings obtained to account."
"In the context of internal policies, which are directly managed by the Commission, examination of the fifth framework programme for research revealed incorrect payments due to the failure of beneficiaries to comply with contract provisions."
"The Court recommends simplifying the systems for reimbursing expenditure and introducing more effective sanction mechanisms."
"The national authorities in the beneficiary countries and non-governmental organisations play a decisive role in the management system for external aid programmes."
"Examination of the supporting documentation that is available centrally (in Brussels) leads to the conclusion that the Commission has legally and regularly met its commitments and payments."
"Nonetheless, the Court has no assurance that these operations were carried out correctly in the beneficiary countries, where the control systems are inadequate and errors have often been detected on the spot."
"The Commission must work more intensively to transform external aid - where progress has already been made."
"To conclude this theme, I should like to open a short parenthesis."
"In recent months there has been lively debate concerning the Commission's accounting system."
"This is a good thing, and I hope that the interest thus aroused will help to push through the reforms that the Court has long been advocating."
"However, in some respects the debate has suffered from a lack of precision and balance."
"The time has come to introduce some order and draw up an objective map of the situation."
"To this end, it should be stressed that, despite certain reservations, the Commission's accounts are reliable."
"Accordingly, save perhaps in a few specific areas, the figures provided by the budgetary accounts correspond to the actual use made of appropriations."
"This view is borne out by a rigorous professional auditing effort, in which the Court has invested considerable resources."
"Yet this effort has also led the Court to criticise the accounting system."
"The shortcomings that have been highlighted make it difficult to obtain the better-quality information that is necessary to improve management."
"I refer, for example, to the deficiencies in the system of accruals accounting when it comes to presenting the state of the Commission's assets and liabilities."
"For years the Court has been drawing attention to these defects, and at last its observations appear to have elicited some response."
"Today we are determinedly pressing the Commission to take remedial action."
"When we meet here again next year we will just as determinedly demand results, which I am confident will be positive."
"In the meantime, I would ask that the Commission be allowed to concentrate on this task, which is not at all easy."
"Let us now deal with what I believe to be a crucial issue in the Report: the reform of the Commission."
"2001 was a year of transition which was marked by significant progress, especially in the fields of financial management and internal control."
"Let us see what the Court's main observations in this respect are."
"Firstly, I would like to point out that certain measures are not being introduced within the time limits stipulated."
"This delay is above all due to an overly ambitious initial timetable, as the Court has already complained."
"Secondly, the Council has adopted a new Financial Regulation which the Court considers generally appropriate."
"Despite some remaining unsatisfactory elements, this is a good instrument which will help to improve the administration of Community funds."
"For the first time, the Directors-General have drafted activity reports and prepared declarations on the quality of information and internal control."
"Increasing top managers' accountability in this way is one of the keys to the reform's success."
"This is a genuine revolution in the Commission's management culture."
"We recommend improving the approach to drawing up reports and declarations: presentation dates must be brought forward and guidelines must be issued in more precise terms, avoiding ambiguity, specifying possible observations and reservations and more clearly outlining plans of action."
"The Commission has summarised the reports and declarations by the Directors-General in a single document which it has submitted to Parliament and the Council."
"This summary includes a plan of action which aims to remedy the problems that have been identified."
"The plan should provide more detail on issues such as the monitoring of internal control standards and the reform of SINCOM."
"Finally, one aspect of the reform deserves greater attention."
"I refer to the Member States' management of programmes under what is known as 'shared management'."
"The Commission is having problems with incorporating concrete measures aimed at checking and improving the effectiveness of these management systems, which account for more than 80% of the budget, into its overall strategy."
"Solutions urgently need to be found, but the Commission on its own is powerless: it needs the active collaboration of national governments."
"I believe that this message provides an appropriate conclusion to my speech."
"The reform is progressing positively."
"The Commission has met its commitment to work hard on improving its administrative and control practices."
"However, it will take more time to achieve the excellent and exemplary administration we all want to see."
"It is a laborious process to which all the institutions must contribute their experience."
"Each year the Court will analyse the progress made, report on the deficiencies and recommend any measures it considers necessary."
"I thank you very much for your attention."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, honourable Members of this Parliament and of the Court of Auditors, I wish to extend very warm thanks to Mr Fabra Vallés for his speech and for his firm support for Commission reform."
"I wish to thank all the members and staff of the Court of Auditors for their good cooperation throughout the year and for the Court's recommendations, which are indispensable if the European Budget is to be put to good use and properly administered."
"With the Statement of Assurance specifically in mind, I am also grateful for their frankness about the methodology applied."
"I will follow Mr Fabra Vallés in concentrating on three points, specifically the surplus from 2001, accounting, and Commission reform."
"The Court is critical of the EUR 15 billion surplus for that year on the grounds that it is not the result of savings - which would have been a good thing - but has come about because the Budget provision on which Parliament had decided had not been fully used, and because programmes, especially in structural policy, had simply got going more slowly than had been planned."
"The surplus represents the difference between the estimates and cash data as set out in the revenue and expenditure accounts, in line with the accountability required by Parliament."
"Why was there such a great discrepancy in structural expenditure?"
"In this area, the Commission always relies on proposals and predictions by the Member States, and in this instance we were working on the basis of assumptions that were simply unrealistic."
"I told the ECOFIN meeting yesterday, and not for the first time, that there is still, in the Member States, no systematic procedure for estimating, on a sound basis, how much in the way of resources can actually be drawn on in a financial year."
"This is where the Member States need to work together with the Commission on improving forecasting, which may be helped by our now presenting the Member States' forecasts to the Parliamentary Committee."
"The Financial Regulation requires that any surplus from a financial year be credited to the Member States as income for the following year."
"We have done this principally by way of two supplementary Budgets, an instrument that also featured in discussions on the Financial Regulation."
"Turning to the accounting standards, the Court has, as in previous years, again observed that the annual accounts for the financial year 2001 gives a true and faithful picture of revenue and expenditure, and of the Community's financial position at the end of the year."
"The Court subjects the financial management including of course the cash position, to detailed scrutiny."
"It is, then, quite simply wrong to assert that the Commission's books and cash position have not been audited for ten years!"
"The Court examines in detail the accounts and the standards by which they are kept."
"The Court has again expressed reservations about the balance sheet, and is calling for further changes to be made to the system."
"As you are aware, the new Financial Regulation requires all the institutions, with effect from 2005, to have one single balance sheet relating to specific periods, a requirement that also applies to Parliament."
"Having gained the impression that there is confusion about this, let me follow the President of the Court of Auditors in making a basic observation to clarify matters."
"Public sector accounting is, by tradition, cash-based, in the sense that it involves the recording of revenue and expenditure over against the Budget estimates arrived at by the body legislating for the Budget."
"This system is therefore in line with accountability to the budgetary authority."
"In some Member States, financial management continues to be founded on this principle, and there is no truth in the claim that this type of cash accounting is inherently susceptible to fraud."
"This sort of information is not, however, sufficient for administrative measures aimed at efficiency, and that is, as it has been emphasising for years, what the Court of Auditors is concerned about, and it is also a matter for concern for the Commission."
"There is a close connection between the adoption of commercial standards in the public sector and the overall reform of administration within the Commission, and also in some Member States in particular."
"It is these aspects that have such a great part to play in the Budget, and especially in the balance sheet, but the budget-spending centres must be able to get more information from the accounts."
"We have committed ourselves to continued development, which the Court has also expressly enjoined on us, including improvements to the underlying computer system."
"Our accounting system is computer-based and capable of performing to the highest standards;"
"I might add, by the way, that the budget-spending centres in all the Directorates-General and in the representations are linked together in a system of which some Member States can only dream."
"This too has been the subject of false allegations to the effect that 4 000 officials were able to carry out transactions directly and, as it were, on their own authority."
"That too is untrue."
"They are obliged to feed everything into one single system, and the Budget Directorate-General then carries out the actual transactions."
"A number of steps have been taken to improve this."
"This year, we have also been concerned to introduce improvements in the area of security, specifically concerning access by system managers, which the Court of Auditors had drawn our attention to on numerous occasions."
"Every year, Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control has the important task of checking the financial statement, and, should you need help in this, it goes without saying that my staff are always at your service."
"Mr Elles, if your group has come to the decision that it should seek help from elsewhere, that is manifestly its own business."
"As far as the hearings of a suspended official are concerned, the Conference of Presidents had given this matter their attention, and, when the official raised a query, it was to that and also to the proceedings currently underway that her attention was drawn - nothing more than that."
"To summarise, I would like to thank Mr Fabra Vallés again for observing that the Court of Auditors, on the basis of rigorous and professional audit work, has confirmed the reliability of the Commission's accounts."
"The Commission is currently finalising a detailed framework for further modernisation of the accounting system that will take on board the very suggestions and criticisms that the Court of Auditors has made, and I will be able to present this to Parliament in January."
"Turning to the third area - that of the reforms - the measures taken by the Commission are many in number and far-reaching in their effects."
"You will be aware that, in the area of the Budget, activity-based budgeting is changing the way in which the Budget is drawn up."
"Another major change is the strategic planning using the Annual Policy Strategy within the Commission."
"The offices of the Internal Audit Service and the Central Financial Service have been set up in the same way."
"The most crucial aspect, though, is the decentralisation of responsibility and accountability, as described by the Directors-General in their report."
"This must show whether the objectives set out in the Budget have been achieved, and whether a declaration on the financial management can be given, stating that all the control measures had been set up and were up and running."
"This too involves new structures, such as annual reporting for example."
"We did this for the first time in 2001, and the Court of Auditors is right to point out that the statements by the Directors-General still differ in too many respects for them to be able to serve as a basis for some sort of Single Audit Concept."
"This is an observation with which the Commission concurs, and that is why we will shortly be deciding on appropriate improvements, which we will authorise the Directors-General to carry out."
"There is one suggestion in the Court of Auditors' report that I particularly want to pick up on, one that will also be important in terms of the work done by the Committee on Budgetary Control, and that is the suggestion that the annual reports by the Directors-General should include a specific position statement on which of the Court of Auditors' recommendations have already been put into effect and which of them still require action to be taken."
"This would reduce the number of possible criticisms; this is a very good, indeed essential proposal, and one that we shall adopt."
"It will make the Budget Commissioner's work easier, as also that of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"Let me take this opportunity of congratulating the Court of Auditors on its twenty-five years of existence, and also, on behalf of the Commission, to again thank it very warmly for all the work it has done."
"I would also like to address a few words to the principal rapporteur, Mr Casaca."
"Work on the discharge procedure has already begun, and the questionnaire you have submitted is a comprehensive one."
"For its part, the Commission will do all it takes to give you satisfactory answers in due time, that is to say by 18 December."
"The questionnaire also makes clear, Mr Casaca - and you can tell the committee this from me - that the cooperation involved will, in my view, be not only thoroughly in-depth, but also very good."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Fabra Vallés, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by extending my warm congratulations to the Court of Auditors on twenty-five years of its existence and on last week's celebrations, which were entirely worthy of the occasion."
"Today's discussion on the Court's annual report for 2001, which you, Mr Fabra Vallés, thankfully presented to the Committee on Budgetary Control as long ago as the beginning of November, makes it possible for us to examine the same key areas that have already been mentioned - notably the enormous Budget surplus of over EUR 15 billion, the significance of which is that 16% of the resources allocated were not able to be spent even after the 2000 financial year had come to an end with all of 14% of funds unused and left over."
"We are very much in favour of frugality, but not at the expense of objectives that have been decided on, unless the capacity for implementing them had been overestimated from the outset!"
"In Chapter I, the Court reiterates the call it made in the previous year for a supplementary and amending Budget to be presented in good time."
"The Commission's response to this may well be technically correct, but it is not the right one politically."
"There is still a great deal of work to be done here."
"What the Court has to say in Chapter 9 of the Statement of Assurance is most interesting, but, at the same time, gives rise to grave concern."
"Again, with the exception of a few areas, certification of the accounts is withheld."
"The question arises of whether the top notch on this yardstick will ever be reached."
"In terms of discharge, the really important things will be a series of items such as Commission reform, financial management and the new Financial Regulation."
"The reliability of the Commission's accounting system has been the subject of vigorous debate, which the media have broadcast far and wide."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control was prevented from hearing the arguments of the Commission's accounting officer, who has since been suspended."
"What we now read in the Court's report- on pages 308 ff. for example - paints a pretty grim picture of deficits that have been present in the Commission's book-keeping and accounting procedures for years."
"Putting together the Court's criticisms in its reports from 1994 onwards, the result is proof of the culpably negligent way in which the Commission goes about remedying these serious defects."
"According to its current plans, the Commission intends to progressively remove them, but it will be 2005 by the time it will have done it, so the Court of Auditors and Parliament will have many years more checking up to do."
"I will end with two questions."
"The first is whether 2001 saw an improvement in Budget implementation."
"It is the discharge resolution that will provide the answer to that."
"The second is this: under the Treaty, it is the Commission that is responsible for the management of the Budget as a whole."
"The new Financial Regulation gives its Directorates-General decentralised responsibility."
"Who, though, in the Commission, is responsible for the monitoring of the whole within the Commission itself?"
"The individual Directors-General, the Budget Directorate-General, or the accounting officer?"
"In any case, it is, above all, you, Commissioner Schreyer, in your role as Budget Commissioner, to whom we shall continue to address our questions."
"Mr President, thank you in any case for giving me the floor."
"I should like to start on a positive note."
"The Court of Auditors is celebrating its twenty-fifth anniversary, for which congratulations are in order, and I can only say that in those twenty-five years, the Court of Auditors has become a father figure without which this Parliament would be unable to do its job."
"I am also pleased that the Court of Auditors notes that the Commission is functioning ever more effectively."
"The Court of Auditors takes a positive view of Commission reform, and the same more or less goes for the new Financial Regulation."
"This is the good news."
"The bad news is that a positive Statement of Assurance has not yet been issued this year either."
"I should like to repeat what I said last year and the year before."
"Why can the Commission not be more specific and set a date by which we must have a positive Statement of Assurance?"
"It would be something we could all work towards and we would know what to expect."
"It is also disappointing to perceive no real improvement in European unification's oldest policy area, namely that of agricultural policy."
"Once again, the Court of Auditors is assessing agricultural spending very critically, and there appears to me to be hardly any tangible improvement."
"This is why I took the initiative earlier this year to better control agricultural spending."
"This topic will be discussed shortly in this House, and I hope that the Commission, the Council, as well as the MEPs will assess it in a positive light."
"It is also this year for the first time that the Directors-General of the Commission will be required to account for healthy financial management."
"I think that this will be essential in the future."
"As far as the procedure is concerned, surely there is room for at least some improvement, and the reports will also need to be more specific and clearer, but I think that this will be also an essential point for us as Parliament in future."
"As everything that needed to be said about the surplus on the budget has already been said, I will not enter into any great detail on this subject."
"Suffice to say that we naturally need to budget more effectively."
"I would also like to say a few words about the Statement of Assurance itself."
"This is the same message I am having to repeat."
"I gather from the Court of Auditors and the Commission that it is very difficult to indicate margins of error in some sections of the Budget, but I would still appreciate it if the Court of Auditors were to develop certain indicators where possible."
"We should be able to judge, from one year to the next, whether things have generally improved by a certain percentage."
"Everyone likes to know the final score, and this should also be possible for the European Budget."
"One major point that is left is enlargement."
"The Court of Auditors itself admits that even the current Member States leave a great deal to be desired on this score."
"As far as I am aware, the IACS (integrated administration and control system) has not yet become operational in any of the new Member States."
"This is a point of grave concern and something which will require attention particularly in future."
"Mr President, I should first of all like to concur with Mr Kuhne on the subject of the transparent and open way in which we cooperate."
"I could be asking my fellow MEPs a whole string of questions today."
"I could question the considerable budget surplus of EUR 15 million;"
"I could ask why, for the umpteenth year in a row, no positive Statement of Assurance has been issued;"
"I could ask about the Commission's accounting system, about the shortcomings of the Member States which, all in all, already manage 80% of European subsidy policy; about pre-accession policy, or about Sapard, where only 9.2% of the resources have been used."
"These are all important questions, which we will be addressing together with the rapporteur, Mr Casaca, over the next few weeks and months."
"In my view, there is only one important question left today."
"Members of the Court of Auditors, you know that I am on good terms with the Court."
"I like working with you and we work well together."
"However, according to OLAF's annual report, allegations have been made by an MEP to OLAF with regard to possible misappropriations by a former member of the Court of Auditors."
"You will be aware that I am that MEP."
"When I heard about those allegations, I passed them on to OLAF."
"I specifically did not want any publicity at the time."
"I wanted to see whether OLAF would do its job, and I have to compliment the OLAF investigators on doing a sterling job."
"A few weeks ago, they submitted a dossier to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg."
"They also submitted a dossier to the Court of Auditors itself with a number of recommendations."
"One of those recommendations was to mount a disciplinary inquiry against a former member of the Court of Auditors and against someone who used to be one of its temporary officials."
"I understand that a request has also been made for a financial reimbursement to the tune of EUR 28 000."
"Members of the Court of Auditors, I should like to ask you for your official reaction to the OLAF inquiry."
"Will you be taking on board the recommendations that the Court of Auditors has made?"
"Can you also give me permission to examine this OLAF dossier myself?"
"Thirdly, can you assure me that the case involving Mrs N is an isolated one and that it is not common practice within the Court of Auditors?"
"Members of the Court of Auditors, it is a crucial question because we will shortly be debating not only Parliament's discharge, the Commission's discharge, but also, among other things, the discharge of the Court of Auditors itself."
"I think that an honest and open answer from you is very important in terms of the Committee on Budgetary Control's, or Parliament's, ability to decide whether or not to grant you discharge with respect to the year 2001."
"Mr President, what would happen if a small Danish limited company with 100 employees were to draw up annual accounts about which a chartered accountant made a declaration emphasising that most of the reservations were due to the fact that they recurred from year to year; and if it were confirmed that the weaknesses were to a large extent due to the failure of the company's accounting system to provide adequate assurance that its balance sheet was complete and included all the elements of the company's activities; and if, in addition, the declaration stated that there were problems with the monitoring and security systems, and that the data in the system were not complete; and it continued by saying that it was a matter of concern that the company did not give a high enough priority to remedying these defects, and that it had not given sufficient consideration to the area or allocated enough resources to finding a solution to the problems within a reasonable time frame?"
"What would happen if it was ultimately concluded that no declaration could be made as to whether the construction work, purchases or services forming the basis of the payments to the local recipients, actually took place?"
"If all this happened, the board of directors would, firstly, refuse to give discharge to the management."
"It would then get rid of the management."
"After that, the taxation authorities would turn up and seize all the business's accounts documentation for critical analysis."
"Afterwards, the business would have its taxes raised to the tune of the undocumented expenditure, and finally there would be talk of criminal liability."
"But not so in the EU."
"This is just the approach we take for private business."
"Here, the Commission seeks to silence criticism by all possible means, which is exactly what happened with the sacked accounts director Mrs Marta Andreasen, and when Parliament wished to make thorough enquiries into her criticism, a majority in the Conference of Presidents prevented us from holding a hearing."
"If the criticism was unjustified, as the Commission claims, we would of course clear this up, and all would be well."
"However, the Commission knows, and the European Court of Auditors has confirmed, that the criticism is justified, and therefore it must not come to light."
"Instead, this Parliament chooses to turn a blind eye; which means giving discharge, as otherwise the citizens could find out that the EU finances are not under control."
"I think that it is incredibly unwise to continue with this hush-hush policy, and I do not believe that it is possible in the long run to avoid the scandal that is the EU's failure to manage the money the taxpayers are handing over to us."
"I find the report very enlightening."
"The problem is that we do not dare to back our criticism up with action."
"Mr President, every autumn, as the trees drop their leaves, we in this House discuss the European Court of Auditors' annual report, the content of which changes very little from one year to the next."
"It appears that the Commission hardly takes any notice of the criticisms and recommendations contained in this annual report."
"Is this really going to change this year?"
"We fear the worst."
"This Commission has been promising a change for the better since 1999, but the fact that by May 2002, no real action had been taken to reform the accounting system is, according to the EDD Group, an absolute mockery."
"The Commission is asking for a repeat of the fall in 1999, particularly in the light of the fact that Mrs Andreasen was not allowed to give us any information about the shortcomings in the accounting and the administrative organisation this morning."
"This being the case, we would ask the President of the Court of Auditors whether he would be able to submit a special report containing all the relevant information on this topic by mid-March 2003."
"We are tired of the Commission's delaying tactics and of its beating about the bush."
"Is the President of the Court of Auditors of the opinion that a more independent position in respect of the Commission could considerably enhance the effectiveness of his institution?"
"Given the virtually built-in surplus in the Structural Fund policy, this is due for a thorough overhaul, also in view of the EU's impending enlargement."
"In addition to better control, an integral policy evaluation is needed as a matter of urgency."
"Can the Court of Auditors indicate whether the unaltered course of the present Structural Fund policy after 2004 will lead to even greater administrative problems?"
"In our view, we should, as soon as possible, put a stop to the pumping around of government funding, which entails the considerable risk of it being taken advantage of."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the report which our former colleague, Mr Fabra Vallés, is presenting to us today is important in terms of what it says and what it suggests."
"It makes it very clear to us that the Commission's accounts are reliable, and also that, despite the criticism that can be made of the accounting system, this system is not necessarily the root cause of fraud."
"These are two things that I feel are important in the context of the debate that we are holding."
"Having said that, it goes without saying, Mr President, but above all, Commissioner, that this House is concerned by the Commission's accounting situation, and I must honestly say - even I who, as you know, always adopt a cautious attitude in the light of 'scandals' - that some decisions, such as the one taken this morning, do not, in my view, help the Commission to show that it can propose a legitimate reform of the accounting system and do this in good faith."
"I sometimes tell myself that 'we are learning nothing' or as the Latin saying goes 'oportet ut scandala eveniat!'."
"Why have we resorted to using a scandal, a mini-scandal, a mini-debate in order to delay a reform - reform which you yourselves have admitted is urgent - for such a long time?"
"That is the question that is essentially being raised."
"We look forward to your forthcoming decision."
"I believe, however, and the Court of Auditors says this, that this has nothing to do with the discovery of cases of fraud or poor management by the Commission, but I feel, in fact, that it is high time that this reform got off the ground, is discussed, and that it is carried out in all the institutions."
"It is a shame that it is caused by a situation that we have recently experienced."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the President of the Court of Auditors, Mr Fabra Vallés, on the report he has presented to us."
"It is a rigorous, clear and very focused report, which provides us with precise information on how the budget has been implemented."
"The most striking aspect of this report is, once again, the significant budgetary surplus for 2001: 16%."
"It is a very high percentage, as the previous speakers have been repeating, especially if we analyse it in detail and realise that, of the Structural Funds, just 70% has been implemented and that the SAPARD budget has barely been implemented at all, despite the fact that it is an enormously important instrument for the new countries of the European Union."
"A similar thing is also happening in the case of agricultural policy."
"With regard to the reliability of the accounts that the Commission has presented, the Court's report considers them to be adequate and, amongst the recommendations it makes, I would like to stress the one relating to the accounting system."
"As in previous years, the Court believes that actions should be taken to modify the current system in order to improve it."
"And given that this issue has led to some controversy - excessive controversy in my opinion - it would be desirable for the Commission to take very good account of the recommendations for modernisation of the accounting system and to make it as transparent as possible as soon as possible."
"I believe it is also necessary to point out the reference to the internal reform of the Commission and the slowness with which it is taking place."
"This is no doubt due to the fact that it is a complicated and ambitious process, but we should also remember that it is a necessary reform, and we therefore hope that the Commission will take very good account of the recommendations made to it."
"I do not wish to elaborate on the previous speeches."
"Practically all the Members who are speaking agree on the concerns in this report and the clarity with which they have been presented and I therefore believe that the ball is in the Commission's court."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Fabra Vallés once again."
"There is absolutely no doubt that his experience as a former member of the Committee on Budgetary Control has been a great help to him in carrying out his work."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to welcome this report by the Court of Auditors, in particular for the innovations it makes and for the wealth of its content, and to pay special tribute to the President, Mr Fabra Vallés."
"I would also like to thank the Commissioner for her kind words to me and I wish to offer her my particular thanks for the cooperation I have received from the Commission services in this discharge process."
"The framework of budgetary implementation in 2001 outlined by this report is characterised by a very strong implementation of the budget, which in particular affects appropriations for the pre-accession and Structural Fund programmes, due to ongoing shortcomings in Community accounting procedures, which need to be reformed as a matter of urgency, and also due to the persistence of long-standing problems, such as the lack of transparency in the Commission's handling of the system of protection for the European sugar industry."
"Amongst the shortcomings of the budgetary implementation it is particularly shocking to see that the stated concern at the lack of preparation of the candidate countries appears to have varied in a way that is inversely proportional to the Funds that have actually been made available to the final beneficiaries, especially to the farmers of these countries."
"It sometimes appears that the myriad consulting companies that hover around the European institutions, often composed of former officials or of officials on temporary leave, are more important than the citizens."
"The rules are also taking on an absurd and increasing complexity, which is out of step with reality."
"In the much needed revision of the accounting system everything - and I mean 'everything' - that is considered necessary to ensure that the EU's accounting systems adhere to international best practices and public accounting standards must be done."
"The modernisation of accounting and payment procedures, with clear, accessible and exhaustive codification of all expenditure, with the systematic notification of final beneficiaries and with clear and consistent terminology, are projects that we would like to see implemented."
"The transparency of relations between the European institutions and the outside world is a recurring concern."
"The Court's account of the case that led to the sugar system not being reformed demonstrates how one of the most anachronistic farming systems in the Community has been able to hold out for almost four decades without making any significant changes."
"In a complex high level intermediation system it is sometimes easy to forget the citizens in favour of the pressure groups, overlooking those in greatest need in favour of those who are able to exert the most and the most effective pressure."
"It is therefore crucial to make the fight for transparency and fairness part of our daily work."
"Mr President, many things have been said about the Commission's accounting system in the last six months."
"The European Court of Auditors confirms in no uncertain terms that many of the recurrent problems surrounding the underlying transactions, which are making it impossible to issue a statement of assurance without reservation, are due to the flawed accounting system."
"The Commission acknowledges most of the defects that the Court of Auditors points out."
"It never ceases to amaze me, however, that the Commission did not take action back in 2001, on the basis of the draft action plan which was submitted in that very year with a view to responding to some of the most pressing problems."
"I am now looking forward to a frank and serious discussion between the Commission and Parliament, so that we can finally get this cleared up."
"It is politically untenable that auditors' criticisms keep on coming."
"If something is wrong, it must be put right."
"The Commission has promised that its strategy for giving the EU an integrated accounting system based on the highest standards within the public sector will be presented at the end of this month."
"I wish to hold the Commission to this promise, and I welcome the action plan."
"I also hope, however, that the plan will get straight down to addressing the areas requiring immediate action, especially given that the Committee on Budgetary Control is to focus on just this accounting system in connection with the discharge for 2001."
"Mr President, I too welcome the Court of Auditors' report but I wonder about the statement just made by Mr Fabra Vallés."
"It has a very interesting spin on the words you have actually written within your report."
"You mention in your statement a lack of balance in what is being said in the public arena at the moment and I agree with this."
"I would have liked to equal that balance out from the 300 Commission spin-doctors that have been saying things about Marta Andreassen recently and point Members of Parliament's attention to the fact that she was gagged by that very same Commission this morning."
"But what did you write?"
"You wrote: 'Since the first statement of assurance in respect to the financial year 1994, the Court has repeated its reservations in respect to the reliability of the accounts."
"You also said: 'In the absence of a comprehensive accounting system, the year-end financial statements are drawn up largely on the basis of records which are not part of the accounts."
"I would say these are actually two quite shocking statements and, oddly enough, I would also say they back up exactly some of the things that Marta Andreassen, the Commission's former chief accountant, had been saying."
"If, as you just said in your statement, the accounts are so reliable, then why write those things in your report?"
"If the accounts are so good, why did so many heads of departments refuse to sign their own accounts off without reservations?"
"If your checks are so thorough, why do you not give us, the Parliament, a figure that we have requested for many years now, which is the percentage of money lost through fraud, mismanagement and waste - a figure you used to give us to allow us to have a benchmark to see if things are materially getting better."
"Finally, I have one or two questions for the Commissioner because I am quite sure that you are a wise political manoeuvrer, Commissioner Schreyer."
"I think you have probably heard a host of political speeches in this Parliament today about the Court of Auditors' reports and how people are framing themselves, looking forward to discharge."
"I believe you have a whole host of problems coming forward and, should you read the political tea-leaves correctly, you will be keen to get your reforms under way even quicker than you have done."
"So please, with that sort of political nous that you have, could you just answer a handful of very short questions for me?"
"Who did sign off within the Commission the accounts in 2001?"
"I think I have tabled this question to you and also a whole host of journalists have asked you this."
"We would really like that answer."
"Was it the Chief Accountant at the time?"
"Was it the Director-General of Budgets?"
"Was it you?"
"Was it some secretary?"
"Was it the commercial engineer you have employed as the Chief Accountant of the Commission presently?"
"What is going on within your systems?"
"We want reform."
"This Parliament urges you to reform, and if you do not quickly reform the system, then please leave and let someone who will do the job do it properly."
"Mr President, I would also like to thank the Court of Auditors for its report again this year."
"I am extremely disappointed that this is the first occasion on which the Court has been able to present its audit this year."
"I think it is one of the primary responsibilities of this Parliament and I am very saddened that it has taken it until December to put on the agenda something that came out in November."
"The way the report has been set out has improved a little bit; however, I think the document itself is still largely impenetrable."
"It is over-complicated and is badly presented."
"We hope, President, that you will continue in your efforts to make this clearer in future."
"The main issue on which the Budget Control Committee is likely to concentrate this year is of course the accounting system of the Commission."
"This is not because Marta Andreassen has told us that we should do that, but because the Court has been pointing out these failures since 1994."
"The fact is that the Commission has been extremely slow in instigating those reforms and we still are unlikely to see a complete radical reform until 2005."
"I think this is an unacceptable degree of complacency."
"We must go much further and set a more ambitious timetable."
"Although we do recognise, and in fact what we are asking the Commission to do here is already ahead of 11 EU Member States in their presentation of their accounts."
"But we are being tough on you and we want to push you to meet the standards of the best."
"The Court has also been remiss in the fact that they have failed again to name and shame Member States who have failed to control EU spending and I do not think we are ever going to identify the real culprits until the Court of Auditors stops being quite so cowardly and starts naming people."
"It is also worth noting, as people have said before, that this is the first year when Directors General have taken control of their own departments but 22 of those DGs have expressed reservations and we will be investigating those during our research."
"An issue that many are keen to follow is also the failure of the Commission to fine Member States who infringe EU directives and I would just like to warn the Commission that we are going to take this issue a lot more seriously."
"We want to see more money coming into EU coffers from the fines that should be imposed on Members States who fail to respect directives."
"Mr President, aware as I am of your usual agenda, I would like to thank you most sincerely for being here."
"Thank you very much."
"There have been a series of specific questions and general comments, but to stay somewhat in line with the agenda, I believe it was Mr Kuhne who said that he had confidence in Mr Casaca."
"As far as I am concerned, naturally, as far as I know, that confidence is complete and absolute."
"But not only confidence in him, but in the whole House, in all the Members, but I am aware of the usual good work of Mr Casaca."
"Furthermore, issues relating to the DAS have been mentioned."
"We are often asked when we will be able to provide a positive DAS."
"Well, I am convinced that the day that the internal control of the Commission - which has just begun - is working properly, will be the day when the DAS is positive."
"Because I am sure that it will be the Commission that rectifies and controls itself."
"Why do we not give the error rate?"
"I have said several times, whenever I am asked, that the error rate provides limited information and may lead to distorted interpretations."
"I therefore believe it is better not to provide this information."
"We are then told that we could provide the DAS by sector."
"If only!"
"And I say 'if only' because if we had the resources to carry out a DAS by sector, you may rest assured that we would do so."
"And you may be sure that we would derive much more information."
"The truth is that today, with the information provided by the DAS, something very clear has to be taken into account: to speak of mistakes does not always mean speaking of irregularities, and speaking of irregularities does not always mean speaking of fraud."
"Therefore, what the error rate indicates are errors and what we have to look at is the background to these errors."
"This error rate, because of the sampling system employed, is so small, that what we cannot do is give it to Parliament so that it can interpret it as if it were a clear result, which indicates exactly what people want to hear."
"That is the reason."
"We are working on a new methodology for the DAS and we hope that with that new methodology we will be able to reach a point where we can provide the information required by Parliament and that that will be sufficient for the needs of our budgetary authority, both the Council and Parliament."
"Mr Staes asked me a question about the case of Mrs N. All I can say about this is that, from the moment OLAF arrived at the Court of Auditors, all doors were left open to them, the cupboards unlocked and the computers switched on so that they could look at whatever they want."
"When you ask whether we have already taken measures, I believe that the Court of Auditors has adopted a prudent attitude, waiting for the Solicitor-General to assess the documentation provided by OLAF, because member N has yet to be heard."
"I believe that we, as the Court of Auditors, cannot pass judgment, because although we are called a court, we do not pass judgment, we only make recommendations."
"I therefore believe it is prudent to wait for the Solicitor-General in Luxembourg to assess the documentation provided to him by OLAF."
"But it should be noted that at this very moment there is a group of members of the Court working on this issue."
"What for?"
"To get as much as possible done before the Solicitor-General gives his opinion, whatever that opinion may be and whatever assessment he sees fit to make."
"Mr Dell'Alba said that he is worried."
"I believe we should all be worried."
"And we should all be because whether the Commission improves or not depends on all of us."
"I know that the honourable Members fulfil their duties, and I know because I used to be a Member of this House, and I remember how I used to enjoy getting stuck in."
"But I must say that I have found a completely different situation."
"It is not that I have passed over to the enemy or changed sides, nor have I moved over from Barcelona to Real Madrid, no; I have genuinely found a Commission which is different to the one I was accustomed to dealing with."
"A Commission in which I see daily changes. You say these changes cannot yet be seen in the final result?"
"It is true, they cannot."
"And do you know why?"
"Because this is not simply a face-lift."
"If it were simply a face-lift, a nip and a tuck, and the results would be visible very soon."
"The Commission is undergoing a profound change."
"And therefore until next year I am sure we will not see any changes."
"I believe that that confidence, and as well as confidence, help, should be offered by all of us, and we must not forget - you are in contact with the governments, with the States, and you must pass this on also to the governments - that one of the current problems the Commission has in terms of improving its results, the Community budget for improving its results, is also in the hands of the governments."
"Therefore, I believe that if all the institutions as well as the governments make an effort, we will help the Commission to achieve tangible results as soon as possible."
"I would say to Mr Heaton-Harris that I am sorry but I am not going to reply in relation to the former chief accountant because a disciplinary procedure is under way and I am not therefore going to answer."
"What I can say, and we should all agree on this, is that I believe there has been a mistake in the procedure; there has been a procedural error."
"And I would say to Mrs Morgan that of course we are making an effort."
"You ask us to make an effort; we really do make an effort every day, everyday we increase contacts and dialogue with the various institutions in order to improve our work."
"We hope that this work will be increasingly useful to you."
"I am prepared to commit myself to this, of course."
"I believed that the approach of the report had managed to improve something, because all I have done is seek something I would have asked for and present it as a consequence."
"It seems that it is not yet sufficient, but I promise, Mrs Morgan, that next year we will make a further effort."
"Mr President, I should briefly like to refer back to my speech."
"I asked the President of the Court of Auditors three questions, two of which were left unanswered."
"I specifically asked him whether I would be able to gain access to the dossier drafted by OLAF following the submission of my fraud dossier to the Court of Auditors."
"He failed to give me an answer to this."
"Neither have I received a reply to the question whether the case involving Mrs N, the former member of the Court of Auditors, is an isolated one and whether we can rely on this not being common practice within the Court of Auditors."
"Thirdly, I should say that I am extremely dissatisfied with his response."
"In its press release, OLAF first says the following about this case: 'we have submitted a dossier to the judicial authorities in Luxembourg'."
"I now hear that the Court of Auditors is waiting for the judicial inquiry in Luxembourg."
"I fear that this will take years and years, as is customary in Belgian courts."
"I should still urge the Court of Auditors to do as OLAF has recommended."
"Mr Staes, I am sorry for having left some of your questions out."
"With regard to the contents of OLAF's report, until there is a response from the Solicitor-General, the affair is sub judice, and there is therefore nothing more to say."
"Furthermore, in its report, OLAF makes it clear - and I will give you a small piece of information from the report - that the case of member 'N' is - and I quote - 'a specific case and the procedures used by the Court of Auditors for internal control are correct'."
"That is all."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the preparation of the Copenhagen European Council on 12 and 13 December 2002, including the institutional aspects of enlargement."
"- (DA) Mr President, Commissioner, former colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming European Council meeting in Copenhagen will play a decisive role in the conclusion of the Danish Presidency."
"The agenda will focus on two subjects: enlargement and the functioning of the Council in the light of enlargement."
"At the meeting, the Chairman of the Convention will brief the European Council on the status of the Convention's work, and, in addition, the European Council will meet with the President of the European Parliament, Mr Cox."
"Let me start with the latter."
"The meeting with the President of Parliament is of course an established tradition at meetings of the European Council; a tradition that the Heads of State and Government view as important and valuable."
"It is important that the institutions have a regular opportunity to exchange views and discuss key European questions, as we are also doing here today; and as the Danish Prime Minister and I did last week, when we were visited by Mr Prodi, President of the Commission, and Mr Cox, President of Parliament."
"I am quite sure that the meeting is fresh in their minds."
"If enlargement succeeds in Copenhagen, and it will, this will be another product of the hard work put in by the institutions and their effective cooperation over the last few years."
"Enlargement will be the most important item on the agenda of the European Council meeting in Copenhagen."
"For some months the pace of the accession negotiations has been very fast."
"We are now close to taking the decision that will seal the reunification of the continent of Europe: the conclusion of accession negotiations with the first group of candidate countries with a view to their accession on 1 May 2004."
"This has been incredibly difficult and complicated, and it has not yet been resolved."
"The fact that the possibility of concluding the negotiations now seems to be a reality is due in no small part to the positive result that was attained at the European Council meeting in Brussels."
"As you know, the Brussels European Council concluded that ten countries will be ready for membership from the beginning of 2004."
"The final and decisive negotiations are now taking place."
"Last week, the Presidency presented a negotiating package for each of the candidate countries."
"These packages represent the Presidency's proposal for a definitive resolution of the negotiations."
"They take into account - as far as possible - the views of the candidate countries, as presented at separate meetings with each individual country, and they are in line with the financial framework for enlargement, that is to say, with the Berlin Agreement and with the decisions from the European Council meeting in Brussels in October."
"The Presidency hopes that we can cover a lot of ground - as much as possible - in the negotiations before the European Council meeting in Copenhagen."
"It is no secret that the final negotiations will not be easy."
"Given the right willingness to compromise on the part of both present and future Member States, however, I am convinced that we shall achieve a successful result."
"Enlargement does not end in Copenhagen, however."
"The European Council also wants to give new impetus to the accession process for Bulgaria and Romania."
"A decision will be taken on detailed roadmaps and timetables, and pre-accession aid, in order to move forward the accession process with Bulgaria and Romania."
"The Commission's communication of 13 November on a roadmap for the two countries is a good step in the right direction."
"At the last European Council meeting, in October, the EU welcomed the new reform work in Turkey."
"The countries of the EU were unanimous in emphasising that the many important reforms in Turkey have expedited the start of accession negotiations with that country."
"Turkey's accession will follow the same principles and criteria as those applied to the other candidate countries."
"The EU is in the process of preparing the decision on the next step in Turkey's candidature."
"This decision will be taken at the Copenhagen European Council."
"The Presidency hopes that a solution to the Cyprus issue can be found ahead of Copenhagen."
"The EU supports wholeheartedly the UN Secretary-General's endeavours to find a solution."
"If a solution is not found to the political conflict in Cyprus at the Copenhagen Summit, the EU will take its decision on the accession of Cyprus on the basis of the conclusions from the Helsinki European Council in 1999."
"Setting the accession date for the new Member States entails a number of institutional consequences, and it is obviously important that Parliament is fully involved in the discussions on these consequences."
"I myself have had the pleasure of informing Parliament at all stages of these deliberations."
"I have already had the occasion to discuss matters: during the last session in Strasbourg, where this and other questions were raised by Mr Barón Crespo; and also last week in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, where we discussed the subject at length."
"The Presidency fully understands Parliament's keen interest in the institutional consequences of enlargement, and is willing to enter into an open discussion on these matters."
"At the same time, I must also draw attention to the complicated negotiating process under way at this time with regard to enlargement."
"Agreement must be reached not only within the Council (and within the other institutions), but also - and this is particularly important - with the future Member States."
"It can be said, therefore, that it is an ongoing, intensive process in which we do not have all the answers yet."
"The institutional questions are pressing."
"They are a necessary part of enlargement as a whole."
"Questions such as the weighting of individual countries' votes in the Council and the countries' representation in the European Parliament constitute an essential part of the accession treaty."
"We need to make a start now on laying down clear provisions for the transitional period."
"What we are talking about is primary legislation in line with the treaty."
"In this connection, I should like to make the point that the European Parliament will have to give its assent, and that the accession treaty needs to be ratified in both existing and new Member States."
"Agreement on the accession date of 1 May 2004 is based on detailed discussions on what is desirable and what is possible in the light of the ratification process in both the present and the future Member States."
"We owe it to the future members not to delay accession for any longer than is absolutely necessary."
"I believe this goes for us all: Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"This means that there is a need for certain transitional arrangements."
"This was also the case with previous enlargements."
"It has been suggested in Parliament that the 2004 elections to the European Parliament be held on an earlier date, for example 9 May."
"I personally sympathise with this view."
"The matter was discussed in detail over many years in connection with the revision of the Common Act on direct elections, which has recently been amended (published in the Official Journal of 21 October 2002)."
"All sorts of dates have been considered, but in vain."
"Unfortunately, I do not believe that further attempts to change the date will bear fruit."
"It is not the Presidency, however, that is standing in the way of a different, earlier, date."
"I hope that Parliament appreciates the situation that the Commission will find itself in during the period between the accession of the new Member States and the investiture of the new Commission."
"Obviously redistributing the portfolios within the Commission for a period of just half a year is not a satisfactory solution."
"The Presidency hopes Parliament accepts that the interim Commissioners from the new countries will not be subject to hearings or approval by Parliament."
"This avoids any possibility of prejudicing the new Parliament's opinion of the new Commission."
"It is of course unacceptable to the new Member States that 'their' Commissioners should be approved by a Parliament in which the new countries are not yet represented by MEPs with voting rights."
"The proposed solution avoids any possibility of prejudicing the choice of candidates by the President-designate of the European Commission in the composition of the new Commission."
"It goes without saying that, if the Commissioners from the new countries do not have a portfolio during the period up to the investiture of the new Commission, there is very little point in Parliament's specialist committees holding hearings of the new Commissioners and examining them in specialist areas they do not have."
"This is why I hope that Parliament can see its way clear to agreeing to the new Commissioners being appointed on the basis of a simplified procedure in the transitional period, until a new Commission can be appointed with the full involvement of Parliament."
"Lastly, there is the question of the full participation of the new Member States in the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference."
"The Council has a clearly defined position on this matter."
"The new Member States must be placed on an equal footing with the old Member States in the negotiations that will shape their and our common future."
"And, like the old Member States, they must of course have the right of veto."
"We cannot in decency do otherwise."
"I have endeavoured to explain the complicated institutional consequences of enlargement."
"I am looking forward to our debate."
"I will listen very carefully and am open to all good suggestions for realistic alternative solutions."
"The Council will discuss the institutional consequences of enlargement once more at the General Affairs Council meeting on Monday and Tuesday."
"It has already been agreed that I shall be present myself at the meeting of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on 10 December."
"This will be an opportunity for me to brief the competent parliamentary committee on the latest developments, and for a discussion on their significance."
"In my opinion it is natural that the discussion should take place within this committee, but if Parliament should wish for a different forum for the debate, on the date in question, 10 December, I am, of course, at your disposal."
"The Seville European Council instructed the Danish Presidency to continue working on the question as to how the presidency will function in the future in an enlarged EU."
"The Presidency was to present an initial report at the meeting in Copenhagen."
"This will mean that we can have an initial orientation debate on the subject there."
"The Presidency's report has three models for the form the presidency could take in future, and the report deals in this respect with the question of strengthening the role of the High Representative and the possibility of having an elected President of the European Council."
"It is not the intention that the European Council will take a decision on the models."
"The Presidency will suggest that the further work on shaping the presidencies of the future be continued in both the Council and the Convention, and, as far as the latter is concerned, this forms part of its general discussions on the institutions."
"At the meeting in Copenhagen, the Chairman of the Convention will give a report on the progress that has been made in the Convention."
"This dialogue is very important."
"With the presentation, last month, of a draft Constitutional Treaty, the work of the Convention entered a decisive phase."
"The discussions on the details within the framework the chairman presented are making rapid progress."
"The basis for the Convention's end product is now being created."
"In this connection, it is good to see that the draft Constitutional Treaty has given rise to a Europe-wide debate on the form the Europe of the future will take."
"It bodes well for our common ambition to create European cooperation which is more democratic and has grass-roots support."
"Over the whole of its term, the Presidency has worked towards seeing to it that the work in the Convention unfolds in accordance with the aim of producing a good and well prepared input to the Intergovernmental Conference."
"As will have been clear from my statement, the European Council has an extensive and ambitious agenda for its meeting."
"It is my hope and belief that all the countries at the meeting will show the necessary willingness to compromise and help to take the important decisions I have spoken of here."
"In Copenhagen we hope to be able to take a historic decision on the greatest enlargement in the history of the Community to date, and I also dare say the enlargement with the most far-reaching consequences and the broadest historical perspective."
"The great debate on enlargement that took place in Parliament last month is just one example of the strong will Parliament has shown, and the efforts it has made, to make this project succeed."
"And, as I said at the start, this great project can only succeed if the three institutions work closely together."
"I believe that they have done so, and I should like to thank Parliament once more for the clear messages it has given out all along when it comes to the enlargement ahead of us."
"I particularly note your intention to attend a meeting of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on 10 December 2002 to take up some of these institutional questions."
"I recall that later in that week in Copenhagen, we will have a meeting of the Conference of Presidents with the Danish Prime Minister."
"Perhaps in our own internal debate within the groups, we can see how to try to coordinate some positions and to what extent, if it is possible, we could advance or progress the sensitive questions on institutions."
"Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, in 1993, the Copenhagen European Council set in motion the current enlargement process, the largest-scale enlargement in the Union's history."
"Almost ten years on, we are nearing the end of that process."
"At the end of next week, the Heads of State and Government will be back in the Danish capital to take the final decisions."
"What is on the agenda at Copenhagen?"
"Basically three points."
"The negotiations need to be wound up with the ten candidate countries named in the Commission's report of last October, the pre-accession strategy to help Bulgaria and Romania speed up their preparations for membership needs to be strengthened and a decision is needed on the next steps in Turkey's candidacy."
"I will expand on these three points today."
"First, however, let me say something about the decisions we must take to organise the three great changes which will take place in 2004: the accession of the new Member States, the appointment of the new Commission and the European Parliament elections."
"We can now establish the heavy schedule of political and institutional events in 2004 in the light of the reflections taking place in Parliament on how to organise the various deadlines related to the arrival of the new Member countries and the European elections."
"I think the recommendations we are getting from the Council can, if necessary, be revised and supplemented to accommodate Parliament's specific needs in the best way possible."
"I suggest we organise things in the most practical order and, where the Treaty is silent, that we use common sense."
"Politically, it is highly significant that the European elections should be at the centre of the institutional activities related to enlargement."
"The new Parliament will open its doors immediately to the new Member States' elected representatives, who will come in as full members of this House, and it will thus be able to approve the appointment of the new body of Commissioners legitimately, and they will take office as soon as possible."
"How is the Copenhagen Summit shaping up in terms of the main point on the agenda - enlargement?"
"The Brussels European Council brought agreement within the Union on the broad outlines of the offer to the ten candidate countries, in particular as regards the agricultural and budgetary issues."
"The European Council's conclusions were presented immediately to the Heads of State and Government of the candidate countries, who reacted favourably to them on the whole."
"Nonetheless, many issues still have to be resolved before an agreement acceptable to all concerned can be reached."
"The Presidency of the Council and the Commission have worked - and will continue to work - ceaselessly to reach an agreement."
"Without going into detail on the discussions under way, I will outline some of the main points."
"Firstly, we need to find a suitable way of respecting a principle we all agree on. In 2004, 2005 and 2006 the net amounts received by the candidate countries from the European Union should not be lower than those they receive in 2003."
"Secondly, the candidate countries need assistance to prepare better for the task of controlling the Union's external borders. This means enabling them to carry out their tasks under Schengen properly."
"Lastly, we need to solve certain specific points relating to the agricultural policy."
"First and foremost, the Commission fully supports the Danish Presidency in its efforts to reach the necessary compromise on all these matters."
"Some Member States have expressed reservations regarding the substance of the offer to the candidate countries. We, however, do not share their view."
"Like the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Rasmussen, I consider that a reasonable offer should be made - an offer that allows the candidate countries to defend the Copenhagen outcome before public opinion in their own countries."
"We must keep within the overall framework laid down at the Brussels European Council, but openness, flexibility and generosity are also needed."
"Secondly, last week, I appealed publicly to the leaders of the candidate countries to show realism in this last lap of the negotiations."
"Indeed, I note that many points are still unresolved and we have only a few days left."
"We are skating on thin ice and progress must be made."
"There are times in history when narrow sectoral interests, however legitimate, must give way before the general interest."
"That is the law of democracy and we must apply it."
"I want to reiterate earnestly that most of the points of the final compromise must be decided at the forthcoming General Affairs Council meeting on 9 and 10 December."
"We cannot leave the Copenhagen European Council to decide on dozens and dozens of details."
"Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, before this House, I appeal to the good sense of the leaders of the candidate countries and the leaders of the Fifteen."
"The remaining difficulties must be settled quickly in the same spirit of partnership and friendship that has presided over all the accession negotiations."
"I would also like to comment on the latest developments regarding the conclusion of the negotiations with Cyprus."
"As you know, the European Union has always backed the endeavours of the United Nations Secretary-General and, in the last few weeks Kofi Annan has taken the courageous initiative of putting forward a plan for a global settlement. That plan has our full backing."
"The reactions of the parties concerned have, on the whole, been positive."
"They have accepted these proposals as an appropriate basis for a settlement and, in the next few days, they will respond with their proposals."
"We hope these contributions will allow Mr Kofi Annan to make more progress towards a solution."
"We have already formally stated that we are ready to take account of the terms of such a settlement in the accession arrangements for Cyprus, and we will endeavour to do so if such an agreement is reached."
"In any case, the commitments entered into at Helsinki remain valid for the candidacy of Cyprus."
"As regards Bulgaria and Romania, the Copenhagen European Council will have to adopt the Commission's proposals for detailed roadmaps, including precise timetables and increased pre-accession assistance, in order to take the accession process forward."
"As you know, these two countries have proposed 2007 as their target date for accession and the Commission believes no effort must be spared to achieve that target."
"Lastly, a word about Turkey."
"This House has already had occasion to debate the issue at length. For my part, I want to state our position once more, in particular in the light of contacts Commissioner Verheugen and I have had recently with the leader of the AKP, Mr Erdogan."
"On the basis of the Helsinki Conclusions, the Commission regards Turkey as a candidate on an equal footing with other candidate countries, and therefore as subject to exactly the same assessment criteria."
"The report the Commission presented on Turkey in October was based on objective information that no one disputed."
"It noted Turkey's progress towards meeting the Copenhagen political criteria. It also noted the remaining difficulties."
"In short, Turkey has come a long way but much remains to be done."
"The new Turkish Government's legislative programme confirms this."
"Indeed, the government plans to present several series of legislative measures, and even constitutional amendments, to the Turkish parliament in order to bolster democracy and human rights in Turkey."
"The European Union must encourage this process. It is in our interest that a major partner such as Turkey, whose role is enormously important strategically, politically and economically, should reinforce its institutions, improve the quality of its democracy and commit itself unequivocally to the values and principles we all share."
"On the other hand, before we take an irreversible step, we must be sure that Turkey meets all the conditions fully, just as we have in the case of the other candidate countries."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the prospect of approaching membership of the Union has given millions of Europeans a new political and economic perspective."
"Above all it has given them hope."
"Hope is the rarest and most valuable commodity in politics."
"History has not been kind to these peoples recently, but now they have the hope of a better future - a future of dignity, freedom and prosperity."
"I am certain that this hope will carry the Union forward for many years to come and that, together with the governments and peoples of the incoming Member States, we will achieve great things."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, changes and developments are now occurring on at least a daily, even an hourly, basis, and so the picture I can give you at the moment is only a snapshot of that moment."
"It prompts a number of observations on the subject of Copenhagen."
"For a start, we have not yet reached the objective."
"There are still very considerable differences in outlook between the Member States and the candidate countries, and any real result in Copenhagen will demand abundant political courage, far-sightedness, and a great deal of leadership."
"I am of course glad to hear it said that we are dealing here with an historic dimension, which must not be allowed to be brought down by this or that detail."
"Do you think I do not know that?"
"But even great and historic projects have to be paid for, everything has to be done decently and in order, and we have to get through the difficulties in which we find ourselves at the moment."
"I am confident, though, that the Heads of State and Government will indeed weigh up the risks we would run if we did not achieve a result, and the concessions that might still be required in Copenhagen."
"Secondly, it is important that Copenhagen should not be overloaded, and I am saying this to the future Member States, whom I earnestly urge to do their utmost to sort out the many bilateral issues and leftovers from the negotiations by the beginning of next week, which I think they have a very good chance of being able to do."
"But I am also addressing the Member States, who must resist the temptation to tie the great decision on enlargement to the advancement of certain national interests."
"It is with a certain amount of concern that I see the first attempts being made at wrapping up packages that are not appropriate."
"Thirdly, we have to achieve an outcome in which there are no winners or losers."
"Those who think in terms of winners and losers will fail."
"We have to achieve an outcome in which there are only winners, one in which the principal victor is Europe as a whole."
"So everyone should be aware that the proposal from the Presidency that is now on the table, which was worked out together with the Commission and is fully endorsed by it as it stands, is a fair and even-handed offer to the Member States."
"Although it is now the accession of ten states that we are now organising rather than the six planned in Berlin in 1999, the Danish proposal is over EUR 2 billion below the upper limit laid down in Berlin."
"This gives the candidate countries an argument when they ask how it is that it is suddenly no longer possible to make the funds available that, in 1999, were considered appropriate for six countries, even though we now have ten countries to deal with."
"That is an argument that is not easy to counter, and so I hope that there will be some movement here."
"I really have to tell you that one problem is the result, quite simply, of the rules we have made for the European Union."
"The new Member States will have to pay full contributions from the very outset, but, as you know, the flow of funds is very slow, and it is subject to certain rules."
"Not only do we have the problem of having to prevent new members from becoming net contributors; we also have the additional problem that we may not allow the new Member States' state budgets to become unbalanced."
"It is that problem that we have at the moment."
"Let me just add, in conclusion, that the proposal currently under discussion has already taken on board many of the candidate countries' arguments and aspirations and contains many new ideas, the most important of which, in my view, is the creation of what is termed a Schengen facility, by which we will be supporting the new members in securing our external borders."
"I believe that what makes this idea so good is the fact that it will persuade the citizens that money is being spent here for a purpose that is of benefit to us all."
"As President Prodi has made reference to Romania, Bulgaria, Cyprus and Turkey, I do not need to repeat what he said, but I do want to put forward a few ideas for your consideration."
"In the situation as it is at the moment, in which we are closer than we have been in decades to resolving the Cyprus problem, and there is a real opportunity to sort the problem out - an opportunity that will pass us by if it is not done before Copenhagen - at a moment such as this, positive, encouraging signs are of extraordinary importance."
"It would therefore be right and proper for the European institutions, even before Copenhagen, to speak out clearly in favour of the international community taking its share of responsibility in managing the great tasks that will remain to be dealt with after the Cyprus issue is resolved."
"This country will have great burdens laid upon it, burdens that it cannot bear alone, and it will be dependent on help from the international community."
"The sooner the international community declares its readiness to provide this aid, the greater, perhaps, will be the willingness to do as the United Nations proposes."
"All things considered, I believe that we can be satisfied with the position that we have reached."
"What we now need is a final great effort, an effort made in full awareness of the fact that time is running out."
"We have often spoken of a window of opportunity."
"I had no inkling of just how true that is."
"We must all be aware that if we do not act now, every month in which we hesitate will make things more and more difficult."
"I am firmly convinced that it would take only six months for the Budget situation in the Member States to make a solution almost impossible."
"So I can only say that it must be done now, and all parties must, in heart and mind, surmount the obstacles!"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I will start by asking for your indulgence, as I am going to do something I have never done before and leave the Chamber immediately after my speech. The reason for this is that, contrary to what it had agreed with me, Turkish television has announced that Mr Watson and I will be available for a discussion starting at 5 p.m.."
"Not wishing to give the wrong political impression, I will go and do it, although I do not otherwise comply with requests of this sort if they have not been agreed in advance."
"Let us turn, though, to Copenhagen: from Copenhagen to Copenhagen!"
"I wish the summit of Heads of State and Government under Danish presidency great success, in order that we may tackle the issues that remain to be resolved."
"This summit in Copenhagen must become a summit for enlargement."
"We must not end up in a situation in which Turkey is the sole topic for discussion."
"Turkey may well be important, but Copenhagen must send out a signal that the peoples of Central Europe, plus Malta and Cyprus, are joining the community of values that is the European Union."
"That must stand centre-stage."
"Copenhagen must consummate the historic process of the 1980s and 1990s, and, to that end, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we wish you much success!"
"I can endorse wholeheartedly what has been said on behalf of the Commission, both by President Prodi and by Commissioner Verheugen, both of whom, as well as the President-in-Office of the Council, I wish to thank for the work they have done."
"Speaking on behalf of our group, I would also like to remind you that, even if the Danish proposal is accepted, we still have EUR 2.391 billion in hand, on the assumption that the figure, to which Commissioner Verheugen referred, is correct."
"We should be counting every euro, and, as President Prodi will be aware, I am very much in favour of stability, but the outcome of Copenhagen must not be that the whole enlargement project is deferred for lack of agreement on the financial issues."
"We therefore call on the governments to achieve a result in Copenhagen."
"I would think it a tragedy, ladies and gentlemen, if we ended up without an agreement with Poland, a country that was at the heart of change in Europe - I do not want to recapitulate the historical circumstances all over again; I have done it often enough - and if we ended up without an agreement with Poland, the country to which, along with others of course, we owe the great change in Europe."
"Hence the demand that the Heads of State and Government should do something now and make a result possible."
"And now for Turkey."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European Court of Justice is fifty years old today; at any rate, it was fifty years ago that it was convened for the first time, on 4 December 1952."
"The law matters to us."
"There are criteria for accession, and they include such things as the law."
"We cannot, then, take certain things - all of which are important but have nothing to do with the criteria as such - as reasons for now naming a date for negotiations with Turkey, even though the criteria have in no way been met!"
"We firmly reject the idea that Copenhagen should name a date for negotiations!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I say this in full awareness of the fact - which I do not conceal and have never sought to conceal - that there are within our group widely divergent views on whether or not Turkey should be a member."
"Some are very strongly in favour of Turkish membership, while others advocate a strategic or privileged partnership."
"This is indeed normal in a large group, and I am sure that other groups differ but little."
"We are not talking only about Turkey, however, when we agree, absolutely and 100%, that it would breach our own requirements and be in contravention of them, if we were now to throw overboard what we have defined as conditions for the commencement of negotiations."
"What will be the image of the European Union if pressure is exerted over the Cyprus issue, if we are told that, if there is no date right now, the Cyprus issue will not be resolved?"
"We are becoming susceptible to extortion!"
"I therefore recommend that we rely on the firm foundations of European law and criteria."
"The Commission has pointed us in the right direction; we are not opening any negotiations right now, because the criteria have not been fulfilled, and, on this, our group has no reservations whatever in following the Commission's lead."
"What I expect of the Council Presidency, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is that you too take your stand on the basis of the criteria and of what has hitherto been agreed in the Community of Fifteen."
"If you take a different line, our assessment of the Danish Presidency's achievements will be less favourable than it has been so far."
"Nor do we accept the way in which the United States of America is trying to exert influence; whilst they have the right to bring influence to bear, it is influence and pressure to which we shall not yield!"
"Now, I am also aware that there are countries in the European Union that lag behind others; in particular, that there is a major EU country that needs to make up for lost time in its solidarity with America, and this country is therefore susceptible to pressure."
"For us, as a friend and partner of America, the pressure of no consequence whatever, as we are following our own principles, and so what we say to our American partners and friends is this: You can make recommendations to us, but we will act in accordance with our own convictions!"
"We now hear from Turkey that the Cyprus issue will not be resolved if they are not given a date."
"We had a clear basis, to which the President-in-Office of the Council referred: if the Cyprus issue is not resolved within the framework of a federation of both parts of the island, then what had previously been resolved by the European Union will apply, and the whole island - but in reality only its Greek part - will become a member."
"I have one further comment to make to the Commission on the post-1 May 2004 order."
"Our recommendation to the Council and to the Commission is that no decision, whether anticipatory or otherwise, should be taken without reference to Parliament."
"We are prepared to be flexible in any way that will be appropriate, but what you can depend on is that we will always defend Parliament's rights."
"It is on this basis that we seek good cooperation with all the institutions of the European Union."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Poettering, 'inshallah'."
"We are on the eve of an important historical event: the reunification of Europe, rather than the conclusion of a new stage in enlargement, of which this is the fifth."
"I believe we must wish the Danish Presidency luck in its task since this is a very important moment."
"Vice-President Titley and other colleagues from my group will deal with all aspects of this issue."
"I will restrict myself to thanking the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Haarder, for his reference to my question from the previous plenary session, specifically in relation to the institutional aspects and their relevance to the European Parliament."
"I must say that I consider the behaviour over recent weeks of the Commission and the Council in relation to issues which are not only subject to negotiation with the enlargement countries, but which affect our daily life and the essence of Parliament, to be entirely unacceptable."
"I still maintain that criticism."
"I have listened carefully to President-in-Office Haarder and President Prodi."
"I am grateful and pleased that you are coming on the 10 December to Parliament's Committee on Constitutional Affairs, but I maintain my criticism for the following reasons: firstly, it has been proposed to modify the mandate of the Commission;"
"I have always thought, and we have therefore always advocated, that the Commission should be chosen, that from the day of the European elections the Commission should be operational."
"It was said that its mandate would last until January and now it turns out that the date for the end of the Commission's operations is being brought forward."
"It is never made to coincide with the elections, which worries me very much."
"Secondly, the General Affairs Council of 18 November took a series of decisions which affect many areas, specifically, the parliamentary timetable for 2004, and which make this Parliament during the next legislature a concertina Parliament."
"We will have Members who are here for just a month, and then we will have the incorporation of other Members from the candidate countries who will have joined the Union."
"Then, if the negotiations with Rumania and Bulgaria are concluded at the same time, there will be another modification; if it is not at the same time, there will be two modifications."
"In other words, we will not know what the absolute majority in this Parliament is nor what its membership will be over the next legislature."
"This has not therefore been done well and it causes many problems."
"Furthermore, I do not believe it makes any sense to have Commissioners spending several months with nothing to do in the Commission."
"I believe that Parliament must defend its right to hold hearings and to appoint a Commission on the basis of a joint programme and that is our duty to the electors."
"I hoped that in the 'trialogue', as President Prodi said, there would be progress on this issue."
"But, Mr President, since there has been no information from you, I very much fear that there has been no progress in last week's 'trialogue'; if I am mistaken, please tell me now."
"And I would ask you please, and we are awaiting the meeting of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs of 10 December, to raise these issues seriously at the European Council in Copenhagen, because this is not the way to act."
"And finally, and I will end here, I still have hope because, as Alfonso X the Wise, a philosopher king, said, 'if God had consulted me on the day of the Creation, I would have given him some useful advice'."
"Neither the Council nor the Commission are God, and neither are we the Devil."
"I will briefly respond to Mr Barón Crespo."
"The dialogue of last week had only one definitive context as far as Parliament is concerned: an opportunity for me to confirm in person what I had already done in writing, that Parliament would insist that no definitive decision on the question of dates should be arrived at without having an adequate dialogue and understanding between the institutions including Parliament."
"Thereafter, because there is, from my own appreciation of the points made by different colleagues here, a diversity of parliamentary views, I was not in a position to express a definitive view except the view that there should be no final decision without our consent."
"I should not now enter the debate."
"Mr President, Copenhagen has been the place of many controversial summits but none will be more so than next week when the camel of enlargement approaches the eye of the needle of European domestic politics."
"We know that enlargement will make us more multi-cultural and more competitive."
"The central question is: will it also make us more democratic?"
"Many of the answers to that question are being teased out inside the Convention, but it is certainly up to the European Council and not the president, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, to decide just how far and how fast Member States are prepared to project the Union's experience in parliamentary democracy to the east and the south."
"I trust that the European Council and the Commission will be generous to Turkey in this respect."
"We should throw ourselves behind the process of regime change which is taking place in Turkey."
"There would be no stronger way of expressing support for Turkey's reformers than offering a schedule for the opening of the accession negotiations but only on the condition that the Turkish Cypriots were brought to accept the Annan proposals for a federated settlement of the problem of Cyprus."
"It will certainly be far more possible for them to accept a UN settlement should there be a firm prospect of membership for motherland Turkey itself."
"They frankly require the assurance of our settled intentions concerning our future partnership with Turkey and I know that the presidency will do all that it can to achieve this great breakthrough that is in its grasp."
"Mr President, my thanks also to the Danish Presidency, the Commission and others. We are facing a kind of evaluation, and the time has come to hand out a little praise, and of course a small amount of criticism, too."
"First, the praise."
"I wish to commend the Danish Presidency for managing to secure the release of Akhmed Zakayev before the great Copenhagen Summit gets under way."
"It was a splendid decision and means that many of my worst fears have fortunately not come true."
"I also wish to praise the Presidency for its hard work on enlargement."
"I think, however, that it is worth remembering that praise is also due to the applicant countries for the herculean task of adapting themselves, and for the formidable tasks the populations of these countries have had to undertake in connection with this whole process."
"I also wish to point out, as Mr Verheugen did, that it is not over yet."
"Besides the fact that we have not quite completed the whole project, the people of these countries will of course also be voting on whether or not they want to join us."
"In this connection, it is to be hoped that these voters do not compare the debate on money with the debate we had earlier today, the one about all the money - the large amounts of euros - that, for various reasons, the Commission has not been able to use."
"I hope that the citizens of the applicant countries do not look at the two things side by side and become frustrated."
"I hope for a 'yes' vote."
"As regards Turkey, I also agree that the time has not yet come to give that country a date, but I think that the right thing to do would be to give it a date for a date; in other words, set a combination of a timetable and a roadmap."
"What are the practical demands we are making of them?"
"What are the deadlines?"
"How are they to be met?"
"When must the individual parts of the human rights and democracy projects be implemented in Turkey in order that we can set the final date?"
"It is obvious that it is not possible to give a fixed date right now, with fundamental aspects still not in place and many decisions yet to be implemented."
"A date for a date, however, would be the right thing to do."
"There are a couple of things, however, that have disappointed me about the Danish Presidency."
"I am disappointed that it did not manage to do something about the Statute of the Ombudsman."
"I am disappointed that it is still not possible for the Ombudsman to obtain the documents he asks for."
"Not only to be permitted to sit down somewhere and read them, but also to have those documents handed over which he has asked for, and which he needs in order to carry out his work."
"I am also disappointed that no progress was made towards ensuring that the employees who are in contact with the Ombudsman are only bound by one thing, that is, by the truth, rather than by any form of loyalty to one of the institutions of the EU."
"These employees must be bound by the truth in order to ensure the proper treatment of citizens within this system, and tackling this was one of Denmark's clear priorities."
"I am also disappointed with Denmark's readiness to cooperate with the USA in connection with the war with Iraq, and also in relation to the EU's list of terrorist organisations."
"I should like to hear where the Presidency stands on the plans to put the Iranian resistance movement on the list of terrorist organisations."
"Does this not conflict with what Denmark, amongst others, supported when the list of terrorist organisations was first discussed, which was that resistance movements comparable with the ANC or the Danish resistance movement must under no circumstances end up on the list of terrorist organisations?"
"We have a problem, and I should like to hear the views of the Danish Presidency on this."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we always have the option of saying the same thing at every meeting."
"Let us repeat ourselves, therefore, although it may be that, for once, it will not be necessary."
"First of all, with regard to the timetable, I would like to say one very simple thing: the Commission, the Council and Parliament must come to an agreement together."
"It is unacceptable for the Council to set one timetable and for the Commission to set another."
"We must reach an interinstitutional agreement."
"Once this agreement has been reached, it is up to Members of Parliament to come to an agreement, because different points of view coexist within this House."
"I am against the idea of bringing forward the elections, against decisions which would not change anything in terms of historic opportunities and could lead us, in my view, to speed things up, leading us inevitably to failure."
"We must find an interim solution for the new commissioners during the six-month period."
"I think that the most important thing, and no one has mentioned this, is that, if the Convention succeeds - and I hope it will - in convincing everyone that the President of the Commission must be elected by Parliament, and if the IGC accepts this, I shall, in that case, call on the Council to bring forward the ratification, because this procedure could take 18 months otherwise."
"As things stand, the next Commission will not be able to be elected under this procedure, simply because we will not have enough time for the IGC to endorse the appointments."
"It is therefore absolutely essential that the Council anticipates and accepts what has been decided by the Convention and by the IGC, and therefore that, when the next Commission is constituted, and this is the most important thing in my eyes, the next President is elected by Parliament, thus anticipating what is decided by the Convention and the IGC."
"That is the most important thing."
"As far as Turkey is concerned, we must be responsible."
"We cannot decide on Turkey's accession plan now."
"There are some possibilities of Turkey joining the EU, but there are also some arguments against its accession."
"What we must say today, therefore, is 'no' to those who say that Turkey is not part of Europe, and 'no' as well to those in the US and the UK who tell us that Turkey must at all costs be part of Europe."
"President Clinton had even said that Russia should definitely be part of Europe."
"So we say to the US that Mexico and Canada must be part of the United States."
"How about that?"
"I do not understand why it is up to the US to decide who must be part of Europe."
"I believe, therefore, that this question remains open."
"There are important debates to be held, but I call on the President of Parliament and the President-in-Office of the Council to write a letter to the Turkish Government and tell it, in order to give it the opportunity to prove his good intentions, that we are organising a meeting in Strasbourg for all the Sakharov Prize winners, and that, in the light of this meeting, Leila Zana must be freed in order to be able to take part."
"It would be an extraordinary manifestation of Turkey's goodwill."
"This is what can be done in the near future, Mr President."
"Therefore, Mr President, write to the Turkish Government."
"It would certainly be an extraordinary gesture before Copenhagen if the Turkish Government allowed Mrs Zana to come to the meeting of all the Sakharov Prize winners."
"This is how we could move things forward."
"I would like to end by simply repeating exactly what I always say: financially, our proposals for enlargement will not be enough, not by a long shot."
"The Council is wrong, the Commission is wrong."
"We cannot operate on the same budget with 25 Member States as we did with 15."
"Ceterum censeo Carthaginem esse delendam."
"We always have to repeat the same thing."
"One day, you will understand history and the meaning of history."
"Mr President, we are standing on the threshold of a truly historic European Council where we expect the final political decision will be taken to give the green light to ten applicant countries to become full Member States in 2004."
"The groundwork has been done and I commend you, Mr President, for your leadership and enthusiasm for the European project and also the Commission and the Danish presidency for their efficiency in dealing with this unprecedented project."
"Enlargement to welcome ten new States and tens of millions of new European citizens into the EU is both a bold gesture and the accomplishment of our true European destiny."
"I urge the heads of State and Governments to be similarly bold in proposing a package of measures for Bulgaria and Romania that will ensure that those States too may fully rejoin the European family of nations as early as possible."
"I also hope that a genuine and significant decision will be made in relation to the Turkish application for membership."
"It is clear that Turkey has a key role to play in shaping the European Union of the future and we must do all in our power to guarantee that the new Turkish Government is given full support and encouragement in its desire to make their country meet the Copenhagen criteria so as to begin accession negotiations."
"Mr President, the Copenhagen Summit will be a historic event."
"Ten countries will be able to join the EU from 2004, two countries from 2007, and Turkey will probably be given a date for its next meeting."
"Europe is growing together, which is a good thing."
"However, the EU membership that is now being negotiated is not the kind the applicant countries will actually receive."
"They can say 'yes' to the EU, but as early as next Christmas, when the Rome Summit has buried the Treaty of Rome and the constitution of Rome is born, they will be given the status of constituent state of a new federal state."
"The completion of the new constitution is planned for before the new countries join, with their right of veto in matters of treaty amendments."
"This is unfair, as Mr Haarder also said."
"When the applicant countries have signed their membership agreements, and when they have been approved here in Parliament - by March or April - they should be offered equal status with the present Member States and enjoy the same legal representation in all bodies."
"If a referendum says 'no' to membership, the country's representation can cease in the same way as when Norway voted 'no' to EC membership and had to find an ambassador job for its Commissioner."
"If the referendums confirm membership, this membership becomes a reality, and the countries should have the same right of veto in matters of treaty amendments as the present Member States."
"They must not join as second-class members, but instead have equal rights from day one."
"I also think that we could be much more accommodating with regard to the funding of their membership of the EU."
"When Denmark, a rich country, joined in 1973, we actually only paid 20% of our contribution in the first year, 40% the next, 60% the third and 80% the fourth, until, after five years, we reached our full contribution."
"Why can we not adopt a similar introductory arrangement with reduced contributions, or grant exemption from contributions, while these countries are so far behind us in terms of wealth?"
"We should bear in mind that EC and EU membership is, of course, not just something one receives."
"For some it is actually very expensive insurance, as ordinary people have to pay contributions via their daily purchases of everyday goods and via national taxation."
"Everyone has to pay, but only very few receive subsidies from the EU budget."
"We should perhaps now look into redistribution, or Mr Rasmussen runs the risk of getting an unpleasant surprise when people realise how much they will have to pay in contributions to the EU."
"Just a few words about the next point on the agenda."
"There should be a move towards wages being paid through the front door, and being taxed in the Member States; and the system of travel expenses should be changed to a card system for Members, according to which Parliament pays all the expenses incurred, whatever their magnitude."
"Mr President, Mr Bonde first became a Member of Parliament - as I did - in July 1979."
"As a communist activist, he was elected to uphold the need to stop Denmark acceding to Europe."
"Over 20 years on, you have heard what our dear Mr Bonde has to say about the management of the situation before us."
"In 1979, Mr Cohn-Bendit was probably still much more revolutionary than we are as European federalists, persistently liberal, persistently anti-fascist, anti-communist, anti-fundamentalist and federalist."
"Today, things have changed."
"Today, Mr Cohn-Bendit said something very interesting, but he presented it as a paradox."
"The United States is proposing that we speed up the time frames for Turkey's entry into Europe."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit says that it is as if we were to call upon the United States to speed up their federalising process and get on with annexing Canada and Mexico."
"Is the concern today not the need to move towards a world organisation of democracy and democracies, using the ultimate global free liberal weapon of mass attraction in preference to the ultimate weapons of mass destruction?"
"The ultimate free, liberal weapon of mass attraction is the recognition of the natural, historically-won right of every woman and every man to political democracy, to the rule of law and, therefore, to the liberal foundations of federal, federalist States which respect the freedom of the individual citizen."
"What has all this got to do with Copenhagen?"
"A great deal!"
"After the war, Benedetto Croce observed that, indeed, monarchic Europe - the Scandinavian monarchies, the British monarchy, the Dutch and Belgian monarchies, as it were - was the only part of Europe which resisted the different forms of nationalism, including national socialism, and the different forms of socialism, including communism, preserving a faint hope of freedom."
"This story is paradoxical."
"The paradox which we want to focus on, Presidents, is that you are not free to build Europe in Copenhagen now: you are representing bureaucratised States and a bureaucratised Parliament."
"This means that the creative spirit is not free to flow where it will."
"We must fight for freedom and for Europe."
"Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, expressing the opinion that emerged on the institutional implications of enlargement."
"These implications, starting with the initial time frames, warrant a great deal of attention in our view, and they must be addressed with all due rigour."
"We cannot afford not to carry out a meticulous analysis with the excuse that these are political issues and that we therefore ought not to go into too much detail or that these are technical issues and it is not worth wasting time on them."
"The solutions must be sustainable, respect the Treaties, meet a number of institutional criteria and be decided upon by agreement between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, whereas the Council communication of 21 November sought to present us with faits accomplis."
"The Presidency representative, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Haarder, said that it is important for Parliament to be involved, but a debate - although the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has called for a debate - is not enough: a genuine, formal agreement needs to be reached between the three institutions."
"I will, however, specify the points which we consider to be essential."
"Firstly, we believe that transitional arrangements relating to the composition of both the Commission and the European Parliament must be kept to a minimum or avoided."
"The Council has specified the date of 1 May 2004 for the formal entry into the Union of the new Member States."
"That would mean the appointment of ten new Commissioners, taking the total number of Commissioners up to 30, and would clearly create problems, in that the Commission's term of office should end on 20 January 2005 at the latest."
"What responsibilities, what special status could be conferred upon ten Commissioners for a few short months, ten Commissioners which the European Parliament would not have time to examine at the necessary hearings in May before its dissolution?"
"We would have Commissioners whose appointment had not been approved, whose role in the Commission was uncertain and who would be in danger of not having their appointments renewed a few months thence."
"I do not believe that this can be in the interests of the candidate countries of the future Member States."
"Similarly, joining the European Parliament after 1 May, the representatives of the new Member States would only be in office for a few weeks, for a single part-session, before the election of the new Parliament."
"In conclusion, if we stick to the date of 1 May 2004, the most sensible solution would appear to be to bring the European Parliament elections forward and schedule them for that same month of May."
"The President-in-Office has told us that such attempts have failed in the past."
"We do not see why they should fail again and we feel that an effort must be made to adopt that solution."
"In particular, the European Parliament elections - why should they not be held on 9 May 2004, immediately after the accession of the new Member States - would assume particular importance and this might stimulate greater, more enthusiastic participation of the electorate."
"Moreover, it would allow us to carry out the election - if the Commission President is to be appointed by election, as we too hope - or, in any case, the vote on the appointment of the President of the Commission, during the June part-session of the European Parliament and to complete the process of examining the Members of the Commission and endorsing their appointment by the end of July, with the new Commission taking office on 1 August, without the need for dubious transitional measures and with all the Commissioners having full legitimacy and equal status."
"At the same time, a decision needs to be taken to bring forward the end of the Commission's mandate."
"The result would be first and foremost - and we believe this too to be vital - to synchronise essentially the terms of office of the Commission and the European Parliament."
"To this end, we need an interinstitutional agreement which brings forward the end of the Commission's term of office and the date of the European Parliament elections, and we call strongly for such an interinstitutional agreement."
"One last comment on the subject of the IGC."
"Mr Haarder, you said that the future new Member States must also be able to exercise the right of veto at the Intergovernmental Conference, in other words they must have exactly the same rights as the Member States without actually being Member States, only acquiring this status as of 1 May 2004."
"We would like to know how this tallies with Article 48 of the Treaty."
"We believe that an acceptable solution would be for them to have the same status for the purposes of the IGC that they have for the purposes of the Convention."
"Mr President, for the record, my name is pronounced van Velzen."
"I should like to say that we are currently facing an historic moment."
"Indeed, we are at the final stage of negotiations and I think that the package that is being prepared by the Danish Presidency, consisting of a number of key components on the subjects of agriculture, nuclear safety and border control, is, of course, one that is certain to appeal to our citizens in the European Union as well."
"I have no option but to conclude from the Commission report that the Member States wishing to accede still have to sort out an awful lot of things."
"I also think that we should expressly mention this in Copenhagen, so that our citizens know what the newly-acceding Member States are up against in the coming year and a half."
"Another area of concern to which more attention should be given is media pluralism in Central and Eastern Europe."
"The past has shown us all that, let us say, the old establishment set aside resources and created opportunities in order to keep their own media intact."
"In this area too, I think we could ask the Commission to devote more attention to the actual - that is the factual rather than theoretical - diversity of the media in Central and Eastern European countries."
"I also think that we should not combine enlargement with the debate on Turkey."
"If we do engage in such a discussion at present, we would of course be flouting our own laws and rules, as Mr Poettering has already pointed out."
"Looking at the facts and the Commission's report - and I was in this respect pleased with Commissioner Verheugen's speech - we simply have to conclude that although Turkey has made a great deal of progress, it still fails to meet the Copenhagen criteria on all counts."
"This is why we are, actually, in a kind of virtual debate and are doing silly things to boot."
"We like to mention a date for the sake of naming the date."
"Good luck to anyone who can explain this to citizens in the European Union."
"I am therefore in favour of abandoning this curious debate."
"We cannot get away from Turkey's need to meet the Copenhagen criteria, and the fact that it does not do so at the moment. Consequently, we should stop wasting any more time on this."
"Imagine if Member States were to set dates at this stage which are at the moment not based on fact."
"On the subject of agriculture, there is something that is still a factor for me, namely the huge differences existing between the new acceding countries, between Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary for example."
"I wonder whether we should not concentrate on making the package more tailor-made."
"The Danish Presidency has set a good example in this."
"Surely, farming in Poland with less than one and a half acres is mainly a social problem, one that should be dealt with in Poland, and the European Union might well be able to play a major role in this."
"Farmers with up to 8, 9, 10 hectares will mainly need help in the form of world development programmes, which is quite different from extensive discussions about quotas and so on, as these mainly apply to the far bigger agricultural areas in Poland."
"I would therefore call for more attention to be given to this area, and it would surely be extremely sad if Poland and the Polish Government were to be prevented from striking an agreement simply by our inability to offer a somewhat more targeted programme and, above all, to allow the Polish Government to develop a somewhat more targeted programme for their own farmers."
"I would therefore urge some sort of creativity in this area."
"With regard to the new Member States, everyone is agreed, of course, that we need to set up a system where there is no room for net contributors."
"However, we should also consider how we can speed up the cash flow so that these Member States do not end up having major problems."
"Let me conclude by saying this: we have an enormous opportunity in Copenhagen, and we should seize it."
"Mr President, you will recall that when we had our great debate with the accession countries in Strasbourg, I finished my contribution by quoting an English saying that there is many a slip 'twixt cup and lip."
"I warned that we should not celebrate prematurely the end of this process because there was still a long way to go and of course I was right."
"It now seems that although we think we are close to agreement, we are actually a long way from agreement and there is a very real prospect that we could lose everything."
"We should be clear on that."
"If Copenhagen ends up with endless rows over highly technical issues conducted in ten parallel negotiation sessions, it does not take a brain surgeon to realise the whole process could easily seize up."
"For once, I disagree with Commissioner Verheugen."
"I think if we miss Copenhagen, we will not miss it for a week or a month or a couple of months, we will miss enlargement for a whole generation."
"As I have said before and I will say it again, it is now or never."
"This is the opportunity we have to seize."
"I welcome the brave attempt by the Danish presidency to put an extra EUR 1 billion on the table in order to clear the decks so we do not have these complicated negotiations in Copenhagen."
"Unfortunately, in doing so, particularly a couple of weeks in advance, they seem only to have encouraged some of the applicant States to believe that this is just one more stage in the negotiations and quite frankly we have to be clear that it is not."
"This is not a constantly elastic process."
"At some point we must say no."
"Berlin and Brussels cannot be breached."
"The moment we break budget discipline, we open a whole Pandora's box which is liable to bring the whole project collapsing to the ground."
"We also must be clear that this project is so important that we are not prepared to let any one country sabotage the whole negotiations."
"If any one country wants to hold out until the last possible moment, they do so at their own risk and not at the risk of all the other accession countries, because we must be prepared to agree as each country is prepared to agree."
"Equally, I must urge our leaders to ask themselves a simple question before they go to Copenhagen."
"What will they do in 20 years' time when they are sitting with their grandchildren on their knees and their grandchildren say: 'What was your real role in the great disaster when Europe failed to grasp its own destiny?"
"What did you actually do?'"
"Are they really going to turn around and say: 'Well, actually, we could not do it because we were not sure if Baltic sprats were big enough for our nets."
"We could not do it because we could not quite agree on the right amount of sheep premium or the exact sugar quota or exactly what sort of portfolio a Commissioner should have for two months'?"
"Are we really going to say that?"
"Because it is going to sound very lame."
"Let us think of the big picture and remember that the money we are giving to the accession countries represents one thousandth of the GDP of the European Union."
"The entire EU budget is only two thirds of what the British Government spends on social security alone."
"We are actually talking about what are minor issues in the global picture of things."
"Let us not lose sight of that."
"Concerning Turkey, I would say that we must say to this new government, which is like a breath of fresh air in my opinion: you must meet the Copenhagen criteria."
"We want you to meet it by such and such a date and if you do we will open negotiations."
"But let us kill off once and for all this idea that Europe is a Christian project only."
"I represent Hindus, Muslims, Jews, Sikhs, Buddhists, Taoists, all religions, and I am not prepared to say to them: 'The European Union is not for you'."
"This is the message some people in this chamber are giving out and we must kill that off."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my agreement with Mr Titley and also say that it also strikes me that the spirit of European integration is standing at a door on which there hangs a 'No Entry' sign, as it is not wanted in negotiations that are confined to milk quotas and direct grants."
"In the European Union, solidarity stops when it comes to money."
"The Danish Presidency may well have tried, by means of its negotiating package, to do justice to all positions, but, as the spirit of integration was shown the door, all that has come out is a worthless patchwork of rags that is no kind of framework for a future together."
"Why is this?"
"The Member States' mean-minded attitude leaves the candidate countries with the impression that they are second-class citizens who are not welcome."
"That puts wind in the sails of the EU's opponents in those countries, and jeopardises its acceptance."
"Savings in the Structural Funds mean savings in cohesion, in the very heart of the European Union, and thus have adverse effects on the project of integration."
"Hence the impossibility of significant impetus for rural development or an attempt at it, the most devastating indication of which is the fact that it will lose out when grants of aid are increased."
"This is an attempt at making manifest the structures of an agricultural policy that has failed in the European Union, and, in practical terms, an indirect rejection of agricultural reform, meaning that the demise of farms in the candidate countries is being pre-planned without there being any alternative jobs."
"That is sending the wrong signal."
"We, the Group of the Greens, reject all attempts at downgrading enlargement into a national savings bank, and hereby demand that the Council and the Commission should give absolute priority to the project of support for rural areas in the candidate countries and allocate more funds to it."
"Without that, the result will be social collapse, the European Union's spirit will be endangered and so will the project for EU reform!"
"Mr President, the Copenhagen European Council which is being held next week will have one major, important task: to conclude accession negotiations with ten candidate countries."
"It will be necessary to iron out a few last-minute financial difficulties, but we have great hopes and we particularly welcome the fact that France is willing to look at the latest proposals by the Danish Presidency in a favourable light."
"They certainly demand some additional expenditure, but what is at stake is worth the effort and we must not forget that the Brussels European Council of last October had taken away almost an equivalent amount of structural aid from the new members."
"Everything should therefore balance out in the end."
"The second major item on the Copenhagen agenda will be Turkey's candidacy."
"We share Mr Giscard d'Estaing's view that, as things currently stand, Turkey's accession would spell the end of the European Union."
"We have, in fact, said this several times before."
"The 1999 Helsinki European Council made a serious mistake, which has unfortunately not been made good, but has since been confirmed."
"This error on the part of the Union shows its lack of understanding of what it is and its ignorance of what it wants."
"Mr President of the European Parliament, you yourself have suggested that Mr Giscard d'Estaing, by adopting this position, would be removed from his role."
"I do not believe this, because exactly how could the Convention draft proposals on the future of the Union, on its institutions, on its policies if it has not firstly answered the following questions. What brings us together?"
"What is our model for the Union for the next fifty years?"
"Where must our borders end?"
"Mr Giscard d'Estaing is therefore doing exactly the right thing by raising these questions indirectly."
"In fact, in our opinion, Mr President, the Convention, under whose influence I do not know, has been too hasty in preparing technical proposals without first having answered fundamental political questions which influence them."
"It is in Europe's own interests to put things right as soon as possible."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in a few days' time, the European Council in Copenhagen will decide to enlarge the European Union by adding to it eight countries of the former Eastern Bloc as well as Cyprus and Malta."
"This is the subject of negotiation and - necessarily - of occasional dispute, and haggling over one point or another, but nothing can conceal the fact that Europe, divided until 1989, is now, by taking this step, giving itself a new Community order, founded on the principle of democracy, the rule of law, freedom and the market economy."
"I am convinced that, of all the political events we have experienced, it is this one that will be the most important for all the generations now living."
"If some far-sighted person fifteen years ago had written out the agenda for this European Council, as it now is, complete with the reunification of Europe, he would have been thought to be deluded!"
"If, at that time, we had been asked about our willingness to pay another EUR 2.3 billion for it, I am sure that we would have answered with a loud, clear and instantaneous 'yes'."
"Sustained effort will be demanded of us if this enlargement is to be managed - politically as well as financially, of that there is no doubt - but this is the moment when this Union of ours is joined by ancient European lands, which belong with us in exactly the same way as France and Great Britain do, and will join us in standing up for the principles of freedom and democracy under the rule of law."
"The European Union is founded on the applicability of the law, and it is the acknowledgement of the law's applicability that alone holds it together."
"That is why it is so significant that Parliament, in a resolution on the report on the negotiations with the Czech Republic, described the so-called Exemption Act as incompatible with our conception of law, and did so in a careful and balanced way."
"This question is not just about German-Czech relations in the past, but also about Europe's present and future, as fundamental principles of law and their applicability are at stake, and it would certainly be helpful if the Czech Republic were to say something to clarify matters before enlargement."
"Now, my notes include a sentence, such as we have heard uttered so often already, to the effect that discussions on Turkey must not be allowed to dominate to some extent the enlargement summit, but I see that we ourselves have been unable to resist this temptation, so that may well be the way things are in Copenhagen as well, making it clear that this is something that people get worked up about."
"A few days ago, Commissioner Verheugen was quoted in a German newspaper as saying that he was against Turkey joining and that he proposed to the Turks the establishment of a special relationship as neighbours, a treaty that could also apply to other countries contiguous to the EU."
"I am sure, Commissioner Verheugen, that you will explain this as a misunderstanding or a misinterpretation and, quite rightly, point out that this represents a breach of the confidentiality you presumably agreed on."
"But this is not about you not being allowed to keep to yourself something that you want to have dealt with in confidence, but about the way this way of doing things encourages the impression that, on this issue, many are saying in public the opposite of what they actually think."
"Where Turkey is concerned, you would not be the only one, as a whole host of those who advocate its accession do not actually want it to join and are taking cover behind the criteria."
"That is a hypocritical way of going about things, and does more harm to the EU's relations with Turkey than it would to take stock of the situation with all the honesty that respect for this country requires. So, what we want is not offers of dates for accession, but greater honesty in our relations with Turkey!"
"Mr President, I rise to share the concerns of those who have expressed fear about decisions being taken without consulting Parliament on curtailing the mandate of the current European Commission."
"Of course we recognise that new Member States have a right to a Commissioner as from day one of their membership of the European Union."
"Of course it makes sense not to reshuffle all the portfolios of the existing Commission just for a few months."
"Therefore it makes sense to curtail the mandate of the existing Commission and move rapidly to the approval of a new Commission by the new Parliament with the full democratic legitimacy that it entails."
"But how can this be done?"
"Under the current Treaty, there are only two ways."
"One is that every single Member of the current Commission agrees to resign on an agreed date, or this Parliament adopts a motion of censure forcing them to resign."
"Both scenarios would be a little bit odd unless they were subject to an agreement among the three institutions."
"Another way would be for the Council to put it in the accession treaty but again if they were to do that unilaterally, without consensus and agreement, that would undermine the spirit of the Treaties."
"So what I think should happen is that we do negotiate and reach an agreement on what would be sensible, which would be to fix an early date for the Commission to be replaced, on condition that the new Commission has the full legitimacy of going through the full procedure by the new house to be elected in the European elections."
"That is a sine qua non."
"Under those circumstances, it would make sense, as has been suggested, to bring the date of the elections forward from June to May, because then the new house in June could already vote on the President and in July we could have the hearings and vote on the Commission as a whole, which could then begin, if that were agreed, already in August or September."
"That would allow us to go forward more speedily."
"It would get rid of the problems of Commissioners without portfolios for a lengthily period and it would make sense in its own right to have the elections early in May, which is a good idea on its own merits."
"By the way, Mr President, I am sure you would be interested in this, it would avoid us having the problems in this House of having full Members for one session only just prior to the European Elections."
"I think that is the route the Council should pursue in dialogue with us."
"I should like to make one brief comment."
"Earlier this afternoon, Mr Barón Crespo raised the question of what had happened at the interinstitutional dialogue last week in Copenhagen with the President of the European Commission, the President-in-Office of the Council and myself."
"I indicated that I made it clear that I wanted no definitive decision made on questions of dates and transition without the Parliament being fully involved, engaged and consulted."
"As you will now appreciate, having heard one view from the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and an entirely different view from the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, it was not appropriate for me to seek a definitive conclusion in that dialogue other than to say that we needed to consult with the other institutions."
"Evidently we also need to talk to each other."
"Mr President, I should like to concur with Mr Brok."
"What is crucial, of course, is that we welcome the Member States and that this House - soon to be newly elected - can codecide on the new President of the Commission, but that is where his and my line of reasoning part ways."
"I am pleased that he has mentioned 1 May as an important date, but I would say that this 1 May could, in fact, be the date for European elections, in which case I would be in Mr Napolitano's camp."
"I should like to briefly update you on what has been happening in the Netherlands recently."
"There, we saw a Dutch Liberal leader, Mr Gerrit Zalm, launch a kamikaze campaign."
"He demanded that the Netherlands should thwart enlargement with a view to enforcing agricultural reforms."
"Fortunately, Mr Zalm has been sidelined for the time being, but with the forthcoming elections on 22 January 2003 in the Netherlands, he naturally remains a dangerous force to be reckoned with."
"The Dutch will hopefully elect a government that recognises the benefits of stability and economic growth, as well as the importance of a reunited Europe, thus preventing the Dutch reputation from being tarnished any further."
"This does not detract in any way from the primary importance of those agricultural reforms to the enlargement countries, candidate countries, to us ourselves, and to the developing countries."
"And what is evident is that, thanks to Mr Fischler's proposals, we already have many sound proposals on the table, but that many Member States still threaten to obstruct them."
"What we need is the courage to do our homework in the area of agricultural reforms, and this is also necessary to help the dollar round succeed."
"Indeed, we may talk about a development round, but if no firmer and broader-based proposals benefiting agricultural reforms are tabled, then things will take a turn for the worse and this round will fail."
"In that case, we will not have done our homework, which is necessary if the accession countries are to be treated fairly."
"Mention is made of net and gross accounts between Europe and the enlargement countries too easily without sufficiently acknowledging the necessity of those agricultural reforms."
"Could I add that I hope that the discussions we are having here will somehow serve as a lesson to us in the next step towards enlargement by the accession of more countries?"
"Let us have a less ambiguous and earlier debate with our electorates, and let us have the courage to ask for their opinions in good time by means of a European referendum."
"In my view, we have built in too much technocracy and not enough politics this time round."
"We have learnt that these are political decisions."
"We should summon up the courage to look our own people in the eye and accept their judgments."
"- (DA) Thank you for another useful and constructive dialogue on enlargement."
"The debate confirms that there is massive support for what is happening next week."
"I would extend my thanks for all the good advice that has been given, on which I shall make a few comments."
"I should like to thank Mr Poettering for putting the Copenhagen European Council into exactly the right perspective from the outset."
"Without repeating what he said, it is this historical perspective that we must keep in view the whole time."
"The thanks given to the Presidency are also due to the Commission, especially Mr Verheugen, who has now been working tirelessly on this for years."
"I fully agree with Mr Titley."
"I do not know about 'now or never', but in any case it is time for action."
"It must succeed."
"Despite the difficult problems that remain, we have come so far that we cannot justify failure."
"As regards Cyprus, I fully agree with Mr Verheugen."
"The EU and the international community must declare in plain terms their readiness to give the necessary assistance to meet the great challenges reunification will present to Cyprus and its two communities."
"We must do everything we can to ensure that the UN Secretary-General's endeavours to find a solution ahead of Copenhagen meet with success."
"Concerning Turkey, the basis is clear."
"Turkey is a candidate."
"The accession negotiations can commence when the Copenhagen criteria have been met."
"They have not been, but Turkey has made impressive progress with the far-reaching reform package."
"In Copenhagen, a strong and positive signal will be sent to the Turkish politicians and population."
"The precise form this signal will take is to be discussed in detail by the Heads of State and Government."
"I agree with Mr Poettering that this is not the main subject for Copenhagen."
"The ten countries will take centre stage there."
"We shall not forget the prospect of Turkey, however, neither shall we forget Bulgaria and Romania."
"These two countries have made tremendous progress in their accession negotiations, but are not ready yet."
"They will be given a roadmap for the last stretch of the way."
"I wish to thank the President of the Commission for his support for the content of the packages that the Presidency has presented to the ten countries, and I wish to thank Mr Verheugen for his word of caution against overloading the agenda for Copenhagen with all sorts of other issues."
"He knows better than anyone how difficult and complicated the enlargement process is, and he knows the danger of entering into detailed discussions on the individual packages at the Copenhagen Summit."
"My thanks to the many people who have expressed their support for keeping within the expenditure ceilings set out at Berlin and Brussels."
"I also wish to thank all of those who have said that we should not argue over small amounts at this decisive historic juncture."
"I must, however, advise against suggestions that we should discuss whether we can add another couple of billions to the amount set out in the ten packages."
"The art is not to have opinions and make suggestions."
"The art is to gain a majority, to obtain everyone's support, and there are, of course, countries who think that the packages put together by the Danish Presidency are already too generous."
"We must keep in mind that the art is to reach a consensus, or, in other words, to put the finishing touches to the packages in Copenhagen."
"Mr Barón Crespo and others are right in saying that it would be best if the new countries had Commissioners with proper portfolios from the outset, and if Parliament could hold new elections in time to approve a new Commission."
"This would mean that the MEPs from the new Member States could play a part in approving the Commissioners from their countries."
"This is not as easy as it sounds, however."
"A new election date could help; and we have tried to arrange this, but without success."
"The Presidency is willing, but we are afraid that it will not be possible."
"If this is the case, it is good that we have another solution, one that may not be perfect, but is tolerable for all parties."
"I believe that the Council has now stated - and in any case I have stated four or five times here in Parliament on behalf of the Council - that the new countries will be put on a completely equal footing with the old Member States at the Intergovernmental Conference, where a new treaty is to be adopted."
"This is not something I have made up; it is in Article 23 of the Treaty of Nice."
"It would be entirely unreasonable for us to offer the new countries, who are perhaps about to hold referendums, a different status from the old Member States, when their populations are to say 'yes' to a new treaty."
"In a way, it is bad enough that they have to accept a treaty that we are in the process of amending."
"If they are not placed on an even footing with us when the amended treaty is to be adopted, then I do not think that we are treating them properly."
"Finally, I wish to give my support to something that many have expressed."
"None of the applicant countries will have to wait for any of the others."
"If only nine applicant countries are ready, they will join."
"It is important, therefore, that the applicant countries, too, remember to strike while the iron is hot, or Mr Titley's prediction might come true."
"Lastly, I wish to say to the President that the Presidency looks forward to seeing him and the Conference of Presidents in Copenhagen directly before the summit."
"There we can continue the dialogue we have had all along on these difficult but also rewarding issues that are common to the three institutions."
"Mr President, as this debate draws to a close I am pleased to be able to note once again that there is broad agreement between Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the question of enlargement, and that is an important political signal in itself."
"I would now like to say a brief word on the most important topics of the debate."
"First, I will return to the subject of money."
"I think - no one will be surprised at this - that when we reach the final stage of a negotiating process that involves a lot of money people start to back pedal in public, and those who will have to pay start to say it is too much and those who want something say it is too little."
"That is quite normal and I would not get too excited about it."
"There is the structural question, however, which some Members of this House have quite rightly raised, that is: are our rules really designed to allow new members, who are poorer than the European Union's present average, to gain from their membership in the first few years?"
"That is precisely the problem."
"Lest anyone should be worrying for nothing, the position as I see it today is this: under the presidency's proposal, the new Member States will receive more than EUR 9 thousand million net in actual payments in 2004, 2005 and 2006."
"So when their own contributions are deducted there are EUR 9 thousand million net additional payments left."
"That means no one is a net payer and they are all in a much better position than in 2003."
"The figure for appropriations, ladies and gentlemen, is really very impressive, I have to say, and the word meanness is not appropriate."
"A net EUR 25.7 thousand million in appropriations are available for those three years."
"That is quite something when you look at the size of these countries' economies."
"We should not forget that the gross national product of the countries of Eastern and Central Europe is only five per cent of that of the present European Union."
"These figures are already reasonably balanced, I should say."
"It is also true, however, that it repeatedly has to be pointed out by both sides that the European Union is not a cash dispenser."
"You do not put a card, be it a membership card or a credit card, in at the top and get money out at the bottom."
"We are not like that at all."
"We are a community based on law and it is our aim that people should enjoy an equal standard of living, and we help to bring that about, but only in so far as we are actually able."
"Mrs Schroedter has drawn attention to a particular matter, and unfortunately I have to agree with her, namely that this proposal that rural development funding should be made available for direct payments must actually be regretted from the Union's point of view."
"The proposal that we put forward was in fact intended precisely to make possible a socially cushioned, sensible structural development of agriculture in the new Member States."
"I must however point out that it was quite a strong demand from the candidate countries themselves that they should be able to make a transfer, at least for the first three years."
"The argument is as simple as it is convincing: without this measure there is no chance of winning the referendum in Poland, for example."
"That is the background to this decision, but I readily admit that it is certainly regrettable from the point of view of a sensible development of agricultural policy."
"Now a brief word on the subject of Turkey."
"Mr Nassauer spoke to me about it in person."
"I have nothing different to say about it in private than I have said in public."
"What was quoted in the newspaper I have said many times, including here in the European Parliament. If, in 1999, we had had the opportunity to develop a Turkish strategy without the 40 years of past history we already had, it would never have occurred to me, at any rate, that the correct solution might be to offer Turkey full membership of the European Union."
"The problem is, however, that we did not have that option."
"That option had already been attempted and had already failed and there was no other."
"I am sure that all the debates of the last few weeks, including those triggered by Mr Giscard d'Estaing, have not achieved the outcome that the former French president wanted."
"They have resulted precisely in those who would have preferred not to commit themselves at present - and there were quite a number who would have preferred not to do so - now being forced to endorse the outcome of Helsinki once again, namely that Turkey clearly has candidate status, that it will be treated like any other candidate, that its prospects for membership are unqualified and clear and that it is encouraged to continue down that road."
"That is the outcome of the debate in 15 Member States, so far as the governments are concerned."
"I am well aware that other views are being taken in public, sometimes even by the majority."
"But we know that the 15 governments of the Member States are unanimous in the view that we must stick to the Helsinki strategy."
"In that respect, Mr Giscard d'Estaing's contribution probably did not have the outcome he wanted."
"In the debate about dates, I agree with Mr Brok that we must not allow the subject of Turkey to eclipse the decision-making process about ratification in the Member States, and there is probably already a real danger that it will."
"Regarding the institutional questions, the Commission is of course more than willing to enter into intensive discussions here at any time, and as always the Commission will not have the slightest problem; on the contrary, it will seek to ensure that Parliament's rights are fully safeguarded."
"I should just like to make two small points."
"Naturally, we now needed a working hypothesis for the accessions."
"Without a date we would have been unable to negotiate the financial chapter, because the date has enormous consequences for the financial situation in the first year of membership."
"The financial packages for each individual country are quite different, depending on the date taken as a basis for the work."
"That is why the decision was necessary."
"So far as I know, it was taken by the Council primarily in the light of the amount of time the Member States said they needed for ratification."
"That should also be taken into account, as I have often said."
"So far as the Commission is concerned, I would like to point out once again that it suggested avoiding the transitional Commission with 30 commissioners and therefore offered to cut its term of office short, but it proved impossible to negotiate this."
"Candidate countries and Member States took the view that the new commissioners must be there from the first day of accession."
"In that case, I think it is sensible to keep this transitional period with 30 commissioners as short as possible."
"That is why the date of 1 November emerged for the next Commission."
"That is the minimum amount of time required to appoint a new Commission President, get him approved and also to give him time to put a new Commission together."
"That is the full background."
"I think we can discuss it together sensibly and, as I said, the Commission is willing to do so at any time."
"That concludes the debate."
"WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)"
"Mr President, the EU's enlargement by ten new Member States will be a triumph for democracy if we also manage to adapt our institutions in such a way as to ensure that this enlarged Union, with its half a billion inhabitants, can also function more effectively, transparently and democratically."
"This presupposes more say for the directly elected European Parliament, but also more of a Union in which peoples and regions feel at home."
"All future Member States have made huge efforts to meet the Copenhagen criteria and to integrate the acquis into their legislation and national fabrics."
"Turkey cannot demand a date in Copenhagen."
"It is obvious that Turkey itself has a long way to go before it can meet the Copenhagen criteria."
"Surely it is up to Turkey to decide what it must, can, and is willing to do to become a true democracy, respecting human rights and cultural minorities."
"This should not only be evident from its legislation but also be based on reality."
"This does not only depend on the Turkish Government or parliament but, above all, on the attitude of the army, and as long as the army holds such a key position, Turkey cannot be considered a democracy in the true sense of the word."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I have raised this oral question on behalf of my group in order to bring once again to this House, and therefore to a public and transparent debate, a fundamental issue which is a constitutional one."
"At a time when in the Convention we are considering reforms of the Commission, the Council and all the institutions, being able to fulfil our mandate with dignity, honour and equality as European citizens is an essential issue which we have been working on for a long time."
"I would add something else: we must resolve this issue during this legislature, before it comes to an end, given the political importance it has."
"I tabled my question in the quest for greater support and consensus within the European Parliament because I believe it is necessary and I must say that my group believes that this is an issue which must be defined with the greatest possible transparency, both with regard to the constitutional aspects of the Statute and the rules which we have to lay down for ourselves."
"What I regret at this point is that it seems that, in seeking the greatest possible agreement, disagreements have been highlighted."
"I have been faced with an open and systematic accusation; this morning, in a press conference, three parliamentary group presidents have publicly accused the Socialist Group of blocking the Statute."
"As the President is well aware, it was I who proposed the amendment to the de Palacio report which was approved by 455 votes."
"It was I who proposed, and this is in the joint resolution of the Liberal Group as a recital, that a group of eminent people had to be created, and Mr Haarder is well aware of this, and I proposed its membership, beginning with Mr Ersbøl."
"This is what I have done on behalf of the Socialist Group."
"I would like those people who have criticised us - and I do not mind the election campaign being brought forward, but it should not verge on slander - to explain in this House - which is where things should be explained - what it is they have done."
"And I would say to Mr Watson, with the greatest of respect, that it would also be interesting - he has a golden opportunity - if he could explain why he feels surrounded by Germans."
"We are all equal here."
"I do not feel overly influenced by the Germans, it is not true."
"It is not true, for example, that this system of allowances has been created to compensate the Iberians."
"I come from a parliament in which they gave me the ticket, I had never earned more."
"I was faced with this system and I do not know any parliament, even those which pay most, which has renounced this system."
"Why do we have to have this hypocritical and cynical argument?"
"I believe we have to seek unity and not offend our fellow Members because we have to work together to find a way to move ahead."
"Finally, Mr President, you are well aware that I was the president of the group which most supported the idea of you being able to maintain exploratory contacts with the Council."
"Now, we are in a parliament, we have to apply the parliamentary method, not the plebiscite method, and I am glad that after I raised the question, you have written to give an account of your activities, and I am also glad that you have spoken with Mr Rothley."
"With regard to Mr Rothley, I must say one thing; with Mr Rothley as rapporteur, the Statute is very difficult, without Mr Rothley, it is impossible and we must all be aware of this and, therefore, instead of increasing divisions and offending many members of this House, what we must do is work together and bring this Statute forward."
"I am grateful for the letter you have written and I have one hope, Mr President, because I believe that you also take this approach."
"I hope that today the Council will say that it is prepared to hold talks with us on the methods for approving the Statute."
"That is all I am asking of the Council today, and I am very grateful that Mr Haarder is here because he has been fighting with us for the Statute."
"I would like to mention one thing, and that is that the Treaty of Nice is now in force, which means majority approval, except on taxation issues, which will be decided unanimously."
"Today, all we have to ask is that the President-in-Office of the Council hold out his hand - not to me but to Parliament."
"We must do the rest through an open debate and joint work amongst us and, please, let us not increase divisions."
"Let us seek unity in Parliament because this is our responsibility and we cannot transfer it to others."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are dealing with a never-ending story here."
"This House has been considering the Members' Statute since 1998."
"I think it is high time we brought it to an end."
"We are virtually at the end of a legislative period and we also have enlargement ahead of us."
"I believe the legal position of the Members of this House needs to be settled now once and for all."
"Of course, we also need an official response from the Council to the proposals made by official bodies of this House."
"The Rothley report, which was initially adopted by the European Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs as an opinion for our President and the Conference of Presidents, is the only document in this House to contain a really comprehensive proposal for a Members' Statute."
"We have been waiting for a response from the Council since April this year and that is why we believe this oral question is now necessary."
"It is high time."
"This proposal of Mr Rothley's is a very balanced one."
"We were guided by the submissions made by the wise men who were appointed to make concrete proposals to us."
"We have come to the conclusion that we ought to receive as salary one half of the basic salary of a European judge."
"I believe everything about this plan is well balanced."
"I find it all the more regrettable that three group chairmen this morning issued a press release on this important question, which really depends on a consensus in this House; I think that was completely intolerable."
"There was quite an obvious contradiction between the claims that were falsely made there this morning and what is actually contained in the resolution."
"I would, however, point out that there is only one major difference between the motions before us here, namely the reference, in paragraph 2 of our motion for a resolution, to the Committee on Legal Affairs' April decision, because we want the Council to adopt a clear position on this document."
"Everything else is virtually identical in content."
"I therefore fail completely to understand why it was claimed this morning that the large groups would oppose the statute and wanted to fill their pockets."
"That is certainly not the case and it is improper to say so in that way in this House or at a press conference."
"I would like to make that very clear at this point."
"In this House, there is no room for cheap populism."
"The large groups have a responsibility for this entire House and we are trying to fulfil it."
"This oral question and this resolution have again been put on the agenda so that we can make progress in the debate about the Statute, not to hinder it."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have been negotiating now for nearly five years, and we cannot continue any longer in a situation where the Council leads Parliament a dance like a bear with a ring through its nose in a circus arena."
"It must be clear by now what the Council wants."
"If we know what the Council wants, we shall also be able to arrive at a sensible Statute in the ensuing discussions in the Committee on Legal Affairs in the actual legislative process under Article 190 (5)."
"I hope that Mr Haarder, who after all was once a colleague of ours, has sat in this House and knows the problems and who was also formerly involved in the work on drafting the Statute, will now be in a position to give Parliament a clear, positive signal on behalf of the Danish Presidency."
"What I consider unacceptable is that we should have a repeat of what has already happened with the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies."
"Let me remind you. The contact group met and we were told that if we reached a compromise over taxation the problems would be solved and the Statute could come into force as proposed."
"What happened?"
"We went along with the compromise, one that, incidentally, I consider illegal and that the European Court of Justice will never accept."
"We went along with it, however, in the interests of a common statute, and what was the outcome?"
"The Council again raised other problems and issues and in the end we have made not the slightest progress."
"That is why this time I would like to see on our desks not only a well-meaning letter from our President, but also a definite statement from the Council."
"That is the purpose of this oral question and the resolution that accompanies it."
"The question of the transparency of costs is raised again and again."
"But it is not the subject of this resolution."
"It is perfectly clear that we want transparency, and it is also perfectly clear that our presidency will of course submit fresh proposals for the reimbursement of costs if we get the Statute."
"I take that as read and that is the subject of all the motions for a resolution that are here on the table."
"Mr President, I have listened with great attention to the speeches we have already heard."
"This is of course a matter I personally was very heavily involved in as a member of the European Parliament, and I attach the very greatest importance to the decision concerning a Members' Statute."
"I should like to say that, as has been pointed out, the Council wishes to help find a solution that guarantees the individual Member dignity and public respect."
"Regarding the way in which such a statute is to be implemented, I must of course point out that the rules governing its implementation are set down in Article 190, paragraph 5 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, in which it is stated that it falls to the European Parliament, after seeking an opinion from the Commission and with the approval of the Council, to determine its Members' status and the general conditions governing the performance of duties."
"When the Treaty of Nice has come into force, the Council will be able to take decisions by a qualified majority and no longer only by acting unanimously, as has been the case up until now."
"That does not however apply to taxation arrangements."
"Even if it is the case that Parliament adopted a draft proposal for a statute on 3 December 1998, that is to say before the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force, Parliament has since debated the new guidelines, namely in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"A permanent dialogue has been conducted between the Council's successive Presidencies and the interlocutors designated by Parliament, namely in the contact group set up to promote the negotiations between the two institutions."
"As is well known, the Council has not adopted a position on a number of the central features of the future Statute."
"In that connection, I should like to emphasise a couple of crucial elements."
"According to the positions laid down so far by the Council, there must, first of all, be concordance between the Statute and primary law, for example concerning immunities and privileges."
"Secondly, agreement in the Council on the tax issue must be respected and, finally, there must be transparency and respect for the principle of reimbursing expenses on the basis of expenditure that has in actual fact been incurred."
"In my view, the statement from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market from April of this year does not fulfil all these conditions, and I can understand why Parliament's President has been given the same message in his informal contacts with the governments of the Member States."
"I also appreciate why, on the basis of his contacts with the Member States, Parliament's President has drawn a number of conclusions regarding elements of a compromise which, once the Treaty of Nice has come into force, will be able to attract the necessary majority in the Council."
"In conclusion, I would therefore welcome all efforts aimed at a solution acceptable to both the Council and Parliament."
"I should like, on behalf of the Council, to urge Parliament not to let this opportunity pass by."
"It is Parliament that is to do the proposing and the Council that is to do the approving."
"The ball lies in Parliament's court."
"I would call upon us now to agree to a proposal that can attract broad support in Parliament and that can attract broad enough support in the Council for its to be able to be approved in accordance with the new rules in the Treaty of Nice that will be in force by February."
"Mr President, sincere thanks for your work."
"We have made progress."
"Thank you also for the letter that you sent to Members, which has clarified a lot of things."
"Incidentally, I have not forgotten how you supported me in the Conference of Presidents in 1998 over the question of whether the Committee on Legal Affairs should prepare a draft statute."
"You were chairman of the Liberal Group at the time."
"That was a long time ago."
"We intend the resolution as a spur to deeper discussion with the Council of the questions that remain open."
"We talk about strengthening democracy and not just about salaries, we talk about the dignity of Parliament, whose Members represent 380 million citizens of the European Union, and not just about reimbursement and allowances."
"Of course those questions need to be settled."
"I am convinced that the presidency, which is the only body competent to do so, will resolve the system of reimbursements in a way that is understandable and transparent for the general public."
"Those who speak only about money betray their deep contempt for this Parliament."
"We are not a gang of con men whose activities have to be stopped."
"When the European Council introduced direct elections in 1976, it failed to set out the constitutional rights of Members."
"The Council cannot, more than two decades after the first direct elections, expect us to go without a definition of Members' constitutional rights."
"The rules on immunity date back to 1965 and were designed for delegates sent to the Parliamentary Assembly by the national parliaments."
"The Council cannot expect us not to change anything in those 1965 provisions in the year 2003."
"I am quite familiar with the legal problems."
"With a measure of good will on both sides they can be solved."
"There is a time for everything."
"Omnia tempus habent."
"I have the feeling that the time for a decision is drawing near."
"In 1999 the European Council itself called on us - we have quoted it - to bring the question of the Members' Statute to a conclusion as a matter of urgency."
"We shall probably deal with the matter for good early next year."
"We are authorised to submit a report for the plenum."
"I know there are still problems with primary law, but they can be solved and I would be very grateful if the Council would concentrate on this question and send us concrete pointers for a solution."
"In any case, the Statute must be adopted before enlargement."
"It will be virtually impossible afterwards."
"Mr President, the starting point of my group's deliberations on the issue of the Member's Statute must be observing that there is a crisis of confidence between the citizens of most of our countries and the politicians."
"It is a major political challenge to resolve this crisis, perhaps the most important political challenge to be tackled in the near future."
"All our actions must take this objective into consideration."
"As it happens, the Confederal Group of the European United Left-Nordic Green Left believes it is necessary to ensure total transparency in the conditions governing the exercise of the parliamentary mandate and to dispel any idea of privileges for Members."
"In my view and in the view of the broad majority of my group, that requires two things: the first is that we need a statute in the very near future, in other words, some time before the June 2004 elections."
"Therefore, in the proposals that will be negotiated with the Council, we must not include provisions that we already know are unacceptable."
"Otherwise, we might as well be saying that we do not want a statute."
"The second requirement, in our view, is that the content of the proposals that we put forward must respect the positions of principle that I mentioned earlier - particularly transparency and the rejection of any notion of privilege."
"I do not intend to insult or offend anyone by saying this, Mr President."
"It is quite simply to explain why my group is opposed - and has already said so - to Parliament sending the document by the Committee on Legal Affairs to the Council in its current form."
"To give just two examples, Article 9 of the document claims to guarantee future Members virtual impunity."
"This is inexcusable, and the article regarding remuneration calls for a huge rise in allowances for most Members."
"At a time when the Union is advocating austerity measures to be imposed for employees and calling for public spending to be rationed, this might sound like a provocation."
"Obviously we find this unacceptable."
"Let us be honest therefore."
"Those of you who wish to come to a swift agreement with the Council on a Members' Statute must not, at tomorrow's vote, approve the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs in its current form as this report would obviously rule out the prospect of reaching an effective agreement on a statute."
"On the other hand, by voting in favour of the compromise resolution by Parliament's three 'pivotal' groups, you will leave the way clear to seek an agreement that the broad majority of us, of you, say you want."
"Tomorrow, each of us will have the opportunity to shoulder our responsibilities."
"Mr President, it has already become evident here that three groups have proposed a joint motion for a resolution, and, in my opinion, it is very important that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have now united in a common campaign, because it is time we obtained some concrete results."
"We want a statute to be achieved and all these matters that annoy our citizens so much to be resolved."
"We cannot approve of a statute that contains possible elements in the form of concealed pay."
"We want all the money paid to us in the form of salary and expenses to be as transparent as possible and justifiable in the eyes of the public."
"Neither can we agree to any privileges for ourselves that we cannot extend to our citizens."
"As my colleague, Mr Lehne, attacked the Chairmen of the three groups here, I might remark that both the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Party of European Socialists have themselves provided the reason why the three groups have had to form an alliance."
"The means the two largest groups have employed to prevent you, Mr President, from holding discussions with the Council have been totally unacceptable."
"On behalf of my own group, I want to thank you for the efforts you have made, and I believe that you have already achieved more with regard to this statute issue than your predecessor did throughout her entire term."
"In the letter you sent us you have stated that, given certain preconditions, we really do have the chance now to achieve a solution and we must accept that matters regarding Members' immunity, for example, will have to be resolved in another context."
"Tomorrow everyone can decide which side they are on."
"If we want a statute we must continue to explore the various possibilities in the way begun by the President, and in this manner we will at last remove this issue from the agenda."
"Mr President, that old favourite, the Members' Statute, has reared its ugly head once again in the Chamber, before we can really even tell what will be the outcome of the discussion with the Council."
"In our view, the reason why the negotiations are stalling is essentially because, in addition to the technical details, the European Parliament is seeking to obtain a purely European statute for its Members with remuneration paid out of the Community budget, whereas this objective runs counter to the spirit and the letter of the Treaties."
"Articles 189 and 190 clearly stipulate that the Members of this House are representatives of the people who elected them."
"That is why, a long time ago, we put forward a proposal which, we continue to believe, could represent a good compromise."
"It consists of three parts."
"First of all, MEPs should continue to receive their main salary, exactly as they do now, from the State that elected them and this will be subject to national tax regimes."
"It would be excessive - and I stress these words - in our view, for a country's representative to be paid by anyone other than his own country and for him not to have his main salary taxed in the same way as his fellow citizens."
"Secondly, relocation and other costs should be fully refunded, but within a reasonable limit obviously."
"Lastly, if necessary, we could, additionally, identify a set allowance paid by the European Parliament for each day of attendance."
"This would constitute an income - but this time, it would be a clear and transparent income - which could be subject to Community tax."
"We have thought for a long time that this proposal offers a good compromise between several objectives."
"It is rational, comprehensible and transparent and lastly, we believe that it enables us to preserve an essential principle which is to establish a statutory and financial connection between all Members and the people who elected them."
"Mr President, when I and my British Conservative colleagues fought the last European elections in 1999, one of our core policies was that the unsatisfactory character of the terms and conditions which we, as MEPs, enjoy should be revised and updated."
"During the last three years or so, we have talked a lot but realistically we have achieved much less."
"The key to achieving a satisfactory outcome to this problem must be the attainment of a political agreement between Parliament and the Council on a package of terms and conditions for Members of the European Parliament which are appropriate to the twenty-first century."
"These must then be converted into proper legal form in the manner envisaged by the Treaties."
"We must not allow ourselves to be side-tracked by debates and possible disagreement over the details of the mechanics of how this process of technical transposition is to be put into effect, because if we do that it gets in the way of achieving the necessary political agreement."
"Of course, that political agreement is the essential pre-condition of the next stage, the completion of the legal and constitutional formalities, and as said by almost every speaker, and there is agreement about this, that has got to be done by the next European elections."
"Once all the rhetoric is cut out, it is just as simple as that."
"Mr President, I rather suspect that voters outside this House would have some difficulty understanding what is going on here this afternoon and indeed some of us may."
"I wonder what the public would make of it."
"Surely, the top and bottom of all this is that the majority of this House wants a sensible, standard remuneration package, salary, pension, reimbursement of expenses where practical on the basis of receipts and vouchers - the same sort of system that most of our voters are subject to in their workplaces."
"Of course, some will say we do not do an ordinary job of work."
"We are special."
"Yes, indeed we are special, we are public servants."
"I have sat in this House now for three years through innumerable discussions on this issue and we seem to move no further forward."
"What do we have on the table today?"
"We have an exercise in subterfuge bogged down in a quagmire of procedure, I would hasten to suggest."
"On the one hand, we are talking about a report - a report that was not a report, merely an advice - voted by one committee."
"On the other hand, we are talking about some feedback from yourself, Mr President, for which we are very grateful."
"But some people here do not even want to mention that."
"Confused?"
"I certainly am."
"Members have nothing of substance or detail before of them, nothing that they have the right to amend or that they all have the possibility to properly vote on."
"So, what are we discussing here?"
"Some of us had hoped that we were at the very least talking about a process that would finally lead to a proper report setting out the detail of a proposed statute that would be clear, transparent and that every Member would have the right to amend and vote on and stand accountable to his or her voters and finally, once and for all, to draw a line under the criticism that we are so easily subject to."
"Instead, we are bogged down in this interminable roundabout of discussion on procedure."
"But, help is at hand!"
"Let us be clear, there is a very practical paragraph in the joint motion from three parties that would allow a practical process to take off."
"The very paragraph, of course, that is opposed by majorities within the big groups in this House."
"That paragraph is tabled individually as an amendment."
"So, be on notice: if you block that amendment, you block progress, you block this House from getting an open procedure that will lead to a statute and you stop this Parliament becoming worthy of the name of parliament and you will leave our citizens even more bemused and sceptical."
"I would ask you, Mr President, also to check the procedure under which this question has been brought because I really wonder if it is acceptable procedure within our rules."
"I would not wish people to become any more confused than we already are."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, since I am relatively new to this House, though not new to politics, I would like to begin by saying something about myself. I once presented a youth petition for a referendum for service and justice and against privilege."
"I have helped to get rules on incompatibility tightened up, worked on new rules for the separation of politics and business, on measures and decrees for greater objectivity in the filling of public sector posts and the setting up of a group of experts for the shaping of a salary structure covering all public functions in my homeland, from the Federal President to the mayors of larger towns."
"The question of service and justice, mandate, profession and privilege runs through my entire political career and is always a question of the credibility of politics with the citizens."
"For this very reason I have argued for this question to be put to the Council, because since I have been in this House I have always had the feeling that there is no shortage of rumours, of mutual recriminations in Parliament and Council and between the groups, but no statute."
"The cause of our problem actually lies in the fact that, although we have all been elected to this House, we are not treated equally."
"Part of our problem is that we have 15 national electoral laws and no European electoral law, that we do not have one incompatibility rule but several different ones."
"That is one problem."
"We have already discussed this topic in 1998, 1999 and in April 2001."
"The President has told us that we have now almost reached our destination and we therefore wanted to know from the Council what matters are still outstanding and how we will reach our destination."
"Today again we get no answer from the Council - because that was no answer."
"I therefore ask myself how close we are to the destination if we cannot clearly say what the outstanding points are."
"At the same time, I witnessed a press conference this morning at which accusations were raised against everyone who mentions the Rothley report, which is a report from a committee and contains an opinion for the President."
"I consider such behaviour intolerable and the claims that were made to be untrue, and I ask myself: who is damaging the dignity of this House and the respect in which it is held?"
"Is it those who make reference to a decision by a parliamentary committee or an opinion addressed to the presidency, or those who ignore that decision and want to start a parallel action?"
"No national mandate can be compared with the mandate in the European Parliament."
"The time involved is greater, the distance is greater and we have less time at home than any of our counterparts."
"We have a decision from the Committee for Legal Affairs and the Internal Market which forms the basis for the President's talks."
"We have a group of experts that has come to a conclusion so that no one can say we are arranging things to our own liking."
"We have the Rothley report and we have the legal situation where we adopt our statute and the Council approves it so it can enter into force."
"With this question we wanted greater transparency instead of rumours, greater clarity instead of recriminations."
"We wanted the Council's answer, which sadly was no answer, to bring us a step closer to the decision we need."
"Nor do we want to be messed about by political opportunists or the Council's indecision."
"I say to you, if we do not take ourselves seriously, no one else will."
"We must therefore resist opportunism and single-mindedly go the way we in this Parliament have decided on the basis of the law."
"We are of course always ready to split the report into a constitutional part and the remainder if they give us detailed reasons for doing so, but sadly this question went unanswered today as well."
"Mr President, I have to describe Mr Karas's speech as meaningless."
"The question to the Council went: Is the Council, at the level of Heads of State or Government, prepared to enter into a dialogue with the European Parliament about the circumstances for the adoption of the Statute of Members?"
"The answer is yes."
"I said that quite clearly."
"Moreover, I repeated what the Council has said all the time, namely that the ball is now in Parliament's court."
"Now Parliament has agreed on something there are prospects of the Council's adopting and approving, I assume that the ball will be passed on to the Council."
"I shall not go into details concerning the statement by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to Parliament's Conference of Presidents."
"That statement has not of course been sent to the Council, and it has not been adopted by a majority in Parliament."
"The Council will not submit a detailed proposal."
"That is an answer for Mr Lehne."
"The ball is in Parliament's court."
"I should like to remind you of the events of 1999, when the then German Presidency made a great effort to arrive at a compromise."
"That is something I believe the present rapporteur can remember, so we do not need to repeat it."
"I agree with those who have said that it is absolutely crucial for a Statute now to be adopted with clear and transparent rules that can increase the dignity accorded to the individual MEP, together with public respect for Parliament."
"There must be clarity regarding the reimbursement of expenses; there must be an appropriate salary level; and travel expenses must be calculated on the basis of documentation."
"That is what the Council has emphasised all the time."
"We must have this Statute in place in good time for the next elections to the European Parliament."
"In the light of impending enlargement, there will be a greater focus upon these elections than ever before and, if this problem is not solved, it will give rise to very damaging debates, especially in the new Member States."
"It is bad if the electorate treat this Parliament with indifference."
"There are unfortunately too many people who do just that."
"This can be seen from the fact that they do not turn up and vote."
"It will be even worse if, the first time they go to the polls, voters in the new Member States at the same time read about debates on the Members' Statute on the front pages of their newspapers."
"In that way, we are in danger of seeing a great many voters treating Parliament not merely with indifference but also with contempt, and that would be the worst thing of all that could happen."
"Finally, I would pull no punches in now calling for the President of Parliament to be supported in the initiative he has taken and for a package solution now to be arrived at that has prospects of being approved by the Council."
"The Council has of course given clear signals."
"It must be possible for these things to be done, Mr President."
"It lies in your hands and in those of your MEPs."
"That concludes the joint debate."
"I have received five motions for resolutions to wind up the debate"
"Mr President, there is something I need to get off my chest."
"On Sunday, I expressed my solidarity with the Galician people by attending the demonstration in Santiago de Compostela."
"'Nunca mais' was their slogan, and I should like to repeat it here."
"Galicia lives by the sea, and the sea was destroyed by merchant criminals who sail along the coast in old tankers full of oil."
"They are nothing more than environmental criminals who allow leaking tankers to be towed into the high seas."
"Now is the time to put our money where our mouth is and use the European Solidarity Fund to help the Galicians, and also to help the thousands of volunteers who are facing an impossible task."
"I would also urge everyone to see this apocalyptic scene for themselves, as the reality is much worse than the television footage."
"Please let this be Europe's last oil disaster."
"The Council must now take decisive action."
"'Nunca mais' - never again."
"Mr President, the Prestige disaster in Galicia has the consequences of a natural disaster, but in truth it is a political disaster."
"It is political because neither the Member States, nor the European Union itself, nor this Parliament were able to take appropriate measures at the time to prevent ships such as the Prestige - and there are hundreds of them - from moving around Community waters."
"It is political because this Parliament, despite the fact that there have been seven disasters similar to that of the Prestige over the last twenty years off the Galician coast, did not have the courage to lay down legislation similar to the United States' Oil Pollution Act, so that we could prevent this type of vessel, which are time bombs operated by criminal capitalist mafias, from moving through these waters."
"At the moment therefore, Mr President, since there is no European emergency plan to deal with these problems, hundreds and hundreds of Galician vessels are trying - together with the help of many States, whom we thank - to prevent the fuel oil from entering the Galician Rias."
"In the Arosa Ria, 500 small vessels are trying to resolve, through small-scale methods, a problem which is the responsibility of the Spanish State and the European Union."
"I will end, Mr President, by saying the following: I believe that the Presidency of this Parliament should go to Galicia and demonstrate human compassion and a desire to resolve the problem which that country, like many others, is suffering from; but especially Galicia, which is suffering this problem more than anywhere else in the world, should be shown the compassion and assistance it deserves."
"Thank you very much."
"Mr President, I would just like to express my profound sympathy with what Mr Nogueira Román has said."
"We, in Scotland, recently in the case the Braer disaster suffered a similar misfortune."
"But that is not what I wanted to speak about tonight."
"I would like to mention the currently hot issue about access to the Court of Justice, especially rights of semi-privileged access in the case of regions with legislative powers."
"The Committee on Constitutional Affairs discussed that last week and it will come before us in a fortnight's time as a hotly controversial point."
"Tonight's debate on fisheries brings up an interesting example which shows what the reality of the issue is."
"There are big risks for Scottish fisheries of the kind which Mr Nogueira in a different sense has alluded to."
"It could be that we want to raise an issue about the legality of current proposals under the primary law relating to the accession of Spain and Portugal."
"That really ought to be something which can be taken up by the legislature and executive which deal with this problem as a matter of European law, then the Scottish Parliament and Executive."
"Only if we get appropriate rights of access to the courts will that sort of question be answered in the proper place."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to express my solidarity, as a Portuguese citizen, with our neighbours in Galicia who have suffered this tragedy."
"Many Portuguese citizens have been cooperating in this humanitarian effort and we are also extremely concerned about the fate of the oil slick from the Prestige, which could also reach the northern coasts of Portugal."
"This is an enormous disaster and it is to be welcomed that Europe has, for once, learnt its lesson."
"It seems that the Erika was not enough but the Prestige must be enough for this type of thing never to happen again!"
"I therefore wish to express my agreement with the proposal by Mr Nogueira Román, suggesting that Parliament's President should visit Galicia and, if the Portuguese coasts are affected, he should visit that area too."
"Above all, he should express the solidarity of this Parliament and add force, on our behalf, to the requests to strengthen European measures in this field, which will probably be discussed at the Copenhagen Summit next week."
"It is extremely important that Parliament sends this forceful signal and I therefore fully support the words of Mr Nogueira Román."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not think we needed the Prestige disaster or the scientific reports that we recently received from ISIS about cod and the catastrophic state of this very important species of fish to see how urgent a reform of fisheries policy is."
"I think everyone who has eyes to see and ears to hear must recognise that our existing fisheries policy enables us neither to guarantee our fishermen and all those families that depend on fishing a future nor to create stable conditions that will allow our fishery resources to remain available for future generations."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to over-dramatise; the situation itself is dramatic enough."
"I believe that makes today's debate crucial for the future of the fishing industry."
"We are debating several questions and several reports at once."
"I would like to begin by thanking all the rapporteurs, and also the person who tabled the question, for the reports because they give us an overall view."
"I would like to divide my contribution into two parts."
"First of all, I would like to speak mainly about the general aspects and then I would like to speak again at the end about the various tabled amendments and the Commission's stance on those amendments."
"I would, however, like to say a word about the Prestige disaster, ladies and gentlemen."
"It is a complete misnomer that this ship should be called Prestige."
"The consequences for fishermen, for mussel and oyster farmers, are indeed colossal and dramatic."
"We in the Commission are trying, with the means that are available to us, to help at least to avoid the worst and to get help to the stricken families as quickly as possible."
"The Commission has therefore set up a task force."
"It has already been to Galicia and has spoken with the people affected on the ground and with the authorities there."
"We are currently working on plans for aid programmes and we are ready to use all the statutory means available to us to see that the existing instruments are applied as flexibly as possible so that we can help those affected."
"I contacted the Spanish authorities myself at the very start of this disaster and I am keeping in touch with those in positions of responsibility there, and since it now appears that France, too, will be more severely affected than was previously anticipated, the same principles will of course also be applied and the same assistance made available for France."
"I believe the ISIS reports were the most recent evidence of the dire straits our fishing industry is in."
"As you know, in October ISIS published the news that four of the Community's cod stocks are close to collapse."
"One reason for this alarming state of affairs is that stocks were already low - and that does not only mean young fish; there are no longer enough adults either - another is the poor spawning last season, and another is that fish mortality is still too high."
"The ISIS scientists have recommended - quite clearly and unambiguously - that in the absence of a recovery plan direct cod fishing should be discontinued for the next year in the North Sea, the Irish Sea, the waters west of Scotland, the Skagerrak and Kattegat."
"Fishing for haddock and whiting should also be suspended because too many cod are caught with them."
"Reducing cod catches in the last few years has not been enough and unfortunately we now find that quota reductions have resulted in false returns being made and illegal fishing."
"The scientists have also pointed this out."
"It is not just an assumption by the Commission as many have claimed."
"The scientists have repeatedly warned that we should not only set quotas, but that we must also reduce the fishing effort so that we are able both to make better controls and to ensure that unwanted catches are not too high and that the total allowable catches are appropriate."
"I can only quote them."
"The scientists say - they said so back in 1990 - we recommend that the fishing effort be limited because TACs alone cannot control fish mortality."
"Twelve years later, ladies and gentlemen, we have still not put that recommendation into practice."
"Subsequently we presented the ISIS findings to our Scientific and Technical Committee on Fisheries, and it again recommended that we should adopt a recovery plan for cod as soon as possible, a plan which, apart from cutting TACs and quotas more than originally planned, must also reduce the fishing effort accordingly."
"In its opinion, that is the only way to do the one and avoid a moratorium."
"As you know, the Commission proposed a year ago that the fishing effort be limited as part of a recovery plan for cod and hake."
"To this day the Council has taken no decision on it, and the situation has got worse in the meantime."
"Parliament, however, gave its opinion on this recovery plan on 13 June this year."
"In view of this situation, the Commission has been weighing the various options that are available."
"We have decided against a moratorium, going instead for an improved recovery plan, precisely because we must take both the scientific findings and the difficult situation of our fishermen seriously."
"Now, how is this different from last year's plan?"
"Firstly, in terms of catches the big reduction in the fishing effort means a total allowable catch in the North Sea for the Community and Norway of 16 800 tonnes of cod, 31 600 tonnes of haddock, 10 400 tonnes of whiting, 60 000 tonnes of plaice and 16 000 tonnes of sole."
"For the waters west of Scotland it means around 1 000 tonnes of cod and 7 200 tonnes of haddock, for the Irish Sea 1 200 tonnes of cod, 7 500 tonnes of haddock and 400 tonnes of whiting."
"Those are only some of the catches of course."
"Secondly, we propose a simplified system for the fishing effort, where we want to operate the effort not for each individual ship but for a group of ships."
"Thirdly, we have tightened up our proposal concerning controls."
"Member States will have to notify the Commission of the fishing effort on a monthly basis and ships must notify the controlling authorities when they change fishing zones."
"I am also willing to fund further research work to help us find even better ways to rescue this fishery."
"That cannot, however, mean, ladies and gentlemen, postponing the necessary measures again."
"Our aim is to take a decision on this improved recovery plan together with the fisheries reform in December."
"What does this all mean for our fishermen?"
"I am aware that it means great hardship at first, unfortunately, I have to say, great hardship for those concerned."
"I am very much aware that livelihoods are at stake here."
"That is why we must not abandon the fishermen in this difficult situation."
"We have therefore also submitted a corresponding action plan in order to cushion some of the possible negative socio-economic consequences."
"I would like to pick out just three of those measures."
"Firstly, Member States are urged to adjust their structural programmes and provide additional resources for the fishing industry and areas dependent on fishing."
"Secondly, Member States can introduce targeted measures for small-scale, employment-intensive coastal fishing."
"They can, for example, reserve certain fishing grounds for small vessels or they can gear their programmes to the coastal fleet in order to preserve jobs in the coastal regions in particular."
"Thirdly, it is essential that the economies of the coastal regions be diversified."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I turn now to the other topics on the agenda today, firstly and in particular Mr Jové's report."
"Our proposal in this connection is a new basic regulation for the common fisheries policy as the cornerstone of the reform."
"The four crucial elements of this basic regulation are as follows:"
"Firstly, we want in future to manage stocks on a multi-annual basis."
"Applying an annual principle to fish is not consistent with fish biology; instead, we must make the biological cycles of our fish stocks the essence of our policy."
"To make management consistent, for those stocks where it is sensible to do so we want to manage the fishing effort as well as TACs and quotas."
"Note that I say where it is sensible to do so."
"That means not everywhere, and it depends primarily on the state of the stocks."
"Secondly, we propose a new fleet policy."
"The ultimate objectives of the so-called MAP4 are to be the starting point for the upper limit."
"This upper limit can only change in one direction, namely a reduction in fleet size."
"Whenever a fisherman has his ship scrapped using public funds, the upper limit is reduced by the tonnage in question."
"This means we also need a system to define the ratio by which new vessels can be exchanged for old ones, provided that is done with private funds."
"Thirdly, we propose closer surveillance of fisheries."
"Member States will have to coordinate their control activities and Member States' inspectors will be able to make controls across borders."
"Satellite surveillance will gradually be extended to smaller vessels, and finally there will also be greater powers for the Commission concerning controls in the Member States."
"Only when everyone involved can count on his neighbour being subject to precisely the same controls as he is and to the same sanctions as he is if he breaks the rules, only then will there be justice and only then will people have confidence in the system."
"Fourthly, we want the fishing industry to be more closely involved in decision-making in the regional advisory councils."
"Now to the Structural Funds."
"First, there is something I would like to make clear."
"It is not the case, as is repeatedly claimed, that the Commission is under a legal misapprehension because the Member States are legally entitled to continue using money from their structural funds for fleet renewal."
"The fact is that if the Council fails to find a compromise this December and does not reach a decision on reform, we will not be able to use any more money for fleet policy after 1 January 2003."
"That is the legal consequence of the Council's decision of December last year."
"This policy involves three specific measures."
"Firstly, we propose retaining those public aids that serve to improve safety, working conditions and hygiene on board."
"Secondly, we want no more aids for modernisation or the building of new ships."
"In future we want these resources to benefit those who really need them; that means the fishermen, whom we must help financially so that they can diversify their activity and have a chance - if that is what they want - of getting out of fishing."
"In particular, this is aimed at the many fishermen who are in fact not far off retirement but are unable to retire because they still have loans outstanding with the bank, because their ships have not yet been paid for."
"Are we taking a social attitude if we continue to ignore that or pretend it is not a problem?"
"I do not think so."
"Thirdly, we propose that the aids paid up until now for the export of ships and for joint ventures should in future be used to reduce overcapacity."
"I am prepared to proceed differently for small vessels in order to help the many owners of small vessels in a different way because they are a source of much less pressure on fisheries."
"This brings me to the final proposal, namely the emergency measures for scrapping."
"We propose setting up a scrapping fund."
"That is an emergency measure."
"It is designed not as a long-term scheme but an emergency measure and is intended to help us restore a better balance between the sizes of our fleets and the available resources."
"The fund will add the resources for scrapping that are yet to be reprogrammed to the resources already provided in the structural fund for fisheries."
"These resources and the new fund will guarantee financial support for laying up fishing vessels."
"There are two main elements to this."
"Firstly, a 20% higher premium, but with a time limit, for ships whose days at sea are cut by at least 25% and, secondly, an additional EUR 32 million available for scrapping in the coming year."
"We are also willing to talk if further resources are needed to help the fishermen who want it."
"Then we shall also have to find a way to do it."
"Mr President, I hope not to take up my five minutes, but I am not very good at controlling myself in this regard."
"In any event, I would like to apologise to the members of the Committee on Fisheries because my speech is going to consist not so much of comments on the final result of the report - and I would like to stress that I have not presented any amendment to the final result of the vote in the Committee on Fisheries - but rather on the Commission's proposal."
"We are dealing with a proposal which presents various problems - several in my opinion - in terms of the lack of compatibility with the Treaties and elements of legislation."
"It is true that fish populations are experiencing difficulties and that it is necessary to adopt urgent measures."
"It is true that fishing should be sustainable and to this end it is necessary to preserve fish populations, obviously, but in the two-word term 'sustainable development', the two words are not dissociable and there must therefore be a balance: there must be fishermen and there must be regeneration of fish stocks."
"But it does not make any sense to talk about sustainable development, if we dissociate the two words."
"I have the impression in this regard that the Commission is proposing an approach which prioritises, or basically only takes into account, the issue of the rapid regeneration of stocks and ignores the other facet of sustainable development."
"Its approach therefore, in my view, implies a greater social impact on populations dependent on fishing, which may lead to far-reaching structural changes."
"Effectively, only the larger scale sections of the fleet would survive and the small-scale fleet, which generates most employment, would be heading for extinction."
"Therefore, the management and the recovery of stocks should take account of the social and economic impact of recovery plans."
"To this end it would be necessary, firstly, to improve the quality of scientific information and, furthermore, to introduce economic and social elements into the drawing up of recovery plans."
"Only in this way, by adapting the speed of recovery of fish stocks, can we modulate and minimise the impact on the populations dependent on fishing."
"And I believe that the Commission has not been careful and my interpretation is that there has been an implicit weakening in its proposal by not wanting to strengthen the Technical and Scientific Committee on Fisheries which I personally believe should be strengthened."
"And naturally the focus of the multi-annual plans should be multi-specific, taking account of the relationship between species within populations, and plans involving just one species should be the exception in very serious circumstances."
"In some respects the Commission's proposal implies a de-communitisation of the fisheries policy, or at least that is how it appears to me."
"For example, it is proposed to empower the Member States to adopt emergency measures in fields of Community competence or in fields where there is already a Community mechanism in place."
"The Commission has presented two difficult, complex and very restrictive proposals on, for example, cod fishing."
"I will take this opportunity to make the following very personal comment, which is perhaps my observation on what I have heard during this debate."
"It is clear that there is a reduction in stocks going on."
"Furthermore, and this is very serious, the destruction of jobs has been much greater than that of resources, and this has happened in all the States of the European Union despite the exceptions, the protection measures and discriminations, some relating to access."
"I, who have not been excessively belligerent on this issue, am making this comment because now it is surely going to be necessary - let us pray that we can prevent the worst repercussions - to take tough measures which are always going to have most impact on the small-scale fleet."
"This perfectly illustrates the need to change the approach of the common fisheries policy, because I believe that it is not the States but the fishermen who fish and it is necessary to adopt measures to safeguard the activity of the most sensitive sections of the fleet, of whatever nationality."
"And, although I imagine that this is an issue for the future, I believe that in terms of the allocation of catch quotas by type of fish and sections of the fleet, if we want to preserve the fishing regions and the sections of the fleet which create a lot of employment, we are surely missing a unique opportunity, perhaps allowing ourselves to be carried away by too many individual interests, which the Commission to a certain extent has encouraged."
"I will not comment on other Commission aspects."
"I would like to thank my fellow Members for the debate, the President, Mr Stevenson, for handling this whole difficult issue, and express my group's support for Mr Varela's report."
"Mr President, could I first of all add my thanks to the rapporteurs, Mr Jové Peres and Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, for excellent reports, and could I also say to both of them, because they come from Galicia, that they have our deepest sympathy from the Committee on Fisheries on the unfolding tragedy in that area from the wreck of the Prestige."
"If the Committee on Fisheries can give any help at all, we will do whatever is necessary and find whatever help we can muster to aid the people of Galicia."
"Our heart is with them at this time."
"I want to speak about the cod crisis."
"As the House knows, in order to tackle dwindling cod stocks in the North Sea, the Irish Sea, to the west of Scotland and the Skagerrak, the Commission are calling for massive cuts of up to 80% on the cod and haddock fisheries and significant reductions in other parts of the white fish sector."
"Cuts of this magnitude would wipe out the white fish sector in the United Kingdom and Ireland and destroy many thousands of jobs in those countries, as well as in France, Scandinavia and the Netherlands."
"I have seen the revised cod and hake recovery plan from the Commission."
"I have to say to the House that this is a radical change from the original cod and hake recovery plan that we considered and I believe that, under Article 37 of the Treaty, we have a right to be consulted in this House on these revised proposals."
"I hope that this House will support me in saying that we demand that right and that we intend to have our say and our full consultation will be called for on these revised proposals."
"In the interests of enhancing this debate, I want to ask the Commission why they are prepared to accept the flawed and out-of-date scientific data on which they have based their call for these draconian cuts, because the ICES scientific data was collected in the year 2001, before stringent conservation measures were put in place, the benefits of which have not yet been measured."
"For example: the fishermen in my constituency in Scotland extended mesh sizes to 120 millimetres, they suffered the 12 week closure of 40 000 square miles of cod spawning grounds in the North Sea last spring, 170 vessels were scrapped under the latest decommissioning rounds, leaving many thousands of tonnes of fish swimming in the sea that would otherwise have been caught."
"And of course, parts of the Irish Sea have been closed for cod fisheries for the last three years, enabling cod stocks to recover."
"The impact of these measures has not yet been analysed by the scientists, nor has the possibility that rising temperatures, pollution or the North Atlantic drift may have contributed to the migration of cod further northwards towards Iceland and the Faroes where many thousands of tonnes of cod are regularly being caught."
"Indeed the same scientists who are calling for a minimum closure of six years for our white fish industry cannot guarantee that the cod will ever return to the North Sea even if we implement these measures."
"As we know in the Committee on Fisheries, 10 years ago the Canadian government closed the Newfoundland Banks and there is no sign yet of the cod returning there."
"In their place, however, Canadian fishermen are finding huge stocks of snow crab and shrimps, which are netting them around four times the dollar income that the cod used to earn."
"I think a similar pattern is now emerging in the North Sea, where we are seeing large burgeoning populations of prawns, now one of our richest fisheries."
"Scientists have recently revealed that, just as the cod fish will eat prawns, prawns eat cod larvae."
"It may well be that, whatever draconian measures we take, we will fail to re-establish the cod."
"By the end of six years of intended closure, at the very minimum, such measures would be academic in any case because according to the most recent socio-economic impact study, up to 44 000 fishermen and ancillary workers would have lost their jobs."
"That is the kind of catastrophe they face this Christmas after faithfully adhering to the rules and regulations of the Common Fisheries Policy for the past twenty years."
"I support the need for a sustainable fishery and the need to get fleet capacity into balance with available fish stocks, but I also recognise that a viable fishing industry needs fishermen to catch the fish."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, first of all I would like to congratulate Mr Jové Peres on his work, on his report and on the common sense that inspired it."
"Today, Commissioner, in reality, the painful situation that my country, Galicia, is currently experiencing as a result of the Prestige tragedy takes precedence over any other consideration."
"Contemplating the state of the Galician coast following the disaster, and the Galician people, in their sorrow, anger, bravery and concern, who, despite everything, are looking to the future, seems to me to be the best proof that Galicia, the north-eastern region of the Iberian Peninsula, is heavily dependent on fishing, and not only because 20% of its gross domestic product comes from fisheries and related activities."
"I would also like to reiterate all the requests made by the rapporteur, Mr Varela."
"What I have just said relates to Mr Jové Peres' report because the Galicians, in the face of the Prestige disaster, are working courageously to mitigate the terrible social, fishing, economic and environmental consequences."
"I believe the three aspects are inextricably linked as parts of a whole."
"The proposal on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the common fisheries policy must be based on and committed to sustainable development and environmental protection."
"Both ideas are starting points, hinges, upon which the construction of CFP reform rests."
"Sustainability would clearly be guaranteed if there were no development, but depending on the starting points - which are sometimes deductive and other times not well founded, but which, in all cases, are questioned or questionable - the solutions can vary, and in this, yet again, the work of the rapporteur, Mr Jové Peres, deserves to be praised for not over-emphasising across-the-board aspects, although these were important."
"In this matter, the recovery we all want and are aiming for cannot rest on a single idea - the reduction, if not the disappearance of the fishing sector - because fishing is carried out by real people, human beings, family men, and for this reason alone we need to seek and find a balance between the consequences of limitation and means of conservation."
"One example would be the mechanism of temporary cessation of activity, restriction of fishing days, etc."
"Commissioner, a Galician newspaper this morning contained the following: 'the European Fisheries Commissioner says that cutting off aid would mitigate job losses."
"The removal of state aid for the modernisation of boats will be positive, as it will contribute to maintaining jobs on-board boats'."
"In my opinion, given that the boat is not just the centre of work, but also the professional fisherman's home, the brave workers fully deserve an improvement in their working and living conditions."
"Their dignity requires it and society, in particular the fisheries sector, has requested and expects this."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I was going to talk about the reports presented to Parliament and congratulate the rapporteurs, since they have all done an excellent job, but you chose to refer to the disaster that is destroying Galicia."
"For the first time, you have recognised that your staff can do something for my region."
"I hope that your task force has informed you that Galicia, has not only oysters, but also mussels and turbot, which make Europe the main world producer of these two species, thanks to modern, vigorous aquaculture companies, which have lost everything in the past twenty days."
"I hope they have told you that our coastline is incredibly rich in biodiversity and that this biodiversity is not Galician, Commissioner, but European."
"We are now rich in oil and the lack of action by our leaders has struck a glancing blow to what we love most, our way of living."
"The twenty thousand people who live from fishing in Galicia do not understand you very well."
"I have tried extremely hard to explain your proposals, trying to find common ground between you and my fellow countrymen."
"Since we have been told about this task force, who have not informed the Galician fishermen of any plans to visit, I would like them to present their conclusions to Parliament, here and now."
"We have listened to the Commissioner for Transport, who, in the face of the total lack of activity by the Spanish and Galician Governments, has drawn up practical proposals in order to table them at the Council, so that we might address this disaster and prevent a reoccurrence."
"We have also heard measures proposed by Commissioner Barnier, who has shown himself to be sensitive and receptive and has agreed to appear shortly before the Committee on Regional Policy in order to explain to us how the Solidarity Fund can be mobilised."
"Now it is your turn, Mr Fischler."
"Is it not time, Mr Fischler, for European fishermen in Galicia to hear more than just bad news from their Commissioner?"
"So far, Galician fishermen associate your name - and this must be said - with the non-agreement with Morocco, fleet scrapping and a whole series of measures that might turn out to be good or they might not."
"The Socialist Group has made a huge effort and has even held a hearing to discuss CFP reform, has published a leaflet and listened to the sector but, to say the very least, the measures are not explained well enough."
"All this, Commissioner, and this is my criticism of you, translates into a loss of European credibility, because your fellow Austrian citizens, as well as the Germans, will still remember the European response to the disaster you suffered due to floods, and I include myself in this European response, Commissioner."
"The European citizens of Galicia would like to receive exactly the same treatment."
"I cannot believe that, after a month of disaster, all you can say to us is that you have sent a task force."
"I believe it is now up to you, Mr Fischler, to tell your fishermen - because they are your fishermen, not mine; they are mine, but also yours, you are responsible for them - what they can expect from their Commissioner."
"I am not going to suggest visits, although I do not think it would do any harm if you were to go to Galicia."
"Tour operators are starting to think, as a way out, of offering disaster tourism, as we in Galicia are very fond of black humour."
"However, Mr Fischler, do you not believe it is now time to explain, in this House, in Parliament, here and now, what the European fishermen, the Galicians, can expect from their Commissioner at this time of disaster?"
"In Galicia we all know that we have two ears, one on either side of our heads, but what we did not know is that as well as two ears, we were going to have sixty thousand tonnes of oil on our beaches, and that today, in Parliament, we were going to be talking about what to restrict or deciding to prevent fishermen from continuing to deplete the sea's natural resources."
"All this, Commissioner, is Galician black humour, but it is also tragi-comedy."
"That is all I have to say."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to thank both rapporteurs for the great job of work they have done."
"The reforms of our fisheries policy that we are debating this evening are very important."
"In particular, Mr Varela's reports on public aid for the renewal and modernisation of the fishing fleet are very important."
"On behalf of my group, I would at the same time express understanding for Mr Varela's statement concerning oil pollution along the Galician coast."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party supports the Commission's proposals for reform, containing those elements necessary to our being able to adapt the Community's fishing fleet to the ocean's resources."
"We might well have been able to endorse maintaining public aid for the modernisation of fishing vessels if this would exclusively have improved safety and working conditions on board."
"We could also discuss aid for renewal if we were to make the aid conditional upon more capacity's being withdrawn than added."
"Under no circumstances, however, can we accept a continuation of the present situation, in which the European fishing fleet is becoming larger and larger at the taxpayer's expense."
"One of the biggest problems for the European fishing industry is, specifically, that the fleet is too big."
"There are simply too many vessels for too few fish, and there are unreasonably large discrepancies between the ways in which the Member States have so far administered fisheries policy."
"To continue with this catastrophic policy, which will only exacerbate the problems and postpone the reform process which must undoubtedly take place, would be to pull the wool over the eyes of the fishermen."
"With regard to the proposed ban on cod fishing, we in the ELDR Group would like to support the conservation arrangements."
"We also emphasised, however, that, when such drastic measures for reducing the quotas are being proposed, we really need to be sure of the facts, for the measures would have very far-reaching consequences for the fisheries sector not only at sea but also on land."
"Research must therefore be accorded high priority, and sufficient resources must be made available."
"Everyone agrees that current fisheries policy has proved to be a failure."
"That is why it is absolutely crucial for us to support the Commission's proposals for reform and thus to reject the tabled amendments aimed at perpetuating current fisheries policy."
"Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteurs on their work because the reports that we are now discussing are broadly to be welcomed, make considerable improvements to the most negative aspects of the Commission's proposals and incorporate various amendments that I tabled in the course of the preparatory work in the Committee on Fisheries, although in some cases I disagree with the solution that has been found and I feel that the report could have gone further."
"I would highlight the aspects of this revision that are most worth saving: a permanent derogation governing access to resources within the 12-nautical mile zones of Member States' territorial waters is crucial to traditional fishing and to the socio-economic fabric of regions that are dependent on fishing, defending small-scale coastal fishing, protecting fish stocks and the most sensitive part of the coastal rim."
"I would remind you that one proposal which we tabled previously has already been adopted here, calling for this derogation to be extended to 24 nautical miles."
"At least the permanent nature of 12 miles should not now be called into question!"
"The adoption of the proposal that we tabled to extend this derogation to 50 miles in the outermost regions under the terms of their special status is also extremely positive. This special status, when confirmed by the Council, will provide clear advantages for the protection of the fisheries sector in the autonomous regions of Madeira, the Azores and in all the outermost regions, thereby contributing to their development."
"We must reject the reprogramming of the Structural Funds (FIFG) for the fisheries sector, preventing the appropriations for the 'modernisation' objective being transferred to the destruction of vessels, which is, as a matter of fact, in line with the Committee on Fisheries' opinion on the 2003 budget."
"As we have pointed out, there are other alternative ways of reducing the fishing effort, which have already been referred to here, such as the system based on regulating days at sea, the adoption of biological recovery periods and technical measures geared to more selective fishing."
"It must be said, Commissioner, that in certain regions, what causes the greatest destruction of fish stocks is not fishing, but pollution."
"And, now, unfortunately, we have the case of the Prestige, showing that this is sadly true: what causes the greatest destruction are these accidents; the old and unsafe oil tankers that still sail around our coasts."
"The scrapping of vessels must be seen as a last resort, bearing in mind that any new policy to reduce fleet capacity must be based on the degree of true compliance with previously set objectives and must not further penalise those who have already fulfilled these objectives."
"Even prohibition, in some cases, for vessels less than 12 metres long, although positive, is extremely limited."
"We need to go further."
"We must nevertheless bear in mind that any reduction of fishing effort must go hand in hand with an increase in the financial resources for the FIFG and the Union's internal policies, in order to compensate for the socio-economic effects of such a reduction."
"I also regret the fact that the specific programme for small-scale coastal fishing has not been adopted."
"The participation of fishermen and their representative organisations in the decision-making process is also crucial to the common fisheries policy and to stock management, specifically through co-management, so as to guarantee genuine decentralisation."
"We also feel that it is the Member States' responsibility to guarantee the effective monitoring, inspection and implementation of the rules laid down in the common fisheries policy. We therefore disagree with the proposals intended to undermine this principle."
"Mr President, in the CFP reform process, I have consistently favoured retaining the founding principle of relative stability - installing the coastal zones as a permanent feature of the CFP at least up to 12 miles and strengthening the role of the proposed regional advisory councils so that real involvement of stakeholders can be achieved."
"I have also supported in principle proposals to move to a multi-annual, multi-species and ecosystem approach to fisheries management and my views are broadly in line with the Commission's on structural issues."
"But I believe that all of the positive potential of CFP reform could be in vain if the Commission does not show itself to be willing to really listen to those who are actually affected by fisheries policy."
"Our fisheries policy must be understood and not just perceived as something being arbitrarily handed down by a European Union which claims to know better but cannot really prove it."
"Certainly the CFP to date has not exactly been a resounding success, as we have all acknowledged."
"That means that the scientific advice has to be up-to-date, it has to be verifiable, it has to be independent and it has to be able to be proved to be so."
"The cod crisis that has been looming over the North Sea for almost two years has seen fishermen already being subject to real-time closures, to swingeing cuts in fleet size and a variety of technical measures including increased mesh sizes."
"Their efforts have borne at least some fruit in that the improvement of stocks of cod is only approximately 3% short of the target set by recovery plans."
"Now, these same fishermen are faced with drastic cuts and a total loss of any confidence in the Commission and its scientific advice, with measures being proposed which could totally devastate already fragile fishing communities."
"I think the Commission must take into account the specific nature of this cod crisis and not tie its hands with political deadlines."
"The forthcoming December Council will be the forum for finalising reform proposals and it should not be used for rushing through panic measures for cod and associated species."
"I urge the Commission to transform its words into real action."
"Why not establish urgently the first pilot regional advisory council - or management council, as I would prefer - and give it the task of helping to devise measures to save the stocks of white fish in the North Sea."
"In that way, faith could be restored in the process at the same time."
"I call on the Commission to think again too when it comes to open access to the North Sea as part of a future CFP."
"The present crisis only underlines the fragility of that sea and the key stocks in its mixed fishery."
"Your own words, Commissioner, in a written answer to me said: 'very little is known about the abundance and status of non-quota species in the North Sea but fishing for non-quota species would almost certainly incur by-catches of species subject to quotas'."
"I say let us get reform right and then use it ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, first of all I want to be associated very much with the words of sympathy expressed with the people of Galicia and I fully concur with the speakers and my colleagues who called for solidarity with them at this time."
"I broadly welcome the Jové Peres report in its present form."
"The Commission proposal is based on the principle of sustainable development and the poor state of fishery resources."
"The starting point is indisputable but many views, including my own, differ as to the quantification of the state of stocks."
"The basis of the proposal is that account is taken exclusively of scientific reports as regards management measures."
"However, no credible measures are proposed to improve scientific knowledge even though the shortcomings in this area are well recognised."
"They envisage a common fisheries policy which is geared more to the short-term interests of some Member States than to fishermen."
"I say to the Commission that the CFP must be geared towards keeping alive regions which depend on fishing rather than making it a battlefield between Member States."
"Fishermen share common interests."
"They all need fishery resources to carry out their activities."
"Decisions and objectives of the recovery plans cannot discard the social and economic consequences which they may have."
"Recovery plans must seek a balance between the recovery and conservation of stocks and measures to limit the impact on the fishing industry."
"The exclusive coastal zone is something that Irish fishermen are adamant about maintaining and so are fishermen from Scotland, Wales, England, France, Portugal and Holland, from Denmark, Germany and others - it is something that I am adamant must be retained."
"The basic objective of the 6 to 12 miles coastal zone regime was to protect fishery resources by reserving access to small scale coastal fishery activities."
"In general, this puts less pressure on stocks in these zones which often harbour nurseries in juveniles."
"It also contributed to protecting the traditional fishing activities of coastal communities, thereby helping to maintain their economic and social fabric."
"The current critical situation of many stocks makes it more urgent now than ever, not merely to roll out the 6 to 12 mile access regime which is totally inadequate, but rather to roll out the exclusive zone to 24 miles if we are serious about conserving stocks."
"I ask you to support my amendments to extend the exclusive coastal fishing zone to 24 miles."
"I have no doubt that the greater majority of your fishermen would ask you to do the same thing."
"Because I regret the present unsatisfactory state of fish stocks and because I am in favour of conservation, I am adamant that highly sensitive areas must be protected."
"The Irish box is one such area of very great sensitivity."
"Waters in this zone are important spawning grounds, which is why there has been a derogation from free access in these waters."
"Regrettably, this did not prevent the illegal plunder of stocks in the Irish box over the years by some Community fishermen flying flags of convenience."
"This plunder must stop."
"These waters must be protected."
"Existing arrangements for access to the Irish box must be retained permanently in the reform process."
"There is no bureaucratic replacement for the knowledge and experience of fishermen."
"For this reason, and for many years, my group has been calling for a greater involvement of fishermen in the ways the common fishery policy is run."
"The Commission has now adopted this idea, which I welcome, by proposing the creation of regional advisory councils which will include fishermen and their organisations for the very first time."
"If these councils are to play a meaningful role in the future, fishermen must be involved in all phases of the management process."
"Fishermen must also be more involved in the work of scientists in order to establish mutual confidence."
"Only in this way can fishermen contribute to and influence Community policy."
"I congratulate Mr Varela for both of his balanced reports."
"I agree with his analysis."
"I agree with his criticism."
"I agree with his proposed changes to the Commission's proposals."
"I will be supporting his reports."
"In conclusion, let me say unequivocally, as I did during the debate on the Stevenson report, that the common fisheries policy is not only about fish, it is also, and more importantly, about fishermen."
"It is about their families and their families' future."
"It is about their way of life, the only one possible in many areas."
"Mr President, the Souchet report, which we recently adopted by a very broad majority, has already strongly recommended maintaining state aid for the modernisation of fishing fleets."
"The conclusions of the Varela report are heading in the same direction and this we welcome."
"The European Parliament must confirm its support for maintaining this aid and must not approve the proposals by the Commission which is seeking to withdraw it on the pretext of preserving the marine environment."
"Aid for modernisation is still needed and does not in itself contribute to overfishing."
"Quite the opposite."
"By using a modern and suitably equipped fleet and using more selective and controlled fishing methods, we will encourage the sustainable management of resources and combat fraud."
"It is not this aid which contributes to overcapacity; it helps to improve working conditions, hygiene and on-board safety; it helps conservation and improves the quality of fisheries products."
"It therefore has a crucial role."
"More broadly speaking, having listened to Mr Fischler earlier, giving an outline of the general policy, we also wish to stress that good resource management is obviously necessary, but this has to be performed objectively, transparently, involving the professionals and with quota reductions or increases, depending on fluctuations in fish stocks."
"I have one last comment to make."
"If we introduce stricter legislation in the area of fisheries, will consumer demand lessen or, on the other hand, will imports from third countries increase further?"
"For whose benefit?"
"How can we avoid this pernicious effect?"
"We would like answers to all these questions."
"Mr President, someone said earlier that shrimps are netting a much higher income than cod."
"Does that mean that cod will be off the menu in future, as is apparently already the case in Newfoundland?"
"That reminds me of a joke."
"Why do we need cod when we have fish fingers?"
"But seriously, we have been preparing for this reform on 1 January 2003 for years now and just what has the European Parliament delivered in the end?"
"A lot of people are saying this is a lot of hot air about nothing, because the strong wind of change expected in European fisheries is now no more than a mild breeze."
"And I think that the House has given birth not to a reform but at best a mini-reform."
"Oh well, be that as it may ?"
"Instead of safeguarding long-term fish stocks, short-term, short-sighted maintenance of the status quo is the order of the day."
"Harsh words, but I stand by them."
"Hardly the real reform everyone supposedly wanted."
"Hardly a ray of hope for exhausted resources, more a fatal 'eyes down and charge!'"
"We have too many vessels chasing fewer and fewer fish, with some stocks in a state of total collapse."
"You cannot ignore the facts, even if you think it might lose you your seat."
"Do you really believe that people do not see through politicians?"
"I cannot continue to support public aid for new vessels with a clear conscience knowing that we simply have too many vessels."
"If building new vessels were a profitable business with good profit forecasts, surely the banks would be queuing up to hand out money?"
"They are not queuing up, there are no good profit forecasts and yet we expect European taxpayers to step in, whether they want to or not."
"That is just plain stupid."
"Sad, but true!"
"And there will not be any profit forecasts unless we rethink and make radical cutbacks."
"Mr President, this evening we are debating three proposals for regulations which form what I think is the most important part of the package of common fisheries policy reforms and we therefore need to remind ourselves why reform is so urgently needed."
"One of the most important reasons is that stocks of several species are at a critical level."
"There are too few fish for too many fishing vessels and the proposed regulations need to be judged in this context."
"Parliament needs to pluck up courage and stand firm if it is serious about protecting fish stocks."
"Unfortunately, no thread of real reform runs through Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna's reports."
"I do not think that minor cosmetic corrections are of any use at all in the long term, be it to the fishermen or to the endangered stocks, which are on the verge of collapse."
"Nor do I totally agree that we should call the voluntary scrapping measures proposed by the Commission into question."
"The emphasis here is on voluntary; to me, everything else is just talk."
"As far as I am concerned, neither report is acceptable as it stands and I cannot vote for them."
"The fact that all the proposed measures need a soft social and economic landing is one of our main demands and I think we all now agree on that."
"But today's debate is about the proposed reforms, not the loss of the Prestige and we must not confuse the two."
"We stand by the Galician fishermen but we must keep our eye on the ball."
"Mr President, we need to ensure the viability of the sector that is vital for employment and economic and social cohesion in the Union's coastal areas."
"We need to maintain sustainable marine ecosystems conserving fish stocks for future generations."
"Parliament's resolution the green paper identified the fundamental aim of the CFP as attaining a balance between the two."
"ELDR amendments to the Jové Peres report seek to ensure the long-term future of the 12 mile limit and of relative stability."
"These are essential both to the sustainability of fragile coastal communities and of the stocks on which they depend."
"We aim to specify more clearly the other measures that need to taken to protect stocks."
"We would rename regional advisory councils as regional management councils."
"This makes it clear that such councils should have a real role in helping to formulate and to implement the measures needed under the reformed CFP."
"In particular, we must use these councils to help achieve the fullest possible understanding of the functioning of marine ecosystems."
"For example, recent research suggests that an increase rather than a decrease in nephrops quotas could actually be positive for the regeneration of cod stocks."
"Finally, balancing the viability of the sector and the sustainability of stocks is not just a matter for the reform of the CFP."
"It is precisely what is required in the current cod crisis."
"It is good that the Commission has addressed the socio-economic problems but the measures so far seem like prescribing a couple of aspirins to cure a severe case of pneumonia."
"So we are formally in support of the resolution."
"Let us hope that a proper implementation of CFP reform will prevent any such crises arising in the future."
"Mr President, what has been agreed to in relation to cod fishing in the Irish Sea will discriminate drastically against the Northern Ireland fleet."
"More sacrifices have been made by that fleet than any other fleet in the European Union."
"It has been pruned and pruned and pruned yet again."
"Northern Ireland fishermen more than anyone want to maintain sustainable fisheries in the Irish Sea."
"Cod amounts to about 10% of the value of all fish annually landed in Northern Ireland."
"Northern Ireland fishermen are opposed to the present proposals."
"They are not viable as an economic option, either for fishermen whose assets are not really being fully used or for the governments who may be spending considerable amounts of money on aid without obtaining long-term change assuring a viable future for the industry."
"Fishermen have promoted the following as alternatives in Northern Ireland: further targeted decommissioning; real-time closures; additional technical conservation measures."
"Fishermen want to work with the scientists but the scientists who advise the Commission will not work with them."
"I have been at a meeting where they invited the scientists to come and look at the Irish Sea and the scientists would not even come and look at it."
"They prepared a boat for them and they would not even go out in the boat."
"I say that if the scientists cannot go and argue their case in the Irish Sea then it must not be a scientific case that they are really arguing."
"The chairman of the Committee on Fisheries has a proposal that would secure more money for investigating the effects of the measures already in place."
"That is something that is very important."
"We need to know if all the sacrifices that fishermen have made in the past have done anything to help the fishing industry, and the scientific evidence should be produced if they have it."
"This should be supported, and a proper evaluation of what has already been imposed conducted, before any new decisions are taken that will have a discriminatory effect on the Northern Ireland fishing fleet."
"Fears of discrimination are not myths in Northern Ireland, they are stubborn facts."
"We need to have a real evaluation of what success the past cuts have had and what information is available to be examined."
"Northern Ireland fishermen have made great sacrifices in the past but they are now being convinced that the knife has been turned on them."
"For example, we have had an announcement from Dublin that there are going to be bigger, larger and better boats."
"There is going to be an Atlantic dream financed partly by EU aid while the fishermen in Northern Ireland are being pushed to destroy their own boats."
"Finally, I would like to say that not only fishermen are going to suffer but also their wives and families will suffer and death is going to come to the fishing villages and to the hopes of the future for these people."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reports we are currently discussing are well structured, contain useful explanatory statements, put forward good arguments and, as Mrs Figueiredo said, are broadly to be welcomed."
"I do, however, have some observations to make. The golden rule for any fisheries policy is stock preservation and the fundamental priority must be the preservation of stocks and marine life, because, to use a culinary metaphor, just as you cannot make an omelette without eggs, you cannot go fishing if there are no fish."
"This problem first arose a very long time ago when, around 1600, a renowned jurist, Hugo Grotius, wrote a book entitled 'Mare liberum', in which he advocated the principle of the freedom to navigate the seas, which later became a principle of international law."
"Even then, some jurists added that this also implied the freedom to fish, which could also lead to the depletion of stocks."
"As you see, this is an age-old problem."
"In other words, the freedom to fish must be conditional on the marine resources available."
"Protecting marine resources is not only about guaranteeing the future of fishing but also concerns a biological value, an essential value of humanity and of life on Earth."
"Consequently, we cannot make intrinsically contradictory speeches, in which we advocate one thing and also its opposite; speeches in which, on the one hand, we call for the preservation of stocks, but immediately also claim the right to practically unlimited and unconditional fishing."
"Having said this, I should like to say something to Commissioner Fischler: as Mrs Miguélez said, what is impressive about Commissioner Fischler is his indifference to the fate of fishermen and of fishing communities, and his lack of feeling."
"In fact, we need to show solidarity and understanding towards fishermen, specifically towards those who, as has already been said, are now suffering the consequences of a terrible and criminal shipwreck."
"Mr President, I would like to devote my speech to the cod crisis."
"It is a particularly bad state of affairs and reference is often made to the situation in Newfoundland, where fishing has gone on to the point where the Grandbanks are empty, but we should also set in motion drastic measures to stop excessive fishing."
"However, we have not always done this in the past."
"By way of comparison, there was a shortage of cod in the 1960s, followed by a huge surplus in the North Sea in the Seventies."
"To this day, nobody can explain why that was."
"We do not know enough, and certainly not everything there is to know, about cod."
"During 2000 - 2001, cutbacks by 40% were imposed, which was very drastic."
"The effects of such a measure have left the sector with little resilience to take any further knock-backs."
"The sector is under pressure and we are expected to take a careful approach."
"We should not consider last year's reserves as an option; these had a negative impact on cod stocks."
"This is an example of hasty, rather than careful, decision-making, with a negative result."
"Needless to say, the situation is very worrying, but I should like to repeat that we need to produce far clearer information before we can take draconian measures of this kind."
"We cannot sell this to the people who work in the fishing industry."
"We cannot simply discontinue cod fishing."
"We can certainly not pass on the problem to the flatfish sector, since cod is caught in that sector as a secondary line."
"Neither flatfish stocks, nor cod stocks would justify this."
"We are not simply talking about fish stocks, but also about the socio-economic implications of another major intervention."
"We should, therefore, think carefully and take informed decisions."
"I am thus pleased with Mr Stevenson's resolution."
"We should think of alternatives, think in terms of cutting the link with flatfish, and consider setting up a compensation fund."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I represent a country of whose history fishing and the sea are an integral part and in which the fisheries sector still provides around fifty thousand jobs."
"Against this backdrop, some fundamental criticism must be made of the Commission proposals."
"In their current wording, these proposals are unacceptable."
"Our first criticism is that ending aid for fleet modernisation is totally unacceptable."
"Given that 40% of Portugal's fleet is more than 25 years old, this would definitively sideline the overwhelming majority of Portuguese fishermen and prevent them from undertaking any modernisation."
"Our second criticism is that the ban on aid for the creation of joint enterprises for fishing outside Community waters will only serve to increase our imports from third countries; it would, therefore be sensible to continue to allow vessels decommissioned from the Community fleet to fish in the waters of third countries under these joint enterprises."
"Lastly account must be taken of the efforts that some countries, in this case Portugal, have already made under the Multi-Annual Guidance Plans for fisheries, where the effort that has already been made to reduce the fleet should now be considered and deducted from their targets."
"To conclude, Commissioner, I should also like to say that other issues have not been given due consideration."
"For example: if a stock preservation programme exists, why are we continuing to allow fishing for the manufacture of fishmeal to take place?"
"Also, why is it that no specific measures have been envisaged for the outermost regions, whose aquatic ecosystems are highly sensitive?"
"In this regard it is crucial that a specific solution is found for these outermost regions which, in Portugal's case, are Madeira and the Azores."
"I also hope that the opinion delivered by the European Parliament will take account of those aspects that have not been considered and that the Council is able to reach a reasonable agreement."
"Mr President, I would like to concentrate on the cod crisis."
"It is a tragic day today if we are meeting here not to focus on the positive reform of the CFP but to debate the fate of fisheries in the North Sea."
"As we all know, ISIS has recommended no fishing for haddock and whiting in these areas unless ways to harvest these stocks - and I am quoting - 'without by-catch or discards of cod' can be demonstrated."
"ISIS has also implied severe restrictions in the fisheries of nephrops, plaice and sole with - and I quote - 'stringent restrictions on the catch and discard rates of cod with effective monitoring of compliance with those restrictions'."
"I am glad that the Commission has moved away from an all-out moratorium."
"However, sadly, due to the nature of mixed fisheries, 80% would still effectively mean the same: a closure of fisheries in the North Sea."
"I would like to commend the work of the UK and Scottish Fisheries Ministers; the UK Fisheries Minister Mr Elliot Moreley, the Scottish Fisheries Minister Mr Ross Finny and the Secretary of State for Scotland, Mrs Helen Liddle."
"They are fighting for the future of Scottish fisheries and the final decision ultimately rests at their doors, not ours."
"However, we have to consider what kind of future we want."
"Do we actually want to say: 'sod the cod and allow fishing to continue and just hope for the best."
"Or, do we want to work through, in a cooperative manner, with industry, ministers and other organisations to seek a common solution?"
"Whatever solution is agreed, change is inevitable."
"At present there is no specific UK/Scottish counter-proposal to what the Commission is proposing."
"However, doing nothing in the light of declining cod stocks is not an option."
"The difficult task of reaching a quota figure that is sustainable yet scientifically credible remains."
"The next two weeks will be critical to finding a solution to this crisis."
"Commissioner, once again, this evening, you have heard many Members express dissatisfaction for a number of different reasons, and these are exacerbated by the problems in the North Sea and Galicia - and we send the people of these regions our heartfelt sympathy - although I do not feel that Mr Nogueira's approach was the most appropriate way to defend the cause of Galicia;"
"I would therefore call upon the other Members to be more objective and aware of the fact that this is, in actual fact, a Europe-wide issue."
"There is something I really do fail to understand, however, Commissioner. We have the same perspectives and goals and we understand the concerns expressed by the Commission: we understand its concerns regarding the conservation of stocks; we understand its concerns about not increasing fishing effort."
"Parliament is on your side."
"We even agree on providing incentives for scrapping and, therefore, encouraging some fishermen to leave the fisheries sector."
"I genuinely fail to understand, however, why it is that we cannot succeed in coming to an agreement."
"You continue to deny that modernisation, specifically modernisation of the fleet, is essential, even though, in our countries, fishing vessels provide the most unliveable working conditions still existing in Europe."
"Then the other point is the reliability of the scientific data, which we have mentioned several times."
"Now, I do not believe that an agreement cannot be reached between Parliament and the Commission, given that our goals are the same."
"I would add just one thing, Commissioner: consider the political implications if we were to fail in this matter."
"We are on the eve of redefining the Europe we want, and we want it to be more intergovernmental and more Community-based."
"If you do not succeed in this, it will be evidence that more Community-based organisation means a European Union which is more removed from the citizens and less attentive to their concerns."
"I do not believe that we will fail, but we must fight this battle together, to ensure that everything we have built up over the past 50 years is not lost."
"Commissioner, how can we convince you to restore state aid?"
"You are as stubborn on this issue as a deep-sea fisherman."
"You have conceded a small amount of ground for vessels less than 12 metres long, which is positive."
"In my view, however, it is not because the money is public money that fish are disappearing!"
"And you are well aware that without state aid, deep-sea fishermen, or a number of them at least, will prolong the life of their boats, using them for sea-fishing for longer."
"An old boat, however, is a dangerous boat."
"An old trawler is as dangerous as an old oil tanker."
"Here are the statistics from France, which were published a few weeks ago."
"According to the 'Accident Investigation' Bureau, there have been 30 shipwrecks and 22 people have died."
"What sort of boats are involved, however?"
"All of them were more than 30 years old - that is obvious."
"Above all, however, most of them were modernised some months or not long before, in other words destabilised and made heavier, because fishermen have no other choice."
"I therefore believe and hope that, in December, you will also find an answer for vessels over 12 metres long as well, in other words, for small-scale fishing, which is dependent not only on the size of boats but on the skipper being on board too."
"You want to find a solution without increasing capacity."
"Fine. Small-scale fishing has no proper funding and so, without a boost from the state, nothing will change."
"For my part, I believe we need a solution other than 'nothing', so I hope that you will adopt a slightly more flexible approach by the end of our debate."
"Mr President, I should first of all like to express my solidarity with the Galician people and with the MEPs who hail from that region."
"In the light of recent events, it is only right and proper that the European Union, and also the Commission, should express solidarity."
"I note that the Commissioner has, in fact, taken the bull by the horns with regard to what is wrong with the fish stocks."
"It is true that, as far as cod is concerned, something is amiss."
"It is also true that cod may well be found in other locations, but the fact is that cod levels in the North Sea are at an all-time low."
"However, we should also be careful, if we want to adopt a fair and sound administration in Europe, not to throw out the baby with the bathwater."
"We should look at the situation fairly and consider the underlying causes."
"There is, of course, the warming of sea water to some extent, but we should also examine the probable causes of overfishing in the first place."
"Why was quota control not in place?"
"Let us mainly focus on these issues."
"I should now like to turn to the next topic."
"It is unacceptable for the good to be punished along with the bad."
"If the Commission indicates that it also believes that quota for flatfish should be cut, for example by between 30% and 40%, then I have to say that I do not go along with this."
"Sound quota management in that very sector has meant that, relatively speaking, this sector is doing well, certainly taking into consideration the drastic cutbacks in additional catches."
"This is why the flatfish fishing quota can be cut disproportionately in relation to those for cod, as has been illustrated in Denmark, Germany and certainly in my own country, the Netherlands."
"I should also add that over the space of ten years, cod catches from the Netherlands have decreased by 70%."
"It is unacceptable for fishermen to have to suffer extra for sole and plaice."
"If the European Union wants to remain credible, it is essential that this policy on flatfish should not be carried through in other sectors, and I assume that the Commission will act fairly in this too."
"Mr President, I think that reform of the common fisheries policy is one of the most pressing problems we have in the EU and, even if Commissioner Fischler looks a little tired, the proposal for a new fisheries reform deserves high praise."
"There is a real need to set out a fisheries policy that creates a balance between resources and their use, that is based upon the principle of sustainability and that takes much more extensive account of environmental and ecological considerations than the previous policy did."
"We need the multiannual management plans proposed by the Commissioner, based upon scientific advice and to be applied to all the stocks."
"We must get away from the annual quota lotteries and the emergency crisis resolution that takes place every single year."
"The collapse of cod stocks in the North Sea, Irish Sea and Skagerrak is, in reality, a judgment upon fisheries policy so far."
"If the Member States had followed the scientific advice and warnings, including the Commission's proposal from June of last year for a rescue plan, this collapse would presumably not have happened."
"It is the lack of political responsibility and monitoring on the part of the governments that is now giving rise to a range of serious social, environmental and economic consequences in the region concerned."
"We need to cut back on the combined fishing fleet, something which necessarily means using the subsidies for eliminating the fishing fleet's overcapacity and, if need be, for supporting those fishermen affected by the measures required. We must not, however, use the subsidies for renewing and converting the fishing fleet."
"Moreover, we need to establish much more efficient common supervision of fisheries."
"On that point, the Commissioner should know that aid will be required."
"I cannot endorse Mr Varela's reports."
"I think that they are both on the wrong track."
"I hope that a sustainable fisheries reform may be implemented before the New Year, and it might be useful if the Commissioner could confirm that the work is continuing in accordance with this timetable and if he could provide his assessments of the options."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as part of the reform of the common fisheries policy, the Commission has decided to move ahead with an amendment to the regulation on the structural policy of fisheries, laying down emergency measures for the destruction of vessels and even providing for an increase in premiums for scrapping, despite the fact that Europe is currently in a period of budgetary restrictions."
"In our joint debate on this proposal, I should first of all like to take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna and underline the remarkable quality of the work he has submitted for our consideration."
"Like the rapporteur, I acknowledge that the Commission proposal is largely unacceptable."
"Without calling into question the entire concept of vessel scrapping, I must stress the irreversible nature of this measure and draw attention to its enormous socio-economic costs in the Member State that I represent and especially in my home region, the Algarve."
"This is the reality of the situation in Portugal: fifty thousand jobs in the fisheries sector, 90% of vessels are old and small and are engaged in traditional forms of fishing."
"I would point out that there are other measures that are not irreversible and which will cause less upset in achieving a balance between fleet capacity and available fish resources."
"Portugal has been extremely committed to fulfilling and even exceeding its targets for the multi-annual guidance plans, unlike other Member States, which have made no effort or have even increased their fleet capacity, with total impunity."
"Portugal is becoming increasingly concerned to see the Commission ignoring this situation, rejecting inspections and continuing blindly to ask all Member States to make the same sacrifices."
"Returning to the Commission proposal, the sudden redirection of funds from the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG), raises serious doubts at the legal, financial and budgetary levels."
"It is therefore becoming unjustifiable at all levels to reprogramme funds already earmarked for the period until 2006 and which have been planned with the national and regional bodies and the economic and social operators."
"As the rapporteur quite rightly said, this Commission proposal appears, more than anything, to be a leap in the dark."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you for the very extensive debate we have had here."
"May I say to everyone who referred to the shipwreck of the Prestige that perhaps it was not perfectly clear from my first speech that we, by which I mean the services responsible for shipping in the transport DG under Mrs Loyola de Palacio, the environmental experts under Mrs Margot Wallström, the Structural Fund experts and my experts, have joined in setting up a task force."
"All these experts have been in Galicia for some time now and have been looking at ideas in situ, together with the agencies responsible, as to how we can best help here."
"As far as direct responsibility for fisheries is concerned, as you know, the current rules only allow 4% of total structural resources for fisheries to be used for compensation following a disaster."
"I have said that this is too little."
"We need to do more here and I am in the process of doing something about this."
"I shall be bending the rules as far as I possibly can without actually breaking them."
"We are also prepared to look, with the Spanish Government, at how we can put structural resources for fisheries to the best possible use here."
"We want the compensation ruling to be flexible enough to include joint activities undertaken by groups or organisations in the fisheries sector."
"We really cannot completely ignore the polluter pays principle here but, as you know, there is a sort of solidarity over and above that, in the form of a fund of EUR 300 million, which the Commission has been demanding to see increased to EUR 1 billion for some time now - for several months in fact."
"It is not up to the Commission to take the decisions here; this is a decision for the Council."
"Now to the cod plan and the oral question."
"I really must categorically reject what Mr Stevenson said about everything being based on out-of-date data and hence not being very relevant."
"These are the latest data available and the evaluations were not carried out by just any scientists; they were carried out by scientists from all the Member States who worked as a group, were paid by the Member States and had to reach a common verdict."
"To say this was an academic exercise which, if you want, you can ignore, is totally uncalled for."
"For the most part, catch data for 2001 were used."
"If 2001 brought about such dramatic results, then it is obvious from stock patterns that 2002 will bring about even more dramatic results."
"If you believe these fish have all moved to Iceland, you are deluding yourself!"
"Why is the situation in Iceland better?"
"Because the Icelanders introduced a multiannual cod management plan years ago."
"It is we who need to catch up, not the other way round."
"And we need to stick to the facts if we want to make any headway here."
"Now to the reports. I should like to comment mainly on the proposed amendments."
"First to Mr Jové Peres's report and stock management."
"I am more than happy to accept Amendments Nos 4, 14, 27 and 30, because the Commission too feels that fisheries management should include social and economic aspects."
"However, I must reject Amendment No 2, because economic considerations cannot be used as an excuse for watering down the measures needed."
"I must also reject Amendments Nos 24, 31 and 99, because our wording for the precautionary principle is in keeping with international maritime law and cannot therefore be watered down."
"Amendments Nos 19 and 50 do not pose any substantive problems; however, the precautionary principle already takes account of environmental considerations per se and I therefore feel that these amendments are superfluous."
"However, I welcome your support for multiannual management plans, Mr Jové Peres, and gladly accept Amendments Nos 1, 3, 6, 29 and 32."
"I cannot accept Amendments Nos 35 and 36 because it is up to the Council to set the framework for management plans."
"However, I gladly accept Amendment No 22 on international guidelines for sustainable fisheries management."
"I must reject Amendments Nos 67 and 68, although I agree that we urgently need better scientific data on third country stocks and we shall be sending Parliament a separate communication on this in the spring of 2003."
"Now to access to waters and stocks."
"I gladly accept Amendments Nos 8 and 46, but I must reject Amendments Nos 70 to 74 and 94, because I think we need to keep the twelve-mile zone."
"I must also reject Amendment No 45, because we shall be examining access restrictions such as the Shetland Box in 2003."
"I must reject Amendments Nos 9, 47, 95 and 97 on a 50-nautical-mile economic zone for the outermost regions as they stand, because this is a matter of national law."
"I reject the proposed amendments on relative stability because I think that relative stability is part and parcel of our common fisheries policy."
"I can accept Amendments Nos 28 and 76 but I must reject Amendment No 11, because both the Commission and the Council legal services are of the unanimous opinion that the system for western waters needs to be changed and that these Member States should be treated on a equal footing with other Member States when it comes to the fishing effort planned for this zone."
"And so to fleet policy. I am delighted that the rapporteur agrees in general with our proposals and I welcome these amendments."
"I accept Amendment No 44, although we must comply with Community provisions governing data protection."
"I also accept Amendment No 78."
"However, I must reject Amendments Nos 7, 26, 34 and 39 to 43, because they add nothing new of substance and create a whole host of practical problems."
"Now for your proposed amendments to the chapter on controls."
"I am delighted that many here are in favour of stepping up controls and the implementation of a common fisheries policy and gladly accept Amendments Nos 51, 57 and 61."
"However, I should like to accept Amendments Nos 51 and 57 in a slightly different form."
"I cannot accept Amendments Nos 52 to 56 or 62."
"Nor can I accept Amendment No 12, because we need effective tools if those who break the rules are to be held liable for the damage they cause."
"And that includes quota reductions."
"Now to decision-making procedures and consultations."
"I must reject Amendments Nos 21, 37, 65, 66, 80, 84 and 86 to 89 for the sake of institutional equilibrium, although I gladly accept your Amendment No 64 and part of Amendment No 85 to do with regional consultative committees and the demand that they should also be set up in third countries."
"Finally, I am unfortunately unable to accept your Amendment No 69, because the basic principles will be included in our new framework regulation in the future."
"Now to the proposed amendments in Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna's two reports. First, I have made the Commission's standpoint on this quite clear."
"I must say, to my great disappointment, that many of the proposed amendments are designed merely to maintain the status quo."
"I find that unacceptable and must therefore reject the proposed amendments which refer to it."
"I am convinced that it makes no sense to hand out money for scrapping with one hand and to finance new ships with the other, because all that does is to put more pressure on endangered stocks and subsidise this absurd state of affairs out of taxpayers' money."
"Nor do I agree with you on exports or joint ventures."
"These mechanisms do nothing to reduce excess capacity in our waters because most of the vessels which receive public aid for joint ventures or export were already fishing in third countries."
"However, I can accept Amendment No 3 on the possibility of adapting programme planning during the current Structural Fund period."
"I can only accept the part of Amendments Nos 19 and 37 designed to promote the diversification of vessels out of fisheries."
"Finally, I think that Amendment No 27 is superfluous."
"Now to the final proposal on scrapping. Unfortunately, I must reject Amendments Nos 2 and 9, because if we ask the taxpayer to fund the scrapping of vessels out of additional public money, then it is only logical that we re-programme public aid for fleet renewal at the same time."
"As far as Amendments Nos 3 to 6 and 8 are concerned, here too I must beg to differ."
"Scientists have been telling us for years that our fleet is far too big and that stocks are depleting under the tremendous pressure from fisheries."
"Our scientists have repeatedly concluded that TACs and quotas and technical measures alone are not enough."
"As far as additional funds for scrapping are concerned, we have drawn up calculations based on empirical values."
"Of course they are only estimates, but the majority of Member States see them as an upper limit, which is why I cannot agree with Amendments Nos 3 to 6 and 8."
"Nor can I accept Amendment No 7, because the Commission has indeed honoured its obligations by instituting infringement proceedings against Member States who fail to achieve their fleet targets."
"As for Amendment No 10, the point here is that Member States must meet all the conditions of MAP 4, that is, overall fleet targets and individual targets, if they want to claim additional scrapping premiums."
"Anything else would put Member States who have achieved their overall fleet target at a disadvantage."
"Mr President, the Commissioner said that he could not address the principle of relative stability because it is part of the CFP."
"CFP reform, which we should embark on today and in the next few days, is based precisely on the principle of relative stability, which is not unchangeable."
"On the other hand, the Commissioner said that another amendment was to maintain the status quo."
"The status quo in Community waters is maintained by the Commission and Mr Fischler, Mr President."
"I have received the motion for a resolution corresponding to this oral question on the cod crisis."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0389/2002) by Mr Pérez Álvarez, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for by the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Government of the Republic of Senegal on fishing off the coast of Senegal for the period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2006 [COM(2002) 497 - C5-0493/2002 - 2002/0238(CNS)]"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first may I thank you, Mr Pérez Álvarez, for your report on our proposal on the conclusion of a new fisheries protocol with Senegal."
"I am delighted that you support this proposal."
"It will enable our fishermen to continue fishing in Senegal until 30 June 2006."
"I think this protocol is of huge interest to both parties."
"Senegal will receive a financial contribution of EUR 16 million and we shall be helping Senegal to build up sustainable fisheries."
"In addition, more Senegalese fishermen and observers will be deployed on board our vessels, although fishing opportunities for our vessels have been cut back, in line with data from Senegalese scientists."
"The fishing zones for Community ships have been reduced and coastal zones have been reserved for the local artisanal fleet."
"Finally, we have increased compulsory landings for the Senegalese fishing industry in the new protocol."
"The agreement offers our fleet stability, because the new protocol will run for four years, and flexibility, thanks to the new system for calculating fishing opportunities."
"In turn, this will foster higher utilisation rates and hence a better cost-benefit ratio."
"The Senegalese authorities have confirmed that our fisheries will not endanger stocks because, even during the period from 1997 to 2001, Community catches only accounted for between 1.7% to 3.3% of total catches in Senegal."
"By comparison, our vessels accounted for 25% of landings for the local industry in 1997."
"Now to the proposed amendments."
"I agree with the content of Amendments Nos 1, 3 and 4 but in form they are, I think, superfluous."
"The Commission already passes on the information called for."
"We are required to do so under the interinstitutional agreements, especially the framework agreement between the Commission and Parliament."
"I cannot accept Amendment No 5, because this is a protocol to a fisheries agreement."
"As an addendum to a framework agreement, no new mandate is required in order to renew a protocol."
"I must also reject Amendment No 2 for this fisheries protocol."
"However, I promise to propose this sort of clause during negotiations on future fisheries agreements with third countries."
"Madam President, I would like to refer briefly to the earlier debate simply to ask the Commissioner to promote all these possible measures to help Galicia as much as you can, and try to speed them up, because those suffering from the damage in Galicia have identity cards and human faces; they are the fishermen, their neighbours, small businessmen, etc."
"It is true that whoever causes damage should pay for it, and here those responsible are hiding behind a legal web, under the umbrella of an anonymous public limited company, and here I mean 'anonymous' in the literal sense of the word."
"Perhaps, Commissioner, it would be a good idea to promote measures for transparency, clarity and flexibility as well within the scope of maritime trading legislation."
"I shall now move on to the EU/Senegal Fisheries Agreement, to say that we should set out fisheries possibilities in Senegalese waters and the financial contribution."
"I believe that the conclusion of a new protocol on fisheries relations between Senegal and the European Union - which is of particular importance following the failed agreement with Morocco - should be welcomed."
"As you said, the impact of the protocol on fish populations in Senegalese waters is minimal, given that the fisheries activities of the European Union only represent between 1.7% and 3% of total catches in the area."
"Furthermore, fishing possibilities for EU vessels have been decreased on sensitive stocks and technical measures including a two-month biological rest period have been agreed to give more protection to fish stocks and to minimise the risk of competition with the artisanal fleet."
"I do not want to say too much because a great deal of data already appears in the report."
"Allow me, however, to say that with regard to demersal species, the opportunities for pelagic fishing have vanished and the opportunities for tuna fishing have remained at the same level."
"Allow me to say also that financial compensation from the EU will increase from EUR 12 million to EUR 16 million annually and of these EUR 16 million, EUR 3 million will be allocated to specific measures: developing local industry and the informal commitment - what a pity this is not included in the agreement - by the Senegalese authorities to pass on 50% of total compensation to the sector, which is important because the Senegalese economy is heavily dependent on fishing and one in six Senegalese nationals of working age works in this sector."
"I would also highlight that the biological rest period is obligatory unlike the simple provisions of the previous agreement, and states that the aim of prohibiting deep-sea fishing is to foster the conservation of vulnerable species and promote the small fishing sector and defend the sustainability of fishing in Senegal."
"All of which, like the setting of lower by-catch rates and larger mesh sizes, demonstrates the importance of this."
"It is equally important to ensure an increased number of Senegalese seamen on board EU vessels."
"I would like, Commissioner, to emphasise a reference to Amendment No 3, which has a clear social content - I am a member of the Committee on Social Affairs - and, overall, sets out similar working conditions, rights and freedoms for all seamen on board EU vessels, whether or not they are EU seamen."
"The European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights therefore does not draw any distinctions and its first article states that human dignity is inviolable."
"In conclusion, this seems to be a good agreement: an achievable agreement is always the best one."
"The agreement is clearly a meeting of wills, and often - almost always - both parties must make concessions in order to reach the agreement."
"The Members of this Parliament are not in the habit of offering congratulations, but I believe this is a good agreement and we should congratulate the Commission."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen."
"First of all, my thanks to you, Mr Lage, for your report."
"I am delighted that you support this proposal granting Community vessels access to Angolan waters until 2 August 2004."
"The new protocol is in the mutual interest of the Community and Angola and contains a few new clauses, which I should like to comment on."
"Stocks in Angolan waters will be checked annually by local scientists in the interest of sustainable fisheries."
"As a basis for this scientific knowledge, or should I say as a result of this scientific knowledge, fishing opportunities will be revised in line with it."
"36% of the financial contribution will be used to set up a partnership between the EU and Angola, in order to develop research, artisanal fisheries, training and aquaculture."
"This is a net improvement over the 28% earmarked for targeted action in the last protocol."
"Not just tuna vessels but all fishing vessels will have to carry six Angolan fishermen, compared with five previously."
"This will create an additional 160 to 180 jobs locally."
"I should like to comment briefly on the proposed amendments."
"Basically, the same applies as I said earlier about the protocol with Senegal."
"On the question of including the Member States' obligation under Regulation 500/2001, with ships declaring their catches in third countries, this is not possible."
"But I am more than willing to include this obligation in any new agreement, because this is something that needs to be negotiated."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commissioner has already addressed the basic issue: the report adopts the results of the negotiations between the Commission and Angola, and even welcomes the way in which the negotiations were concluded and the protocol offers interesting fishing opportunities for the Member State fleets and is today the second largest, I believe, after the agreement signed with Mauritania."
"The new protocol is the ninth since the Fisheries Agreement between the European Community and Angola entered into force in 1997; this new protocol applies to the period between August 2002 and August 2004, provides access for 33 tuna vessels and 22 shrimp-fishing vessels."
"The tuna fishing quotas are shared out between France, Spain and Portugal - it should be noted that the previous protocol provided access for 43 European Tuna vessels, slightly more than the current number."
"With regard to demersal fishing, Spain has received the lion's share, with Portugal, Italy and Greece sharing the rest."
"The annual financial compensation has risen from EUR 14 million to EUR 15.5 million, which is to be applauded. This is a contribution by the European Union to the development of fishing in Angola."
"EUR 5.5 billion are going to specific measures for research, control and monitoring, as the Commissioner has already rightly pointed out."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would not want to end my brief intervention without mentioning the fact that Angola is a terrible and shocking paradox: Angola is a vast territory, with a population of around 13 million inhabitants, has truly amazing underground resources such as oil and diamonds - suffice it to say that its oil, the production of which will increase in the next two years, represents around 15% of US consumption - but most of this money does not go to those in Angola who are suffering an appalling tragedy of hunger and misery."
"One report by the International Monetary Fund even states that EUR four billion have been poured into the State's coffers but have moved along impenetrable and tortuous routes."
"Does this mean that the European Union should not support Angola?"
"No it does not!"
"What it means is that Angola has entered a new phase in its history, which has been plagued by civil wars, death and destruction."
"Angola's fishing industry is extremely interesting."
"I remember, although it is always risky to depend on one's memory, that in 1973, when Portugal was still the colonial administrator, around 490 000 tonnes of fish were brought into Angolan ports. This is something I read in a book on the history and economy of Angola."
"In 1999, around 190 000 tonnes were brought in. This means, then, that Angolan fishing has suffered a major fall and is now recovering, partly because it is no longer a State-run industry and is essentially in private hands."
"It also means, however, if the scientific data are not misleading, that Angola has considerable opportunities for fishing and that Angolan waters contain a wealth of fish."
"The texts also state that fishing in Angola represents 3% of the gross national product and so any effort to support the Angolan fishing industry is to be welcomed."
"I therefore wish to congratulate the Commissioner and the Commission on the result they have achieved."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to start by congratulating our rapporteur, Carlos Lage, on this report which is extremely well structured and clear in terms of its proposals."
"As Mr Lage himself stated, this is a further renewal of the Fisheries Agreement with Angola that began in 1987 and is now being renewed once again."
"As has also been said, European Union vessels fish in those waters for tuna, shrimp, demersal species and, on an experimental basis, some pelagic species."
"This new protocol clearly shows that there has been a slight increase in demersal fishing and a noticeable decline in tuna fishing, which is all the more worrying because we know that for some years, this area, with all the tuna migration, has been experiencing a major decrease in numbers, which is largely due to what we call IUU, or illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing."
"We are seeing a great deal of illegal tuna fishing, especially in tropical waters, such as the Gulf of Guinea, in which the tuna are killed before they even have time to reproduce."
"Perhaps this situation of illegal tuna fishing in all tropical waters will not be too different to this reduction in the tuna fishing quota in the Agreement with Angola."
"It should also be emphasised that when calculating the EU's financial compensation, which is also increasing, we must also take account of the rates paid by shipowners."
"As the report also clearly states, EU compensation has risen from EUR 14 million to EUR 15.5 million and in fact it is important to note that 35% of these appropriations are specifically earmarked for the development of the fishing sector."
"It should also be stated that this agreement with Angola represents gradual progress in the field of fisheries agreements with third countries."
"This considerable allocation of appropriations to the fishing sector is important and shows that it is possible to conclude commercial fishing agreements that contain a development component."
"I believe that we must not show any prejudice - in other words, fishing agreements must be made an integral part of the common fisheries policy: they can be of benefit to third countries, aiding their development and to the European Union, by improving the supply of its markets."
"Lastly, I feel it would also be reasonable, linking this with the reform of the CFP, for vessels scrapped in the European Union to be able to join the joint enterprises that fish in these waters."
"I should also like to mention, on behalf of my group, the PPE-DE, that we will be supporting this report, which we believe to be well-grounded."
"Madam President, the complete, total and disgraceful failure of the common fisheries policy and the consequent collapse of fish stocks means that the EU must now cast its net wider and wider to satisfy voracious Spanish demands."
"Not content with destroying the North Sea, Africa is now the prize."
"There are now 16 third country agreements in place."
"Today we are discussing Angola and, according to the World Wildlife Fund, this deal will strip a vulnerable African coastal community of a precious asset."
"When each deal is debated, my colleague, Mr Nigel Farage, has urged you to open your eyes to the environmental destruction and, more seriously, to the deaths of many hundreds of black African fishermen which European Union boats are causing every year."
"Exhaustive documentary evidence from Mauritania and Senegal confirms the scale of this tragedy."
"The contempt with which our pleadings have met leads me to think that most of the rest of you must inhabit a different planet."
"There is a better way."
"Ten years ago, Namibia threw out the Spanish boats and took control over her 200-mile territorial waters."
"14 000 people now work in an industry worth USD 350 million a year."
"Namibia should be our model if we really want to help the third world."
"Let us stop exploiting these poor countries and encourage them to modernise their industries."
"Let us recognise that the only fishery management schemes that work around the world are the ones with national control."
"We have the whole of 'blue Europe' stretching out before us waiting to be reorganised."
"The reality of the situation is that fisheries resources are being depleted, whilst the discussion focuses on the reliability of instruments used to measure the extent of the rarity of fish shoals."
"Our instruments for managing catches, the market, fleets and relations with third countries are criticised by professionals."
"The Commission wants to act as a substitute for the Council of Ministers in decision-making processes."
"It persists in its Malthusianism tactics by scrapping boats and even by refusing to fund modernisation."
"This is how, in addition to jeopardising the safety of fishermen, the problem of unfair competition arises."
"Whilst we undermine our own industry's fishing possibilities, other fishermen from third countries are coming in their place."
"The margin for manoeuvre is, nevertheless, very small."
"Even aquaculture is not a genuine solution as, in order to 'manufacture' one kilo of farmed fish, you need to use between 4 and 7 kg of fish meal."
"This is the absolute limit of industrial fishing."
"The potential solutions are acknowledged: regionalisation of management for greater flexibility, more accurate scientific evaluation of resources to avoid disputes, greater involvement of the profession ?"
"(Written statement abbreviated in accordance with Rule 120(7) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what I have to say about today's report is this. One: the goal of the Lisbon strategy is to transform the European Union into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, an economy capable of bringing about permanent economic growth, more and better jobs and greater social cohesion."
"Two: in order to do this, we need an economic, employment, education, research policy and social policy strategy developed jointly by the Member States, the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament."
"Three: Europe is moving from a market economy towards a social market economy and is in the process of taking the next step and making the eco-social market economy the order of the day for the twenty-first century."
"As someone so nicely put it, the twenty-first century will be the century of Europe but only, I would add, if we want it to be."
"Four: assuming we really mean it, the Lisbon strategy and an eco-social market economy will allow us, at long last, to get past the received wisdom of capital versus labour, social policy versus economic policy, public versus private sector, Europe versus the Member States."
"Five: it would all be quite simple if we could agree on a few basic principles: that the economy creates labour, that everything labour creates is social and that social cohesion and environmental protection are mutually supportive for the purpose of sustainability."
"This all depends primarily on human rather than state resources, not on equality for all, but on competitive ideas that strengthen the continent of Europe as a whole."
"Six: we should therefore emphasise that economic policy has not been communitised and lies primarily within the sphere of competence of the Member States and that, under Article 99, economic policy must be regarded, and coordinated by the Member States, as a matter of common interest."
"Seven: we therefore welcome, by way of conclusion, the overall approach of the Commission communication on streamlining the annual economic and employment policy coordination cycles."
"We need this coordination in order to achieve common objectives despite differing jurisdictions."
"But this coordination depends on the Member States' doing their bit, on their passing fast, clear information to the Commission, on defining individual responsibilities within the overall concept - because a chain is only as strong as its weakest link - and on the euro zone becoming more aware of its responsibility within Europe."
"We make a huge point of this in paragraph 18 of the report by calling for the role of the social partners in implementing the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategy, in other words the European social partnership, to be strengthened. We therefore call for a tripartite social summit to be set up, with the participation of the European Parliament."
"We have no time for legal wrangling between institutions; we need to foster this social dialogue jointly and involve organisations of social partners."
"Which is precisely why we are demanding more rights in fora and in this process, by which we mean more involvement and more right of involvement on the part of the European Parliament."
"We stress in point 8 of the report that anyone who wants to see this democratic involvement must be concerned that the new timetable for the guidelines package gives the European Parliament even less time than before to agree on its position."
"We welcome the fact that this process has been streamlined."
"We welcome the fact that the focus is on implementation."
"We welcome specific timing arrangements and we welcome the fact that a strategic, medium-term policy concept is being strengthened."
"If we ensure that life is breathed into this communication, then we shall be one step closer to the Lisbon strategy."
"Madam President, economic prospects are not at their best at the moment and the European Union has realised that it needs to coordinate economic policy and employment policy more efficiently."
"The Commission proposal on streamlining coordination cycles has attracted the interest of all the institutions and numerous discussions have been held at various levels, illustrating that this proposal is not merely a technical proposal, as it might appear at first sight; it is, of course, guided by important political objectives, such as efficiency and transparency in the application of the Lisbon agenda and the role of the European Employment Strategy which, after five years in practice, is now firmly established."
"May I make a point of thanking the rapporteur, Mr Karas, and the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mr Bullmann, on a job extremely well done."
"I shall confine my comments to a few basic issues."
"First, the report supports the focus on the medium term."
"This means that we need to be much more sparing when changing and revising the guidelines."
"The Commission will approve a package of guidelines in keeping with the new programme for the first time in April 2003, covering the three years up to 2006."
"We need to avoid any major changes in the guidelines before this mid-term review in 2006."
"We have proven that it is far better to keep to the guidelines and ensure they are applied than to constantly add new elements."
"Secondly, this medium-term focus will require greater discipline on the part of everyone involved: the Commission, the Council, the European Parliament and all other interested parties."
"Of course, the Commission will review the employment recommendations for each individual country every year in order to ensure that they still reflect political developments in each Member State."
"May I remind you that the Treaty requires us to produce this annual report, which will take the form of application monitoring."
"That brings me to the second aspect, which is consistency and complementarity."
"It is vital that the two procedures complement each other if we are to achieve the maximum possible coordination between economic policy and employment policy."
"We had a fair degree of overlap in the past; on occasions, however, we also had contradictory approaches to the two strategies."
"Thirdly, there is a need to focus on application."
"Now that the employment strategy has been up and running for a number of years, we have identified the basic practical problems and the gap which often arises between submitting national action plans on employment and implementing them."
"I should like to stress in particular that this streamlining procedure should result in closer collaboration, not just between the various Councils - the Ecofin Council and the Council on Employment will need to find a clearer and more efficient way of working together - but also between the institutions of the European Union."
"I think that Parliament - and the entire procedure, of course - will benefit from this proposed streamlining of procedures, especially from more transparent information, with the main elements of the application of financial policies and employment policies being provided in a coordinated manner."
"May I remind you that, in the past, information on these two procedures often came in at different times, giving rise to a great deal of confusion."
"Fourthly, streamlining means a better governance model for these procedures, which in turn means more efficient consultation with the European Parliament and greater involvement on the part of the social partners and civil society."
"The big issue as far as evaluating employment policies is concerned is that neither the social partners nor the national parliaments have been properly involved."
"Finally, I must say that this proposal respects the need for autonomous procedures, as required under the Treaty."
"In short, the economic guidelines provide an overall framework for economic policy but the employment strategy has the necessary degree of autonomy."
"I am delighted that Parliament supports this approach."
"So what next?"
"This entire procedure coincides with the review of the employment strategy."
"We shall be presenting an initial communication in January 2003 and both these documents, the communication on the revision of the employment strategy and the draft joint report, which we submitted a month ago, will be the two basic political papers and will need to be debated so that we can get to the spring Council and then start applying the new procedure with the guidelines."
"We have a long history of collaboration with the European Parliament on the employment strategy."
"I think that we now have an opportunity for even more efficient and substantial collaboration."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. Parliament has worked on this Commission proposal in a very focused manner, in a very focused and very concerted manner."
"We were quick and we agreed across the committee and party political divide, under Mr Karas's guidance, on what I think is a good position."
"And because we have worked in such a quick and concerted manner, we can formulate clear demands on exactly what sort of coordination is required."
"First, at no time, not for a minute, not for a second, does anyone have any authority whatsoever to subordinate the social goals of Lisbon, the employment policy ambitions of the Lisbon agenda, to a one-dimensional interpretation of the internal market."
"This must be crystal clear and must be expressed in the procedures we choose."
"On the contrary, only if you take specific measures to promote social integration, only if you develop the full potential of people in Europe and get them into work, will you have any chance of putting Lisbon's demanding agenda into practice."
"I say that quite advisedly in the present debate on job market reforms and the reform of social security systems."
"Of course we need systems to be flexible and adaptable, but we also need them to be modern."
"And a modern system is a system that offers security, security for job seekers, job security, security in the event of illness, old age or disability."
"That is why economic reform is a means to an end when it comes to maintaining and renewing the European social model, not the other way round."
"If this is what we want, we have to put the objectives of competitiveness, social security and full employment on a par with each other."
"We have to find ways of linking these goals and making them mutually supportive."
"And if that is what we want, we must also make sure that the relevant Councils and Commission departments are involved on an equal footing and that no new hierarchies are created or old hierarchies reaffirmed."
"We shall be measuring you in your spring report, in your guideline package, on the basis of whether you meet these targets and do justice to what the streamlining concept promises."
"Secondly, if we want to do justice to Lisbon and Gothenburg, we must stop beating about the environmental bush."
"We must use the full potential of environmental policy in order to make it work for qualifications and employment."
"Thirdly, as Mr Karas quite rightly points out in his report, economic policy is a matter of common interest which deserves to be coordinated."
"If we want to coordinate it, then we also need to pluck up the courage to talk about investments and about an offensive in this area in the face of around 8% unemployment and a growth rate of under 1%."
"Parliament will be involved in this discussion and we must secure our rightful place in it."
"Madam President, the Commission communication actually takes up a proposal which Parliament has debated time and again in this Chamber since the second stage of monetary union, namely the need to try and coordinate and interlink the various political areas much more closely."
"We have always taken the view that this will only work once all the political areas have been put on an equal footing and all the Councils are considered equal under a guiding General Council."
"Unfortunately it took the Lisbon process, some six years later, to grab this opportunity and I am delighted that we have now moved from theory into practice. Commissioner, we have great expectations of the Commission; we expect an agreement to be reached."
"Europe is sorely in need of one."
"And that applies not just to economic and employment policy; it also applies to social and environmental policy."
"Europe is sorely in need of one because we cannot afford the luxury of uncoordinated policies."
"The Delors Commission concluded at one point that uncoordinated policies were costing us growth, which automatically means they are costing us jobs in the European Union."
"We are counting on an end to this situation and from that point of view this new paper really is most welcome."
"But it is only most welcome if it can rely on a more secure data situation than is presently the case and we can explain to our citizens that the coordination process is not just yet another euro-word or instrument which will not stand up in practice."
"What do I mean by that?"
"We need to be able to show that certain economic or employment or environmental policy decisions in one Member State also harm or benefit the national economy or the job market or the environment in another Member State and can halt, freeze or foster growth, and we need statistics that can provide us with the relevant data."
"Unfortunately, to the disappointment of European economic researchers, this is still not the case."
"What we need is a coordination profile and this profile may become clear in the question of how we bundle investments, investments in research and development for example, where Europe unfortunately still has a great deal of catching up to do."
"The main thing is that Parliament should be involved under an interinstitutional agreement, at the very latest by the time the Convention completes its reforms and the Treaty is amended."
"Madam President, no coordination, no procedure can be effective if there is a lack of political will."
"This must be our starting point."
"Some good objectives were set out in Lisbon and Gothenburg, but there is a huge gap between what is said and what is done."
"The European Union is facing serious economic problems, its growth potential is slowing down, public and private investment is very weak and it is lacking skills."
"Neither the Stability and Growth Pact nor the monetary policy is dealing with these challenges."
"They are assigning everything to the Member States, and coordination cycles, which are designed to be the Member States' area of discipline, cannot work if the Union also fails to adopt and implement common policies."
"There is no genuine European economic policy due to differences between the Member States."
"Coordination cycles do not examine economic relationships between countries."
"And we do not yet have a global approach to the European economy and the eurozone, considered in the context of globalisation."
"We do not yet have a policy on demand, networks or human capacities."
"The Union is still an area of regulatory and fiscal competition, where the very notion of social market economy is not accepted and will not be incorporated, in my view, in the future constitution, especially since there is still genuine aversion towards economic affairs."
"I shall now turn to institutional procedures."
"What the Commission is proposing to us is purely technocratic."
"I am in favour of merging different areas and setting up a cycle."
"I agree with the principle of streamlining."
"However, this will not remove the aforementioned political obstacles, hence my suggestions."
"First of all, the Treaties provide no solid basis for communitarisation of the economic policy."
"Our priority must therefore be to establish this basis in the Convention."
"Secondly, no reliable comparative statistical and analytical tool exists, particularly for social cohesion and sustainable development."
"As a priority, we must therefore provide the Union with investigative and analytical resources which are equal to its statements."
"Thirdly, the proposed procedures do not yet have any democratic value."
"We urgently need a broad public deliberation on the situations and options prior to the Commission's package, as well as a subsequent evaluation, by civil society and the elected representatives, and not only by the Commission."
"Fourthly, I do not believe that the European Parliament is today still capable of properly debating and of choosing a coherent economic policy."
"Too many positions held are marked by national interests alone and ideological mindsets."
"Having said that, Parliament is better placed than the Council and the Commission to deliberate and assess the economic policy."
"An annual interactive discussion is therefore necessary between national communities and the Community institutions at Parliament's initiative."
"Only then will the Commission draft its proposals, only then will the decision be referred back to the Council, but Parliament could then have a power of ratification."
"To sum up, without shared political will and a common democratic procedure, the coordination of national policies will fail."
"Madam President, I would like to thank our rapporteur Mr Karas."
"He has had a very challenging task to streamline the measures of coordination."
"I fully welcome the efforts of the Commission in this respect and I want to thank our Commissioner, Mrs Diamantopoulou, for your courage in proposing these items."
"I do not want to be the black sheep of the House today, but I think that we should also be critical when it comes to expanding methods of open coordination to different areas."
"In the report, Parliament says that we have two items which are important."
"If you look at paragraph (e) in the Karas report - I will read an extract from the paragraph: 'Whereas a better streamlined review of implementation in the form of a new implementation package requires information on the implementation of policies agreed on Europe leading to an evaluation of implementation in the relevant policy areas'."
"This is a text from the report and it shows that, for Parliament, implementation of present coordination mechanisms is really important."
"We have not seen enough concrete results from the coordination mechanisms and we need concrete results."
"The other worry of Parliament concerns the role of Parliament and you can see from all of the reports that our role as a parliament, as a representative of the citizens, is very worrying for us."
"In the working group of economic governors in the Convention of which I was a member, we had a majority of members who thought that the European Parliament and the European Commission should have a role to play and that the methods of open coordination and processes should be included in the Constitutional Treaty."
"Unfortunately, I was in the minority in this working group, because I think that the main aim of the open method of coordination is to be flexible, and that it should not be in the Treaty."
"We should use the current mechanisms."
"Madam President, I would like to express my full support for the report on which we are about to vote, particularly for its comprehensive approach to the sustainable development strategy, as defined at Lisbon and, then, more specifically, at Gothenburg: it is not a formula for lumping economic, employment and environmental objectives together under one umbrella but an integrated approach which orients sectoral and horizontal policies towards a new concept of development."
"In practice, this will allow us to discharge our responsibility towards future generations and the countries whose development is lagging behind."
"I would like to focus briefly on the instruments necessary for the practical implementation of this strategy."
"If we genuinely adopt the approach that quality of social conditions and of the environment are central rather than secondary to growth and that is an essential factor in competitiveness, the most appropriate implementation instrument would appear to be the method of open coordination, although it does need to be strengthened and streamlined, as the report states, particularly as regards the involvement of the European Parliament, which, moreover, needs to be better, much better equipped in this regard."
"The success of such a policy depends on the genuine participation of all the institutional levels and all the social players."
"Without this widespread committed involvement, development will not be sustainable."
"Lastly, I would like to take this opportunity to sound the alarm, and in this I am supported, inter alia, by the Civil Society Contact Group."
"The preliminary draft Constitutional Treaty presented by the Chairman of the Convention does not contain any reference to the concept of sustainable development."
"If we do not reinvigorate what has already been affirmed by the Treaty and at Gothenburg, it will be a genuine cultural regression, a step backwards which, not least, will reduce Europe's influence as a global player."
"Madam President, we welcome the important step being taken today in the field of health and safety at work."
"The proposal on risks to workers from physical agents was submitted eight years ago and the first part, on noise, was approved this year."
"So we realise just how difficult, both technically and politically, this type of legislation is."
"On behalf of the Commission, I should therefore like to congratulate the European Parliament, especially the members of the conciliation committee, on implementing what is, technically and politically, a particularly tricky issue."
"Today's final draft of the directive contains three important achievements."
"First, it provides greater protection for workers in all sectors of the economy, including sea and air transport, which were not covered under current legislation."
"Secondly, it recognises that the music and entertainment industry is a special case and grants it a five-year transitional period in which to draw up the codes of conduct needed so that workers and employers can honour their legal obligations and, thirdly, it reduces the limit of exposure from 90 db, which was the limit set in the 1986 directive, to 87 db."
"Clear progress indeed."
"Approval of this directive completes the second stage of the Commission proposal on risks from physical agents."
"More work is needed on the remaining two sections of the Commission proposal, namely electromagnetic fields and optical radiation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to call on the co-legislators to keep up their efforts to complete this legal framework on physical agents, which will give us an integrated framework for protecting workers and which, it must be said, has been lying on the negotiating table for far too long."
"Madam President, I would thank the Commissioner for having eventually dealt with the other physical agents, for in that way I do not have to say that there are still elements we have missing. I am delighted, moreover, that the Commission has consistently placed the issue high on its agenda."
"We all know that noise is a very serious problem for the working environment."
"It is an area which has been fully explained in terms of science."
"We know that, in actual fact, very little noise is needed to cause lasting damage to hearing."
"We also know that damage to hearing can lead to a reduction in people's capacity to work or to their possibly not being able to obtain jobs in the labour market ever again."
"It is, then, a very serious state of affairs we are talking about."
"I am therefore extremely pleased at our being able, tomorrow, to adopt a directive that gives workers better protection than that which they have at present."
"It is, then, a better directive with which we are concerned here, first of all because we are now at long last obtaining a proper upper limit on the noise to which workers may be exposed."
"I should like to have seen a lower limit, which is something I also proposed."
"I should also like to have seen no account taken of protection from personal protection measures, but what we have here is nonetheless an improvement."
"The other very positive factor is that the directive systematically attaches importance to the prevention made so much of in the framework directive."
"Prevention is in terms of action values but, in connection with the directive, we have also attached importance to ensuring the presence of properly functioning hearing protectors."
"There are, however, a number of other provisions that are to be avoided."
"We must implement alternative working methods that minimise exposure to noise."
"We must examine the work tools used in enterprises. Overall, employers' responsibility for making the directive work is emphasised in the directive itself."
"The directive provides protection and, in addition, it naturally makes clear the responsibility of employers in individual work situations."
"Finally, a couple of words about the music and entertainment sectors."
"This is a much discussed subject."
"We have heard about the British pop industry and about bagpipe players, all of which livened up the debate."
"It is not that I wish to provoke anyone with whom we have been debating this matter, but I should very much like to repeat that noise is, and remains, purely and simply noise."
"Irrespective of whether it sounds pleasant or unpleasant, noise can cause very serious damage to hearing."
"We have only to look to our own experience."
"We are of course aware of who is most often affected by the illness known as tinnitus."
"It is, in point of fact, people who have lived with pleasant noise or who have been affected by very pleasant noise, namely music."
"We know, therefore, that noise is noise."
"I am pleased that the directive recognises this so clearly."
"The directive also acknowledges that the music sector may possibly have difficulty implementing the directive's provisions within the deadline that has been fixed."
"It has therefore extended the deadline for implementing the directive."
"I am also very pleased that we have attached importance to prevention and to getting things to work in practice."
"We have established a transitional period, but this is also to be used for preparing standards governing the behaviour of the whole of the music and entertainment sectors."
"I am very satisfied with these standards because they are forward-looking and because they will, in a practical way, help the sector to observe the rules."
"It is also worth pointing out that those standards of behaviour, or ideas for standards of behaviour, arose in the course of the actual work done by the trialogue, and this is therefore a good example of the way in which cooperation through the trialogue can lead to constructive and positive results."
"It is not just a question of being combative."
"Good ideas emerge too, which can lead to constructive compromises, and that is something many of us are pleased about."
"In that connection, gratitude must also of course be expressed to the Commission for the role it has played and to the Council for its constructive cooperation."
"Finally, I just want to say how pleased I am that we have achieved such a broad compromise and such considerable support here in the Chamber."
"I now hope that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party will support this compromise and so confirm what its MEPs normally say in the committee, namely that, when there is scientific data and clear evidence that an issue constitutes a problem for workers, we must also legislate to solve that problem."
"That is a view I hope the ELDR Group will comply with tomorrow."
"I look forward to our obtaining a really large majority for a good directive."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, to follow on from the rapporteur's closing words, both I and the PPE-DE Group are happy with the report and with the compromise which has been reached."
"I think that this report lays another important stone in the edifice of health protection for European workers, even if, unfortunately, it will still be far too long before we have common European protection standards."
"In this particular instance, the first proposal dates back to 1993."
"The noise directive was certainly no easy task, with the Council and Parliament taking up somewhat different positions."
"But the whole purpose of the conciliation procedure is to bring about agreement even so."
"Such agreement is, by its very nature, always a compromise but, as I said, we all have reason to be satisfied with this particular compromise."
"Objectively speaking, noise protection has been increased; the previous speaker explained the technical data and details."
"But what is important is that it is clear-cut; there are no grey areas or confusing discretionary powers when it comes to implementation."
"The employer's obligation to provide hearing protectors, check they are effective and make sure people wear them is new."
"This sets out employers' general duty of care without any room for misunderstanding."
"My group was also concerned that an allowance should be made for the music and entertainment industry when it comes to applying the directive."
"This is a welcome move for reasons of legal truth and legal clarity because it makes no sense to have to keep turning a blind eye to the fact that the directive applies to orchestra members in theory but is never applied in practice for reasons of comfort or on aesthetic grounds."
"It is therefore simply more honest to allow a transitional period here and let the individual Member States and social partners decide what they want to do themselves."
"I should just like to emphasise that, however pleasing it is on paper, this directive needs to be applied in practice."
"I am becoming more and more convinced that employee protection directives look very pretty on paper but that nobody actually wants to implement them."
"That may have something to do with economic developments, but it is precisely during hard times that we need to make sure that directives are implemented."
"I say that with one eye very firmly on the candidate countries because we must set a very clear example here too."
"Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work and I very much welcome the outcome of conciliation on the subject, but I think we have several causes for complaint as well."
"Four subjects were covered by the original physical agents directive, noise was one, but the original 1986 directive on noise was due for revision in 1991."
"Here we are almost at the end of 2002 before we finally have a revised text."
"Vibration was another subject but it took Council eight years to reach a common position on vibration, and, as we have heard from the Commissioner, we still have the aspects concerning fields and waves and optical radiation to be dealt with."
"Progress is painfully slow."
"Yet, all around us in this high-tech era we are increasingly being bombarded by fields and waves from wireless local access networks, from blue tooth devices, from class I lasers and the like."
"I hope we will see a renewed sense of urgency on the part of Council."
"The directive is to be welcomed."
"It will bring about direct improvements."
"Workers will be exposed less to noise at work."
"Then their representatives will play a part in risk assessment in the choice of hearing protectors."
"Our preventative audio-metric testing will be made available under certain circumstances."
"All of these things and many others are to be welcomed."
"For the music and entertainment sector, I think we have established a very good approach."
"Member States will, as we have heard, draw up a code of conduct in consultation with the social partners and will give practical guidelines on how employers and employees can meet their obligations in that sector."
"The approach has been very much welcomed by the Musicians Union of Great Britain who acted to coordinate the work of musicians' unions across the European Union."
"In the interests of time, I will make just one other point."
"Many voices were raised in conciliation about the importance of business impact assessment on proposals of this sort - rigorous impact assessment."
"I will pose the question here that I posed in Committee: what value should we place upon whether a person in their 40s or 50s can actually hear and communicate with their infant grandchildren?"
"Because that is the part of the hearing spectrum industrial hearing loss often destroys."
"So, let us have a cost-benefit assessment by all means, but let us take all of the costs and all of the benefits into account, not just narrow financial ones."
"Madam President, we have moved a long way from when the rapporteur brought a report first to the Employment and Social Affairs Committee."
"I think we still have problems for the entertainment and leisure industry but the rest of industry and the workers will find this directive very easy to live with."
"If the original proposals had gone through, industry across the EU would have been decimated and workers thrown out of work - particularly in the construction industry, cement industry, mining and quite a lot of engineering industry - so thank goodness we have returned to some sort of sensible solution and moved back to the Council position where hearing protection can be taken into account when measuring decibel levels."
"I am glad we have moved back to the weekly measurement granted by Member States if they so deem necessary."
"But the amendment granting the leisure and entertainment business a five-year delay for implementation while the Commission looked at the best way to regulate this industry, taking into account the special problems faced by the pub and club industry in particular, was unfortunately lost that in conciliation, although, with a code of conduct, it is better than was first proposed."
"I grant you that."
"But at the present moment the current noise directive is not being implemented in the pub and club industries, neither in the UK nor in Denmark or in many other Member States."
"The reason it is not being implemented is because it is not workable."
"My problem is that if we add another layer of bureaucracy for the pub and club industry like this, we will cause tremendous problems."
"That is why I personally refuse to sign off the conciliation because I believe we could have got more from the Council."
"I was on my own apart from one notable exception so I appreciate the vote tomorrow will not make any difference at all to the final outcome."
"We have, through a lot of hard work, got a better deal for industry and workers alike."
"We could have got a better deal for the entertainment and leisure sector and I am sorry we did not take that opportunity."
"Madam President, may I just say what a pleasure it is to be invited to take the floor at five minutes to midnight."
"I often think - because it is usually the case with employment legislation - that it is all a plot by the Secretariat to remind us of the folly of the working time directive, not that we need to be reminded of that particular folly on that particular directive."
"Regarding this one, this conciliated text is in my view a bad compromise on a bad directive."
"It would have been much better for both parties to have kept their original positions and for the legislation to have fallen."
"Certainly I voted against it;"
"I was the notable exception referred to by my colleague Liz Lynne."
"I also voted against it in the conciliation committee for this reason, even though we did manage to dilute many of the dafter amendments during that committee process."
"As far as the UK is concerned, existing noise regulations have been well thought through and these tighter regulations at EU level are neither necessary nor appropriate."
"Mr Hughes mentioned the importance of business impact assessments and that they should be carried out thoroughly."
"I agree with that."
"It is significant that there has been no proper regulatory impact assessment at EU level to determine the costs and benefits of the proposed directive."
"Certainly there was one done by the UK which established that the costs far outweighed the benefits and perhaps that is why the EU decided not to do one."
"This legislation does not reflect the real world."
"Coming two weeks after Parliament approved the atypical workers directive, where extra costs and red tape could mean the loss of 160 000 temporary worker jobs in the UK alone, this latest directive shows that the EU continues to operate in a time warp when it comes to employment and social legislation."
"Finally, I would like to say that during the progress of the legislation through the European Parliament there have been three different ministers back in the UK, which may explain why the UK Government has made such a limp response to it."
"The UK Conservative response will not be limp."
"We will stand up for common sense and vote against it."
"Mr President, as the final member speaking on this issue, I would like to repeat and underline that the directive will, over time, render occupational noise-induced hearing loss and associated conditions diseases of the past."
"That is an achievement by the rapporteur, compounded by the fact that there were a number of national positions which were very difficult at the outset of this report, as has been said by other members."
"A huge amount of work went into that position."
"From the United Kingdom position, we were left with the situation where a number of issues had to be ironed out."
"We now have a situation where our Government - and I am surprised at Mr Bushill-Matthews' statement on this: we may have had three different ministers involved, but the fact is that the United Kingdom Government - and this is one of the governments most interested in this particular health and safety measure, believes that this strikes a good balance between improved worker protection and the need to avoid excessive and unnecessary regulation."
"I think it is important not to caricature health and safety measures when a huge amount of work has gone into ironing out those national positions."
"We heard a lot from Mrs Lynne about the impact on musicians in the entertainment sector."
"We have all in the United Kingdom heard much said on this."
"The fact is that those sectors have been satisfied by what could have been a far more difficult directive."
"The rapporteur is to be congratulated on the progress made."
"That is why I will be voting in favour."
"Mr President, it is estimated that around 12 million vertebrate animals are used annually in the European Union for the development and the testing of drugs, vaccines, chemicals and other products."
"A further nine million are bred and destroyed as surplus to requirements."
"Since Directive 86/609, which controls the use of animals in experiments, was first implemented more than 16 years ago, a great deal has changed."
"The original purpose of the Directive was to avoid distortions in trade."
"The European Union did not then have a duty, as it does now, to consider the welfare of animals in agriculture, research, transport or single market policies."
"Today, animal welfare is the subject of extensive public debate and interest and concern about the use of animals has escalated."
"Also, enormous progress has been made in scientific knowledge and practice."
"For these reasons, as well as deficiencies in the actual operation of the Directive, with many cases of infringement action taken by the Commission over the years, it is clear that this Directive is in urgent need of revision."
"The Commission has already made a commitment to review the Directive next year."
"I hope that the points on which we have focussed in this report will guide their work because there are many lessons to be learnt."
"The first is the need for a central European Union inspectorate to coordinate the work of inspectors in the Member States but with the power to visit facilities and revoke licences if necessary."
"In 1986, Parliament called for a standing committee to monitor the implementation of the Directive but it was not done."
"I believe this has proved to be a mistake."
"There is great variation between the Member States in the way that information is collated and in the way that replacement, reduction and refinement are applied."
"For example, the Commission has already published two sets of statistics on the number and use of animals in experiments."
"The data is required every three years."
"It does not have to contain very much detail and there has been no standard format for presenting it."
"Some Member States publish very detailed statistics annually while others publish the bare minimum as infrequently as possible."
"This has made evaluating the implementation of the Directive difficult."
"We need data to be published annually and in a standard format."
"The use of alternative testing methods is, of course, central."
"Animal experiments should be seen as exceptions to the rule rather than normal scientific procedures."
"Work on alternatives is progressing fast."
"This is where Member States should be concentrating and giving priority."
"Related to this is Article 7(2) of this Directive, which states that animals should be used for experiments only where there is no scientifically viable alternative."
"Given that the Commission does not currently require detailed information on statistics, it is impossible to monitor whether this article is actually being implemented."
"That is why the report recommends a central EU database including information on all animal experiments approved, currently performed and finalised."
"This would allow for EU-wide checks to ensure that article was being implemented and that experiments were not being duplicated."
"While the number of animals used for experiments had appeared to be reducing, the use of transgenic animals is rising."
"This is something that could not have been foreseen in 1986 when the Directive was adopted."
"There is inadequate provision for it in the Directive as a result."
"Transgenic animals must be included."
"Finally, many complaints from NGOs and other bodies and organisations relate to breaches of Article 5 on the general care and accommodation of animals."
"This can largely be overcome by an EU-wide standard training course including animal welfare and the ethics of experiments."
"There are four amendments to the report."
"I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment. I would also like to thank Mr Nisticò in particular for discussing his amendments with me."
"I regret that I cannot support amendments 1 and 2 as they weaken the report considerably on a point which is of great concern, that is, the use of primates, especially wild caught primates."
"I can support Amendment No 3."
"I believe there is general agreement in Parliament and in the Commission that Directive 86/609 is neither suitable nor effective today and that we need new legislation."
"I hope that the Commission will take up Parliament's recommendations."
"I welcome the own-initiative report by the European Parliament on the Directive on the protection of laboratory animals."
"I would like to thank Parliament and Mrs Evans for the initiative and the work accomplished."
"The report comes at the right moment to maintain the momentum for the in-depth revision of the Directive."
"In March 2003, we will convene a meeting of a technical expert working group."
"Experts from all stakeholders should elaborate on specific issues including those raised in the report."
"However, I would just like to say that development and testing of weapons on animals and the respective ban proposed in the report are not covered by Community competence."
"The report further highlights several cases of incorrect transposition of the Directive into Member States' national legislation and cases of incorrect practical application."
"We have been actively pursuing these cases and therefore four out of the nine cases presented in the report have already been successfully closed."
"In conclusion, I consider the report to be most welcome."
"It provides the key elements for the in-depth revision of the Directive."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your support for the two-step approach we have taken for amending the Directive."
"The first step is currently under way and concerns the inclusion of the procedure for technical adaptation into the Directive."
"Parliament adopted the proposal in July 2002 without amendments."
"However, a modification in the wording has recently become necessary and Council is likely to adopt a common position."
"Therefore, for the second reading, I would like to ask you again for a rapid adoption."
"The second step for amending the Directive will, of course, be the in-depth revision."
"I would again like to emphasise that I consider the Parliament's report as an important input and I hope that I can count on Parliament's continued support in our efforts to further improve the welfare of animals used in experiments in the European Union."
"Madam President, the European Parliament has, on a number of occasions, expressed strong feeling about this matter and declared itself to be opposed to the use of laboratory animals when experiments are repeats of experiments which have already been carried out in other technologically advanced countries, when alternative, internationally approved methods exist and when the products in question are not strictly necessary, as in the case of cosmetics."
"Directive 86/609 establishes boundaries and standards which the individual countries of the European Union have to respect in order to ensure maximum protection for animals: I hope that these are applied throughout the European Union."
"We must remember, however, that the people who devote their lives to scientific research are skilled professionals, as are the Commission's scientific consultants, who are therefore fully aware of this responsibility and perform experiments with the noble aim of eliminating diseases which are still incurable and fatal."
"Moreover, we need to acknowledge that, for certain specific purposes, it is still necessary to use subhuman primates today."
"It is necessary for the purposes of assessing the effectiveness and safety of Aids vaccines - every year, another two million people die - for the production of monoclonal antibody vaccines to fight diseases such as cancer, polio, tuberculosis or malaria, and where there are no alternative methods in existence."
"To prohibit these types of experiments on primates would be to jeopardise the lives of a great many children and adults, Commissioner, depriving them of drugs and vaccines which are essential for the preservation of their lives."
"I have tabled three amendments."
"I am going to withdraw the second, but Amendments Nos 1 and 3 stand as before."
"Amendment No 1 is particularly important to me, and I therefore hope that reason will prevail over emotion tomorrow, for No 1 is of fundamental importance for the protection of human health itself."
"If Amendment No 1 is not adopted, I shall regrettably be forced - as I have already told the rapporteur - to abstain in the final vote."
"Madam President, I should first like to thank Mrs Evans for an outstanding report and to thank Mrs Wallström for the positive reception she has given to Parliament's report."
"I think we were right to highlight the Member States's poor implementation of the 1986 directive."
"I also think that the report shows very clearly the need for tightening up the current rules."
"I can fully support the Commission's being obliged, by no later than next year, to table a proposal regarding the way in which animal experiments are to be regulated in future."
"Among the areas I would earmark for tightening up is the area of application."
"I think it important that animal experiments should also cover the use of animals for educational purposes, and we must look at the conditions under which transgenic and genetically modified animals are used in experiments."
"We must establish some clear ethical rules."
"I also believe it is very important for us to obtain a central database for approved animal experiments, both current and completed and both successful and manifestly unsuccessful."
"I think it important that we obtain a combined database of this kind so that we avoid repeating experiments that have already been carried out."
"Finally, I want to support Mrs Evans's idea of obtaining better supervision of the circumstances in which animals are kept, possibly through a common EU inspectorate that can help ensure that the rules are observed."
"May I say that I am able to support Amendment No 3 and that there will be a free vote on Amendment No 4 in the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"On the other hand, we are unable to support Amendments Nos 1 and 2."
"I am looking forward to a proposal from the Commission that will live up to the expectations to which - inspired by Mrs Evans - Parliament's report has given expression."
"Madam President, I will start by saying that I do not belong to the cross-party group of animal rights extremists either by nature or by inclination, I have never been a vegetarian and I am not one of those people who likes to sleep with their dog on their bed."
"I firmly believe that we are not bound to love animals but that we do have a duty to respect them."
"This, too, is a way of measuring the degree of civilisation of a people."
"The almost complete lack of attention on the part of many of the Member States to the need for proper implementation of Directive 86/609 on animals used for experimental purposes, the appalling shortcomings of the directive itself and the delay in realising the need for it to be updated are confirmation of at least two things: firstly, that animal welfare is a taboo subject in this wealthy, opulent Europe, and secondly, that international economic lobbies are still succeeding in preventing free, political debate on certain subjects."
"Admitting, as I do, that scientific progress includes animal experimentation does not mean allowing the Member States to flout and repeatedly violate standards and to subject laboratory animals to unnecessary suffering."
"Therefore, the European Commission must speed up its reform process in this area and step up its control and monitoring of non-compliant States, and Parliament, without allowing there to be tension between its head and its heart, must summon up the courage, with the resolution before us today, to take up arms and wage ideological war against the egoism and evil ways of mankind and, without jeopardising scientific research, confirm our unquestionable duty to respect defenceless animals."
"Mr President, it is always a pleasure to hear a committed rapporteur and a committed Commissioner speaking on their common concern in this matter."
"That, of course, has made the whole debate briefer because it is not interrogatory."
"I want to say two things."
"Firstly, it is extraordinary that a Directive promulgated in 1986 has still not been properly implemented in some Member States."
"If Ms Evan's report does nothing else, it has brought to our attention the need to speed up the process, because that is at the heart of the reform of our procedures generally: implementation, how it is done, rather than innovation, is now always the motto."
"I agree with Mr Lund about Mr Nisticò's amendments."
"I have to say with great respect that I do not think I can support Amendments Nos 1 or 2 which he has withdrawn."
"The reason, very simply, is that it seems to me to devalue animals caught in the wild, as though they are a cheap supply that can be brought in whilst all our concern goes towards zoo-bred animals and the contents of laboratories."
"I also feel that we need to look very carefully in this Directive at exactly how the process of experimentation will go in the future."
"We have this triptych here neatly from Ms Evans: replacement, reduction and scaling down."
"I would add reflection - we ought to reflect before every experiment is carried out."
"Why are we doing this?"
"Is it being duplicated?"
"What will the results be?"
"It will be a good day for Parliament if we can do this as well as for the animals under consideration."
"Madam President, a great deal has been said this evening on this subject."
"Each speaker has explained his position calmly and resolutely, and, indeed, I do not even want to use all the time available to me for fear of repeating what has already been said."
"Directive 86/609 laid down provisions which reflected the - as yet quite limited - understanding of that time."
"Over 15 years have passed since that directive, during which time I would say it has had hardly any effect at all, for every day we receive news not of progressive alignment with the directive but of ill-treatment of animals and unlawful behaviour."
"The States have to a large degree failed to comply with the directive; the whole of society - human society as well as, of course, the animal kingdom - has not felt protected."
"The report contains a number of very specific provisions on the behaviour of what are, indeed, major countries - Austria, Belgium, France, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom - which have behaved in different ways but, in any case, in such a manner as to justify the assertion that almost all the States have failed to comply with the directive for a long time."
"This failure to comply has taken different forms but it is still failure to comply."
"Few countries in the European Union have escaped criticism, and that may well be because they were not yet part of the European Union at the time in question and have therefore not been assessed."
"I believe that there must be an undertaking in this regard."
"The report's proposals are certainly sound, the recommendations made by the Commissioner - although I feel she is a little overoptimistic - are certainly sound, but the important thing is for the legislation to be implemented, and so we need inspectors, we need monitoring, we need all possible endeavours to ensure that the directive is respected, even before we start to revise it."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place later today at 11 a.m."
"Short-term residence permits"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before we go into the discussion of Mrs Sörensen's report proper, I wish to express my appreciation of the quality of her work and congratulate her on her personal involvement in the fight against the veritable scourge that is the trafficking in human beings."
"The proposal for a directive we are considering today is undoubtedly an extremely worrying problem; illegal immigration in its two particularly odious forms - on the one hand, the development of networks of smugglers who act for reasons that are far from humanitarian and, on the other, the exploitation of migrants in the trafficking of human beings."
"More precisely, this directive concerns the victims of trafficking and smuggling under these two types of offence, which must not be confused with one another."
"One of the key elements of dismantling networks that exploit migrants lies in obtaining information."
"The victims are in the best position to be able to provide this type of information to the authorities. And, without this information, the authorities will find it more difficult to combat trafficking networks."
"The aim of this proposal is therefore to strengthen the instruments for combating networks, by establishing a residence permit for the victims of action to facilitate illegal immigration or trafficking in human beings with arrangements that encourage them to cooperate with the competent authorities against the perpetrators of the offences in question, but avoiding any type of abuse in the way this mechanism is used."
"It should be highlighted that, since trafficking in human beings and action facilitating illegal immigration are often interlinked, the scope of the text covers both offences, because these are basically parts of the same fight."
". (NL) Mr President, let me begin by thanking all those fellow MEPs who have contributed so much time and energy to what I think has been an extremely fruitful collaborative exercise."
"It was in mid-September, and in this Chamber, that by far the most important conference on the subject of trafficking in human beings to date was organised by the International Organisation for Migration and the European Commission."
"It resulted in the so-called Brussels Declaration, and in this Brussels Declaration you can clearly see the central importance of the directive that you have before you to vote on today."
"It is important to point out straightaway that trafficking in human beings and smuggling of human beings form an integral part of our economy today."
"It is essentially about treating people as if they were nothing more than merchandise."
"At the same time victims of trafficking in human beings are victims of a whole range of abuses and criminal practices."
"Trafficking in human beings has now also become the subject matter for committees, with nearly everyone seeming to want to take up a position on it."
"What is frequently overlooked is that trafficking in human beings is proliferating because corruption, along with indifference and disbelief, is proliferating."
"In a number of countries soon to become members of the European Union, parents sell their children in the hope of giving them a better future."
"This proposal for a directive is a first and consequently important step towards eventual concrete action."
"The directive requires the Member States to issue a short-term residence permit to victims of smuggling of human beings or of trafficking in human beings who are prepared to cooperate with the competent authorities."
"The essence of the proposal is that, here, governments and the victims have shared interests, in particular that the criminal networks be shut down."
"For the purposes of this special directive, the Commission has taken trafficking in human beings and smuggling of human beings together."
"It is indeed the case that in purely legal terms they are two quite different things, but in reality the distinction is extremely difficult to make."
"This proposal for a directive is however based on thorough practical knowledge of experts active in the field."
"The experience we have acquired in Belgium for example proves that the instrument of a short-term residence permit does not miss its mark."
"Other Member States too have such systems, albeit with varying degrees of success."
"I fully support the Commission's proposal and it is fundamentally important that its content remains intact."
"First and foremost this means that some of the amendments touched on by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs are unacceptable, in particular, for me, Amendments Nos 7 and 27, for the simple reason that they tear the proposal apart."
"They turn it into an empty shell."
"Voting for these amendments will be barely concealed approval for the practices of organised crime."
"What I want to say is that this directive stands or falls by the minimum social provision for victims."
"A victim will never want to cooperate if he or she is not offered the beginnings of an alternative to the situation in which they currently find themselves."
"Allow me to say a few words on two other points."
"Firstly, there are some who would want this directive to apply immediately to minors too."
"At first glance this seems a good idea, simply because we can never do enough for the extremely vulnerable position of minors."
"What is forgotten, however, is that what this directive is offering in the end is only a minimum."
"Minors are offered very much more today in all the Member States and it would therefore be a real step back if minors were only accorded such minimal protection and rights."
"This does not alter the fact that there is a real need for a special effort for victims who are minors."
"Finally, I would like to say something else regarding a number of original amendments from Mrs van der Laan - Amendments Nos 20, 25 and 35."
"Her alert legal mind envisages the possibility that in certain cases contact between victim and criminal can be accepted by the authorities to further the investigation."
"It is a tempting idea, but it is a legal minefield in a number of countries."
"The risk of kidnappings or even of manipulation and intimidation is also very real."
"Victims willing to cooperate with the authorities want absolutely no contact at all with the criminals, not even from a distance."
"I should also like to emphasise that this directive sets aside a special place for specialised and recognised NGOs, but also for international organisations and government agencies."
"As Mrs van der Laan has likewise rightly said - and, although this, because of a technical error, does not appear in the text in front of you, it has been noted on the voting list - NGOs also have a special part to play as intermediaries between the investigation and prosecution services on the one hand and the victim on the other."
"It is also important in this regard to emphasise that where NGOs are concerned they must be NGOs recognised by the state."
"After all, anyone, even criminals, can set up NGOs."
"Or, as not uncommonly happens, NGOs can be infiltrated and manipulated."
"I therefore think that everyone involved with this matter should sign a code of conduct."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, international estimates indicate that traffickers in human beings transport up to 700 000 people every year, mainly women and children."
"Every year, 120 000 women and children are lured into the European Union from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe alone."
"These figures do not take account of either illegal immigration or the smuggling of human beings."
"This highlights the urgent need for coordinated measures against this form of organised crime."
"The proposal for a directive, which provides for short-term residence permits to be issued to victims who cooperate with the competent authorities, is an important step."
"Up to now, there have not been any pan-European arrangements for dealing with the victims of action to facilitate illegal immigration or trafficking in human beings."
"However, we need common European standards if we are to combat this form of crime."
"The short-term residence permits proposed here will not undermine the current practice of deporting illegal immigrants."
"Instead, the authorities will be put in a position to obtain information and incriminating evidence from victims who cooperate, with a view to apprehending traffickers and smugglers of human beings and commencing criminal proceedings against them."
"Immediate deportation of victims may improve the statistics, but it does not bring us any closer at all to achieving our objective of effectively combating organised crime, whereas short-term residence permits for victims who cooperate make it possible to identify structures, break up criminal rings and bring criminals to justice."
"That must be our goal."
"At this point I would once again like to thank Mrs Sörensen very sincerely for all the commitment she has put into this report."
"I would also like to thank the Commission and the other groups for their helpful cooperation, which I believe has led to a good end result in this report."
"Mr President, the Commission's proposal is a creditable attempt as a Union, to get a better grip on smuggling of human beings and trafficking in human beings."
"The circumstances under which people enter countries illegally are tragic and degrading."
"All legal means must be used to tackle the criminals who show no mercy in their quest to earn big money."
"The means proposed here can make a contribution to this."
"Similar legislation for victims of trafficking in human beings was successfully introduced in the Netherlands some years ago."
"Mrs Sörensen however immediately puts her finger on the weak point in the Commission's proposal."
"The definition 'victims of action to facilitate illegal immigration' is unclear."
"She proposes following the lead of the UN protocol against smuggling of migrants and using the term 'victims of smuggling of human beings'."
"The Commission is opposed to following this lead precisely in order to prevent misunderstandings."
"This directive in fact affects a different group of people from those in the UN protocol."
"The directive is only concerned with those who can reasonably be regarded as victims and who have experienced harm such as threat to life or assault on their physical integrity."
"I understand this reasoning, but think that the Commission's definition will provide for at least as many misunderstandings."
"In effect we are talking about the same terms."
"The problem is just that the term must bring to the fore that the people concerned have suffered disproportionate harm."
"Mrs Sörensen tries to solve this by proposing the term 'victims of smuggling of human beings resulting in exploitation'."
"This term does not fit the bill either however because what happens then to the physical harm the Commission is talking about?"
"Both definitions threaten to lead to abuse of the regulation."
"The Council must consider carefully whether the offence of smuggling of human beings should be included in the directive in this way."
"Especially as legislation in this area exists only in Spain."
"I should also like to note that the deletion of Article 12 does not seem to me to be a good idea."
"Access to the labour market, to vocational training and education is just one part of what this system should set up."
"If it is omitted, what reason does the victim then have to cooperate with proceedings against the smugglers of human beings and traffickers in human beings?"
"It is precisely through the opportunity to earn a little money and to receive some training that in the end you give them more opportunities in their homeland and you also give the homeland itself more opportunities."
"Mr President, the resolution before Parliament derives its legal justification from an institutional framework where it is not hard to acknowledge the commitment of the European institutions, particularly the European Parliament, to the important and necessary action to stamp out one of the most dangerous and vile forms of criminal trafficking in existence: the trafficking of human beings."
"In this connection, my country's legal authorities have already carried out many detailed investigations, especially with regard to the north-east border, which, in an irresponsible move, had its border controls removed a long time ago."
"I will now turn to the content of the resolution."
"Without prejudice to the fundamental reasons behind this approach, which, of course, should be endorsed - for precisely these reasons and because of the need to take concrete steps to clamp down on trafficking in human beings and the promotion of illegal immigration - we must not ignore the risk. The danger is that, through the practical application of these rules in support of those who cooperate, we may create clandestine means whereby the same organisations can, through false or perfunctory cooperation, establish another method to bring persons into European Union territory illegally."
"It is therefore extremely important to limit the scope and legal procedures, and clearly delineate the legal procedures of this process, precisely in order to avoid delays being contrived and the possibility of re-entry."
"Lastly, I would like to remember the victim of an horrific reverse race murder two years ago: a young Swede killed by racists in Salem, a suburb of Stockholm."
"Mr President, I too would like to explain once again why we feel totally unable to vote in favour of this report; it is because the premises it is based upon are totally flawed."
"Migrants put themselves in the hands of traffickers and smugglers of human beings because legal immigration into 'fortress Europe' is virtually impossible nowadays."
"That and that alone is the starting point for all this."
"That is why trafficking in human beings and smuggling of human beings happen in the first place, and it is because people who come here in this way are forced into acting illegally that they find themselves in a precarious situation."
"It is for that reason alone that it is possible to exploit them in the way that they are being exploited."
"To that extent, I can say that I find the Commission's proposal honest at least, because the title itself makes it clear that this is about ensuring that any form of illegal immigration is made more difficult, rather than about helping the 'clients' of traffickers and smugglers of human beings."
"That is evident from the fact that this report also covers smugglers who do nothing apart from transporting people across borders in return for payment."
"That is why I have only this to say: if this really were a matter of helping people, which some Members have suggested to be the case, then we should be working to dismantle border arrangements in a consistent way and to guarantee that people have the freedom to choose where in the world they live."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by thanking everyone for their contribution to this debate and for the support expressed for the Commission's proposal."
"We agree with the amendments intended to clarify the system that has been proposed."
"I am referring here to simplifying the residence permit, to the possibility of extending the reasonable reflection period on the basis of serious grounds and to the need for the victim who has been issued with a residence permit to remain available to the competent authorities."
"Similarly, we can support the amendments specifying that the victim must be informed in a language they understand or that they can submit a request for asylum as well as the amendments stipulating that the decisions to withdraw or not to renew a residence permit can be appealed against and that the withdrawal of authorisation must have good reason."
"We also support the amendments that seek to clarify certain concepts, such as the seriousness of the offences referred to or the examples of vulnerable persons."
"We cannot, however, support the proposals that eliminate the granting of social benefits such as access to the labour market, to vocational training and to education."
"We are talking about short-term residence permits and these measures will not only have a major economic impact but will above all provide an important incentive for cooperation with police authorities."
"Similarly, we feel that minors must not be included in the common rules."
"The provision of a specific framework that guarantees greater protection for minors, who are particularly vulnerable victims, is of the utmost importance."
"Lastly, we believe that giving victims the opportunity to maintain relations with trafficking networks in order to work as informers could have terrible consequences."
"We must be aware of the power of these networks, of the vulnerability of the victims and of the risk that such a solution would entail."
"Lastly, we cannot accept the amendments which, although reasonable and well-founded, appear to exceed the legal basis of this instrument: I am referring to the protection of privacy, to the identification of the victim in a court case and to the recognition of harm suffered and compensation for this, which are covered in other texts, both at European and at national level."
"I wish once again to thank Parliament for the support it has given this Commission initiative."
"Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"That now brings us to the next item on the agenda, but we have a slight problem."
"Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, is on his way here, but it will be a little while before he reaches the Chamber."
"The sitting will therefore be suspended for a few minutes."
"(The sitting was suspended at 9.35 a.m. and resumed at 9.45 a.m.)"
"Mr President, this is not a procedural issue."
"At this very moment an oil tanker is moored in the port of Gibraltar, the 'Moskowsky Festival', which the Spanish Government, specifically the Spanish navy, expelled last Saturday, sending it more than 400 miles from Galicia."
"This is an oil tanker which is not good for Galicia, which is not good for Community seas and which should not be moored in a free port nor in waters which both Spain and Gibraltar consider to be their own."
"The next item is the Commission statement on its contribution to the work of the European Convention."
". (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, the Commission will present its second contribution to the Convention on the future institutional structure of the Union."
"To avoid any misunderstandings created by press reports, I would like to make it clear from the outset that, today, I am here to present, as agreed, only the text that the Commission has adopted."
"The document on the Constitution of the European Union, which has been reported by the press, is nothing more than a working document, a feasibility study that Commissioner Barnier, Commissioner Vitorino and I commissioned from a group of legal experts in the Commission, in order to have an initial idea of how a Treaty could be organised."
"The document was essentially drawn up on the basis of the structure of the preliminary draft presented to the Convention by the Praesidium."
"As it is simply, I repeat, a technical working tool, it was neither discussed by the College nor submitted for its approval, and the College has therefore no political responsibility for its content."
"Although it was formulated mainly for internal use, I thought it my duty to inform Mr Giscard d'Estaing of its existence, and, for the sake of transparency, we have decided to post it on the Internet by the end of the day in order to make it available, as others have done in the past, as a working tool for the Convention and for all those interested."
"To set the tone for my presentation and the subsequent debate, I would like to recall someone who played a leading role in laying the first foundations of the European project."
"This is what Jean Monnet said about his famous method: 'I never thought we could change human nature."
"But by changing the context in which people live, by giving them the same rules and the same democratic institutions, we can succeed in changing the way they behave towards each other."
"Within the Community, Europeans are learning to live together as one and the same people."
"We are not merging states, we were uniting human beings.'"
"If we want to look ahead, far ahead into the future, we need to climb onto the shoulders of the great statesmen who have gone before us."
"That requires a responsible and humble approach, and it is with humility that I propose to follow Jean Monnet's intuition in order to meet the great challenges of the future."
"To unite all the citizens of Europe, we must create true harmony between the States and between the peoples."
"The debate that has taken place in recent months since the Convention opened has already clarified many unclear areas and answered many questions."
"First, the debate has made it plain that citizens do not want the Union to withdraw from areas where it is present."
"On the contrary, people want the Union to be more prominent in foreign policy, in justice and security and in social affairs."
"Moreover, there is broad agreement on the Community method, which is at the heart of so many of our achievements."
"Relations between the main institutions certainly need to be streamlined and clarified, but even the most sceptical have realised that without a strong Community element, Europe would become less effective and less democratic too."
"Our contribution to the Convention seeks to respond to these concerns."
"In short, it has three objectives: the Union must become more democratic, more effective and clearer."
"The path to these goals has not yet been marked out in detail, but we already know where the starting and finishing lines are."
"The reshaping of the Union must be grounded on its twofold nature as a Union of peoples and of States, together with a third source of the Union's legitimacy, the fact that it safeguards the common interest."
"Our path must lead us to build the world's first true supranational democracy."
"To give more democratic substance to our structure, we need to establish the roles and responsibilities of the main institutions more clearly."
"We therefore have two proposals for reform."
"The first concerns the appointment of the Commission."
"The President of the Commission should be elected by the European Parliament by at least two-thirds of the votes cast in a secret ballot."
"Once it has confirmed the appointment of the President of the Commission, the Council, by common agreement with him or her, will designate the other members of the Commission."
"The European Parliament will then approve the whole Commission, as appointed by the Council."
"The second innovation concerns the Commission's dual accountability to the European Parliament and the Council."
"We propose that both institutions should have the right to pass a motion of censure on the Commission."
"This will give the institutional triangle more balance and will strengthen the Commission's position as guarantor of the general interest."
"Clearly, this is a particularly delicate and bold proposal, but, in my view, the proposed arrangement divides decision-making power more fairly between the representatives of the national governments and the representatives of the people, that is, between the Council and Parliament."
"For the same reason, we propose to make codecision the rule."
"All European legislation must be put forward by a Commission proposal, adopted by a majority vote in the Council and codecided by the European Parliament."
"Lastly, as I have often said in this House, the time has come to put Parliament on the same footing as every other democratically elected parliament, by reforming the way the Union is financed."
"Its responsibilities are typical of those of all the world's parliaments."
"We want to give the European Parliament more power to make decisions on resources."
"The Union's budget must therefore be adopted by the European Parliament and the Council by a procedure derived from codecision, as I mentioned a moment ago."
"As the Praesidium also acknowledges in its draft Constitutional Treaty, the Union must have its own resources. This would remove the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the key points in the Communication form a single unit."
"The democratic legitimacy of our institutions, for example, is closely bound up with their functions."
"Our main proposals in this respect can be summed up in three points."
"The first point is to abolish unanimous voting, as this rule has played a part in the darkest periods of the Union's recent history."
"If the veto has frequently paralysed decision-making with 15 Member States, just think what could happen with 25 or more."
"That is why I believe majority voting should be the rule."
"However, the current system of weighting is extremely complex and a mystery to the citizens, and not just to them: experts find it impossible to understand too."
"We therefore propose that the Council should take practically all decisions by a twofold, simple-majority vote, that is, a vote which represents both a majority of the Member States and a majority of the citizens."
"More sensitive decisions would clearly require enhanced majorities."
"The second point concerns the Presidency of the Council, an issue that has caused rivers of ink to flow."
"I believe that the proposal for a President of the Union, put forward by several quarters, creates more problems than it solves."
"On the one hand, it enhances the continuity and visibility of the Union, but, on the other, it denies the Member States and deprives us all of the opportunity for involvement at European level."
"There are other concerns too."
"Who would elect the President of the Union?"
"Who would this President be accountable to?"
"And above all, as Mr Verhofstadt remarked, what would this President do for the other 360 days of the year when the Council is not in session and George Bush is not calling?"
"It is clear that such a position would open a rift in our institutional structure."
"We therefore recommend maintaining the system of rotation for the Presidency of the European Council, the General Affairs Council and the Committee of Permanent Representatives."
"For all other Council configurations, we propose a new formula, that members of Council configurations should elect a president from one of their number, with a one-year mandate."
"This formula will bring greater continuity to the Council's work and put the Presidency in the hands of persons who enjoy the full confidence of their peers."
"The third point concerns our external representation."
"The Union must act as one in the international arena in order to defend its values and promote its social model."
"In terms of trade, the Union is already on an equal footing with the other leading players on the world stage."
"Why, then, can we not be equally credible in the political arena?"
"This requires imagination and courage because it is vital for the Union to speak with a single voice in international politics."
"What we propose is a new post of Secretary of the Union for Foreign Affairs."
"The Secretary will be appointed jointly by the European Council and the President of the Commission, and will also be a Vice-President of the Commission."
"It follows that the Secretary of the Union must report personally to both the European Council and the President of the Commission."
"As a member of the Commission, though, the Secretary will be jointly accountable along with the other Commissioners before the European Parliament."
"As you can see, this is a major innovation, but, I repeat, it is unavoidable."
"Given the magnitude of the change - and this is important - we plan to have a transitional period, at the end of which the Secretary of the Union will take full charge of his duties."
"I would like to outline these briefly."
"The Secretary of the Union will autonomously exercise the Commission's right of initiative in foreign policy in accordance with the Council's guidelines."
"The Council, or a group of Member States, may, however, ask the Secretary to present suitable proposals to the Council to achieve common objectives."
"The Secretary of the Union for Foreign Affairs will also be responsible for implementing common decisions and, most importantly, the Secretary will be the Union's sole representative for foreign policy in relations with non-Member countries and other international bodies."
"Various Union activities, such as trade and development cooperation policy, are connected with foreign policy."
"Continuity in these areas will be ensured by collaboration between the Secretary of the Union and the President of the Commission who, in this respect, will coordinate matters."
"The issue of the Union's external representation is also relevant to economic affairs."
"Representation of the euro area in the international arena needs to be settled."
"The euro's economic strength is now recognised: it also needs to become a force politically and make its presence felt in the wider world."
"The third and final key point of our proposal is simplification and clarity."
"The current volume of directives, decisions and regulations that combine to form our body of legislation is possibly the biggest barrier citizens face in understanding the European institutions."
"The Commission believes it is time to put in order the instruments at our disposal."
"We propose, therefore, to classify legislation into just three categories: organic laws adopted by enhanced majorities by the European Parliament and the Council; laws adopted by codecision by Parliament and the Council; implementing regulations adopted by the Commission in order to put these laws into effect."
"The Constitutional Treaty must make a clear distinction between laws and implementing regulations."
"Moreover, it must be clear who implements European legislation in practice."
"We propose that the Commission should have exclusive competence for implementing - I repeat, implementing - European legislation, and, as I said, it will be accountable for this to both Parliament and the Council."
"The principle of transparency must also apply to what is known as comitology."
"We therefore feel that only advisory committees should be maintained."
"When the legislator decides to adopt laws at European level, I repeat, the Commission alone should have responsibility for their implementation."
"However, where the Commission is to perform a legislative role by delegation, then it is only right that both branches of the legislative - the Council and Parliament - should be on the same footing as regards the possibility of monitoring the Commission's activity, referred to as 'call back'."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, When I quoted Jean Monnet at the start, I said that, at this stage of European integration, we need to look far ahead."
"The debate aroused by the Convention in recent months has already widened our horizons."
"The national parliaments and governments have believed in it right from the start, and sent major figures to represent them."
"The goal of the Convention has become more ambitious."
"It is no longer just a question of ensuring that the institutions work well after enlargement: it must establish the overall shape of the Union for generations to come."
"I am pleased to see this development."
"The Convention that Parliament and I too wanted so keenly is providing our fellow citizens and the whole world with an analysis of all aspects of our institutions."
"I am also pleased that this is taking place in the light of day."
"The coming months will see the emergence of a new, united Europe, and we can be proud that it will have come into being democratically and transparently."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, we warmly applauded the President of the Commission just now."
"I am pleased for him personally, but I am also pleased about the case he has been making."
"We cannot always applaud the President of the Commission so enthusiastically."
"Mr Prodi, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats wishes to sincerely thank you and the whole Commission for the work you have done."
"I would also like to add that our group very much supports the Commission as regards the future of the European Union and its institutions."
"That does not mean that there will not be differences of opinion between us on points of detail, and today's debate is one which forms part of a process in which we need to exchange views, and a process in which others are also involved, such as governments, with whom we ultimately need to achieve a result as well."
"I believe that the most important thing in the debate over the coming months will be for the Commission and Parliament to ensure in no uncertain terms that the outcome of the Convention is underpinned by the Community method."
"The Community method means the institutions of the European Union acting together and it particularly means that we must very firmly reject the intergovernmental method."
"I want to make this point crystal clear, and in the full public gaze: if at the end of the Convention the intergovernmental method wins the day, we could not support that."
"In that respect, we are totally at one with the Commission."
"We want a democratic Europe, and as far as we are concerned a democratic Europe means a representative democracy at EU level."
"That means the European Parliament being closely involved in all legislative issues, as a 100% co-legislator, as Mr Romano Prodi said."
"However, a democratic Europe based on representative democracy also means that we recognise the principle of subsidiarity."
"If we do not want a chamber at EU level consisting of national Members of Parliament, then we also need to strive to define what tasks are European tasks."
"All other tasks are tasks for the Member States of the European Union and it is the job of the Member States of the European Union to define what are national matters, what are regional matters and what are matters for local authorities."
"The principle of representative democracy must apply at all four of these levels - local authorities, regions, nations and the European Union."
"That implies that we need to link the Community method at EU level with the principle of subsidiarity."
"We need Europe to be effective - let me emphasise that point - and to be clearer and easier to understand."
"As far as we are concerned, a key issue and one linked with the Community method is that the Europe we are building should be a legal Community."
"Because if it is not a legal Community it will be an intergovernmental Europe, and that would be opening the way to political opportunism, and history has shown that to be a very bad thing for Europe."
"It is not possible for me to talk very much about the many points of detail in the four minutes I have at my disposal, but I urge us all to consistently be guided by the issue of method when we have individual decisions to make."
"My request to the members of the Convention, and let me repeat it here, is this: make sure that the Convention achieves results."
"If we do not manage to achieve any results in the Convention, and transfer this task to the Intergovernmental Conference, the outcome of that conference will owe less to the Community method than what we can achieve in the Convention."
"That is why I am calling for our work in the Convention to be completed and for a willingness to compromise to be demonstrated in that forum, so that by the end of June 2003 we will be able to present a reasonable proposal for a European constitution."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to inform the House that I have written to President Prodi, as I did on 14 August to ask for solidarity with the Germans, the Austrians and the Czechs, telling him that now that the oil slick has reached Galicia we have to remember that the Galicians are European citizens."
"I am not asking you to take four Commissioners, as you did when you went to Germany, to wade around in the mud, but I would ask you, Mr President of the Commission, to make a clear gesture of solidarity."
"Furthermore, bear in mind that you have important responsibilities which affect many areas."
"For example, it would be good if Commissioner Fischler, who is an inland person, could see that 60% of the world industrial production of turbot is in danger."
"With regard to the Commission's proposal on the Convention, I would say first of all that the Socialist Group, President Prodi, welcomes the fact that the Commission has done its duty as a driving force - although you have come to Parliament on foot ? and as guardian of the Treaties."
"You have presented, at an appropriate moment, a proposal which my group considers to be positive and which, furthermore, must contribute to making the work of the Convention more dynamic."
"We believe it is a good proposal."
"There are many aspects on which we are in complete agreement: the removal of the unanimity rule in the Council; the proposal of a democratic budget with the removal of obligatory expenditure and, with regard to the issue of revenue, I can tell you that my group has voted and the majority of us are in favour of a Community tax; the proposal for European lists for elections, a harmonised electoral process, promising positions on comitology."
"There are other proposals which we welcome as working proposals. One of them is that the President of the Commission should be elected by the European Parliament, something which I believe a large majority of this House advocates."
"We are not convinced that the unanimous approval of the European Council is required."
"I would point out that the European Council already voted in Corfu and since then votes for the President of the Commission by majority."
"Although in your case it was by acclamation."
"Similarly we approved the merger of the High Representative of the Council and the Vice-President of the Commission for External Affairs, and this may give us more strength."
"In any event, we have to take a decisive step towards a common foreign, security and defence policy."
"And now I will mention those proposals with which we clearly disagree."
"Firstly, we cannot accept the idea that the European Council can pass a vote of no confidence in the Commission."
"This would ruin the balance between the institutions."
"We must move on from co-decision to shared legislative power."
"To this end there must be a Legislative Council which is truly a second Chamber, that is, one that legislates in public and democratically, transparently and clearly."
"We must tackle the problem of the Council's combination of executive and legislative power."
"I would suggest that in this regard we incorporate the Trumpf and Solana proposals and the contents of the Poos report, which are very sensible."
"A final point, Mr President of the Commission, is that Parliament asked last month for a proposal to the Convention for a legal basis for the protection of pluralism in the European media."
"There is nothing of this sort in your proposal and I hope that the Convention will include it."
"Mr President, with regard to the Penelope document, I believe we must work like Penelope but in shifts."
"Certainly the Commission and Parliament will have to work by night to try to redo what others are going to undo by day."
"And I would remind you that the time for transactions, pacts and compromises is at the end, that is, at the end of the Convention."
"In the meantime, we will have to work shoulder to shoulder for the common Community cause."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, sometimes it is an advantage to be spokesman for the third group in Parliament because it has provided me with time to read the Commission's paper."
"I can, therefore, say with some authority that I strongly welcome it."
"It is a strong assertion of the Commission's orthodox function and it should shift the debate about where a power lies, centre stage inside the Convention."
"It represents a challenge to those Prime Ministers who prefer to opine on the fringes of the Convention but who seem far too frightened to contribute official proposals."
"As most of the items in the Commission's programme appear also in my draft for a federal Union it is clear that I shan't be your fiercest critic and, while I commend the firm rejection of an idea of a Super-President of the Council, I do have concerns and reservations about the proposal for an executive Presidency of the Council."
"I wonder if this would not lead to more of the inconsistency and the conflict with the Commission that we have at present."
"Surely it would be an improvement to follow the logic of what you propose for foreign and security policy, which is the virtual cloning of Mr Solana and Mr Patten, and to follow that practice in the other two areas where the Council enjoys executive authority."
"Why not let the Commissioner responsible chair the Council in its formations for economic policy and interior affairs?"
"Nevertheless, despite some reserves the Parliamentary delegation in the Convention will follow the principal lines of this proposal and I look forward to future close collaboration inside the Convention with Mr Barnier and Mr Vitorino."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, unlike my Liberal fellow-Member, I have not been able, in my capacity as spokesperson of the fourth group in this House, to read the Commission communication in the time available, as I have just discovered that it is 145 pages long, and I congratulate Mr Duff on his ability to speed-read this document!"
"Mr President, I would like to specifically mention that I welcome the fact that the Commission is at present making a substantial and constructive contribution to the Convention and has presented its views to us here at the appropriate time, because that guarantees that the Commission's contribution can be taken on board in the Convention's work."
"In January we will be starting work on the actual content of the constitutional treaty, and I am sure that the Commission's proposals will play an important part then."
"Mr President of the Commission, I am in agreement with the objectives you mentioned, because this is a matter of making the European Union more democratic, more efficient and more transparent."
"I specifically welcome the fact that you highlighted the dual nature of the European Union as a union of Member States and a union of peoples, and I think that it is indeed one of the Convention's jobs to make the European Union the first genuinely supranational democracy in the world, as you just called it."
"I would very briefly like to mention those points which, on the basis of what you have just said, I support."
"I have in mind the clear commitment to the Community method, your proposals for enhancing and strengthening the role of Parliament, and the extension of the codecision procedure to all legislative decisions."
"I support the proposal for the European Parliament to elect the President of the Commission in future, and I also agree with your rejection of the creation of a permanent President of the Council."
"I also support the proposals for law making that you have just mentioned."
"I would like to touch on a problem that you did not mention in your speech, and that is the issue of dividing the treaty into two parts."
"It is generally assumed that this is connected with the fact that the whole constitutional treaty is to be primary legislation."
"However, no one has explained yet how that justifies splitting the constitutional treaty into two parts, and the question naturally arises of the different procedures for reviewing points of law stipulated in these two parts of the treaty."
"That is why I would be interested to know, Mr President of the Commission, whether your proposal today provides for different review procedures in the constitutional treaty."
"I ask because one thing is clear: under German law it would not be feasible, for example to facilitate adjustments to the 'second part' of the constitutional treaty, that is to say if it emerged that the EU was in practice to be given a 'competence competence'."
"In other words, it must be clear that the second part of the treaty must also be subject to the ratification procedure by national parliaments in future, in which case, as I have already said, I would be interested to know what the Commission's line is on this."
"Mr President, it is a case of better late than never as far as the Commission is concerned!"
"There has been virtually no major stage in the history of European integration so far that did not begin with a vision on the part of the Commission, underpinned by a major plan and a White Paper."
"This constitutional process is in fact the first major step where the Commission has lagged cautiously behind and has, if anything, been reactive instead of leading the way."
"I nevertheless welcome what President Prodi has said."
"He has summarised the results of the Convention so far, and he has come down on the side of the angels on some contentious issues - by which, if I may be so bold, I mean on the side of the European Parliament - and in particular he has come down on the side of a Community Europe, and against an intergovernmental Europe, and he has presented a whole raft of intelligent proposals."
"I too have been unable to read this document as quickly as our friend Andrew Duff has, so I can only make a few limited comments."
"One thing needs to be said about this paper - it does not make any sparks fly!"
"It does not generate any great enthusiasm or paint any broad canvases."
"It does not attempt to involve the public, the citizens of Europe, in this mighty battle for power."
"It is a very cautious, perhaps technocratic and certainly intelligent, and sometimes even clever paper."
"Yes, you have come down in favour of the Community method, but in that case you should also have presented a bolder picture of European unity."
"There are major tasks and important horizons involved in this process of European integration, but you have not presented them here."
"The social dimension, which is may be the main issue on which the Convention will founder, scarcely gets a mention."
"The same applies to European democracy."
"This paper talks, for example, about a 'constitutional text' rather than about a constitution as such."
"Yes, you are in favour of scrapping the unanimity rule, but it is nevertheless to be retained when it comes to modifying Commission proposals."
"Unity and democracy are all very well, but being given power is a little more important."
"As regards the Charter of Fundamental Rights, I cannot find any reference here to access to the European Court of Justice, which rules on fundamental rights."
"The role of Parliament is to be enhanced, but the right of initiative remains exclusively that of the Commission."
"Parliament is to elect the President of the Commission, but the President is also to be accountable to the Council."
"And the responsibility of the Commission is far from clear, with the Commission being given greater scope for tactical manoeuvring, while the public is to gain relatively little."
"I do not want to allow this to become too much of a critique."
"This is a proposal that also makes the Commission Parliament's ally, but I would have liked to have seen more determination to tackle the really important tasks and to respond with a sense of vision, particularly as regards Europe's response to the dangers of globalisation, to the unprecedented intellectual and political challenge of developing a supranational democracy, of taking the separation of powers seriously, of taking the rejection of an intergovernmental Europe seriously, and of making the legislative process more open and giving the public access to all documentation."
"I hope that we can still persuade the Commission not to be merely cautious in making common cause with us, but also to be our ally as regards new horizons in European integration."
"President Prodi, we have listened attentively, of course, to your speech and have drawn some positive aspects from it as well as others with which we cannot agree."
"This is to be expected and is healthy in a democracy."
"What needs to be emphasised is that this is a significant contribution to the definition of the Europe of the future, which, alongside other contributions, will enable the Convention to continue its work to achieve a result which is based on consensus and which is politically realistic. This is the only way in which we can hope to wield some power and influence over the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference."
"In addition to various proposals and concrete solutions that we will be discussing in the Convention and which of course reflect the position of the Commission and its idea of increasing internal power within the existing institutional framework, the main conclusion we drew from your words was the concern to answer one key question."
"The fundamental issue that everyone, including the Commission, has to face is how to maintain an enlarged European Union's ability to pursue its fundamental aims of development and economic and social cohesion and freedom and security for the present and future citizens of its Member States."
"We must acknowledge that European integration is an increasingly complex process, not only as a consequence of its internal dynamic, which is a victim of the natural conflict between national sovereignties and the concept of consolidating a European sovereignty, but also because this is happening against an international backdrop that is increasingly subject to the consequences and dangers of globalisation, to the threats of terrorism, to violent conflicts more or less everywhere, to financial, environmental, and energy crises as well as unemployment, exclusion and poverty."
"Nevertheless, we must acknowledge that, in the Convention, all issues have been discussed openly, frankly and fairly."
"We cannot have closed issues and nor must obstacles be thrown in the way of the debate."
"The peoples of the current and future Member States demand and deserve this."
"We feel that confidence in the Convention is, in fact, growing, because, in addition to the now traditional Community institutions, it also encompasses national institutions, in other words, the governments and the parliaments of the Member States and of the candidate countries."
"Without wishing to state that there are two sides involved, not least because, as a result of circumstance, all parties have become mixed up together within the Convention, and rightly so, the fact is that this national component provides added value to the debate."
"I say this because, instead of there being one European public, we now have fifteen, soon to be twenty-five and later there will be even more national public opinions and it is to these that we should be addressing our words, because these have the ability to influence the direction Europe will take."
"Let us speak, however, in practical terms."
"What is at stake here?"
"In political terms, what is at stake is questioning, debating and defining 'things' as simple as the democratic legitimacy and the governability of the European Union; also at stake are the aims of the Union and its place in the world, the allocation and the definition of EU competences and their adaptation to the Community acquis, the simplification of the Union's instruments, its democracy, transparency and efficiency, the role of national parliaments, the efficiency of the decision-making process and the functioning of the institutions in an enlarged Union and the drafting or otherwise, of a European Constitution."
"Everything, then, is at stake and rightly so, because this is how debates should be undertaken."
"Consequently, the first question that we should ask is: what sort of Europe do we want to build?"
"To this end we need to define this European model in political terms."
"This task is the responsibility as well as the duty of everyone."
"The Commission has today once again performed this task and I could add that we have confidence - still - in the nations and, consequently, we believe in Europe."
"We trust in the Nation-State, and consequently believe in a Europe based on its nations having the freedom to take decisions which is underpinned by the States having equal legal status."
"We have confidence in the peoples of Europe and therefore believe in a Europe that means greater democracy and not the opposite, which is greater bureaucracy."
"We have confidence in diversity and we therefore believe in a Europe that respects the traditions of its Member States, preserves their cultural heritage and safeguards their respective languages."
"We have confidence in subsidiarity, and therefore believe in a Europe that does not seek to retain for itself decisions that could more advantageously be taken by the Member States."
"We have confidence in solidarity, and therefore believe in a Europe in which economic and social cohesion also results in the prosperity of the peoples and of all the remote and outermost regions without exception."
"We have confidence in peace, stability and security and therefore believe in a Europe that is united but not uniform, which can be mobilised by great causes, and which is governed by values and guided by principles."
"I shall conclude by saying that the obvious target of the Commission's contribution to the debate here is the Convention."
"The Convention is now entering the critical stage of its work, and so we hope that the proposals that it puts forward, which we would like to be politically realistic and consensual, fulfil their task of enabling the Heads of State and Government who are present at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to take the best decisions on behalf of the Member States and the peoples that they represent."
"This is, furthermore, our duty."
"Mr President, not unexpectedly, the Commission is proposing that it be given more power."
"The European Parliament and the EU's prime ministers are also agitating to be given more power."
"It is not difficult to foresee the compromise at the Rome Summit in December of next year."
"The prime ministers scarcely wish to relinquish foreign and security policy, so they will choose someone from the European Council to represent the EU to the outside world."
"They may, for example, get Tony Blair to become the EU's first president and then make Mr Aznar President of the next Commission."
"Instead of concerning itself with foreign and security policy, the Commission would be given power over the developed cooperation on juridico-political and police matters for which, of course, Mr Aznar has a special predilection."
"The Commission may also be given increased executive powers, and Mr Aznar's leadership become a proper government that stands accountable."
"Yes, but to whom?"
"It will scarcely be the European Parliament alone but, presumably, Mr Giscard d'Estaing's proposed Congress in which the national parliaments too may be taken hostage and find themselves with nothing but a congress of yes men, designed for applauding the prime ministers' election of commissioners by majority voting."
"In return, the European Parliament will see the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure abolished and so be given more power over expenditure. It will also see common decision-making extended to include more areas and so be given greater influence over legislation."
"The EU's prime ministers are being given more power and the Commission is being strengthened, as is the European Parliament."
"When all the supranational institutions are reinforced, someone must lose out, and it is the voters, who will no longer have the final word concerning legislation in quite a few areas."
"They are left with less democracy, every time that more supranational and undemocratic power is handed out in the EU."
"Mr President, the draft institutional reform that the Commission is today presenting to the Convention and to Parliament, and the essence of which at least was communicated to the press two days ago, is clearly breaking new ground in its proposals on the responsibility of the Commission before the Council."
"This 'innovation', however, serves as a pretext in all areas to increase the powers of the body, previously considered to be the sole guardian of Europe's general interest."
"That, however, is a biased approach."
"Let us take the case of the monopoly of initiative that the Commission is proposing to consolidate and to extend to the whole of what it calls the legislative domain."
"Why should 20 commissioners have a better understanding of Europe's general interest than all of the governments within the Council?"
"Admittedly, it is said that each government protects its national interest, but their debate makes it possible to go beyond that."
"The same applies to the market: each consumer protects his own selfish interest, but nevertheless, all their transactions set prices which provide the best general approach."
"The Commission, with its monopoly of initiative, therefore finds itself in the position of a planner who claims to know prices better than the market."
"In a world of openness, freedom and democracy, this is unacceptable."
"The monopoly of initiative, strengthened by the requirement for unanimity within the Council in order to dismiss the Commission's proposals and by extending the majority needed to accept them, distorts the entire European decision-making process and certainly contributes to the rift perceived between the Union and the citizens."
"In our opinion, we must reform it by taking an overview of the institutions."
"Either we open up the monopoly of initiative to other players such as the European Parliament and the national parliaments, which possess an undeniable democratic legitimacy, or we maintain it, but then, in return, we are making a right of veto official for each national parliament."
"In any case, it seemed that the recent debate within the Convention on the Commission's monopoly of initiative was drawn to a close even before it had started."
"Let us hope, Mr President, that the Commission's new document will have the unforeseen effect of re-launching the debate."
"Mr President, it seems to me that a document like this Commission communication, which carries the slogan 'peace, freedom and solidarity', is a good omen, and I believe that that slogan could be the slogan of the European Constitution."
"By the way, although I have read the text very quickly, I notice that the Commission is being a little timid and talks of a text of a constitutional nature."
"Let us talk of a Constitution."
"The skeleton presented by Parliament in the European Convention talks of a treaty which establishes a Constitution for Europe; let us talk happily about a Constitution, which is what it is going to be."
"I also believe, Mr Prodi, that what you have said here, what your communication seeks - efficiency, democracy and clarity - are good objectives."
"I believe that for these to be at the forefront of our considerations is a good thing."
"So is the idea of double legitimacy, although I believe we must give this some careful thought."
"The European Union is traditionally a union of States and of peoples, and I believe we must begin to talk about a union of States and citizens, because 'peoples' is a concept from the 1950s."
"In Maastricht we introduced the concept of European citizenship, and we must therefore begin to talk about European citizens as subjects of the European Union."
"Therefore, a union of States and citizens."
"My group's spokesman, Mr Poettering, has defended something which this Parliament has always had as a first priority, and here we are in agreement with you, which is the defence of the Community method."
"If we were to make an analysis of the last fifty years of European construction, it seems to me that the most important thing is this Community method and we will therefore be with you."
"The Community method, however, also means something which I learned many years ago from a person who I admired, Émile Noel, which is institutional balance."
"Ours is a Community system, which is difficult to explain outside these four walls; and it is a system in which the balance between institutions surely does not correspond to the usual notion of the separation of powers which we know in our own Member States."
"I know that in the Convention - and this is a good thing - we are following the formula of George Washington, who said for Philadelphia that the Convention can debate everything and propose everything."
"Therefore, the debate is an open one."
"If you will allow me to use the expression, there is a 'free bar' in terms of considering constitutional models."
"But I believe that on this issue, and of course I must read what the Commission is proposing carefully, we must be prudent, because if we interfere with constitutional mechanisms, we may find that there are surprises in store."
"I believe we must consider whether it is in the Commission's interest to be elected by the European Parliament and to be able to be dissolved by the Council."
"Because the important thing for the Commission is to be independent and autonomous, and I believe that to establish more links with other institutions could eventually make a Commission which should be independent into a partisan Commission."
"I therefore believe we should give this some consideration."
"In any event, Mr Prodi, I believe that this is a good document."
"You have done what you had to do and we are going to debate it in the Convention."
"On the other hand, let me tell you something which I did not like, which is the famous Penelope text which you mentioned earlier."
"My friend, Mr Barón, spoke about Penelope, the wife of Ulysses."
"There was a song made famous by Serrat in Spain which was also called Penelope, about a woman who is waiting on a platform for a train and ends up going mad."
"I believe that by bringing out this text at the same as your declaration, you have not done yourselves a political favour."
"Today everybody is talking about this Penelope project and nobody is talking about the good document you have presented."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, we have been calling for a Commission proposal to solve the institutional problems that exist. It is at long last before us, and we welcome that."
"Your paper makes a further interesting and important contribution to the work of the Convention, but it does not provide a total solution for all institutional problems."
"It does cast some light on the Commission's position regarding a whole raft of issues. For example, majority voting in the Council as a general rule, which we welcome."
"Majority voting by Parliament on legislation as a general rule, which we also welcome. Bringing justice and home affairs within the Community framework, which is also good, and the creation of a Secretary of the Union for foreign affairs as Vice-President of the Commission with a special relationship with the Council, that is fine, and it represents a workable compromise as a means of solving a difficult problem."
"And there is much more besides."
"I can see many positive points in your proposals."
"However, in some areas, Mr Prodi, your proposals do not make things clearer - they just create greater confusion."
"Let me pick out one of them in particular."
"This is the issue of the appointment and political responsibility of the Commission."
"You are suggesting that the European Parliament should elect the President of the Commission."
"That is a good proposal, and a much-needed step forward."
"But at the same time you say that this President of the Commission must be elected by a two-thirds majority of the European Parliament, which prevents the results of the European elections from being reflected in a decision regarding an appointment at European Union level."
"In other words it prevents something from happening that is precisely what you want: it prevents voters from deciding who they want as Commission President for the next five years."
"This means building in a permanent compromise, rather like the permanent grand coalition in Austria."
"We cannot and we will not go along with that!"
"The second issue is that the European Council is to confirm the election of the President of the Commission by the European Parliament."
"How is that to happen?"
"By a majority or unanimously?"
"What do you have in mind?"
"And if the Council does not confirm the President, what then?"
"Does Parliament have the right to dissolve the Council?"
"That is what I would suggest."
"Your proposals do not include any mechanisms for resolving conflicts."
"Ultimately, and this really takes the biscuit, the Commission is accountable to both Parliament and the Council."
"So how will that work out in practice?"
"Will you resign every time?"
"If Parliament says that it has confidence in you, will you stay, and if the Council says you must resign, will you resign?"
"What sort of message does that send about building the institutions of the European Union?"
"It is simply a recipe for confusion!"
"Mr President of the Commission, your proposal in this respect creates more problems than it solves, and the European Parliament regards what you want to tell us is a step forward as actually being two steps back!"
"Mr President, today, on behalf of the European Commission, President Prodi set out a position of great political and institutional importance."
"Adhering to Jean Monnet's vision and the Community method, the Commission is today reinvigorating its ambitious and forward-looking role in European integration with a blueprint that meets our expectations."
"I would like to focus on three issues: firstly, Europe has to become a global political power."
"The new position of Secretary of the Union for Foreign Affairs would represent a strong Europe, able to set out its position in international bodies through a single representative."
"Mr President, you are aware of my personal desire to see faster work and a substantial increase in the quality of our capabilities in the area of defence."
"I am saying this as a friend of the United States: the world will be a better place if it contains a strong Europe, capable of acting on the strength of its values."
"Secondly, the Commission has to become the sole repository of executive power, reinforced in its role as the expression of the common interest of the Union; in other words, we must move towards a genuine Union government, elected by the democratic representatives of European citizens and accountable to the institutions which represent the citizens and the States."
"Other institutional figures, lacking a clearly defined role and which would undermine the unity of representation abroad, must not interfere with the government of the Union."
"Thirdly, Europe must become more effective and coherent, capable of vigorously rebutting the attacks launched by eurosceptic groupings which, in my country too, use Europe as a scapegoat for domestic failures."
"In short, to create a partnership between Europe and its citizens, we need to simplify our procedures and make them more transparent by making codecision the rule, reducing the number of legislative instruments, abolishing unanimous voting and reforming the way the Union is financed."
"I would add that we must strive to combat corruption and promote the pluralism of information."
"Mr President, only if we proceed on this basis will we be able to conclude this process, at the end of 2003, with a Constitution and a second, high quality, credible Treaty of Rome."
"Mr President, in the position he adopted on this issue, Mr Prodi was a strong advocate of the Community method, which is the federation method."
"He also represented opportunism on a large scale."
"If you swear by the Community method you are not supposed to suggest that the Council has a right to dismiss the Commission."
"To use President Prodi's own language, the proposal is stupid - stupide."
"The Commissioners are a collection of civil servants who do not need to inspire parliamentary confidence."
"If there are abuses they must be penalised just like other civil servants."
"The Commission wants to increase its power at the expense of political decision-makers."
"It was unclear as to whether the earlier proposal to grant the Commissioners unequal status is to remain in force."
"If it is, it means the EU would have its own 'Politburo', consisting, one assumes, of representatives of the big countries."
"From the point of view of the small countries, that is not democracy."
"The Commission's demand to withdraw the system of consensual decision-making, or Member States' right of veto, is an attack on the Member States."
"The right of veto is the last defence against supranational, unequal systems of decision-making under the Community method."
"Those representing the Commission in the Convention's working group have been militarising the Union and creating a new European legal area in which there would be Euro-law and Euro-order."
"The Commission is calling for the common foreign and security policy to come under its control, with competence to be transferred from the Member States to the Commission."
"We must not allow the last vestiges of Member State independence to be crushed."
"The Commission had and still has support here for its proposal from the European federalists, whose aim it is to erode the independence of Member States and turn the EU into a federation."
"There is already a federal currency."
"The federal army will commence operations next year."
"Federal law and order are being got ready."
"The federalists are over-represented in the Convention on the constitution of the EU."
"Member States should not approve draft proposals for a federation drawn up by the Commission or the Convention simply as they are."
"We must not make compromises over the Commission's status as a body of civil servants as opposed to a political government."
"Mr Prodi, power wielded by the Commission is not democracy."
"You are a servant, who has now adopted a position on matters that are the business of your masters."
"Mr President, in reply to Mr Seppänen's point, I do not know many civil services in the world which are appointed only after a hearing by the Parliament and have to acquire the confidence of the Parliament to take office or which are dismissible as a college by Parliament."
"That is one of the important features of the situation as it obtains at the moment."
"As Mr Prodi has said, what we are looking for is a supranational democracy in Europe and that will be, in important ways, a democracy sui generis, not exactly like that of any pre-existing state or society."
"I welcome a lot of what he has said today about the way the Commission should take office and hold office."
"This is an attempt to retain the kind of balance between the three institutions which ought to characterise Europe and which does not at the moment in anything like the same way characterise many of our Member States, where the government has become the controller of the legislature of the parliament rather than the other way around."
"That is a good feature of his proposals."
"Although Mr Hänsch has pointed very accurately to some difficulties and potential contradictions that will mean that these proposals have to be more fully thought through to deal with the question, what about the risks of deadlock in the system which you are suggesting?"
"Another point that picks up what Mr Poettering said and which nobody else has spoken of is that a European democracy must be a democracy at many levels."
"One of the great disappointments of the Convention so far has been the tiny attention it has given to those levels of democracy which exist within and below the level of the Member State."
"If we do not take account, adequately and properly, of substantial constitutional regions with legislative powers - the internal nations of the Member States - then this Union will not work as a successful democracy."
"Mr Napoletano has prepared a report today to the Constitutional Affairs Committee of this Parliament."
"We have amended it in committee and we believe that we have strengthened it."
"He is not fully happy with all that we have reached there but I hope that the Commission and the Convention are going to listen to this because if they do not also attend to this vital level of democracy in Europe all will fail."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the President of the Commission has today presented the Commission's draft Constitution, or rather, I would say, his draft Constitution."
"He himself and other Members have mentioned the name of Jean Monnet."
"Now, I believe that there is a fundamental difference between Jean Monnet's work and the proposal before us today."
"In my view, Jean Monnet always endeavoured to focus on the essentials and to achieve the - albeit modest, sometimes even miniscule - goals he set, and, in 40 years, many of his proposals have genuinely been brought to fruition."
"Now, with regard to this proposal, over and above the acclaim it will certainly receive in the media and its success throughout most of this House, I genuinely wonder, without wanting to be antagonistic, how many of these proposals will actually be carried through, as would have happened when Jean Monnet was at the helm."
"There are some differences between the two cases, I feel."
"Why do I say that?"
"Of course, it is lovely to be able to say 'What good proposals the Commission is putting forward on many points, with codecision for these matters, a different procedures for others ...' but, clearly, all this must actually work in practice, and I therefore wonder whether the present Commission, the Prodi Commission, as opposed to the Commissions which preceded it and contributed to Maastricht, the Single Act and so on, will have the same ability to succeed."
"We will see in the coming days. I wish President Prodi and his proposals every success, although, frankly, Mr Prodi, I want to make it clear that what concerns me, what concerns us, the Radical Members, what I personally consider to be the Achilles' heel of this proposal and would alone weaken it considerably, is the question of the President being elected by two thirds of the Members of the House."
"That means that all it would take is for the Mr Poetterings and the Mr Barón Crespos of the future to meet in private and ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my very sincere thanks for the initiative the Commission has taken in this constitutional process with the paper before us today."
"I particularly appreciate the fact that in the key areas the Community method has been adopted as the guiding principle."
"The issues of the decision-making process, codecision and the extension of qualified majority voting, and the replacement of the Council decision-making process stemming from the Treaty of Nice by the simple dual majority are essential approaches that could lead to improvement."
"As I only have limited speaking time, I would like to follow up these initial comments with some critical observations concerning the Commission's attempt to have itself legitimated by both Parliament and the Council."
"I see this as running counter to Montesquieu's division of powers."
"It creates a confusion of executive and legislative roles, a muddle that is really the opposite of transparency and accountability."
"It would lead to a marked weakening of Parliament's role, as up to now the Commission has been accountable to Parliament alone, and Parliament alone has been able to dismiss the Commission."
"The question of accountability remains."
"The right to dismiss the Commission by a two-thirds majority also remains, but now we are also supposed to elect the President of the Commission by a two-thirds majority!"
"That is a total repudiation of the role of this House - the European Parliament is being emasculated!"
"I regard this as a very difficult situation."
"I do not know if the Commission will get what it is looking for here, because once it has the same relationship with the Council as it has with Parliament in all these areas, the natural alliance between Parliament and the Commission will cease to exist."
"That means that we will be losing something without gaining anything, because Parliament in its day-to-day technical work will have to take up the cudgels with both institutions, with the Commission and the Council alike, whereas up to now the Commission and Parliament have been in agreement."
"It is worth considering the fact that the role of the EU Secretary for foreign affairs, which is viewed positively in the paper, will of course appear in a very different, and rather negative, light in this institutional context."
"The point is that this will also have another consequence: the European Council has the power to remove the Commission from office, yet the Commission President is a member of the Council."
"It does not seem the right approach to me to allow the Commission President alone not to take part in such a discussion about possible dismissal."
"If the European Council is to have an almost parliamentary right of control over the Commission, then the President of the Commission should not be a member of the European Council."
"That follows as night follows day: he can in no way be a member of the European Council, because how can a body have a right of control and hold someone to account if that person is a member of that body himself?"
"I think that does not seem to work at all."
"I would therefore urge the Commission to reconsider this very carefully, especially as it is extraordinarily weak on such a key issue."
"The key issue facing the Convention is whether the Council, in its role as legislator, is a legislative Council, with a second chamber that meets in public."
"The Commission's response to that is that this proposal should be examined."
"That is all it says!"
"I would have expected the Commission to formulate a clear position on that point."
"The fact that it leaves the issue of the legislative Council so unclear and presents the relationship between the European Council and the Commission in such a way seems to point to a weakening both of the rights of Parliament and of transparency in general."
"That is why I regard this proposal on such a vital issue as being highly questionable."
"Mr President, I shall be listening with interest to Mr Prodi's response following the comments of Mr Hänsch and Mr Brok, who are very much in agreement on this point."
"The struggles for power and for the social face of Europe have now really broken out."
"There is of course a battle between large and small, between technocrats and democrats, between results-orientation and bureaucracy, and everything revolves around the question of who is going to be pulling the strings in the Europe of tomorrow."
"And with more power for the European Council, as some want, we will of course be breaking the balance between the institutions."
"That means the triumph of the back-room politics of the big countries, and this will have a paralysing effect."
"Just look at migration policy - fewer results, less democracy."
"We can also vote for democracy, however, for a Europe that its citizens can understand - in other words, the Community method, in which the Commission is the elected European government and the premier is chosen by Parliament, the direct representatives of European citizens."
"This is the best guarantee for small and medium-sized Member States such as the Netherlands that their interests count too. At the same time we can make effective European policy."
"Consider migration and in particular the Vitorino proposals."
"Result: democracy and citizens over against this continent's Sun Kings."
"Aux armes democratiques, President Prodi."
"And at the same time, the struggle over the choice of whether or not we have a social Europe."
"Conservative, free-market thinking Europe, even here in the European Parliament, refuses to anchor the European social model as a task in the European constitution."
"And it is precisely on this that citizens, social organisations and we as social democrats want to do battle, because it goes to the heart of the matter."
"Are we going to choose a Europe as social protection for our citizens or are we going for the Europe of the free market, which is powerless in the face of globalisation, in which citizens feel alienated and at times of mass redundancies are regarded as disposable items?"
"Once again President Prodi: aux armes democratiques, Commission et citoyens."
"Convention, seize your opportunity!"
"Mr President, the Commission's major contribution to the work of the Convention can only encourage those who believe that Europe needs a Constitutional Treaty before the reunification stage starts."
"The new constitutional engineering work can only be based on in-depth, responsible dialogue between the representatives of the European and national institutions."
"The Convention will therefore increasingly have to become a forum not for thrashing out different positions but for finding the best compromise, a compromise which confirms the two forms of legitimacy in Europe - the Community and the intergovernmental."
"The new Europe, founded on the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity, must be politically strong and have economic credibility."
"To this end, we need to give it a single voice in foreign policy."
"It must be a Europe with a small number of effective, well-defined competences, including, in addition to foreign policy, defence, security, immigration control, the single market and the management of the economy."
"It must be a federation of nation States but not an interfering Superstate. It must be an institution with a stable balance of the powers of the three institutions: Parliament, Council and Commission."
"Of course, the principle of the six-monthly rotation of the Presidency of the Union will have to be changed."
"The Commission's proposal, outlined yesterday in Le Monde and today in this House, is reminiscent of the French model, with the Commission in the role of Mr Raffarin and the Council in the role of Mr Chirac."
"I wonder whether it might be possible to achieve a compromise whereby there would be a single Commission and Council President, who would be put forward by the Council and elected by two-thirds majority vote in Parliament."
"One last point. The Europe we are building cannot afford to lose its Judaeo-Christian roots, which are the guarantee of the secularity of the institution."
"If, in the future, we were to attempt to build a Union without taking into account our history, that would be tantamount to building a castle with no foundations."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the fact that the Members are coming into the Chamber for voting time while the debate is still in progress means that it will be difficult for the speakers who have yet to speak and President Prodi to make themselves heard."
"I would ask you all to cooperate and to concentrate on the debate until the start of voting time."
"President of the Commission, thank you for your contribution to the work of the Convention."
"We are also looking forward to the end of this never-ending task because I believe that, with everyone adopting a position, with everyone drafting their own Constitution, it is fortunate that some members of the Commission are concerning themselves with this common task and are making their contribution."
"Thank you too for your proposals regarding the appointment of your successors and of the Commission's three-stage appointment procedure."
"We feel it is worthwhile and relevant."
"I have a question to ask, however."
"I understand that you are in a negotiating position, but it seems to me that, when we speak of preserving the Community method, and this is obviously what the Commission desires, this method is based on the role of the three points of a triangle, with a necessary balance."
"From that point of view, I must admit that your proposal to satisfy the desire of the Heads of State and Government and their ministers to strengthen and go beyond the rotating Council presidency will be badly handled and will be viewed as a weak point of your contribution."
"Consequently, the positions that you adopt regarding the Secretary of the Union will be regarded enthusiastically and be reproduced in other sectors."
"From this point of view, the idea that the Secretary of the Union would not chair the Council responsible for these issues seems to me to be a weak point."
"You say that the president of the Council could not seek compromise at the same time as making proposals."
"We all know many assemblies where these two roles are carried out by the same person."
"I therefore believe that this is a point that we should examine in greater depth and I think that, in the area of external representation of the euro zone, these proposals could be reproduced."
"Mr President, I thank you for calling our fellow Members to order."
"What you need is a loud speaker so as to be able to broadcast this message to those outside the Chamber, as it is those who are coming back in who are disturbing our work."
"Thank you, Mrs Berès, for that valuable suggestion."
"Maybe the Members who are listening to me could ask the Members entering the Chamber to do so in silence and in an orderly fashion in order to allow the speakers to make themselves heard."
"Mr President, Mr Prodi can indeed understand me, because I am sitting right beside him, so we can communicate fairly easily."
"I wanted to start by complimenting the Commission President on the excellent document that has been presented."
"I am also pleased that this document is so very much in keeping with Parliament's position and that it is also so much in tune with the Benelux Memorandum that has just come out."
"First of all I am pleased that Mr Prodi does not favour a President of the European Union as Mr Giscard d'Estaing has proposed."
"We mainly see the President of the European Union in the role of President of the Commission."
"These two positions must coincide as far as possible."
"If there is to be a President of the European Union, then it must be the President of the Commission."
"What seems a good idea to us, or at least what seems a good idea to me, is that the future Commission will certainly have three, if not four Vice-Presidents."
"For example, one for foreign policy, that could be Mr Solana's role."
"One for internal security, Mr Vitorino's range of responsibilities."
"One for socio-economic affairs and one for the more technical Commissioners."
"If you divide the work up in this way, then the President of the Commission will have rather more freedom to take on these presidential duties."
"We are also very pleased with the emphasis on the Community method and that there are proposals for legislative simplification."
"There are good proposals for this in the Convention, that go a little further than what the Commission has proposed."
"We think that in the future there should really only be talk of regulations, of directives, of decisions and of the implementing legislation and that will be enough."
"And that as far as possible everything must be done by way of codecision."
"Finally, we are also pleased that the Commission has not put forward the absurd idea of a Congress."
"We think this Congress a bad idea."
"What we do think important is that there should be greater involvement of citizens and that greater transparency should make citizens better aware of what is happening in the European Union."
"This is what the Commission is proposing."
"Consequently, Mr Prodi, you have our full support."
"President Prodi, I agree with what Mrs Maij-Weggen said just now."
"The communication you have presented to us is extremely interesting and is broadly compatible with the positions of the European Parliament."
"However, there is no clear proposal on one fundamental point, namely the integration of the Charter of Fundamental Rights - its integration, not the inclusion of a reference to it - for there is no modern Constitution which does not enshrine human rights."
"I hope that the Commission will not go against the development of modern constitutional practice and take the line that Europe should have a short Constitution with human rights hidden away in an Annex."
"I welcome the proposal to generalise the Community method, codecision and majority voting."
"I welcome the idea of a single spokesman for foreign policy, who is part of the Commission but is personally accountable to the Council too."
"There are many other points which need to be clarified and discussed but we agree that we should not create new, unnecessary institutions and that the decision-making power of the Eurogroup and the Union's financial system should be strengthened."
"Lastly, we welcome the fact that a proper distinction is made between those who make laws and those who implement them: Montesquieu has come to the European Union at last."
"I hope that the Union's future Constitution will be that of a supranational democracy, as called for by the European Parliament, the Commission and the majority of the citizens, and that a way will be found to avoid a few eurosceptics preventing the countries that wish to move forward from doing so."
"Mr President, I do not think it is yet entirely clear how long what the Commission has proposed actually is."
"I have read a document running to 23 pages."
"Mrs Kaufmann thought just now that there were more than a hundred, so I do not know how things are precisely, but those 23 pages are very interesting."
"They contain relatively little on socio-economic issues, and, as for what they do contain, I do rather wonder whether we might agree with it."
"I would just like to say a word about open coordination."
"This is a particularly thorny problem in the Treaty at the moment and it is actually poorly provided for."
"And what does the Commission say?"
"It says that it must be decided by the Council, having been prepared by the Commission, and then in brackets we have 'where appropriate after consulting the European Parliament'."
"This is of course quite impossible."
"If the Commission wants to crush open coordination at some time, then I think this is how they must do it."
"One of the three institutions on which this Community is based cannot simply be disregarded in this way on such an important issue."
"That is the principal message."
"The second message is that in general the social element in the Convention has so far had rather too little attention paid to it."
"It is very fortunate that a working group has now been set up with particular concern for the social issue."
"I think it is possible for the major parties in particular to reach agreement on this, based on the experiences we have acquired in the European social model; it is possible, but we must be careful."
"There is one major difference between the two parties, the PPE-DE on the one hand and the socialists on the other, and this difference is where you start."
"Do you start with the economic or do you start with the social?"
"This is important if we are to bring this to a successful conclusion."
"Mr President, I welcome the Commission's intention to make the EU the first supranational democracy in the world."
"That is a fantastic project, and people understand it and support it."
"In any democracy, the government is elected by parliament, and that is why I also welcome the proposal that here in the EU the Commission and its President should at last be elected by this House and not by the European Council."
"The present approach is really topsy-turvy, and I think that we need to reinstate Montesquieu's principles."
"So I congratulate you on having managed to get there."
"This is a really important point, and one where Parliament and the Commission can now pull in the same direction."
"I would also like to congratulate you on clearly advocating that there should be just one executive and not two."
"There cannot be an elected President of the European Council alongside the elected President of the Commission."
"We do not want the institutions to be renationalised, what we need is to apply the Community method, and in this paper the Commission and Parliament are on the same track."
"We must get that through in the Convention!"
"Mr President, I will be very brief, not least because we are behind schedule and the European Parliament needs to continue its work with all speed."
"I will just make a few brief points, the first of which is addressed to Mr Barón Crespo."
"We have been looking into the problems in Galicia very carefully and are continuing to do so."
"Commissioner de Palacio has already visited the area, Commissioner Wallström is going there tomorrow and Commissioner Fischler has already recommended the measures that should be taken. Most importantly, we are summoning and coordinating all our resources so as to be able to take the broadest, most cohesive action possible."
"We can confirm that, in our opinion, this incident could and should have been avoided."
"We must therefore address this matter as thoroughly as possible because, if similar incidents occur in the future, it will be our responsibility."
"The Commission has already put pressure on the Member States to limit the circulation of obsolete vessels, and we will continue to work on that."
"A few very brief comments."
"I would like, first of all, to thank you for your enthusiastic support for our proposals, for your enthusiastic support for the Community method and for your understanding of the very simple fact that this is not a final proposal - it is neither the Commission's initial nor its final proposal - it is a major step forward which will allow us to discuss the issues together."
"The points on which there is dissent are extremely important points which we will have to discuss."
"As regards what Mr Brok said, for instance regarding the issue of the Commission being accountable to both the Council and Parliament, this is an area we need to explore, but we believe that it is fully in line with what he called the Montesquieu rule, although it is true that, should the Council have to adopt measures affecting the Commission, in that case, the President of the Commission would not be part of the Council and the confusion described by Mr Brok would be avoided."
"There is, moreover, a common concept underlying these proposals, and it is the concept of countries and peoples: we have taken a coherent, fully cohesive approach in this regard."
"In this respect, we often find that we are in almost complete harmony with the Benelux document - not that we developed this approach together, we just seem to have the same perspective on these issues, the same belief that this is a union of nations and peoples, or, as Mr Méndez de Vigo rightly says, of citizens, and that is the approach we are pursuing."
"I will not go into specific points because I know you are pushed for time."
"I would just stress one essential point: the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"I can confirm that the Commission intends to propose that the Charter be integrated into the future Constitution."
"Indeed, we have already proposed this in the feasibility study I commissioned, and we demonstrated that it is entirely feasible."
"As regards this feasibility study, I would stress that it is just a technical working document: it was not submitted for the Commission's approval and it was not discussed."
"It is a feasibility study which is an extremely useful working document."
"To avoid it being confused with the document we have proposed and endorsed in the Commission, I will not distribute it at the Convention today either: it will be posted on the Internet immediately afterwards, like all the working documents we have used during this phase."
"I assure you that this is a working document, nothing more, nothing less: just a working document."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, President Prodi."
"I feel this has been an important opportunity to develop the debate on the future of Europe."
"The next item is the vote."
"Report (A5-0411/2002) by Carlos Westendorp y Cabeza, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council Decision on providing further supplementary-financial assistance to Moldova (COM(2002) 538 - C5-0484/2002 - 2002/0236(CNS))"
"(Parliament adopted the text)"
"After the vote:"
"Mr President, I would like to propose some amendments to the Minutes."
"On page 26, paragraph 11, concerning the statute for Members of the European Parliament, the PPE-DE's motion for a resolution of 14 November is not shown, although I have the electronic record of transmission here, and the two compromise amendments tabled by both the small groups and the two larger groups are not mentioned either."
"Could that please be corrected?"
"Mr President, this has been voted on and I have no problem with that, but I had asked for the floor."
"With regard to Amendments Nos 35, 36 and 37, you have said that they have been withdrawn, which is correct, but I have not understood what has happened about the admissibility of Amendments Nos 4 and 17."
"Are these amendments going to be voted on or not?"
"Amendments Nos 4 and 17 are not going to be voted on because the President has ruled them inadmissible."
"In his view they belong more in the explanatory statement than in the legislative text."
"Mr President, I would like to tell you that yesterday I had contacts with the competent service and with members of the Office of the President and we had reached the conclusion that we were not agreed on whether they were admissible."
"I have here a letter from the President saying that Amendments Nos 4 and 17 have been deemed inadmissible."
". (ES) What the services have told us is that they were admissible and that they would be voted on."
"And I wish to say this, in any event, because the services of Parliament in committee accepted both amendments, we voted for both amendments, we approved them, they have been passed on to the plenum and now it turns out they are amendments to the content of the report."
"They are amendments with legislative content and there was no reason not to admit them, and I would like it to be noted that I am making a formal protest."
"I take note of your formal protest but the amendments remain inadmissible."
"After the block vote on the committee amendments:"
"Mr President, I know you are in a hurry because we must follow our timetable, but we are reforming the common fisheries policy and we have been waiting 20 years for this reform."
"Although you are an able President, who presides very well and with great skill, I would ask you for some restraint so that the Members may know what we are voting for."
"I would be truly grateful."
"Mr President, you told me that Amendment No 4 was inadmissible and then it has been voted on because an agreement had been reached."
"In the case of Amendment No 17, our agreement is even greater since it is within the legislative text: it relates to Article 4."
"The Commission is trying to realise its proposal, which is to withdraw an article, and we have voted to include that article."
"This article should be voted on."
"Let me read out what the President ruled."
"He deemed Amendment No 4 inadmissible in its present form."
"If the rapporteur agrees to modify it by deleting the reference to the current Commission proposal - a reference which would not be relevant once the legal instrument is adopted - then Amendment No 4 would be acceptable."
"This is what we did."
"The only thing the President says in his letter about Amendment No 17 is 'I declare this amendment inadmissible'."
"He is not saying that in any modified form it could be accepted ..."
"Rapporteur, I owe you an apology."
"I have just been told there is a typographical error."
"The President meant to say that he now declares this amendment admissible."
"I apologise."
"Okay, I resign!"
"(Laughter)"
"Mr President, I do not want this to be a dispute between a Galician and a Scotsman, nor between two Europeans."
"I am rapporteur for these reports, I am a professional lawyer and I am producing a legal and political report."
"I have been in contact with the services and they have told us that this amendment is admissible."
"Therefore, all I ask is that the vote be taken a little more slowly, please."
"Nothing more."
"You are absolutely right and I apologise again."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"The vote was suspended at 11.40 a.m. for the formal sitting"
"."
"(ES) Mr President, fisheries are only the subject of discussion in Parliament once every twenty years."
"We are reforming fisheries policy and today Parliament has adopted two very important reports, and I would like to express my gratitude to all the Members who supported me in this task."
"I do so, Mr President, as a Galician in particular, because Galicia is currently experiencing a great tragedy."
"I shall end by saying that I would like Mr Fischler to be present at this historic moment and he is not here."
"I would, however, like the Commissioner to kindly pass on the following: his colleague, Mr Barnier, told him in writing that his reform had neither legal nor moral basis and today, Parliament has taken away the political and budgetary basis and rejected the report."
"Mr President, I would like to move, on behalf my group, in accordance with Rule 37(4) of the Rules of Procedure, that this House should decide whether the joint motion for a resolution tabled by the PPE-DE and PSE groups should be put to the vote before the other resolutions."
"My justification for this is as follows. On 14 November we submitted a motion for a resolution to the administration."
"I have here the electronic record confirming its transmission."
"Therefore our original motion has priority."
"In accordance with Rule 37(4) of the Rules of Procedure, a subsequently tabled joint motion for a resolution replaces the original motion."
"That means that the subsequently tabled joint motion is regarded as that submitted first and should be put to the vote first."
"In the event that the House does not follow this procedure, I wish to ask the President to pronounce that the amendments tabled by the Liberals, the Greens and the Communists are inadmissible in accordance with Article 140(4) of the Rules of Procedure, which stipulates that only amendments that have not already been tabled once may be tabled."
"As the content of the joint motion for a resolution tabled by these groups is exactly the same as those amendments, only one of the two can be admissible."
"It does not make sense for us to follow the voting list, because we would then have to vote on the same content twice."
"That is contrary to both the spirit and the letter of the Rules of Procedure."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I would specifically like to support this proposal on behalf of my group."
"There is every justification for proceeding in this way."
"We amended the Minutes this morning, so that this House's Minutes now say that the PPE-DE Group's motion was tabled first."
"I would, however, urge you, Mr President, to let this House decide."
"Mr President, I believe that we are currently playing a game of cat and mouse in this Chamber which is atrocious, utterly atrocious for democracy!"
"Everyone knows that as soon as ?"
"Listen, and speak afterwards."
"I know that it is sometimes difficult to listen, when you believe you are the strongest, but the strongest has not always proved to be the most intelligent."
"Intelligence does not come automatically purely by virtue of size."
"(Applause)"
"No, and you too, Mr Schulz, please calm down, ?"
"The requests before us are clear."
"I see no point in extending the debate."
"I looked into the chronological order in which resolutions were received."
"My decision with regard to the order in which we should vote is based only and wholly on the chronological order and the precedents that surround that."
"I am now informed that the chronological order indicates that we will vote on the joint resolution tabled by the three groups first."
"(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution)"
"Motion for a resolution (B5-0620/2002) tabled by Diana Wallis and Astrid Thors on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the Statute for Members"
"(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution)"
"Motion for a resolution (B5-0621/2002) tabled by Heidi Anneli Hautala and others on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the Statute for Members"
"(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution)"
"Motion for a resolution (B5-0622/2002) tabled by Francis Wurtz on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the Statute for Members of the European Parliament"
"(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution)"
"Joint motion for a resolution"
"Mr President, we need to change this amendment so that it better reflects the realities of the Treaty of Nice."
"I would ask that the last two words be deleted and that you accept that as an oral amendment."
"Mr President, I do not wish to reopen a debate which this Parliament has already had but you were elected on a programme for reform of this House."
"Powerful elements in the two major groups have blocked that reform and I hope, Mr President, that the Council and the Commission, represented here today, will see the strength of feeling in this House in favour of such reform, greater than it has ever been, and will take that into account."
"Mr President, you thought you were right to follow the procedure you adopted."
"On behalf of my group, I would like to say that we did not agree with your decision, but I do not want to dwell on that."
"I asked to speak because Mr Watson did."
"However, I certainly cannot accept that anyone - be it a member of my own group or one of the other groups - should take the moral high ground and accuse others of having unworthy intentions!"
"(Loud, prolonged applause, heckling)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reaction in this Chamber, the enormous support for what I have just said, is enough."
"I do not need to add anything else!"
"Mr President, my group respects the other groups."
"It is up to the Liberal Group to solve its own internal problems, but I put a question to the Council asking it to show its willingness to hold a dialogue and the Council did so."
"After the vote, I think we should all join forces, and I am addressing Mr Watson in particular, whom I ask, on behalf of my group, to stop his policy of aggression and unjustified slander of the other political groups and specific nationalities in Parliament."
"Now is a time for unity and implementing the Rules of Procedure."
"Thank you."
"I do not want to take any more contributions. I want to make one brief comment."
"We have adopted a resolution today. The resolution gives what I would call an indicative status to the opinion that Mr Rothley has brought to the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"As rapporteur, Mr Rothley said yesterday that he hopes in the course of next year - perhaps by March 2003 - to move it from indicative to definitive."
"In that interim period I intend to work with the rapporteur to see to what extent we can try to mobilise a majority in this House in dialogue with the other institutions to bring closure to this issue in a manner which gives us a satisfactory outcome and a dignified result."
"Report (A5-0397/2002) by Patsy Sörensen, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on a proposal for a Council directive on the short-term residence permit issued to victims of action to facilitate illegal immigration or trafficking in human beings who cooperate with the competent authorities (COM(2002) 0071 - C5-0085/2002 - 2002/0043(CNS))"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Joint motion for a resolution"
". (IT) I would like to draw attention to the need for the Community legislation on PDO and PGI products to be revised."
"Although good, the Fruteau report, on which we are about to vote and which we will support, does not contain major amendments proposed and justified by a number of Italian Members in the Parliamentary Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the Parliamentary Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"In the case in point, major amendments have not been included on the possibility of registering PDOs and PGIs in Brussels when products have already been registered which, for a different reason - as in the case of a plant variety - are designated by the same geographical term as that requested, which might be the name of a town, for example."
"I am therefore going to send a letter to the Italian Permanent Representation in Brussels to call upon Italy to adopt a clear position on this issue in the Council."
"I will send the letter to the Italian Members of Parliament too and invite them to support the initiative."
"I would stress that this is not just an Italian question: it concerns the protection of all European typical products."
"I therefore call upon the non-Italian Members as well to see this as a question of the legal protection of typical products."
". (PT) The rapporteur accepts the basis of the Commission proposal aimed at bringing the current Regulation No 2081/92 into line with the agreement under the WTO on trade-related property rights (TRIPS, 1994)."
"After supporting the Commission's position, which it considers to be crucial to a food quality policy and to combat any attempt to sow confusion amongst consumers, when discussing Protected Designations of Origins (PDOs) and Protected Geographical Indications (PGIs), the report overlooks some contradictions and tables some amendments that give rise to doubts."
"For example, with regard to the procedure for cancelling the Community registration of a PDO or a PGI, the report overlooks the fact that sometimes a PDO or a PGI is not only private property; it can also be the property of a particular community or region due to the characteristics of its production or of the raw material used."
"There should therefore be safeguards to ensure that the voice of local institutional bodies is heard in these situations."
"We must also take account of the relationship between the trademark and the PDO, so as to safeguard any possible move by a trademark with regional characteristics, which cannot be produced in another region or country."
"In Portugal, this problem has already arisen, in the case of 'Limiano' cheese."
"Hence our abstention from the vote."
"(NL) The market is merciless, because whoever produces and sells cheapest always wins - even if this winner is cheap only because of low pay, poor working conditions, animal cruelty, child labour and the absence of measures for the control of environmental pollution."
"In an ever larger-scale market, the production of age-old regional food and drink products is at risk."
"They can lose out to competition from a place where production costs are lower."
"If the free market strikes, cheese, wine, mustard, vinegar and cake will soon no longer come from the region of origin."
"It is therefore good, in the midst of the prevailing liberalisation of the economy, that the logic of the market is defeated by protecting these products and their areas of origin from imitation."
"Yet we have to be careful that no new injustice arises."
"Under this arrangement old EU Member States are at an advantage compared with new ones."
"I have recently put questions to the Commission about Bulgarian feta cheese that can no longer be exported now that the name feta is given only to Greek products."
"The Bulgarian cheese now has to be sold under an unknown name and is therefore less in demand."
"It must therefore always be possible for protected names already assigned to be opened up to prevent the neglect of a traditional agricultural product in other more neglected regions or regions that have acceded later."
". (PT) Since 1993, the EU has had a system in place for Protected Designations of Origin (PDOs) and Protected Geographical Indications (PGIs)."
"This mechanism has helped to make the agri-food sector more dynamic and to preserve traditional production methods, providing consumers with high quality products."
"I welcome the Commission proposal to adapt this system, especially as regards continuing to monitor counterfeiting and unlawful imitations, both within the EU and in third countries."
"One measure, which we believe to be important, would be to insist that products be packaged in the area in which they are produced, so as to provide a guarantee regarding their origin and quality."
"The current inspection mechanism must be effective, and to this end the existing systems and the activities of national and European bodies must be harmonised and the Member States must be given greater responsibility."
"I also agree that the owner of a trademark should, in certain circumstances, have the right to register their trademarked product with a PDO or a PGI."
"Similarly, the product registration procedure must be simplified and made more accessible, making applications easier to assess by the Member States, limiting the role of the European Commission simply to checking the form."
"I have voted against the Report on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs because it approves of the regulation and furthermore does not seek to improve the content or alter the aims of either the former regulation or the Commission proposal."
"The overall aim is regionalisation via a uniform Community approach."
"A development I cannot support as a sovereignist."
"The regulation will put unnecessary restrictions on producers in particular affecting small and medium sized producers of agricultural products."
"Furthermore, I firmly believe that the consumers will be able to orient themselves better if the name of the Member State in which the product has been produced is evident."
"The consumer should be able to support home production, if this is their wish."
"Finally it is unjustifiable that LDCs should live up to EU production standards."
"This constitutes a hidden trade barrier."
". This Report was voted on under Rule 110a of the Rules of Procedure which allows for no debate in Parliament and no amendments to the Report."
"The British Delegation of the PPE-DE Group has previously sought to amend reports which it did not support."
"The new Rule, however, leaves no option but to abstain on certain reports."
"Before we extend the competences and financial resources of Europol, the British Conservatives believe that there is a need to establish whether competence should be ceded to them in this field or other fields or whether the total priority should be interstate cooperation, utilising present national resources."
". (PT) Just a brief comment in order to express, as the rapporteur has done, the profound hope that now, within a new framework that allows us to envisage a lasting peace in Angola, the fishing industry of that country, specifically through the instruments agreed with the EC, can contribute to the development of the economy of a country that has suffered so much from a long and devastating civil war since its independence in 1975."
"This is the most noteworthy feature that, in political terms, marks the difference between this protocol - which is valid for the period 3 August 2002 to 2 August 2004 - and the eight previous ones, in developing the agreement that, as everyone knows, dates back to 1987."
"Furthermore, this is an important instrument from which Portuguese shipowners also benefit - as well as Spanish, French, Italian, Greek and Irish shipowners - and it is therefore regrettable that the Commission has not respected the allocation key contained in the previous agreement and has penalised Portugal by 20 tonnes."
"Lastly, the significant increase in the financial contribution should be emphasised as should, in connection with this, not only the corresponding increase in fishing possibilities, but also the establishment of a partnership with Angola to encourage responsible and sustainable fishing and particularly, the development of scientific research, surveillance, artisanal fisheries, training and aquaculture."
"We will need, in future, to monitor the specific effects of these new developments."
". (PT) I have voted in favour of this report, which highlights the need to streamline and synchronise procedures for coordinating economic, social and employment policies, not forgetting the environmental dimension, in order to gear them towards a medium and long-term perspective."
"Our focus must be on implementing measures rather than on drafting guidelines."
"This analysis of the implementation of guidelines, which will take the form of a new implementation package, will involve the Member States providing information on a systematic basis, in line with a specific timetable."
"The appropriate involvement of all the interested institutions and partners such as the Council, the European Parliament and the social partners, must be ensured."
"We must stress the importance of strengthening the democratic legitimacy of this process and of giving Parliament powers of participation and co-decision in the entire cycle of policy coordination."
"To this end, we hope that the Convention proposes this improvement for the new Treaty."
"Finally, I wish to underline the importance of increasing the role played by the social partners through the creation of a Tripartite Social Summit and a macro-economic social dialogue, as well as the participation of the candidate countries in implementing the Lisbon Strategy."
"This report backs the Commission, which defends the idea of greater coordination in implementing the economic policy and the so-called employment policy of the Member States."
"The only 'economic policy' that the European Union and its Member States know, however, consists of constantly favouring the interests of businesses and their owners."
"As for their 'employment policy', it is, at best - if one can say so - a pretext for distributing aid and subsidies to these same businesses, and primarily to major European industrial and financial groups."
"And, at worst, it manifests itself in the ever-increasing number of workers out of a job: today, there are almost 20 million people unemployed in the European Union, and in addition, there are millions of workers who have only precarious employment."
"We constantly hear of plans for mass redundancies."
"And you dare to speak of 'employment policy'!"
"And how can you discuss 'streamlining' your economic and employment policies, when each day provides further evidence of the irrational nature of your system, and of its fundamental social injustice?"
"By voting against this report, we are therefore reaffirming our rejection of your capitalist system."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
". (PT) The Commission communication which serves as the basis for this report follows up the request made at the Spring Council in Barcelona to streamline the relevant policy coordination processes and to improve the implementation of the 'Lisbon strategy'."
"It is on this issue that the rapporteur attempts to somewhat improve the unacceptable position maintained by the European Commission, which systematically overlooks the social and environmental spheres."
"Nevertheless, these improvements are clearly inadequate, since the proposals that we tabled on the need to amend the aims, criteria and bases of the Stability Pact were rejected. We had tabled these proposals according to the principle that the Member States' budgets must reflect the needs of every people and of every country and not the interests of the financial groups which the European Central Bank is seeking to serve."
"Consequently, no guarantees have been made to establish conditions that will ensure that priority is given to employment, to economic and social cohesion and to combating social exclusion, a crucial issue in the fight against the dominance of neo-liberal policies in the European Union."
"Therefore, despite the fact that a few individual aspects can be seen as positive, we have voted against this report."
". (NL) In 2000, the European Summit in Lisbon spoke out in favour of a tough liberalisation policy and comprehensive privatisation of public services."
"The justification for this, which turned out to be illusory, was that this would prompt even more extensive economic growth, by means of which Europe could beat the US and Japan."
"According to this line of thinking, the expected drawbacks concerning labour and the environment are automatically offset by an increase in profits and employment."
"The proposal that is being voted on today is a commendable effort on the part of Mr Karas to give a wrong policy choice a friendly twist."
"He has managed this to some extent in the area of the environment, at least as far as the good intentions are concerned."
"Whether a callous liberal policy really leaves room for a good environment is, in fact, dubious, but I back the attempt to give more attention to environmental policy than the Commission proposes."
"In the area of social policy, the main thing about the proposal is that it contains an attempt to make the trade union movement partly responsible for the neoliberal economic policy."
"The rapporteur is trying to reconcile the irreconcilable in a somewhat craftier manner."
"It is not so much his friendly intentions as the underlying policy that is being condoned in this way."
"This has prompted me and my group to vote against this proposal."
". (EL) The changes proposed and the idea of coordinating general economic policy and employment policy guidelines could be a step in the right direction, helping to bring about a radical change in economic policy, if only the very acute social problem were a priority which other policies had to fall in line with."
"The opposite is happening, however."
"The emphasis is still on the Stability Pact and the policy of privatisation, merger and capitalist restructuring, which has resulted - in fact still is resulting - in mass redundancies, falling standards of living and pay, fewer and fewer social services and infringements of workers' rights, creating justifiable fears that coordination might cause even more problems, with social issues playing second fiddle to the policy of liberalisation and the rampant profit principle."
"Of course, coordination leaves out two of the four pillars proclaimed by the ?U, namely environmental protection and social cohesion, but adds the completion of the single internal market."
"We believe that the sole objective of this sort of 'coordination' is to mislead the workers."
"We support a policy based on the objective of full, stable employment predicated on man and his needs, with full, protected social rights for all workers, a better standard of living and real social development and prosperity."
". (NL) Over the course of time, flying has become ever cheaper, and is, in many cases, also cheap in relation to the distance covered."
"This is because the environmental and social costs are not passed on to the passengers."
"There is no tax on fuel and the routes taken require no infrastructure outside the airports."
"Flight travel is set to put medium to long distance rail travel out of business, despite the investments in high-speed rail links for distances up to 1 000 km and despite the Commission communication 'Air Transport and the Environment' from 1999 and the 2010 White Paper on transport policy."
"The prices at which airline companies sell seats are at a record low, non-European companies carry passengers within the EU virtually for free and price-fighters elbow out old, national airline companies."
"Despite the low fares, which cannot compensate for the negative effects on air pollution and noise, there is still a political majority in favour of yet lower fares."
"Is it a political priority to reduce the travel expenses of the highest paid?"
"The compromise that has been reached between the parliamentary majority and the Council stipulates that the authorities should cover some of the security costs entailed by the fight against terrorism."
"This money would be better spent on mass public transport, namely city transport and local transport, which is experiencing cutbacks everywhere."
"This is why I reject this compromise."
". I voted for the Foster report, and congratulate Mr Foster on taking forward a set of proposals which provide timely quality control systems and higher standards in civil aviation security."
"Having put forward a thorough report, I would like to add that emphasis on airport security should not preclude measures from EU Member States from providing some form of redress for EU citizens who are unfairly searched, detained or harassed at airports without just cause."
"These are at present inadequate statutory forms of redress for such infringement at both ports and airports."
"This is often reflected in constituency cases."
"In the light of September 11, the Foster report is a strong contribution to the security of all EU citizens."
"Mr President, I just am registering that I abstained on the Thorning-Schmidt report."
"My explanation of vote, if anyone can hear me, is that although we achieved a great deal for industry as a whole, and the rapporteur changed her view during the process of the report going through the European Parliament - in other words, she took hearing protection into account and moved towards weekly measurements, which I welcome - the amendment that we voted through in Parliament on its exemption for entertainment and leisure for five years while the Commission did a report on the special nature of the entertainment and leisure business was lost in conciliation."
"That was the reason for abstention."
"We gained some things for industry but lost some for the music and entertainment business."
"Noise at work can cause effects such as fatigue, communication difficulties and total hearing loss."
"This report won my vote because it lays down a balanced set of rules aimed at protecting workers against the risks of exposure to noise, and sets out exposure limits."
"Implementation of this directive will thus lead to a significant reduction in existing noise levels and, therefore, an improvement in working conditions."
"Current problems in this area may in future be greatly reduced or even avoided altogether through the action employers are expected to take to assess and improve the noise levels to which workers are exposed."
"Nor must we forget the adoption of preventive measures at all stages, from the design of workstations and workplaces, through improvements in their layouts, to the provision of suitable machinery and equipment."
"Lastly, workers must be made aware of the problem and be trained in the right way to use the equipment."
"I have agreed with this report, which is the result of the conciliation process that was conducted, because I believe it contributes directly to protecting workers from noise at work, a particularly sensitive area. It is indeed a worrying and all too frequent cause of occupational health problems."
"I welcome the preparation of a code of conduct that provides practical guidelines aimed at helping workers and employers in the music and entertainment sectors to fulfil their legal obligations as set out in this directive."
"I think the directive under consideration meets our legitimate expectations for improvements in working conditions."
"I also agree with the rapporteur in expressing the desire that rules covering the remaining risk factors for health and safety in the workplace - that is, electromagnetic fields and optical radiation - will soon be adopted."
"Mr President, on Mr Jové Peres, the EPLP voted differently from the proposed PS line in order to be consistent with the approach taken by the UK Government on fisheries and to reflect our support for the following: to look at fisheries management on the basis that absence of scientific evidence does not mean postponing conservation support for a strong role for regional management councils with decision-making power and access support for extension up to 24 miles, support for 12 miles and support for 50 miles for remote areas, for effective measures to reduce fishing capacity and for a continuation of relative stability."
"Mr President, the SNP Members here, Neil MacCormick and myself, have taken a constructive approach to the issue of Common Fisheries Policy reform because we agree that there is dire need for Common Fisheries Policy reform."
"For that reason, we voted today in favour of improving Mr Jové Peres's text in various ways."
"Nevertheless, in the end we voted against the overall package because we do not believe that it goes far enough in strengthening guarantees on relative stability, for example, on continuing access restrictions to certain waters and on enforcement issues."
"Scotland's fishing communities will be demanding that a new Common Fisheries Policy actually does what it is supposed to do, namely that it actually addresses the real management issues in a way which will be effective in terms of conservation and sustainability."
"Mr President, I just want to endorse what my friend and colleague, Mr Hudghton, has said and indeed to endorse many of the things which Catherine Stihler said as well."
"In this area a great deal of the discussion among us remains bedevilled by different understandings of the legal background, in particular, of the continuing effects of the Spanish and Portuguese Treaty of Accession of 1985."
"That does need testing in a legal way and not just by political debate in the Parliament."
"I would like to take some steps to push that forward."
"As I mentioned yesterday, it does show one of the kinds of areas in which it would be very fruitful if it were the case that regions with legislative power had the right to seize the Court of Justice of questions because, after all, a parliament like the Scottish Parliament, which has legislative responsibility for these matters, should be able to test out the question of the legal basis and so should the Parliament of Galicia, might I add."
"This is not a particularly one-country point."
"It is to do with the thought that these are issues of law as well as of politics and we should be thinking of good ways of getting the law finally determined by a judicial authority."
"According to the Commission, the implementation of a new framework regulation as a replacement for those of 1976 and 1992 is justified by 'a general threat to all fisheries resources'."
"It appears however, according to professionals and scientists, that only certain species need to be protected."
"This shows that the reform should therefore focus on more specific management organised according to the different species and fishing areas, in order to deal properly with the realities of the situation."
"Furthermore, I wish to reiterate the express demand of the 'Friends of Fishing Group' to see strict controls applied to industrial fishing."
"How can the Commission seek to implement sustainable fishing whilst also encouraging this type of fishing, excluding it from its proposal, when it has a particularly damaging effect on ecosystems?"
"As regards abolishing State aid for building new boats and reallocating previously granted funds to alternative activities, I stress the absolute need to see structural aid maintained and even increased since it only represents 0.84% of the Community budget, in order to modernise and make the fleet safer, particularly the small-scale fishing fleet."
"To sum up, I shall say that, once again, I am surprised by the European logic which prevails in the area of common policy."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"The distinct identity of the outermost regions, as manifested in a specific set of problems requiring special treatment by the European Union, has once again been recognised by the European Parliament."
"This time it is in the context of the common fisheries policy - an area in which the specific nature of the outermost regions is particularly evident - when Parliament decided in favour of the need to extend the exclusive fishing zone for regional fishing vessels from 12 to 50 miles."
"This measure makes very good sense for two main reasons:"
"First, since the opportunities open to fishermen in these regions have shrunk, it is vital to expand them by increasing the exclusive fishing area to 50 miles."
"Secondly, this is also a way of ensuring the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fish stocks in the seas of the outermost regions."
"In addition, the fishing capacity of the regional fleets is limited, and the fishing methods used in these regions are environment-friendly, in that they are fully compatible with the overriding need to guarantee the conservation of fish stocks."
"I therefore welcome Parliament's adoption of this important measure for the outermost regions and also the PPE-DE's vote in its favour, which was decisive in its success."
". (NL) The dwindling fish stocks at sea as a result of environmental pollution and overfishing are alarming."
"Catch quotas and even catch bans are becoming inevitable."
"This, however, does create a major problem for areas where a large proportion of the population depends on fishing for their jobs and income, and where the consumption of fish is proportionately high."
"This mainly applies to Spain and Portugal."
"These countries are also indignant about Danish fishing for the fish meal industry and about the much bigger Dutch ships, even if these are only active on a restricted number of fishing days."
"Despite the dangers at sea, many fishermen would ideally like to carry on, and even for those who would like a change, no replacement employment is being organised."
"Their interests often lead to the problem being denied, or continued scientific research."
"The main purpose of this research is to do nothing for the time being and delay the finding of a solution."
"My colleague, Mr Jové Peres has tried to take these conflicting interests into consideration and to bring them into line with each other."
"He has largely succeeded in this."
"There is one point in his approach to which I object."
"He is trying to shift the decision about catch quotas from the Commission to the Council."
"This is beneficial for an obstructive Member State but makes necessary radical interventions more difficult."
". (PT) The Commission seems to envisage a common fisheries policy that focuses more on the short-term interests of the Member States than on the interests of the fishermen."
"The time has come for the CFP to try to keep fishing-dependent regions alive and not to turn this issue into a battleground for the Member States."
"Fishermen share common interests; they all need the fish stocks to pursue their professional activities."
"The decisions and objectives of the recovery plans must not underestimate the consequences they may have."
"The recovery plans must seek a balance between the recovery or conservation of fish stocks and measures to limit the impact on the fishing industry."
"Certain amendments that were adopted - including some tabled by my own group, the Union for Europe of the Nations, particularly the maintenance of the 12-mile exclusive zone, which is essential for Portugal - led me to vote for the report."
"Mr President, regarding the Varela report on structural assistance, we rejected the report because it aims to keep the current structure of CFP subsidies."
"The subsidies system has led to a contradictory situation where subsidies are spent on the one hand on scrapping vessels to reduce capacity, and on the other hand on financing the building of new vessels and modernisation of others."
"The subsidies system has helped to drive over-capacity of the EU fleet."
"It has mainly supported the large boat-owners at the expense of smaller operators and local fishing communities, and this subsidy system has financed the export of our over-capacity to other parts of the world."
"This is unacceptable and that is why we rejected the Varela structural assistance report."
"This report, like many others in the last few months, raises some serious questions about the 'sustainable development' of fishing, about depleted fish stocks and bans on the fishing of this or that species in Community waters, about catch quotas or minimum fish sizes which have to be adhered to by fishermen in order to protect young fish, about fish populations etc. Yet there is one question which nobody is asking."
"How many of the fish that you claim to be saving will die in the next 'Prestige' oil-tanker disaster?"
"How many others, day after day, are dying as a result of illegal emissions from the unseaworthy old tubs chartered by the big oil companies?"
"Of course the authorities announce major decisions, such as prohibiting the use of single-hull vessels ... and then they give the oil companies ten years to comply! They have ten years in which to carry on causing devastation along the coasts of Spain, France and elsewhere, and causing the deaths of an untold number of species of marine wildlife."
"In order to save those species, and not forgetting those who earn their livelihood from fishing, the small-scale fishermen that you constantly harass when you are not driving them to ruin (by seeking to destroy part of the European fishing fleet, for example), why not start by putting your own rules into practice, such as the rules introduced after the 'Erika' disaster?"
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137 (1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"."
"(EL) It is perfectly clear from the vote in favour of more and more obstacles to fisheries that all the ?U wants is to establish a restrictive fisheries policy."
"Policies so far have managed to reduce the number of vessels, especially coastal fishing vessels, hitting small family businesses hard and driving people out of this profession."
"On the pretext of maintaining fish stocks, the aim is to end subsidies and limit funding for fleet renewal, thereby accelerating the demise of small and medium-sized enterprises in countries such as Greece, where fisheries are traditionally of both social and economic importance."
"The objective is to shift fisheries into the hands of large companies."
"This will destroy the social aspect of fisheries, which will become the exclusive preserve of a few fishermen employed by fisheries companies, who will be cut off in their work from their social roots."
"At the same time, the aim is to develop the fish farming sector during the course of overall increases in the production of all types of aquaculture products."
"What we need is a change in general orientation and approach, which is not in the nature of the capitalist ?U, together with an overall policy based on its interests, the interests of small and medium-sized farming and fishing enterprises, not the interests of big business."
"By changing the legislation on structural assistance in the fisheries sector, the Commission is trying, purely and simply, to put an end to public aid for the building of new vessels."
"It is crucial that public aid for the renewal of the fleet should be maintained."
"I therefore want to give the rapporteur my unequivocal support."
"I consider that addressing the shortage of fish stocks is not just a question of scrapping vessels."
"Funds for modernising the existing fleet cannot simply be redirected to scrapping vessels, thus bringing into question already adopted budgetary measures that will be in force until 2006."
"Reducing the fleet is perfectly compatible with maintaining public aid."
"We cannot, however, hide our heads in the sand."
"Regulatory measures are needed to prevent public aid from leading to an increase in fleet capacity."
"I therefore support the creation of a single register of vessels (classed by segment, capacity and power), the purpose of which will be precisely to control the growth of the fleets."
"I am in favour of tighter control with dissuasive penalties, namely the loss of public aid for fleet renewal, against those Member States that do not comply with the reduction in capacity laid down in the multiannual guidance programme."
"As the rapporteur has pointed out, one of the aims of any fisheries policy is to control the fleet and ensure it is suited to the available stocks, thus achieving a balance between fleet and stocks and avoiding overcapacity and overexploitation."
"This balance, however, must be based on a fair assessment of all the elements involved."
"Faced with the recurrent failure of Member States to comply with the reduction in their fishing effort, the European Commission adopted a policy of not penalising the prevaricators, a policy that the European Parliament's Committee on Fisheries has always criticised. It is therefore absolutely unacceptable that it should now attempt to blindly implement an across-the-board reduction in assistance for fleet restructuring and renewal."
"This would cause enormous damage - as well as penalising the States that have complied most - and would have unforeseeable effects that would jeopardise the survival of an entire social group and an indispensable way of life, especially in heavily dependent regions with marked seafaring and fishing traditions."
"I have therefore agreed in general with the rapporteur's positions, which are consistent with the views that I, as a Portuguese and a European, uphold: maintaining aid for fleet renewal and modernisation; setting global reference levels for fleet capacity corresponding to the sum of the targets set in the multiannual guidance programme (MAGP, for 31 December 2002) for all segments; a system for managing fleet additions and deletions to prevent these reference levels from being exceeded; penalties for Member States that do not achieve the MGP targets; maintenance of premiums for permanent cessation of fishing activities, other than scrapping; maintenance of aid for joint enterprises; and maintenance of aid for temporary stoppage."
"I support Mr. Varela's highly critical analysis of the Commission's proposals. These proposals are flawed and will not achieve the aim of sustainable development."
"This view is shared by a majority of the Member States."
"No studies, analyses or reports of any kind have been provided on the economic and social impact of the drastic changes that the Commission would like to make to the structural policy on fisheries."
"The Commission also makes a calculation of the budgetary estimates for the financing of these proposals which lacks any logic."
"The Commission's estimates are based on pure suppositions, with no solid foundation."
"The Commission itself acknowledges that they are only probable working hypotheses."
"This is a totally unacceptable way of dealing with this extremely important issue."
"For all of these reasons, and more importantly because these proposals would mean a 40% reduction in the Irish white fish fleet and a loss of approximately 2000 jobs, I will be supporting the Varela report."
"The Varela report is highly critical of the Commission's proposal."
"The only data that the Commission presents in this proposal for a regulation establishing an emergency measure for scrapping fishing vessels are just rough figures."
"These data on the fishing fleet have been considered unrealistic and, in many cases, wrong by most of the Member States."
"No study, analysis or report has been presented, either, on the social and economic impact that will result from the drastic changes to the structural fisheries policy that the Commission wants to introduce."
"Furthermore, the Commission then calculates the budgetary requirements needed to finance these proposals in a way that is totally devoid of logic, since it is based on mere assumptions without any basis in reality, as the Commission itself recognises when it points out that these are just likely working hypotheses."
"The Member States have already earmarked these funds for other purposes, and so they are unlikely to be willing to accept this reallocation."
"Serious funding difficulties are therefore likely to arise in the context of such an unrealistic programme as this."
"A report as clear as this one certainly deserves my vote."
"I broadly welcome the positive work done by the rapporteur, and the way I voted reflects my complete solidarity with the Portuguese positions on this subject."
"In fact, it is beyond comprehension that the new measures should penalise most those Member States that have already made a large cut-back in their capacity (as is the case of Portugal, which has, in fact, far exceeded the targets set), rather than directly affecting the fleets of those countries that have not achieved the reduction targets set in the operational plan for fisheries (MAGP), which should be the ones to have to bear the necessary cuts."
"It is vital that the European Commission should understand once and for all that the system it has proposed - encouraging the scrapping of vessels by increasing the scrapping premium, but selecting only vessels from the Member States that have fulfilled the MAGP targets - will ultimately run seriously counter to the stated aim of the measure."
"Furthermore, it is worth emphasising that it is highly unfair to try to subject Portugal, for instance, to a policy in which the money for these measures would be taken from funds now allocated to aid for fleet renewal."
"On the contrary, it is quite clear that programmes of aid for the renewal and modernisation of the fleet - particularly the Portuguese fleet - should continue to exist, and that Community structural assistance should not be confined to the scrapping of vessels."
". (NL) Rich Europe has Africa, the poorest continent, on its doorstep."
"This continent, with its many fatal diseases, poorly-developed industry, desertification and battle for minerals, is selling its agricultural products and mining products to the rich world."
"In the past, during colonial supremacy, this was done under duress."
"Nowadays, it appears to be done voluntarily, although they are hardly given any alternatives."
"Politically speaking, colonialism has died out, but economically speaking, it is still thriving."
"This also applies to fishing, and increasingly so."
"The European Union leases fishing areas in the territorial waters and economic coastal zones of African countries on behalf of its own fishing fleets, particularly those from Spain and Portugal."
"For the poor countries, this is one way of making a fast buck, but offers no solutions in the long run."
"If the seas in those areas soon run out of fish stocks, as the North Sea is doing, those countries will be left with an insoluble problem."
"They, in fact, desperately need food from the sea for their own undernourished population, and they could export any surpluses."
"Instead of this, they confine themselves to primitive coastal fishing and sell their fishing rights to others."
"This situation should end without delay."
"This is the reason why I am increasingly averse to endorsing the extension of agreements such as those for Senegal and Angola today."
"Mr President, with regard to this particular resolution, let me say I am appalled at the opportunist hypocrisy of certain groups and certain individuals in this House."
"I totally agree with the comments of my colleague, Mr Poettering, when he criticised them for setting themselves up as the custodians of morality in this House."
"All MEPs want a fair statute because it is an albatross around our neck and when they play this opportunist politics, it will be seized upon by the press, in my own country and other countries, to lambast Parliament."
"Unfortunately, the press ignores the real work of this Parliament, the serious work that it undertakes, be it on foreign policy, be it on the promotion of human rights and democracy and, indeed, on other issues, and they will concentrate on these sorts of issues."
"But the other reason I resent the opportunist hypocrisy is this: those Members that complain about the current system are not obliged to take travel expenses."
"They can go to the cash office and get reimbursement of travel expenses."
"If they think it is a wrong system they should practise what they are preach."
"To their credit, some Members, especially Dutch Members, only take the reimbursement of the tickets."
"Those that think that the system is wrong should practise what they preach and should only present their tickets for reimbursement and should not avail themselves of the other expenses and continue with this sort of hypocrisy."
"Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of an alliance of opportunists and hypocrites."
"On behalf of the European Parliamentary Labour Party, I wish to say that we are strong supporters of a Member Statute being introduced before the 2004 European Parliamentary elections."
"Because of that, the British Labour delegation voted for the ELDR/Green/GUE/NGL resolution."
"It bests reflects the entire delegation's desire for transparency and the renumeration of MEPs' salaries and expenses, as did the separate motions by those groups for which we also voted."
"The PPE-DE/PSE resolution supports the existing text from the Legal Affairs Committee and that involves contentious primary legislation which is not acceptable to Council and therefore almost certain to fail."
"The text does not make clear the requirement for there to be complete and transparent reform of all Members' expenses."
"This is not a position, in all friendship to our colleagues in the PSE, which we are able to accept."
"The PPE-DE/PSE resolution also calls on the Commission to give an opinion on the text of the Legal Affairs Committee before it has been discussed by us in plenary."
"This seems to the British Labour delegation a recipe for further delay."
"It will be fundamentally our problem and our responsibility."
"- (DA) During the vote on the Statute, we voted in favour of transparency and comparability and against hidden income, as well as in favour of abolishing the system for reimbursing travel expenses and replacing it with a system through which actual expenditure is reimbursed."
"We have opted for this, even though we are in principle opposed to uniform remuneration, for we believe that MEPs must be remunerated like their colleagues in the Member States."
". It is Parliament's responsibility to draw up a statute for its Members, (relating to issues of pay, pensions, social and health insurance, taxation and immunities)."
"The Commission is consulted and the Council must agree to the statute."
"The Parliament's draft statute (rapporteur: Rothley), has been approved by resolutions of the European Parliament and President Cox was given a mandate by the Council of Presidents in June to undertake exploratory contacts with the Member State Governments and to report back to the Conference of Presidents in the context of the opinion on the Rothley report."
"I voted for a fair statute for all Members which must go hand in hand with a fair, honest and open expenses regime."
"The Council needs to state what problems, if any, it has with the Rothley Opinion and, as we face enlargement, the need to bring this issue to a conclusion is pressing, so that the pay and conditions for Members of the next Parliament are clearly laid down in advance."
"We voted against this resolution in order to reaffirm our complete disagreement with the creation of a monthly 'parliamentary allowance', the same for all Members regardless of the States they represent, because we believe that MEPs' salaries should be based on the salaries of the members of the national parliaments in the countries where they were elected, where social realities differ."
"If the proposal contained in the draft report drawn up by Mr Rothley on the 'draft Statute of Members of the European Parliament' were adopted, we insist that it would be highly immoral to have a 'parliamentary allowance' of EUR 8 500 (roughly 1 700 000 Portuguese escudos) a month, particularly in the case of Portuguese MEPs, when we compare it to the wages earned by workers in Portugal."
"Moreover, MEPs are elected in national contexts."
"Therefore, they are, and should continue to be, linked to these national contexts."
"The proposal supporting a single parliamentary allowance also fits in with a federalist concept of the MEP's mandate, seeking to transform the current 'national Member of the European Parliament' into a future 'European Member of Parliament', which is something we disagree with."
"(NL) My party, the Socialist Party in the Netherlands, is in favour of a scheme whereby all MEPs would receive the same monthly income of, for example, EUR 2 000, only the essential expenses they actually incurred would be reimbursed, MEPs would pay taxes in their countries of residence, as is normal, and they would not enjoy any legal privileges denied to other citizens."
"Members of any parliament are not elected to give undue preference to themselves, but to represent the electorate."
"In response to the criticism of preferential treatment, a statute for MEPs was discussed in 1998 and in 2002."
"Such a statute is a good thing if it puts an end to privileges and excessive incomes, and ends all opportunities to pad out these incomes by taking advantage of the system to reimburse expenses."
"Unfortunately, some MEPs speak in favour of such a statute in order to validate and enhance their benefits."
"A few years ago, I was astounded to hear Mr Rothley and many Members say, during an exploratory debate in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, that it is beneath their dignity not to have a maximum income."
"Today, the two largest groups are trying to force this very contentious report through without any discussion or amendment, and to end the exploration of any better alternatives, maybe even in the hope that the Council will turn down such a statute."
"This report closely follows the proposal for a directive presented by Commissioner António Vitorino, which aims at combating the smuggling of immigrants and the trafficking in human beings, without making a clear distinction between the two types of trafficking, which are very different. It is more interested, in fact, in combating illegal immigration than in protecting the victims."
"The rapporteur tries to make some distinction, but only partially and without drawing all the conclusions from this."
"While supporting the idea of providing assistance to the victims of the trafficking in immigrants, we cannot accept the way in which the Commission tries to do this, since it treats victims of trafficking in human beings for the purpose of prostitution in the same way as it treats illegal immigrants who seek work in the European Union and only turn to illegality because of the unacceptable positions upheld by the Community institutions, which try to turn the European Union into a 'fortress Europe' instead of increasing support for cooperation with their countries of origin and supporting their integration."
"The State should not resort to the threat of expulsion to pressurise victims into cooperating with the police and the authorities in charge of the investigation."
"On the contrary, the cloak of protection given to victims should, from the start, guarantee a residence permit as well as access to asylum procedures and medical and social services, irrespective of whether the victims collaborate in combating the trafficking."
"We therefore voted against the report."
". Whilst the British Conservative Delegation is in favour of prosecuting those who smuggle human beings, this measure is not an effective way of dealing with such criminals."
"By allowing illegal immigrants to stay in a Member State, although ostensibly for prosecution purposes, the directive would leave the asylum system open to abuse."
"If this legislation were to be implemented, the problems would be exacerbated."
"Instead, we need to tackle these matters as individual states and take tougher measures to discourage traffickers and bogus asylum seekers."
"- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of the Sörensen report (A5-0397/2002)."
"We agree that there are advantages in the EU's adopting rules on short-term residence permits with a view to combating organised illegal immigration or trafficking in human beings."
"We are nonetheless alert to the fact that the proposal relates to an area which is covered by Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community and which does not therefore apply to Denmark, cf. the Protocol on Denmark's Position."
". (NL) In tracking and punishing crime, we should not tackle the victims but the perpetrators."
"These include drugs dealers, traffickers in human beings and people taking advantage of other people in the sex industry, rather than drug addicts, refugees and misled women put to work as prostitutes against their will."
"Not only the health, housing and income of those victims deserve support, but also their opportunity to witness in a legal court against punishable offences and to claim damages from those who made money from them."
"I have knowledge of the rapporteur's long-term commitment to women who find themselves in dire straits in the world of prostitution in Antwerp, and this was initially the reason why I awaited her proposals with sympathy."
"It is unfortunate that those proposals - at any rate, the compromises she is defending - still appear inadequate."
"This is probably why a broad majority of this Parliament, which in most cases has little consideration for the position of people relegated to the margin of society, has voted in favour during the discussion in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"The opportunities for the victims to extend their residence permits are so limited that the discussions in my group have led to the conclusion that, in this case, it would be better to vote against after all."
"We do not want to carry any of the responsibility for a scheme that raises people's hopes but offers inadequate protection."
"I have agreed with this report because I believe it puts into practice a large number of declarations of intent on the protection that should be given to many of those who every day are defenceless victims and then see themselves summarily expelled from the countries where they thought they could have a worthwhile future."
"In addition, the establishment of this special measure is conditional upon real cooperation of the victim with the national authorities, with a view to dismantling illegal immigration networks. This will certainly avoid the use of other means to obtain rights that would otherwise be inaccessible."
"This may, in fact, be a way of persuading victims to denounce the perpetrators of the crimes and, under the legal protection of the Member State, setting them free from the network of dependence that is erected around them and often forms a prison from which they cannot escape."
"On a different level, I think the period of thirty days 'for reflection' and the way of granting a short-term residence permit are appropriate, since such a short term will avoid unnecessarily raising unfounded expectations."
"I regret, however, that the short-term residence permit will not be renewed if a court decision terminates the prosecution of the traffickers, because I think the victim's cooperation with the authorities should be better rewarded regardless of the outcome of the action taken against the traffickers."
"Mr President, the December Council of fisheries ministers will have a hefty agenda in terms of agreeing the first package of CFP reform proposals."
"The Commission says that it wants from that a new way of doing things, a better way of doing things, involving stakeholders more, using a multi-annual, multi-species ecosystem approach to management."
"And yet, at the very same time, the Commission seems hell-bent on pushing through its current proposals on cod and hake recovery, which, I believe, are so different from previous versions that they ought to be put out to further consultation."
"I also think that to press ahead and agree that package with its wide-ranging consequences will, in fact, torpedo the CFP reform package and prevent any perception forthcoming from the Council that the EU actually means what it says when it states that it wants to do things in a better way."
"I think that the Council should concentrate on the reform, get it right and then implement it urgently, setting up a regional advisory body to allow the stakeholders to be part of the solution to the cod and hake crisis and not just to be seen as the problem."
". (NL) Last week, the Commission tabled drastic quota proposals."
"These proposals were more inspired by practical political considerations than by justified concern for poor cod levels."
"Instead of a ban on cod fishing and industrial fishing, the Commission would like to restrict minimal additional cod fishing by the Dutch flatfish fleet."
"We would regard an approach of this kind as fighting a losing battle."
"Fish stock management and the corresponding quota rely on the catches being registered effectively."
"After a debacle in the 1980s, this registration is virtually watertight in the Netherlands."
"Of the fish supplied, 99% is registered and traded via fish auctions."
"What about the other Member States?"
"How can one of the larger Member States export twice as many fish as supplied by the fishermen according to the registrations?"
"The Jové Peres report is right to call for effective control and harmonised sanctions."
"It is high time we did something about this."
"Member States that fish within the quotas not only on paper but also in reality are now being hit hardest."
". (NL) For centuries, it has been a matter of course that people should not only eat animals, but also use them in all other areas where they expect to benefit."
"This has resulted in such outrages as fighting with dogs, cocks and bulls, the use of sleigh dogs, the large-scale breeding of animals for their furs, hunting and animal testing."
"Meanwhile, a younger generation of - in many cases - better-educated people is giving increasing attention to the welfare of pets, farm animals and animals in their natural habitats, and animal testing is also becoming less of an obvious choice."
"Tests are carried out on animals for military purposes and in the production of cosmetics and medicines."
"According to the rapporteur, seven Member States, including the Netherlands, fail to implement the existing directive on the protection of animals for experiments and other scientific purposes."
"She is therefore right to call for a proposal to step up this directive before the end of 2003, aimed at better control, a compulsory ethical evaluation procedure, a ban on experiments on primates caught in the wild and also a ban on animal abuse for the development of chemical weapons and cosmetics."
"Unfortunately, this is not yet legislation in the true sense of the word, but an attempt to invite the Commission to take an initiative."
"Unfortunately, unlike other parliaments, this Parliament cannot reach a decision without cooperation."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament"
"Colleagues, I have great pleasure today on behalf of the European Parliament to welcome Mr Alejandro Toledo, President of the Republic of Peru."
"We met at the protocol entrance and it is bitterly cold outside this morning."
"I assured the President that the welcome for him in this Parliament is very warm indeed."
"Mr President, your election on 3 June 2001 marked a new departure in the political life of your country and a step towards democratic consolidation."
"Your priorities for your administration - quality employment opportunity, the fight against poverty, strengthening democracy and the rule of law - are the values that this House espouses, believes in and promotes."
"I know that even before you took office you expressed a keen interest in strengthening the existing ties between Peru and the European Union."
"So we are especially pleased that you are here today and indeed this week."
"This in our Parliament and in the life of our old continent and of our European Union is a very important moment."
"We are approaching the closing moment in a lengthy process of enlarging our union to take in many more Member States."
"At this time, as you may imagine, we are consumed by this activity; it is so complex and so demanding."
"Your presence here today recalls to us the duty to think beyond introspection and to touch the wider world."
"By being here today, you recall to us, even as we take our step forward towards a great and new wave of European integration, that we carry wider global political responsibility."
"Thank you even for that in terms of that reminder."
"We are supportive of the European Union agreement with the Andean Community and look forward to deepening that, as indeed was indicated in Madrid this year in the summit meeting with Latin American and Caribbean states."
"I am also aware of your interest in international humanitarian funds to try to mitigate the impact of poverty and the declaration of Guayacil of July 2002."
"We share so many perspectives and I look forward now to hearing you and invite you please to address the European Parliament."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Cox, President of the European Parliament, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is truly an honour to be here, in a place that sets the standard for democracy in the world."
"It comprises three hundred and seventy-four million Europeans who have decided to join hands to build together a far more integrated world, which goes beyond business and trade."
"I come here today as the constitutional President of Peru, having visited you in Strasbourg last time as a President-elect."
"Nevertheless, Mr President, my belief in being a rebel for the cause of democracy and freedom, human rights and the environment has not changed."
"Europe plays a vital role in the world and I wish today to speak frankly to you."
"There is no room for selective globalisation in the world; globalisation cannot be confined solely to investment, trade or finance."
"If globalisation makes sense in any area it is in the field of democracy, freedom, human rights and the environment, because democracy transcends nationality, just as human rights transcend colour."
"Equally, because it is our responsibility to bequeath to future generations an inhabitable world where our children and our children's children can enjoy not only democracy but also a healthy environment, where the factories that produce wealth cannot destroy the cleanliness of the environment that future generations will inherit from us."
"We certainly need to achieve economic and financial integration."
"Latin America certainly, now more than ever, needs to diversify its financial and trade relations."
"The time has come, however, to pursue integration without losing our national identity."
"The time has come to accept globalisation and competitiveness on the basis that our diversity is our strength."
"Globalisation is not intended to create a uniform culture all over the world - it would be terrible if Kentucky Fried Chicken or McDonalds were part of world culture."
"I rebel."
"(Applause)"
"Being global and competitive does not mean tearing ourselves away from our national culture, and being competitive does not mean taking away the human essence of the men and women of the world."
"Being part of the new CNN culture or the Internet culture that enables us to navigate the world cannot separate us from our languages, our food or our cultural characteristics."
"I would ask Parliament, for which I have the greatest respect, to join me in making every possible effort, Mr President, to begin to give globalisation a human face if we want it to be sustainable in the long term."
"We cannot talk about globalisation and competitiveness when there are billions of men and women in the world who will go to sleep tonight not knowing whether they will have anything to eat tomorrow."
"If globalisation is to be sustainable in the long term, it must be inclusive, it must have a human face and it must include those who are currently marginalised."
"In Latin America, 44% of the population lives below the poverty line, and 21% of the population lives below the most extreme poverty line, on less than one dollar a day."
"If you do not have a social conscience, I would ask you to think in terms of trade."
"Look at the waste of a labour force that could be part of the production process to enable the economy to grow in a sustainable manner."
"Look at the waste of a potential market comprising these 44% of Latin Americans, who could consume more bread, more milk, more shirts and more shoes."
"If you do not want to consider the matter in terms of social fairness, look at it in terms of a business opportunity."
"I have come here today to share with you a concern that is latent in the heart of Latin America."
"I have raised this matter at the Guayaquil Conference of Presidents and at the General Assembly of the United Nations."
"Today, with great affection, but at the same time, with great frankness, I would like to speak my mind on a subject on which much still remains to be done, but I am raising it as an idea."
"The developing world, and Latin America in particular, is facing a huge challenge: the challenge of harmonising the responsible handling of economic policies."
"We have undergone 30 years of structural change, 30 years in which we have been asked to put our house in order economically; we have been trying, some more than others, with varying degrees of rigour."
"After 30 years of structural change, however, we have been unable to engage, we have been unable to connect structural change with a new period of sustained economic growth that generates jobs worthy of employees, that generates income and that increases internal consumption and consequently improves the quality of life of the people."
"Ladies and gentlemen of Parliament, Latin America is silently becoming disillusioned with democracy."
"We now find ourselves with a dilemma which North Americans would define by saying we need to reconcile Wall Street with Main Street."
"We cannot close our eyes and ears to the pots and pans that demonstrators are pounding in Argentina, Venezuela, Ecuador, Colombia and Uruguay."
"We cannot turn a blind eye to this situation."
"People are starting to wonder why there is so little work and so much poverty when they have all this democracy."
"The industrialised countries tell us that the way forward is to strengthen democratic institutions and that we should climb aboard the train of globalisation and competitiveness, while the man in the street is wondering how to meet his family's most basic needs."
"I know that I am deliberately simplifying the argument, to show that there is a great dilemma when it comes to reconciling the responsible handling of economic policies."
"Thirty years of unsuccessful change must not lead us to act irresponsibly."
"We must not advocate a return to populism."
"Something, however, must be done."
"The men and women of Latin America are starting to take to the streets to protest, and in doing so they are directly or indirectly beginning to complain about democracy."
"That is dangerous."
"I am telling you this as a fervent supporter of freedom, democracy, human rights and the environment."
"I cannot, however, turn a blind eye to what I am seeing and hearing."
"In Peru, 54% of men and women are condemned to living below the poverty level, and 23% are condemned to living below the extreme poverty level."
"What do we tell them?"
"We believe in democracy."
"Furthermore, some are now saying that under Fujimori's dictatorship they were better off."
"Something is happening in the region."
"I know that you are involved in meeting the great challenge of integrating Europe and perhaps I am distracting you by sharing my concern."
"If I am, however, I make no apologies."
"I would simply like to tell you that there is a continent that is prepared to buy and sell, that is prepared to live in harmony with democratic beliefs, with the defence of human rights and environmental protection."
"I hope that the process of European integration, which I admire, will not lead you to ignore what is happening in a continent which has great potential."
"In April or May the Member countries of the Rio Group will meet in Lima, and I have deliberately asked for the main topic to be finding the financial means to fund governability and democracy in Latin America."
"Democracy costs money - it is like a plant that needs to be watered after planting and we cannot take it for granted."
"Our hearts bleed when we see a sister nation such as Argentina."
"We are sad to see a possible chain reaction in the region and, however responsible we are in handling economic policy, nothing can shield us from the chain reaction due to which the region is once again swinging between new authoritarian regimes with different faces."
"We must be careful."
"Democracies cannot be overthrown by traditional military coups, but democracy can be weakened by a lack of tangible results for the poor."
"We have asked two international bodies to help us find financial mechanisms to nourish governability and democracy, beyond the agreements with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which set levels of debt for us, so that we can make commitments on fiscal deficit levels."
"I am in favour of this."
"We cannot allow ourselves to fall into populism, because the consequence is hyperinflation and hyperinflation makes the poor even poorer."
"What, however, is good about not having inflation?"
"Why should we faithfully comply with the recipe of the International Monetary Fund?"
"My government has just signed an agreement with the Fund, but what is the good of this if it does not produce the results that the poor expect, and they begin to lose faith in democracy?"
"The time has come to sit down together to consider creatively how to find financial mechanisms that go beyond levels of external debt and, without breaking fiscal and monetary discipline, allow us a greater degree of financial freedom to invest in public works that generate work and prevent governability and democracy in the region from being threatened."
"Ladies and gentlemen of Parliament, two weeks ago in my country there was a regional and municipal election and my party did not achieve good results."
"I could have used money, I could have offered gifts, I could have used populism and, probably, the electoral results would have been better for my party."
"I was not elected to govern on behalf of my party, however, I was elected to govern on behalf of all Peruvians and I have firmly decided not to adopt government decisions with the next elections in mind."
"I have decided to take State decisions with future generations in mind, and that is why I have paid a very high price."
"(Applause)"
"Managing the economy irresponsibly would have meant bread today and hunger tomorrow."
"I was born in a small town 4000 metres above sea level, in the Peruvian Andes, up in the clouds."
"I had the opportunity to get where I am today and I have arrived here, with the privilege of addressing the European Parliament, thanks to a single factor: education."
"(Applause)"
"I know that many might find my presence here strange."
"Some European parliamentarians have worked with me in the fight against dictatorship and corruption."
"I know that my presence could seem strange to many, because after 500 years, thanks to teachers and education, Peru has a President with my ethnic background who, as a result of a statistical error, has become President of the Republic."
"From now on, I undertake to do all I can to ensure that men and women like me might be Presidents of Peru."
"(Applause)"
"This comment concerns a State policy decision."
"I have come to ask you, my European friends, not to sell us weapons."
"Please, I beg you, do not sell us planes, boats or tanks."
"Let us change the priorities of our precarious public budget."
"When I took on the Presidency last year, I promised my people not to disappoint them."
"This year, 2002, I have decided to reduce military spending by 20% to redirect it to health and education for the poor in Peru."
"I am going to do so for the next five years."
"(Applause)"
"I know you are patient and are going to listen to me."
"Do not give us milk."
"Do not give us your agricultural products, please ?"
"(Applause)"
"... because your giving us milk and wheat represents unfair competition for Peruvian farmers."
"(Applause)"
"With the affection and admiration I have for this House, allow me to tell you quite frankly that the time has come to build a two-lane highway for trade."
"Do what you are asking us to do: open up your markets."
"(Applause)"
"You tell us we should operate an open economy. Yes, I agree."
"You tell us we should not subsidise our agriculture, and I agree."
"Do not, then, however, subsidise your agriculture."
"Open up your markets."
"(Applause)"
"The reason, dear friends, is simple, and I hope that you will take this in the spirit in which it is meant, from someone who admires the process of European integration: trade means work."
"If we cannot market our products we will have more unemployed men and women."
"If you ask us to do something that you are not prepared to do yourselves then you are not going to help us: let us do it together."
"If we believe that globalisation should be inclusive, we must join hands to include the poor in globalisation and one way of doing that is to build a two-lane trade highway."
"I like equality."
"I know you are doing this out of kindness."
"I know that you are providing food aid with humanitarian intent, but allow me to say, equally kindly, that the poor in Latin America may be poor but they have dignity."
"They do not want to be offered crumbs."
"All they ask is that you open up your markets on which we can sell our products, competing on quality and price."
"(Applause)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, it has fallen to me to govern a country following ten years of cruel dictatorship, associated with corruption and trafficking in drugs and arms."
"We were handed a country with justifiably high social expectations."
"We were handed a country that had been in recession for four years."
"We were handed a de-institutionalised country."
"We were handed a country that has lost faith in its politicians."
"Can you imagine in Europe having a prime minister or a president who would leave the Houses of Parliament by the back door to hide behind another nationality in Japan, and who would resign by fax?"
"This can only be imagined in the most surreal political situation."
"This event struck the very core of the men and women of Peru, who cannot believe it."
"We have the responsibility to restore faith and confidence."
"Three days after taking over the Presidency, groups were already demonstrating outside the Houses of Parliament giving vent to their expectations."
"I have not come here to boast of victories or triumphs, but I can tell you that the Peruvian economy has begun to experience growth, that inflation is under 1%, that international reserves are at their highest level, and that unemployment rates are slowly beginning to fall, although not as quickly as we would like."
"I now face the challenge of making these macroeconomic achievements felt in people's pockets."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am 56 years old and my journey has been long and difficult, but I have learnt that what does not kill you makes you stronger."
"I have come here today to share my personal conviction with you and tell you that the best investment that a family, or a society such as Peru, can make is to invest in its people's minds."
"This means, quite simply, investing in health, education and justice for the poor."
"Investment in health and education, as you know even better than I, is an investment with a high rate of return."
"The business of knowledge is low-risk, long-term and extremely mobile."
"Populist governments may take power but they will not be able to nationalise our people's knowledge."
"Governments in favour of excessive privatisation may take power but they will not be able to privatise what has been invested in people's minds."
"Today, Mr President, in conclusion, I would just like to tell you that the time has come to work together to ensure that freedom, democracy, respect for human rights and environmental protection are not just the concern of Latin America."
"Today I would like to share with you the thought that world economic health depends on the strength of the democratic institutions and global security."
"The Atlantic has become less of an obstacle."
"Globalisation and competitiveness, using technology, must have a human face and be more inclusive."
"We must achieve this by investing in health and education."
"Mr President, I wanted to share these individual thoughts with you, with all of you, ladies and gentlemen, because next April, in Peru, the Member countries of the Rio Group will meet specifically to examine a proposal to find mechanisms to finance governability and democracy in Latin America, in order to prevent the poor from starting to lose hope in democracy."
"We have come to learn from the experience of the European integration process."
"Latin America is trying to achieve its own integration."
"The Andean countries are trying to learn from the process you are undergoing."
"We want an integrated Andean Community, a stronger Latin America that would be able to engage in dialogue with the European Union, and I hope that at the Rio meeting we will be able to have observers from the European Union so that, with their experience, they can guide us in this process."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as you have been kind enough to give me the opportunity to speak, I would say that the millions of men and women in the world who are currently living on one dollar a day would like the European Union and other industrialised countries to make an effort to include the poor in the benefits of globalisation, giving it a human face, which would prevent the democratic institutions from being questioned and the poor from losing faith in democracy."
"(Applause)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 4 December 2002."
"The final draft agenda as drawn up pursuant to Rules 110 and 110a of the Rules of Procedure by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 12 December has been distributed."
"Mr President, I understand it is not possible to request a change, but may one protest against a change made by the Conference of Presidents?"
"Today we should have been debating the Napolitano report on the role of regional and local authorities in European integration."
"It is a vitally important issue, and Parliament should have been ready to give its opinion on this to the Convention before the end of this year."
"For example, this week the Fisheries Council is debating cod stocks and the common fisheries policy."
"Scotland, which is hugely interested in that, at the moment has a walk-on role."
"The role of the regions in Europe matters deeply to people all over Europe and this Parliament has, by a stitch-up between the big parties, declined to debate it, although we have had it before us since July."
"It is outrageous that this has been taken off the agenda."
"Mr President, this is a very acceptable suggestion, but there is a risk that, yet again, the Members' general opportunity to question the Commission at question time will be curtailed."
"Will question time be extended by a compensatory period please?"
"The plan, Mr MacCormick, is not to have them in competition with each other but to extend, if necessary, the appropriate sitting time."
"Tomorrow at noon we will award the Sakharov Prize."
"At 5 p.m. in room WIC 100, we will celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of the Sakharov Prize in the presence of many of the previous winners."
"After the ceremony, at 6.30 p.m., there will be a special exhibition on the fifteen years of the Prize which will take place in the area outside room WIC 100."
"I have raised this matter at the Conference of Presidents on every occasion on which I have met with the Turkish authorities."
"I have no more information than you have in respect of your correspondence."
"However, when I speak tomorrow afternoon I will return to that matter on the assumption that our wishes will not, at that stage, have been fulfilled."
"Wednesday"
"As regards the Council and Commission statements on safety at sea and measures to alleviate the effects of the Prestige disaster, I have received a request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists for resolutions to be tabled to wind up this debate."
"Mr President, this disaster, without going into the issue in depth and in view of the information becoming available to us, currently involves at least four Community countries: Spain, France, Portugal and Denmark."
"It does not just involve maritime safety, but it is a transversal issue which involves at least four committees (Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, Fisheries, Development and Cooperation and Legal Affairs and the Internal Market)."
"Therefore, not just in view of the dramatic situation in Galicia, but also thinking of the whole of the European Union, we must provide a response and also consider something which is important and which I hope has the agreement of the Group of the European Peoples' Party, at least it did last week: the creation of a committee of enquiry."
"A major and historic decision was taken at the Copenhagen Summit."
"A number of issues of specific institutional interest to Parliament arose."
"I will inform you of those."
"These matters can be further explored by the groups in the debate with the Danish Presidency."
"One is an agreement in principle that by the end of January we shall have worked our way through the procedures for the appointment of the 10 new Commissioners from the accession states, and for the appointment of the new Commission following the departure of the Prodi Commission."
"Work is already in hand regarding this matter."
"A number of suggestions were put forward by committees and groups, but we must close this process by the end of January."
"I would like to point out to the groups that by that time we need to bring closure to the calendar for the year 2004 on the issues of the appointment of the Commission, dates of election and our own internal procedures."
"Secondly, we have an indication that there has been considerable progress - for which I thank colleagues - on drawing up an interinstitutional agreement on better regulation and law-making."
"We have a commitment in principle across the institutions to try to bring closure to this matter before the spring summit meeting in Brussels."
"We have several months to work through the remaining issues before the deadline."
"I put the groups and various committees involved in this matter on notice in respect of that."
"Thirdly, a conclusion was reached that the European Convention should draw up its own final report in time for the European Council meeting at Thessaloniki."
"Again, in anticipating our work into the next calendar year, we need to bring forward, on time, any proposals we have on substance and timing to try to influence what happens then and in the period after that."
"With regard to the Prestige, I noted that Parliament would seek to give as much urgency as possible to the question of financial solidarity and urge the Commission to bring forward specific proposals to the House."
"I also pointed out that we would treat such proposals with appropriate urgency when the matter is presented to us."
"Finally, on human rights issues, I placed considerable emphasis on the dialogue with Russia on the question of human rights in Chechnya."
"My speech is available and the groups may wish, on institutional points in particular, to raise some of these issues in the course of our debate with the Council."
"I believe everyone in the House shares your appreciation and joy that Mr Paya Sardiñas has finally been given a visa so that he can attend tomorrow's ceremony."
"Mr President, last week I saw on Danish television Parliament's President in close communication with the member of his own party who is now the sitting President of the European Council, and I imagine, without being able to lip-read, that there were two related subjects that might have occupied these two colleagues."
"The first was Turkish accession to the EU, and the second was the issue of referendums."
"I shall not go into details regarding the first point but merely observe that the Turkish Government has now obtained a very effective lobbyist in the form of the United States of America's bellicose President who gets on the 'phone to both parties. What, however, was the problem for the Prime Minister and what emerged at our group meeting in Copenhagen was the fact that people back home could confuse Turkey's accession with the new treaty."
"Since, moreover, Parliament's President is a type of specialist in referendums, my question is as follows: what, in actual fact, was talked about?"
"You do not need to resort to lip reading."
"Just read the record."
"We will provide you with a copy of my speech."
"I will be happy to do it a second time."
"As you said, it is not the first time that I have been asked to do this."
"We have not had a specific response to the reply we gave on the last occasion."
"I will come back to you on this matter."
"As you know, Mr Scarbonchi, the decision in principle to attend has been taken."
"One of the key issues on the minds of group leaders has been the security of those who may go."
"This is a serious responsibility."
"We can discuss the matter again and review the current security situation at our Conference of Presidents meeting this week."
"The principles on this matter are clear but the need to protect Members' security is also paramount."
"My office will contact you for further details in order to follow up on that matter."
"Mr President, on a point of order, whilst welcoming the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union, I note that 1 January 2003 is the 30th anniversary of the accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark, each of which has made a distinctive contribution to this Union."
"In Britain the 30th anniversary is regarded as the pearl anniversary."
"Some might regard Britain as the grit in the oyster that has created the pearl."
"What is being done on 1 January to mark the 30th anniversary of the accession of these three great countries?"
"I have no idea what you and your colleagues are planning, Mr Perry."
"I plan to be with my family."
"Mr President, as of yesterday, train No 299 no longer exists: the glorious, legendary poor man's Orient Express, which ran from Brussels-Midi through Luxembourg, France and Switzerland to Milan in Italy, has been withdrawn."
"This was a historic train, used by countless migrants, and it was a useful alternative mode of travel for us Members of Parliament too, Mr President, for those who, for various reasons - health, time or, we must not be ashamed to admit, even fear - did not and still do not want to travel by air."
"By a unilateral decision of the Belgian State Railways, this train has been withdrawn."
"It is not clear why this should happen, at precisely the moment when Europe is trying to promote rail travel over road travel."
"This is therefore a decision which is to be disputed on two different grounds."
"As far as Italy is concerned, we are doing our part."
"Senator Giampaolo Bettamio, whom many of you will remember as a valuable member of the Parliamentary Bureau, has submitted a question to the Minister for Transport and Infrastructure."
"I urge you, Mr President, to make vigorous representations to the Belgian Government, calling for a reversal of this decision."
"It seems cruel that such a decision should be taken ten days before Christmas, given that this train was used greatly by migrants going home precisely for the Christmas festivities."
"Thank you in advance for your help, Mr President."
"Mr President, I am speaking to propose that this Parliament express its condemnation and rejection of the farcical presidential elections which took place in Equatorial Guinea."
"The lack of democratic guarantees and the obligation for the voters to indicate how they had voted led all the opposition candidates to withdraw their candidatures two hours after the beginning of the false electoral process."
"As you know, the current government of Teodoro Obiang did not allow the presence of observers from this Parliament nor international observers at these elections and, therefore, we believe that there are ample reasons for expressing a very firm and categorical condemnation of this electoral parody, which reflects the dictatorship suffered by the people of Guinea."
"Therefore, in the expectation that the plenum will express its opinion, we believe that, by means of its President or whatever channels he deems appropriate, we must express our condemnation of the lamentable electoral farce which took place yesterday."
"Mr President, forgive me for insisting: in this House we have discussed every imaginable subject but we have still not held a specific debate on the issue of world hunger."
"If we do not do anything now, a million people are condemned to die in a few months, but if we continue to do what the international community has done up until now, these famines will reoccur cyclically."
"We cannot continue to send agricultural surpluses which are constantly destroying the fragile agricultural economies of these countries."
"We have carried out 'everything but arms'; this is laudable, but entirely insufficient."
"We therefore need a specific, in-depth debate, which will lead to forward-thinking decisions in accordance with our current needs."
"Mr President, as you may be aware, there were a series of disgraceful riots in Oldham in the summer of 2000, provoked by members of extreme right wing groups such as the British National Party, the National Front and Combat 18."
"Film footage that appears to be that compiled by the local police has got into the hands of the local British National Party who are distributing it."
"Apart from the understandable security concerns of those involved, the apparent collusion between members of the local police and the British National Party can only cause concern to those who hope that the perpetrators on both sides will be dealt with by a system of justice that is blind to politics."
"I hope you will raise the matter with the British authorities."
"As I hope you have already done as well, Mr Ford."
"Mr President, three or four days ago, the Italian police handed over an Iraqi family to the liberal democrat government of Syria."
"The head of the family had been condemned to death 20 years ago for belonging to the organisation known as Muslim Brothers."
"We fear that the sentence might already have been carried out in Syria."
"This family was held at Malpensa airport for five days, was not allowed to have any contact with any other people and was then sent back to Syria without being informed of their right to apply for asylum."
"I call upon the European Parliament and its President to ask for more detailed information from the Italian Government."
"Mr President, I wish to draw your attention, and that of the Commission and the House, to the extremely serious events that have been taking place in East Timor, because this House has always supported the process of achieving independence and peace in East Timor, which is like a son or a daughter to this House and to the European Union, and to which we are committed."
"Extremely serious and somewhat mysterious uprisings and revolts have occurred in East Timor, which warrant the attention of the European authorities."
"I would ask the President to consider contacting President Xanana Gusmão in order to find out what is going on in East Timor, given our great concern for that country, which has only recently gained its independence."
"Mr President, I should like to point out to the House once again that, despite UN Security Council resolutions on Iraq and despite the fact that Saddham Hussein's regime appears to have kept to the dates set in Resolution 1441 and handed over a 12-page report on his weapons systems, President Bush is still telling anyone who will listen that they are unreliable and that he has decided to bomb Iraq."
"The other day, he even said he would have no hesitation in using nuclear weapons."
"At the same time, we have learned that the United States are funding Iraqi opposition parties, including the Conseil suprême de la Révolution islamique en Iraq, to the tune of USD 92 million."
"Those who appear to be fighting Islam and the Islamic revolutions are in fact funding them."
"Nor should we be surprised if the words of Bush senior come true."
"He said that, if it is in the interests of the United States, they will support and create terrorist organisations."
"I should like your comments or at the very least some sort of intervention to make Bush accountable for his actions, before he sends the whole planet up in smoke."
"I do not need to comment on everything that is said, but I will point out that these are matters that can be raised on the agenda and in the appropriate committees of the House."
"The next item is the report (A5-0425/2002) by Jean-Louis Bourlanges, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the typology of acts and the hierarchy of legislation in the European Union (2002/2140(INI))."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group I congratulate Mr Bourlanges on the remarkable degree of consensus he has managed to build in the committee around the main proposals in his report."
"It is a difficult subject."
"As Mr Amato said, there is nothing quite as complex as simplification."
"In trying to address the issue of simplifying our hierarchy of acts in the European Union, Mr Bourlanges has taken a very complex, difficult subject and tried to bring a certain rationality to it."
"For our part, we support his dual approach of, firstly, trying to rationalise the hierarchy by broadly defining three categories of acts: constitutional acts, legislative acts and implementing measures."
"There are obviously subcategories - we cannot simplify too much, unfortunately - but nonetheless there are these three main groupings."
"The other prong of his approach concerns the terminology or vocabulary, for instance regulations should in future be called 'laws' and directives in future should be called 'framework laws'."
"That seems sensible and would make our acts much more comprehensible to the public."
"I come to a point which is of particular importance, and which Mr Bourlanges touched on towards the end of his comments."
"It is this category of implementing act where we delegate the right to adopt certain types of act to the Commission."
"There is already a problem of terminology about what we call these acts, but nonetheless when we, as Parliament, and the Council, as a legislative authority, delegate powers to the Commission, currently exercised in the context of the comitology system, we need some fundamental change, some further steps forward on what has been agreed so far."
"Mr Bourlanges has indicated what we agreed in the committee, indeed amending his own original draft report, but coming to a text which will have a broad majority in this Parliament."
"The position we agreed was that yes, we as a Parliament, are willing - with the Council - to delegate such implementing powers, provided that we have the opportunity to call them back where necessary."
"It is not that we want to immerse ourselves in all the technical details of implementing measures."
"It is not that we want to substitute ourselves for the executive, but we need the guarantee that we can call back the powers if we do not like the way they are being exercised by the Commission."
"We have proposed that if either the Council by a qualified majority, or Parliament by a majority of its Members - in other words, not a narrow majority on a Thursday afternoon of 29 to 36 - decides to call back an implementing measure, then the Commission must either withdraw the measure, or their original measure will be subject to the full legislative procedure under codecision to confirm, amend or repeal the act in question."
"This is a simple system, one that would enable us to delegate far more than we do now, but it will also ensure democracy and transparency."
"I commend it to the House."
"Mr President, Mr Bourlanges should be congratulated on having drafted a good report on an extraordinarily complex set of questions."
"It is a report which will be of great interest to the Convention, which is itself studying these questions."
"The primary achievements are: firstly, to make a clearer distinction between legislative and executive acts; secondly, to rationalise the choice of the instruments available so that force will more clearly follow form and, thirdly, to bring in a clearer class of subordinate legislation which should contribute not only to the quality of primary legislation but also to the parliamentary scrutiny of what is passed."
"My main amendment on behalf of my group seeks to insist upon a separate amendment procedure for the second part of the Constitutional Treaty."
"It is essential that the policy chapters are susceptible to a softer form of revision than the existing unanimity, plus national ratification in all Member States."
"If we fail to bring in such a softer procedure, it may never be possible to alter the political chapters."
"If the Union insists on the same procedure for the first and second parts, what is the point of splitting the Treaty in the first place?"
"The PPE-DE and PSE Groups used to support the lighter procedure and I trust that their spokesmen will be able to enlighten us as to why they now seem to have changed their minds."
"Mr President, as always, every time Mr Bourlanges puts forward proposals, he rouses the entire European Parliament and all those who follow these types of issues to extremely interesting and stimulating intellectual effort."
"I would sincerely like to thank him for this, not least in that his proposals contain a number of points which my group considers to be important and positive."
"I cannot say the same for all his proposals, however, so I will focus on those which we feel to be most problematic."
"The Convention is faced with the issue which the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice Intergovernmental Conferences before it were unable to resolve, in other words the question of the hierarchy of acts and the distinction between the legislative and the implementing regulatory functions, which needs to be expressed more clearly."
"This is, as it was intended to be, the scope of the Bourlanges report, but we feel that the report has exceeded its mandate in including more problematic issues which, in our opinion, should have been discussed in more depth by Parliament and which we certainly cannot accept as the last word on the matter."
"I would mention, in particular, the proposals Mr Bourlanges makes regarding the constitutional revision procedure, which we as a group cannot endorse."
"Indeed, we advocate the subdivision - described by the rapporteur - of the European Union's normative system into three parts: the constitutional, the legislative and the regulatory."
"However, we feel that we cannot support the proposals he makes regarding the constitutional revision procedure because they are contradictory."
"We feel that it is not acceptable to stipulate the need for unanimous agreement by the Council and the representatives of the Member States and then say: 'Oh alright then, not everyone has to sign'."
"We cannot have it both ways: either we accept the principle that it is possible to revise the Treaties even without the unanimous support of all the Member States or we do not."
"Clearly, we or, at least, the majority of the group, are firmly in favour of the former."
"Another position which I feel it is important to stress concerns the legislative bloc."
"We feel that Article 308 should be amended because, as it stands - with adoption by a unanimous decision of the Council alone - it cannot possibly meet the need for flexibility in the definition of the competences of a 25-Member State Union."
"Furthermore, as regards the more specifically executive elements, we are opposed to the idea of a special organ or of specialised agencies with the task of monitoring the technical implementation of Community law. Our experience in this area has almost always been negative."
"Lastly, as regards the specific issue of comitology, I would just like to stress one point, namely the fact that the European Parliament and the Council are given a deadline of three months within which to make a decision."
"We feel that this is too long and that it would extend the implementing procedure unnecessarily."
"In any case, it has proved difficult to apply effectively."
"This is a question which we need to highlight and explore further, and I hope that this will not be Parliament's final word on the matter."
"Mr President, I must begin by apologising for being delayed, thank to the vicissitudes of the European travel system."
"Mr Bourlanges's report is, in my view, an extremely virtuoso piece of work and, I must say, as an individual, I admire it very much."
"However, it reflects a very different tradition of political thinking from that in my own country."
"After all, what he has done is to create a theoretical template into which the workings of the European institutions and, in particular, certain aspects of the relationship between the European Parliament and the other institutions should be inserted."
"I believe this is the wrong way around."
"Rather, the best solution to the matters and problems he raises is to decide on the particular procedures, processes and mechanisms needed to handle most effectively the particular issues concerned and then to define and describe the workings of the European Union in that way."
"Quite regardless of the subject matter, some of which we Conservatives like and some of which we do not, we shall be voting against the report because we believe it looks at its subject matter the wrong way around - in a way that we believe is wrong for Europe."
"Mr President, I am in favour, intellectually, of the process of streamlining and simplifying, so well argued by Jean-Louis Bourlanges."
"I am in favour because he takes account of the long theoretical work that this Parliament has been developing since Maastricht, because this is a parliamentary acquis that must be included in the text of the Convention and lastly, because this work has resulted in clear instruments and effective decision-making procedures, which are crucial to the smooth functioning of the future Union."
"Unfortunately, Mr Bourlanges, in the text's philosophical and theoretical subconscious - for example, in paragraph 5, second indent - we can discern a terrible distrust of the small and medium-sized States which makes me unwilling at the present time to adopt the report, for various and quite straightforward reasons."
"It is the differences between the large States on the major issues that have impeded the Union's progress."
"It is not through any lack of will on the part of the small States that the United Kingdom has not signed up to the euro or to the Schengen area!"
"And nor can the small States be held responsible for the absence of a Social Europe, the small size of the budget, the lack of reform of the CAP, the crisis in structural policy or the limitations of the judicial instruments of the area of freedom, security and justice."
"We cannot, then, where the size of States is concerned, recall the perennial response of the unforgettable chief of police in Casablanca, which was to 'round up the usual suspects'!"
"It is not square kilometres, longitudes, latitudes and per capita GDP that determine how important countries are to the common interest, the European interest!"
"For this very reason, these criteria cannot be used to impose finalised constitutional solutions, leaving anyone who does not agree standing in the hallway, in other words, one step away from the door leading out."
"Perhaps Mr Bourlanges, with his intelligence, knowledge and unswervingly pro-European attitude, should have explored this point further and fought harder to find a reasonable and consensual solution."
"I hope he will do this, at least by tomorrow."
"Mr President, I should like to say thank you to the rapporteur for his tireless enthusiasm for European development and for his splendid and very detailed report."
"I would nonetheless draw attention to two points about which I disagree."
"The first point concerns the procedure for revising the treaties."
"I completely agree that, against the background of the work in the Convention, it is clear that, in the future, we must use the Convention method for treaty amendments."
"That is something we have in any case learned from this process."
"I must nonetheless declare myself to be in complete disagreement with the rapporteur's proposal with regard to changing the ratification procedure itself."
"I do not believe that it would be in keeping with the prevailing spirit of our Community if we were to take control of the EU's development away from the Member States."
"I am in actual fact afraid that such a procedure would in itself stand in the way of development in this Europe of ours because people back home would be very sceptical about giving Europe more competences if, for example, they were not to feel that they were in control of what was going on."
"I think, therefore, that we have to recognise that Europe is founded upon its citizens and nations but that the sustaining, constituent units of our Union are the Member States and that this must naturally be reflected in our ratification procedure."
"We ought quite simply to stick to the procedure we have at present."
"The second point concerns the place of the social dialogue in the Community."
"The rapporteur is trying to have a procedure of approval by the Council and the European Parliament introduced whenever the two sides of industry have arrived at a proposal."
"I believe that such a procedure would give rise to an irrelevant third party in the social dialogue."
"The idea of the social dialogue is, of course, precisely that the two sides of industry should enter into binding agreements with each other and that there should be no irrelevant parties - in this case, legislators - involved in such agreements."
"If we are serious about beginning a social dialogue and perhaps, in time, creating proper European agreements, we must recognise that it is the two sides of industry themselves which must negotiate and that the legislators must stay outside the process."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as it happens that I am the last to speak, by the same token I shall be the last to compliment Mr Bourlanges on his report, but I am not alone in doing so."
"This report is indeed remarkable in many aspects."
"First of all, because it covers in depth one of the fundamental points of the issues raised at Laeken."
"Secondly, because of its rigour, effectiveness and the concise proposals that Parliament formulates in the report, which do indeed lead to genuine simplification of our legislative system, which the rapporteur himself, Mr Bourlanges, described as rather chaotic."
"Lastly, I must say, because of the extremely rich, clever, skilful pen of your rapporteur, whose talent contradicts each day what a great French diplomat used to say."
"This diplomat, Mr Talleyrand, who Mr Bourlanges knows well, used to claim, quite wrongly, that spirit may be very useful but does not lead anywhere."
"On the contrary, Mr Bourlanges, your spirited report leads to a very well-argued resolution."
"I would like to express the Commission's full approval of most of the conclusions of this resolution, in accordance, furthermore, with our own communication, which I prepared with President Prodi and my colleague Mr Vitorino here on 5 December last with regard to the institutional framework."
"Mr President, I would like to emphasise three points."
"The first concerns the actual principle of the organisation of the legal structure of the Union in three blocs - constitutional, legislative and implementing - which would provide the operation of the Union with the clarity that is sorely lacking today."
"This reorganisation is indispensable if we are to clarify the legislative role of each institution: the responsibility of the European Parliament and the Council for laying down legislative acts and the primary responsibility of the Commission for ensuring that legislative acts are applied and adopting implementing acts."
"Naturally, adoption and revision procedures for future constitutional treaties are also important. The Commission, like Parliament, would like to call on the Convention as a model for these procedures more frequently from now on."
"Over and above procedural issues, Parliament and the Commission share the same point of view on the need to include sectoral policies within the constitutional treaty."
"Yet again, I must reiterate that we cannot have strong institutions with weak policies."
"My second point, ladies and gentlemen, which is fundamental to this report, concerns the creation of a genuine legislative bloc."
"The time has come to call a spade, a spade, as you say yourself, and therefore to talk about European laws."
"These laws will be adopted by a legislative authority divided into two equal arms; they will be adopted by means of a single procedure, the egalitarian codecision procedure that Mr Leinen rightly focused on earlier on."
"Here, at last, is an option that would provide all the citizens with a clear, transparent plan, although it is clear that certain aspects of the codecision procedure would need to be streamlined."
"Furthermore, specific adjustments certainly need to be made in the area of organic laws or budgetary acts, and your report, Mr Bourlanges, paves the way for this to take place."
"My third point concerns the role you would like the European Commission to play in implementing legislation."
"I am not talking here about actual governmental functions, although I would note in passing that we should also clarify the exercising of these functions, which must be shared between the Commission, which proposes, and the Council, which decides, with appropriate information provided to the European Parliament."
"This applies to the fields of police and justice and to the field of common foreign and security policy."
"With regard to Community competence to implement European legislation, however, we, like you, would like this to be clearly awarded to the Commission and monitored equally by Parliament and the Council, in other words by the two arms of the legislative and budgetary authority."
"Mrs Randzio-Plath has emphasised this point, moreover."
"We need to carry out fundamental rationalisation to know who does what in the European Union and introduce greater transparency and accountability into the exercising of these implementing competences."
"It is in this regard, ladies and gentlemen, that I must inform you of two concerns the Commission has on two points in your report."
"The first was raised by Mrs Frassoni earlier."
"It relates to the possibility of awarding at least part of these implementing competences to an authority other than the Commission."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must avoid encouraging or facilitating what could be perceived as dismantling regulatory power in the European Union."
"The second point that concerns us, and Mr Corbett and Mrs Bérès, amongst others, have raised it, is that of granting Parliament and the Council a generalised right of veto with regard to implementing measures."
"I am indeed talking about implementing measures."
"This point is currently the subject - although some of the details may be different - of a reasoned discussion within the context of the preparation of the draft interinstitutional agreement on improving legislation, and my colleague, Mrs de Palacio, will discuss it here tomorrow."
"I shall not repeat the Commission's position, as it is already well-known."
"Allow me simply to say that, as regards implementing measures each institution must be able to exercise its prerogatives autonomously, in harmony with the other institutions, and must avoid burdening the citizens and economic entities with the risk of legal insecurity."
"Mr President, in conclusion, I would like to congratulate the members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and your rapporteur most sincerely on the inspired work they have achieved with this report."
"We shall have to fight to impose the ambitious conclusions arising from the report."
"Mr Bourlanges, ladies and gentlemen, there is some distance between the Bourlanges report, as you are able to adopt it, and the conclusions of the Convention working group headed by Mr Amato."
"In order to bridge this gap when the future constitutional treaty is drafted, it is essential for the Commission and Parliament to continue to take the same line within the Convention."
"You can count on Mr Vitorino and myself for that."
"This is an element that Mrs Kaufmann and Mr Duff raised earlier, which makes Mr Bourlanges' report all the more useful and relevant."
"The next item is the report (A5-0436/2002) by Mr Coelho, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiatives by the Kingdom of Spain with a view to adopting:"
"1. a Council decision concerning the introduction of some new functions for the Schengen Information System, in particular in the fight against terrorism,"
"2. a Council regulation concerning the introduction of some new functions for the Schengen Information System, in particular in the fight against terrorism."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Schengen Information System (SIS) is a system of computer networks on which the information provided by the Schengen States is stored and consulted by the police and customs authorities of other Schengen States."
"The SIS is the largest database in Europe and has a dual function: firstly to maintain public order and security and, secondly, to deal with immigration, providing support for measures intended to compensate for the free movement of persons."
"In this context, two Spanish initiatives were submitted to us in the aim of giving the SIS new functions, primarily for combating terrorism."
"I must express my regret that this report, for internal European Parliament reasons, confines itself to these two Spanish initiatives and does not also cover, as initially intended, a resolution on the Commission communication on the development of the future SIS-II, which contains proposals to increase the system's capacity, and to introduce new technical and research possibilities. I am sorry, in particular, because the two Spanish initiatives seek to include improvements in the current version of the SIS that must necessarily reflect the long-term aims of SIS-II and, consequently, must be considered to be an integral part of the process of transition from SIS-I to SIS-II."
"Having made a thorough study of the Spanish initiatives, we have reached the conclusion that, although we are unable to subscribe to them fully, they can be accepted if some amendments are made to them that are basically designed to ensure that guarantees of the protection of citizens' rights are not called into question, thereby responding to the European Parliament's main concern throughout this process."
"Some proposals contained in the Spanish initiatives are acceptable, such as access by Europol or by Eurojust, provided that appropriate guarantees are put in place to ensure the legitimacy and the legality of any use of data."
"This being the case, the conditions laid down in Amendments No 7, concerning Europol and No 10, which I tabled, concerning Eurojust, must be met before access can be granted."
"If this access for new users is made possible, the purpose for which it is granted must always be respected, limiting this access to information which they have the right to access and ensuring that at least the same if not a greater level of protection of our citizens' rights is in place."
"It is also important that Europol and Eurojust's needs to access the SIS data are more rigorously examined and justified."
"The proposals for the full recording of searches are to be welcomed, but it seems appropriate to specify in the Article what information must be recorded."
"A legal basis must also be provided for the operation of the Sirene offices, an idea that I had already suggested in my report of June 2001, and which forces these offices to remove data whenever this proves necessary."
"On the other hand, these two initiatives contain other proposals that, in our opinion, must await the development of SIS-II, when appropriate guarantees are put in place."
"This applies to the proposal to extend access to data on missing, stolen or lost identity documents."
"Although I have no objections in principle, I feel that, in the absence of additional measures to protect the rights of persons whose documents have been stolen, whose identity is used illegally or those whose data are simply input incorrectly into the SIS, the European Parliament cannot, at this stage, approve this proposal, which is likely to aggravate the problems of citizens whose identity has been usurped."
"The same applies to the proposal to add additional data on wanted persons and to incorporate identification material in alerts on persons, notably photographs and fingerprints, on which adequate guarantees must first be adopted."
"The Commission has commissioned a feasibility study to be undertaken on the development of SIS-II, which should be available in March 2003."
"I hope that the European Parliament will then have the opportunity to deliver an opinion on these conclusions."
"I wish once again to express my unhappiness at the fact that this feasibility study will not be looking into the possibility of combining the Schengen, Europol, customs and possibly Eurojust databases into one database, in the aim of eliminating duplication, streamlining resources and improving accuracy; a common database that would be made available to different users in a different way, guaranteeing restricted and specific access to the various areas of the database."
"It appears that there is already political agreement on the need to create a new SIS - this is a Council decision with a legal basis for the development of SIS-II, and with the necessary budget."
"The way in which this will be managed will be determined in a future document."
"I wish to recall that this has been the clear position of this Parliament: this management must be undertaken by the Commission and must be subject to parliamentary and judicial control."
"It is to be hoped that SIS-II will be developed by 2006."
"Given the danger of this development taking longer than planned, however, I think it is acceptable and appropriate for us to be making some improvements - at least those that are possible at this stage - to the SIS in force."
"Lastly, Mr President, I wish to thank all my colleagues in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, whose amendments have contributed to improving this report. I should also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation and, particularly, the socialist shadow rapporteur, Sérgio Sousa Pinto."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, Carlos Coelho, on his excellent report, which, in clear and concise terms, contributes to improving the Council's draft initiatives on the new functions of the Schengen Information System."
"In fact, I can even add that some of the amendments proposed by the rapporteur are already included in the texts of the Council working group studying these initiatives."
"The draft initiatives in question will be discussed for the first time at the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 19 December, in the Joint Committee with Iceland and Norway, and the Commission is willing to support several of the concerns expressed by the rapporteur and which, I am sure, Parliament's plenary will support."
"In particular, I agree with the opinion on the need to limit Europol's access to the categories of data recorded under Articles 95, 99 and 100 of the Schengen Convention and to ensure that the data in question will be neither copied nor downloaded."
"This access must not transform the SIS into a research tool and nor must it be in any way disproportionate to the reasons for such access being granted."
"In my opinion, this type of access can be particularly useful in giving Europol the opportunity to request additional information from the Member States in specific cases they are investigating, in the context of the fight against terrorism, for example."
"This is, as a matter of fact, the type of information that Europol is already authorised to request and obtain directly from Member States."
"With regard to data protection, the Commission believes that the new provisions concerning the SIS, which falls partially within the sphere of Community competence, particularly with regard to Article 96, must be studied in light of their compatibility not only with the Council of Europe's 1981 Convention on data protection, but also with the content of Directive 45/96/EC."
"Similarly, the study of the proportionality of certain measures can be facilitated through consultation with the competent authorities, whether they are acting under the third or the first pillar."
"In this regard, we particularly appreciate the opinion of the Joint Supervisory Authority on these draft initiatives, with which we largely agree, including the reference to the fact that extended access must be granted to the authorities responsible for issuing residence permits, to the data of Article 100 of the security information system where identity documents are concerned; safeguards must be in place, however, to ensure that such access will not infringe the rights of citizens whose identity documents have been stolen."
"I believe that this matter, raised by the rapporteur and which is extremely significant, cannot be resolved solely by developing new technical solutions or by introducing new functions, as Mr Coelho said, for SIS-II, which, in principle, will become operational in 2006."
"This matter must be addressed now and must above all be accompanied by the necessary information to the citizens about the existence of the Schengen Information System and on the conditions governing its use, including the need to delete some details in the event that documents are stolen or lost."
"As to Schengen Information System-II, as the rapporteur said, the Commission was given the task of developing the new generation SIS in January 2002 and we anticipated a global approach to its functions in the communication that we presented to the Council and to Parliament on 18 December 2001."
"To put it succinctly, I should like to say to the House that the timetable for the preparation of SIS-II has so far been met and that the feasibility study is due to be concluded in March 2003."
"This will enable us better to help candidate countries prepare for the future elimination of internal borders, which can only take place when SIS-II becomes operational."
"A report by the Commission services is now being finalised, describing in detail the current state of play of this study, which will be conveyed to the European Parliament and to the Council at the beginning of next year."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Coelho, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on his work."
"The report makes a balanced evaluation of the two Spanish initiatives on giving new functions to the Schengen Information System, which is especially important in the fight against terrorism."
"Following the attacks of 11 September 2001, the Council, together with the Commission, drafted a package of measures intended to increase the level of security in Europe and to ensure the highest degree of effectiveness in combating terrorism."
"Some of these measures have a direct effect on the Schengen Information System."
"Since SIS-II will only be operational in 2006, improving the current system is an urgent need that must be seen as part of the process of transition to the new system."
"These new functions will, of course, have to be adopted in total compliance with our citizens' individual rights, freedoms and guarantees, with strict control of the use of personal data available in the SIS."
"We all understand the need to have efficient information systems, which are equal to the task of the challenges we face from international crime, but we can never use this as an excuse for disrespecting or ignoring the fundamental principles on which the Union is founded as a Community governed by the rule of law."
"We are therefore attempting to amend certain Articles of the Schengen Convention in the aim of giving it new functions."
"Giving Europol and the national members of Eurojust the opportunity to access certain data in the SIS is one of the most important practical proposals of this initiative."
"The need to improve cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs and, in particular, the linking and crosschecking of information from databases, is one of the aims that the European Union and the Member States must pursue."
"Against this backdrop, the fact that the SIS was created to support the Member States in areas involving public order and domestic security, areas that are covered by the action of Europol and Eurojust, leads us to approve the principle of exchanging information underlying the proposal contained in the Spanish initiative."
"Nevertheless, as emphasised by the Schengen Joint Supervisory Authority, the body responsible for monitoring the SIS, access to the database by Europol and the national members of Eurojust raises doubts in terms of data protection and can only become a reality if the basic principle of the legitimacy and legality of access to the database and its use is respected."
"In this context of having some reservations about the initial Spanish proposals, we welcome the rapporteur's introduction of amendments that we believe respond to the concerns expressed by the Joint Supervisory Authority and by various members of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"The European Police Service will therefore have the right to consult and study SIS data only for the purposes for which these data were provided."
"As to access by the national members of Eurojust, these will have the right to consult SIS data only if this right is compatible with the purposes for which the data were provided."
"National members of Eurojust will have to record all searches they undertake and will not be able to supply data to third countries or to other bodies."
"Other proposals contained in the initiative were rejected, in my opinion rightly so, by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms at the proposal of the rapporteur, because they did not provide sufficient guarantees, and it would therefore be preferable to continue to await SIS-II."
"This applies primarily to the proposal seeking to give the bodies responsible for issuing and studying permits the opportunity to access the data contained in the SIS."
"For the reasons I have given, the report Carlos Coelho has presented deserves the applause and the support of the Socialist Group."
"Mr President, following the friendly observation directed to me by Mr von Boetticher, I wish to say that I am in no doubt that there are criminals outside Europe but that they are nonetheless small fry in comparison with those within the European Union's own institutions."
"I merely need to quote the name, beginning with a 'B', of a future President of the European Council who is to take office in just over six months' time."
"There is of course a type of criminal beside whom the small fry we have outside the EU pale into insignificance."
"That was an aside."
"My main criticism and my attitude to the proposals before us are expressed in a minority opinion on the report."
"They are based on the wonder I have always felt at the European Union's and its institutions' ability to empty the language of meaning and, in certain cases, to make the language mean the opposite of what was intended."
"Opposition to the proposals before us is based on the fact that surveillance technology is being reinforced but that insufficient attention is being given to the rule of law, in spite of protests to the contrary."
"I merely need to cite an example in the form of Article 101a of the proposal concerning Europol's access to the Schengen Information System."
"A number of basic requirements are made of Europol, but there is no reasonable guarantee whatsoever that Europol will comply with those requirements."
"There is the supervisory body provided for by Article 24 of the Europol Convention, but all that may be said with certainty about this supervisory body is that it is genuinely powerless in relation to the huge scope for abuse in the overall system."
"I must add, moreover, that what makes matters more alarming from the point of view of the rule of law is that the powers in question are linked to an extremely unclear concept of terrorism."
"I am able, in this Assembly, to say that the old Danish proverb applies here about selling elastic by the metre and, as my fellow countrymen know, that is something which only people of a very trustworthy character can do."
"There is no reasonable likelihood of the bodies concerned being of a sufficiently trustworthy character."
"The rule of law will sustain irreparable damage."
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0404/2002) by Mrs Damião, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Council common position for adopting a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos at work."
"Mr President, you have given me the floor as rapporteur but in fact the name on the report is that of Mrs Damião."
"I would like to begin by sincerely thanking her for the hard work that she has done on this dossier."
"Sadly, she is ill and is only slowly recovering."
"I know I speak for everyone when I say I wish her the fullest and speediest possible recovery."
"I would like to thank the Council too for the adoption of a common position which strengthens the Commission's original proposal and also incorporates a number of the European Parliament's first reading amendments."
"Parliament particularly welcomes the inclusion of a new point in the proposed directive to prohibit all activities exposing workers to asbestos fibres, except demolition work and disposal of waste products resulting from demolition and removal work."
"The whole thrust of the proposal is to protect workers engaged in those activities and repair work, which will bring workers into contact with asbestos locked up in the built environment for many years to come."
"It is with this in mind that in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs we have adopted three amendments at second reading, designed to strengthen still further the common position."
"A quick word about each of those amendments: Article 3(3) of the proposal derogates from important elements of the directive in respect of workers whose exposure is of a sporadic and low intensity."
"This was too open-ended for the Employment Committee and, therefore, we wanted to pin down that definition of sporadic and low intensity still further."
"Amendment No 1 does this by specifying that Member States, in accordance with their normal tradition and practice, will consult with both sides of industry and lay down practical guidelines for determining work of this kind."
"We think that is an important step in the right direction."
"Amendment No 2 makes provision for breaks for workers obliged to wear individual breathing equipment because of their potential exposure."
"Again, we think this is an important step."
"It is extremely uncomfortable to work for long periods in individual breathing equipment."
"The Council had some resistance to Amendment No 3 initially, but we felt it was important that we included a specific mention of sanctions and, in the end, we have included a text which has been used quite often in other social and employment dossiers in the past."
"We are quite pleased with that as well."
"Overall, we have had very good cooperation with the Danish Presidency on this dossier - to such an extent that we feel we can reach agreement at second reading with the assurances we now have from COREPER that the Council will be willing to accept these three amendments adopted in the Employment Committee."
"It is my hope that, with these three amendments adopted and voted upon tomorrow, the Danes can take this forward as an 'A' point on 20 December and they will be adopted very quickly."
"I say I hope that will be the case because the deadline for amendments on this dossier closed only a few minutes ago."
"I hope that no groups have taken advantage of that deadline to table amendments."
"If they have, I can say with absolute certainty that those amendments will not be carried in the House - we know that from the margins in the Employment Committee."
"But it would delay the adoption of this dossier beyond the Danish Presidency into the spring - the earliest would be March under the Greek Presidency."
"That would simply lead to a further delay of weeks, if not months, before this directive could be agreed."
"That would put back its final adoption and implementation within the European Union and during that delay additional workers would inevitably be exposed to asbestos fibres and, over time, might die as a consequence of that exposure."
"So I hope no groups will take advantage of that deadline - if any have, I hope they will, even at this late stage, withdraw those amendments."
"Therefore, I would hope we could include this on the voting list tomorrow."
"Everyone has had the amendments agreed in committee for a couple of weeks now in translation."
"That would allow the Commission to deal with this dossier at its meeting tomorrow afternoon and that, in turn, would allow the Danes to deal with it on 20 December."
"If we do not find that additional amendments have been tabled or if they are withdrawn, I would ask you, Mr President, to use your good offices to have this added to the voting list tomorrow lunchtime."
"Mr President, I would like to express to the rapporteur, Mrs Damião, my best wishes for a speedy recovery, and to congratulate her and Mr Hughes on their excellent work on such a sensitive and technically difficult dossier as asbestos."
"I want also to express my satisfaction at the unanimous conviction that the protection of workers against the risks of exposure to asbestos must be improved."
"The Commission attaches the greatest importance to all measures designed to protect the health and safety of workers."
"We have emphasised this interest in the social agenda and confirmed it in the Commission's communication on a new Community strategy on health and safety at work."
"It is with great satisfaction that I can inform you that the Commission fully accepts the three amendments that Parliament has proposed in this second reading."
"I would like to congratulate the House for the quality of the amendments presented, which are an expression of the European Parliament's preoccupation with the risks and effects of exposure to asbestos and the need to increase the levels of protection of European workers still exposed to asbestos."
"The Commission is convinced that the three proposed amendments improve the text and contribute to a better application of the directive."
"You are aware of the great breakthrough already achieved by the Council's common position: the banning of all activities which expose workers to asbestos fibres during the extraction of asbestos or the manufacture and processing of asbestos products, or the manufacture and processing of products containing intentionally added asbestos, with some unavoidable and very limited exceptions."
"Finally, I would like to thank Parliament, as well as the Danish Presidency and the Council, for their work to date on this issue."
"We should not forget that the effects of exposure to asbestos have dramatic repercussions for workers' health and even for their families."
"With the quick adoption of this important directive, we will demonstrate that the health and safety of our workforce is at the top of our agenda."
"Mr President, I wish to thank Mrs Damião for all her work and I hope that she will get well soon."
"Every year 4 500 people die from asbestos-related diseases in the UK alone."
"It is predicted that 250 000 will die in the European Union of these diseases in the next 35 years."
"Medical and scientific evidence demonstrates that there is a real need for this directive."
"I am delighted that the production and marketing of asbestos will be banned across the EU from 2005."
"Thankfully, it has already been banned in the UK."
"However, there are still millions of tonnes of asbestos in Europe's buildings throughout the European Union."
"Those buildings will have to be demolished at some point, and the asbestos will have to be removed, repaired or maintained, with the consequent effect on the health and safety of all those asbestos workers."
"I welcome the fact that this directive will lower the exposure limit values for asbestos."
"I emphatically support the three amendments Mr Hughes has talked about."
"However, I was extremely disappointed that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs changed its mind after first reading; my amendments, which were not accepted, would have halved the exposure limit value."
"The committee's reasoning, as I understand it, was that, since the Council had not accepted my amendments, there was no point in going to conciliation as it would not have accepted them in future."
"However, we know from experience that the Council quite often changes it mind during the conciliation procedure, and it seems a great shame that we did not pursue those amendments."
"Had it saved just one asbestos worker's life, it would have been worth it."
"Nevertheless, I decided against retabling the amendments because I did not have the support of the Committee on Employment or the other groups in this House."
"Even though I would have liked to have seen the directive go further, it is still a very good directive and will save asbestos workers' lives across the EU."
"For that reason, I will advise my group to vote for this directive, because it is greatly needed."
"Mr President, I should like to say thank you to the rapporteur and to those who have planned this Assembly, for it is the first time in a long time that this House is being given permission to debate at a reasonable hour an important subject concerned with the working environment."
"We are used to meeting close to midnight, so it is splendid to be here today and see everyone awake."
"We all know that asbestos is one of the greatest threats to workers' health in the EU."
"It is estimated that, over the next 35 years, up to 500 000 deaths will be directly related to the serious illnesses caused by asbestos."
"I think that experience with asbestos and the debate in Parliament and elsewhere show very clearly how incredibly important it is that we take the precautionary principle very seriously."
"For many years, this principle was not taken seriously, and we can see the consequences today."
"I am therefore also pleased that all the groups in Parliament have chosen to support this directive."
"I cannot refrain from saying today that I should also like to see Liberals also being supportive in connection with other problems concerned with the working environment and showing a desire, which they have not always displayed, to take other problems in this area just as seriously as they have shown they take those arising from asbestos."
"Overall, the present proposal provides workers with better protection, and I am pleased that many of Parliament's proposals have been approved by the Council."
"It is now proposed that employers should provide education programmes so that workers are clearer as to how they can protect themselves, and it is great progress that employers' responsibility for this area has been made so very clear."
"I would also now call upon the Member States to go still further than the directive, and I believe that the three amendments adopted by the committee will improve the directive still further."
"It would, of course, also be splendid if the Council could express a positive attitude today, for it would mean that, quickly and within the coming week, we could bring our reading of this directive to a close, something which I would call upon us to do."
"There are many things we could have done better but, if we conclude the procedure now, it could save a number of workers from these very serious illnesses."
"I therefore hope that the Council will approve the amendments and that we can obtain a directive as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, like my colleague, Mrs Thorning-Schmidt, I was looking forward to a midnight speaking slot, as this is a health and safety issue!"
"It is quite symbolic that we are speaking about this matter at a reasonable time because it goes so much further than just health and safety."
"This morning in the United Kingdom, in our flagship news programme, the Today Programme, unusually the question of asbestos was raised at another reasonable hour."
"It was raised because of the matter that Mrs Thorning-Schmidt raised, namely the implementation of this directive."
"So effective has the work been on this particular directive and matter, and so effective is the way the debate has gone and the agreement between the political groups that Member States are now looking carefully at the way we implement the directive."
"This morning the Health and Safety Executive set out for the United Kingdom exactly how this directive would be implemented, the way that even small- and medium-size enterprises would find a way through this health and safety legislation."
"It is important; it has huge agreement, but we must also understand the real dangers."
"Not only will the Member States start to implement this - and we must monitor it carefully - but candidate countries are using asbestos at a level we can only estimate, but it is quite a dangerous level."
"So we must set the tone through implementation of this directive, pay tribute to the way Parliament has discussed this and ensure that we in the EU Member States and the candidate countries make something of this directive to reflect the level of debate in this House."
"Mr President, although 13 countries have banned and, for the most part, done away with asbestos, because it is a proven carcinogenic, Greece is still applying Community legislation which allows asbestos to be used until 2005, thereby endangering the lives and health both of workers in the sector and society as a whole."
"Environmental protection and protection for public health are clearly not the European Union's priorities, despite what it may say."
"Its priority is to pursue maximum profits for big business."
"The asbestos scandal is a blatant example of the cruelty of the capitalist system and it is high time action was taken to ban the extraction, processing and use of asbestos products."
"At the same time, measures need to be taken to protect public health from asbestos and to compensate workers in the sector for the damage which their health has suffered all these years."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0384/2002) by Mrs Breyer, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Communication from the Commission on foods and food ingredients authorised for treatment with ionising radiation in the Community (COM(2001) 472 - C5-0010/2002 - 2002/2008(COS))."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Breyer, for her report which responds to the question put forward by the Commission."
"The question was which foods should be allowed to be irradiated in the European Union?"
"The Commission put this question to Parliament and the Council following a consultation of industry and consumer organisations and other interested parties."
"The consultation received a polarised response."
"Stakeholders were either totally against this technology or in favour of it."
"There would seem to be no common ground between these two camps."
"Currently, the European Union-wide positive list of products authorised for irradiation treatment contains only dried aromatic herbs, spices and vegetable seasonings."
"For the completion of this list, the Commission presented three options for discussion."
"The first option proposed allowing the irradiation of shrimps and frogs' legs, as these foods are often imported from subtropical and tropical countries and a certain microbe content can hardly be avoided."
"The second option proposed to allow the irradiation of a number of foods in addition to shrimps and frogs' legs, all of which have been, and continue to be, irradiated in the Member States in substantial amounts."
"Such foods include dried fruits, cereals, chicken, offal, egg white and gum arabic."
"The third option proposed that the current positive list should be regarded as complete, which would mean that only dried aromatic herbs, spices and vegetable seasonings could be irradiated in the European Union."
"The report adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy provides the possibility of adding further products to the current positive list if the safety of these products can be proven."
"The adoption of Amendments Nos 2 and 3 tabled by the rapporteur and other Members of Parliament would, however, result in the third option, which is the most restrictive one."
"The Commission will take note of Parliament's conclusions but must await the reaction of the Council before making any formal proposal."
"However, I would like, on behalf of my colleague, Mr Byrne, to take this opportunity to clarify a few points."
"First, I would like clearly to reiterate that the Scientific Committee on Food has concluded that irradiated foods are safe."
"This opinion is based on many scientific studies and is shared by the World Health Organisation and scientific bodies."
"Therefore, additional toxicology studies are not required, as the views of the scientific community are very clear on this issue."
"There are many misconceptions about this technique."
"I would stress that not all foods can or will be irradiated."
"This is a similar situation to cooking and freezing: not all foods are cooked and not all foods are put in the refrigerator."
"Irradiation is just one method of food preservation."
"For some foods it is better than other techniques, for others it is not."
"The European Union has very strict labelling rules for irradiated foods."
"Even if a compound food contains only small amounts of irradiated ingredients, this fact has to be clearly indicated."
"We also have the technical tools to enforce correct labelling."
"The Commission has financed the development and standardisation of methods for the detection of irradiated foods."
"These methods are used by the food control authorities to check foods on the market."
"The first report of the Commission on food irradiation, published recently, shows that the overwhelming majority of foods on the market are correctly labelled."
"This means that consumers can choose freely between irradiated and non-irradiated products."
"I would also like to reiterate that current legislation already requests Member States to report the results of their checks on irradiation facilities and on food products."
"If products are detected by the food control authorities which do not comply with legal requirements, they have to be removed from the market."
"Finally, I note that the report stigmatises third countries, in particular the United States and Brazil, for using this technique."
"I consider this to be inappropriate as our own Scientific Committee considers irradiated foods to be safe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will start by asking you to excuse my voice, which is affected by a cold."
"This report finds us again debating the extent to which food is irradiated in the Community and the ways in which this should be regulated."
"The end of the 1990s saw the adoption of a directive, after lengthy debate, which allows only dried aromatic herbs and spices to be irradiated in the EU."
"The EU is now, again, faced with the decision as to whether only herbs and spices should continue to be permitted to be irradiated, whether this list should be extended to include a few foods with problematic hygiene conditions, such as frogs' legs and prawns, or whether the list should include foods permitted to be irradiated by the transitional arrangements in the individual states, such as potatoes, poultry, vegetables, prawns, shellfish, frogs' legs or protein."
"The Commission - as the Commissioner has just made clear - lists these three options in its communication and thus more or less leaves it to us in Parliament to decide which of them to approve."
"In its report, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has in fact come to a contradictory decision on the subject, which, I believe, the Commissioner has briefly addressed."
"On the one hand, the demand is made in item 3 that we should take note of the Commission proposal and regard the present list as complete, and the view is expressed that further herbs, spices and seasonings derived from plants should be allowed to be irradiated in the EU only if this is scientifically recognised as being harmless and efficient."
"At the same time, in item 4, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy proposes that irradiated products, which are numerous in some Member States, should be added to the positive list in so far as this technology can make certain foodstuffs safer."
"What this actually does is to make clear our lack of an unambiguous position, as, on the one hand, we state in item 3 that we want a very restrictive decision, whilst, contrariwise, in item 4 making it clear that we favour a decision that goes further."
"Parliament, though, is quite clear about its position, expressed in item 5 of the report, which is that each foodstuff must be subjected to detailed analysis before any proposal is submitted to add it to the positive list, the object being to demonstrate that each of the conditions for authorising food irradiation have been met in accordance with Annex I of the 1999 directive."
"The Commission communication makes clear, and the Commissioner has just said equally clearly, that there is in fact no consumer demand for food irradiation, that indeed the greater part of the food industry rejects it and declares it to be superfluous."
"Even Eurotoc, an independent association of consumers promoting healthy eating - with whose chefs we are all familiar - has made it clear that the irradiation of food is incompatible with its conception of its own purpose and gained, within only a few days, quite enormous approval for its resolution rejecting food irradiation."
"I think this makes it clear that the directive on irradiation deserves to be strongly criticised and its presuppositions refuted."
"There is one thing that we must be clear in our own minds about, and that is that irradiation only makes any sense if it is used to conceal and draw a veil over hygiene conditions that are unacceptable to our way of thinking and are perhaps simulating for the benefit of consumers a quality which is in fact absent."
"Only then does it make sense to treat food with radiation, as, if hygiene conditions were good, there could be no misgivings about the products and they would not need to be irradiated."
"My second point is that irradiation is principally about keeping foodstuffs fresh throughout long journeys."
"Prawns are a prime example of this, in that they are taken from northern Germany to Morocco to be peeled."
"That too - as we have heard from the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism - should of course be seen in a very critical light in terms of an environmentally sound transport policy, and our committee has often called for the mainstreaming of environmental policy."
"I cannot, by way of conclusion, do other than to reiterate that in items 3 and 5 the committee has adopted very divergent positions, and tomorrow's vote will show whether we will take our stand on the side of consumers and of consumer protection, or whether we will make concessions to the industry, which has engaged in energetic lobbying over recent weeks."
"I believe that we should all be aware that irradiation should be viewed in a highly critical light, that it can also involve certain risks, not all of which we may at present be aware, and that consumers reject it."
"I hope that our decision tomorrow will be in favour of consumer protection, enabling the Commission and the Council to get on with their work, that we will also somewhat clarify the Committee on the Environment's rather contradictory report, and will be able to come up with an unambiguous position, one that will serve as a basis for further work by the Council and the Commission."
"Mr President, my group takes a rather different view from that of the last speaker."
"We believe that it is right for Parliament to be consulted."
"We believe that in a number of areas which are contentious - for example, the dangers of non-ionising radiation - not enough is known within the science for us to pass this by."
"My group will also support the amendment, which other colleagues and I have signed in the name of the Socialist Group, for the deletion of paragraph 4."
"Why do we do that?"
"Not because we necessarily disagree with the Scientific Committee on the issue of whether radiation can be safe for foodstuffs, but because it is not the whole story."
"The question is, why is this being done?"
"Is it really for the benefit of the consumer?"
"Is it something for which there is a consumer demand?"
"If that was the case, we would not have as many cases as there are, certainly in my country, of illegal and covert irradiation. This has been carried out because they do not want consumers to know about it."
"They particularly do not want people to know about and reflect upon the trade which is more concerned with cost-cutting than with the end product in terms of consumer satisfaction."
"Mrs Breyer referred to shrimps being taken from one market to another, peeled in one continent and brought back to another."
"This is not due to safety concerns or the attractiveness of the product: it is all about the profits that go into this business."
"In the light of the Commission's options as presented, we, like the rapporteur, take the view that the list should not be further extended at this stage."
"The onus of proof continues to be on those who wish to do these things."
"The proof has not yet been provided."
"It seems that fresh food and safe food do not always go hand in hand."
"Every year, many people die as a result of poisoning by Salmonella and Campylobacter in chicken, for example."
"These bacteria can be controlled by chemicals, such as methyl bromide, which is toxic."
"A major disadvantage of using this method is that traces of these toxic substances can be found in food."
"Food irradiation forms a good alternative in order to kill microorganisms and prevent subsequent food poisoning."
"If we want to eat fresh produce, then it is impossible first to treat it thermally."
"However, in order to prevent vegetables, fruit and cereal products from going off, we can irradiate them."
"This is therefore a great way of keeping produce fresh after all."
"However, it would be unfair to say that food is irradiated for the wrong reasons - in order to give it a better appearance, or to disguise any imperfections."
"Any harmful substances already produced by the microorganisms cannot be eliminated by irradiation."
"Hygiene and sanitary regulations therefore need to continue to apply during production and agricultural processes."
"How, though, do we now know that this fresh produce is also safe?"
"First of all, experience has taught us that food irradiation is common practice in countries both inside and outside the European Union."
"Moreover, the safety of irradiated food is borne out by the record of fifty years of research by the World Health Organisation and the International Atomic Energy Agency, among others."
"The irradiation of food does, however, result in new substances being formed, as is also the case when food is cooked."
"Only in the case of fats is it not entirely clear whether irradiation could have adverse health implications."
"This requires further investigation."
"From the above, I conclude that there is a technical need for food irradiation, that there is no danger to public health, that it is useful for the consumer and that it is not an alternative to hygiene regulations."
"The four conditions laid down in the 1999 framework directive are thus met."
"I would therefore like to make provision for adding, inter alia, vegetables, fruit and cereal products to the positive list."
"In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the resolution has been improved by the incorporation of amendments."
"I do, however, still have a comment on labelling."
"Labelling should not function as a warning sign."
"Once it has been proven that the product is safe, a warning is no longer relevant."
"This would wrongly give the consumer the idea that something was wrong with the produce after all."
"To avoid any confusion, the designation that this product has been irradiated for hygienic reasons may suffice, just as it is stated on a carton of milk that the latter has been pasteurised."
"Let me end by saying that I would conclude that food irradiation is necessary in a number of cases in order to let fresh food and safe food go hand in hand."
"We should therefore not reject food irradiation out of hand but respect it for what it is."
"Five years ago, Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz was the rapporteur for food irradiation."
"At the time, the Commission wanted to take swift action and irradiate far more foods than simply herbs and spices."
"At least now we are discussing it first, which is an improvement."
"Different arrangements exist in the fifteen countries."
"In my own country, the Netherlands, potatoes are irradiated but I have never seen this displayed on the label."
"European law is not applied properly in this area."
"Irradiation is not necessary."
"There are many alternatives."
"If labelling were honest, consumers would not buy the products."
"This is also the reason why there is fraudulent labelling."
"Cyclobutadiene is a substance that is always detectable when food is irradiated."
"It is therefore perfectly possible to label properly, as the substance is always detectable."
"This is the Achilles' heel of the irradiation industry, for consumers do not want it."
"If the substance were labelled explicitly, this industry would die a slow death."
"Mr President, I rather liked the introduction from the Commissioner on this."
"I thought he got it right, with one exception: he was misreading paragraph 3."
"It is not as negative as he suggests."
"The original text from Mrs Breyer, which welcomes the Commission's suggestion that the current list be regarded, has now become 'notes the Commission's suggestion that the current list could be regarded'."
"That has been changed quite significantly."
"You need to look at all the changes that took place in committee."
"After all, food has been treated with ionising radiation for some 50 years, as the rapporteur rightly said."
"In my country, the UK, products include vegetables, fruit, cereals, poultry, fish, shellfish - not too many frogs' legs!"
"All that range, to a certain degree, is given this treatment."
"Different countries have different lists."
"The common ground between us is that it must not pose a health hazard, is of benefit to consumers and is labelled."
"If there is a need and if it is safe, then why not?"
"That is the committee's broad view."
"Well, it is safe."
"The WHO says so. The EU Scientific Committee on Food says so, and it therefore is an element of consumer protection in itself."
"There is a need, for instance, in hospitals, to protect the food of some very vulnerable patients from dangerous bacteria."
"It can protect food from contamination. What it cannot do is to reverse contamination or putrefaction in food."
"The Commission came forward with a perfectly sensible communication - a discussion paper - with its options of the current EU list, plus shrimps and frogs' legs, of the current wider Member States' list, or of the current EU list alone."
"I suspect the answer is somewhere around the first and second options, but we are not at this stage dealing with the legislative proposal."
"The Commission is in listening mode."
"We needed cool, calm reflection on this."
"That is a thousand miles from the threat of Armageddon that we saw in the original report, with spectres of dangers, such as the long journeys that are actually of benefit to the developing countries in exporting their goods."
"The picture of the radioactive sources posing safety risks and risks to security through the acquisition of radioactive materials by terrorists seeking to make dirty bombs has been banished from the committee's view."
"We are looking for something a little more measured."
"The report in its original form was more like the description of the Merovingian dynasty as despotism tempered by assassination."
"The reality is that we have a process that is safe if used properly."
"It can bring benefits and it should be considered carefully with proper risk assessment and risk management, but without scaremongering."
"The amendments that Mrs Grossetête and I proposed and the committee supported bring this report back to where the Commission might prefer it to be."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank the Commission for the clarity with which it has presented the situation as regards the treatment of foodstuffs with ionising radiation in the European Union."
"I am also grateful to the Commissioner for the clarity of what he has had to say about this problem area."
"As long ago as 1999, when we were working on the directive, our fear was that the Commission would not succeed in producing a comprehensive positive list by 31 December 2000."
"And what has happened?"
"It will soon be 31 December 2002, and, rather than discussing whether or not to adopt the list, we are again going over the discussions we had in the days before the directive was drawn up."
"Things cannot, I believe, be left as they stand, and the situation is unacceptable."
"The Commission, in its communication, notes that both the FAO and the WHO regard it as scientifically proven that irradiation is quite safe for consumers."
"The WHO, indeed, urges that it be used more, as the procedure reduces risks to the consumer."
"The Scientific Committee on Food notes, with reference to 17 product categories, that treatment with ionising radiation is harmless, and those categories include all those products treated to date in the countries of the European Union."
"It states that there have been no occasions on which the critical dose has been exceeded in the European Union."
"It is noted in the Commission communication that the most important conditions for treatment with ionising radiation - licensing, labelling and control - have been met and that the methods for detecting irradiation have been validated, in other words, that they also meet requirements."
"I am slowly finding it intolerable that we are constantly, in this context, being told that there is the possibility of cheating, that there is room for fraud and so on. The detection methods are in place."
"We can determine whether products have been treated, be it legally or illegally."
"Why, then, do we constantly have to go over this discussion again and again?"
"We see, then, that all the conditions have been met for a positive list to be drawn up and for the Commission to deal with it."
"The Commission, though, is getting cold feet."
"The reasons for this are apparent from the survey that it has carried out, which, to take one example, discovered that the food manufacturers do not want this treatment."
"Why, then, do they not want it?"
"As the communication makes perfectly clear, they fear a boycott of their products, as the European Union and this discussion itself have been permeated by an ideology which ignores all the scientific findings and simply refuses to accept all that has been worked out and set out to date."
"And so we go back to our discussions and to bemoaning this dreadful state of affairs."
"It is then that the hygiene argument is produced."
"I helped draw up the directive on hygiene conditions in the handling of fresh meat."
"I would be the last person to want to cut anything out here, but we discussed HACCP when we worked on the current version of the food hygiene directive."
"It is perfectly clear to us that this is not acceptable everywhere, and that we have to use other methods as well in order to make products safer for consumers."
"That is what this procedure is there for."
"The only acceptable approach is for the Commission to draw up the positive list very quickly, and, moreover, not in the form it has now proposed."
"The real need is for change in the situation in the European Union."
"We cannot afford to keep on being weighed down by this ideological ballast."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0386/2002) by Mrs Langenhagen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on Special Report No 2/2002 of the Court of Auditors on the Socrates and Youth for Europe Community action programmes (RCC0002/2002 - C5-0257/2002 - 2002/2125(COS))."
"Mr President, it was not automatic that this House should decide to debate the Socrates and 'Youth for Europe' Community action programmes here today."
"It is the case that our new Rules of Procedure state that a topic adopted unanimously by a committee no longer needs to be discussed in plenary, and the Committee on Budgetary Control welcomed my report and adopted it unanimously."
"I took the view, however, that Socrates and 'Youth for Europe', being topics of overall relevance to many areas of European policymaking, have to be presented to a broader public, as this public has had various grumbles and complaints about the way they have been managed."
"These aches and pains have ended up under the care of the European Court of Auditors, which details in its Special Report a range of major weaknesses that it has uncovered."
"The Court of Auditors confirms that some resources have not been used in accordance with the programmes' objectives, and that, in some cases, the goals have not been clearly defined."
"The necessary advance financing was not in place for certain projects, and this made the work of the project leaders and participants substantially more difficult, if not, indeed, impossible."
"An increasing number of schools, universities and other bodies are turning their backs on these programmes, and I can well understand that they do not lack good reason for doing so."
"Moreover, the disproportionately high cost of administration and the cumbersome administrative procedures bear no relation to their usefulness."
"The resources made available cannot be allowed to simply get caught up in the administrative machinery instead of finding their way to the people for whom they are made available in the first place."
"Other faults found included delays in the payment of grants, deficiencies in overall coordination, and the absence of real structures for monitoring and evaluation, mainly as a result of the programmes' complexity."
"That the Commission has delayed presentation of its evaluation report is truly beyond comprehension."
"It is this that caused the consequent delay in the subsequent report from the Court of Auditors."
"That is actually inexcusable, as this involved an assessment of a report covering the period from 1995 to 1999 and it will soon be 2003, nearly four years later."
"In 1999 we were prepared to follow up the first programme by launching a second, which was to take six years between 2000 and 2006, without giving due time to evaluating the problems I have mentioned."
"Despite this, my report on the Special Report and on the Socrates and 'Youth for Europe' programmes has something very positive to say."
"I have no doubt that these programmes are important for transnational cooperation in the united Europe, and indeed necessary for it, and that they supplement the education system."
"But that is not all: these programmes are, at the end of the day, about Europe's citizens, whether they be students or young workers, and they are being drawn ever closer together, as exchanges of views, what is termed active dialogue, and targeted teaching on European affairs, are promoting mutual understanding in the areas of social affairs, European policy and the economy and are moving deeper European integration further forward."
"In the five-year programme that ran from 1995 to 1999, funds totalling EUR 920 million were released for Socrates, and EUR 126 million for 'Youth for Europe' - quite considerable sums."
"This amount doubled in the following programme for the years from 2000 to 2006."
"That is remarkable."
"Rather than reducing its significance, the fact that we are on the threshold of enlargement makes our task of considering Europe's young people and their education an even greater one."
"I therefore call for the so-called technical assistance offices to now, at last, be replaced by public organisations and for clear delimitation of competences between the Commission and the national offices to be guaranteed, in order to eliminate the differences in the individual Member States."
"The national offices must be equipped with adequate human, material and financial resources in order to effectively perform the tasks entrusted to them."
"For we are, after all, agreed that good education is the basis for future economic success and for Europe's ability to compete in the world."
"The report lists specific measures to deal with the problems; these represent a step in the right direction and are intended to ensure that, in future, the predominant characteristics of the Socrates and 'Youth for Europe' programmes will be greater efficiency, transparency and enthusiasm."
"Mr President, speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group, I would like to warmly congratulate the rapporteur, above all on the highly critical comments she has made."
"In order to nip in the bud any tall tales about post-2000 implementation, I would also like just to remind the Commissioner - and I know this is not exactly his area of competence - that, as at 6 December this year, we had EUR 500 million left over in the B31 budget line covering education and youth programmes."
"EUR 500 million, Commissioner - and I would like to tell you what it means when money is paid out in this area so slowly as to become indefensible."
"It means that class war is being waged."
"Under those circumstances, the first to be prevented from taking part in programmes of great value to Europe are students from poorer backgrounds."
"As a representative of the Socialist Group, my comment on that is that these are not bureaucratic difficulties that just happen to have cropped up; people are actually being prevented from receiving anything, and that is something we quite emphatically will not stand for."
"When it comes to the giving of discharge for the coming year, Commissioner, we will be casting an eye over what happens when payments are made in future, and what will be done about delays to this programme, and I also hope that our rapporteur will be examining it with great care."
"Otherwise, the devil will take the hindmost - in this instance, those whose parents' income is rather more modest, to whom we feel we have especial obligations."
"Mr President, I too wish to associate myself with the words of my colleague, Mr Herbert Bösch, congratulating Mrs Langenhagen on the content of her report, and say that the issue of simplifying these programmes and making them more transparent - and this is discussed in the report by the Court of Auditors - is by far the most important and decisive issue for their success."
"I think that when we embark on a process of creating new agencies - and I believe that several dozen agencies are now being thought of to create programmes on a similar scale - I think that before embarking on this process, we ought to think very carefully about the problems we want to resolve, if an agency is indeed to be different and will resolve issues that these scientific and technical offices have not been able to resolve."
"I think that what is more important than thinking about the agencies is considering how to make this entire matter more straightforward, accessible and uniform in all the Member States so that everything can be processed more rapidly, both in terms of payments, as expounded on by Mr Bösch, and also in terms of the concept of the programme itself."
"And this invitation to consider the matter is particularly what I wanted to convey to the Commission."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.20 p.m.)"
"Foot and mouth disease: lessons to be learned and proposals for the future"
"The next item is the report (A5-0405/2002) by Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, on behalf of the Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease, on measures to control Foot and Mouth Disease in the European Union in 2001 and future measures to prevent and control animal diseases in the European Union [2002/2153(INI)]."
"."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with very warm thanks to all the colleagues who did serious work in the committee and on the report."
"I am especially grateful to our chairman, Mrs Redondo, to the secretariat, which did excellent work, to the scientific service, and to the Commission."
"February 2001 saw what was no doubt the most serious outbreak of foot and mouth disease Europe had ever known."
"It affected Ireland, the Netherlands, France and, in particular, Great Britain."
"In Great Britain alone, where the epidemic indeed broke out, official estimates state that 6.5 million animals were killed in the course of combating it."
"Other sources mention up to 10 million."
"The Netherlands lost 285 000 animals and France, where there were four outbreaks, 65 000 of them."
"The consequences were catastrophic for everyone concerned."
"It makes no sense for any future policy on epidemics to be based solely on the slaughter of animals as a means of eradicating the virus, and no such approach will any longer be tolerated by the people of the EU."
"At the beginning of this year, our Parliament set up a temporary committee - not, as some Members unfortunately persist in believing, a committee of inquiry - which had the aim of helping to create an improved policy that would work not only at EU level."
"One of our tasks was to use numerous public hearings and on-site visits to analyse the events in the Member States affected, to evaluate them fairly and take what we thereby learned as a means of drawing relevant conclusions as regards a Europe-wide policy on foot and mouth disease."
"This also means that we have no judicial function, nor are we able to resolve scientific disputes."
"In our report, we cannot pass judgments, let alone condemn anyone in advance for things we cannot prove anyway."
"This was not within our remit and we were not equipped for that purpose."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am quite sure that any other government in the EU would have had similar problems to grapple with had it faced a comparable scenario, with between 50 and 70 simultaneous outbreaks across the whole country, and with sheep being affected as well."
"We now know that, after economic and trade policy considerations led to vaccination being stopped in the EU in 1992, the emergency plans that have been elaborated have been defective, being designed for only a few outbreaks rather than for a worst-case scenario of this kind."
"The fact that the International Office of Epizootics, the OIE, would only restore the designation of 'FMD-free without vaccination' twelve months after the last vaccination meant that the watchword was 'kill rather than inoculate, or just inoculate in order to cull afterwards'."
"That this has been cut to six months since May this year represents a massive step forward."
"We advocate three months."
"I want now to list some of our most important demands."
"Not only must future policy include effective emergency plans for the combating of epidemics, but all the Member States must check how their communications networks and decision-making structures would perform in an emergency, and run cross-border emergency exercises in real time."
"It is also essential that plans should take far greater account than hitherto of the psychosocial effects of any policy on the farmers affected by the epidemic and on all those banned from moving animals."
"Greater attention must be given to bio-safety."
"Every single farmer must be careful about what he feeds to his animals, from whom he buys them, and how quickly he brings them and his old stock together."
"For it was a farmer's irresponsible working practices that caused the epidemic to break out in Great Britain."
"There must be further improvements to the animals' traceability and therefore also to the way they are identified."
"It is also important to do everything possible to prevent illegal imports of animal products from countries where foot and mouth disease is endemic."
"The Commission has already decided that, for example, travellers from these countries may no longer bring products of this sort into the EU."
"But our most important demand in terms of action against future epidemics is that emergency vaccination should be regarded as the recourse of first choice, the object being to allow the animals to live on and assess products from them on a regional basis."
"This would be a crucial improvement on what was done in the past, as there continues to be no dispute about the absolute absence of any health risk to humans from the meat of inoculated animals and from other products derived from them."
"This, then, is an area in which there is an urgent need for people to be informed."
"There is, though, one thing that I want to make clear. Infected stocks will always be slaughtered, as will any animals put at risk by contact with them."
"Economic considerations and the demands of the internal market, among other things, mean that there will be no early return to general vaccination, nor has it been called for in the hearings to date by any reputable expert."
"Do not, then, raise people's hopes too high."
"To do so would indeed be irresponsible."
"Nevertheless, there needs to be further research towards finding an appropriate and durable marker vaccine capable of covering all serotypes and enabling an undoubted distinction to be drawn between inoculated and infected animals."
"I might mention that, in Germany until 1990, only cattle were inoculated, to the exclusion of all other animals."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that a policy such as that which we are proposing will put an end to images the like of which were broadcast around the globe last year."
"Let me just say something about the voting."
"Vote for my amendments and for those tabled by the Socialist Group!"
"They will do away with a whole array of accusations that have been levelled at the British Government, charges that we as a parliament - or so I personally understand parliamentary practice - are not entitled to bring in this way and are thus not justified."
"Being a politician myself, I can quite understand that they were made in an excess of political enthusiasm, but please do your infighting at home."
"For that purpose, the European Parliament is the least suitable of all platforms."
"And one more thing: there are fourteen Member States in the European Union besides Great Britain."
"It is important, ladies and gentlemen, that not only the British Government, but also the Council, the Commission, the candidate countries, the OIE and other states, such as, for example, the USA, Australia, Argentina and South Africa should be able to take our report seriously."
"The combating of epidemics calls for a worldwide strategy, as foot and mouth disease is an international disease and not a British one."
"It is my view that we, representing the peoples of the fifteen Member States, have achieved outstanding success in discussing this problem area as it deserves to be discussed, and in coming up with final conclusions that point the way ahead."
"What is, unfortunately, certain is that there will certainly be another outbreak of foot and mouth disease."
"The question is only that of where and when it will occur and with what intensity."
"Against that, we must be armed."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have come together today having completed several months of work, hearings, visits on the ground, meetings with experts, farmers, with men and women, in fact, with all those who have had first-hand experience of the foot and mouth crisis, who have been deeply affected by it and, who above all, never want it to happen again."
"This was very much the aim of our work: understand what happened, analyse events from every angle - economic, social and psychological - in order to learn lessons from this and minimise the risks and the effects of this type of disease in the future."
"Some would have liked the main aim of the temporary committee's work to be to seek out the guilty party or parties, which is an understandable reaction when one is desperate and appalled by what one is going through."
"This, however, was not the specific aim of our committee or the reason why it had been set up."
"Can we accept the fact that, in a report that is intended to be the product of the most objective investigation possible, there are some very subjective elements and some irrational guesswork?"
"I think not."
"The very credibility of our work as parliamentarians depends on this and that is why our group tabled a number of amendments designed to restore balance to the report."
"Apart from a few petty political digressions, we must acknowledge that our work has been very rewarding and worthwhile, the large number of direct contacts enabling us to gain a better understanding of the problems of managing the crisis and its countless consequences."
"We must point out that the epidemic was a traumatic experience for tens of thousands of people, particularly because the memories that we may have of foot and mouth disease are of an epidemic which is undeniably serious, but not to the point of destroying entire regions and leading to the slaughter of millions of animals that individuals had put so much effort into feeding and caring."
"Having succumbed to new rearing methods and more movement of animals, we were unable to cope with this crisis and respond as we did 50 years ago when we isolated infected herds, since the number of infections was already too great by the time the epidemic was identified."
"Of course, with hindsight, we can always say 'We should have done this or that', but we must not forget that, at the time, we were facing a crisis and that solutions had to be found urgently in tandem with institutions, local communities and populations who were unprepared for this type of situation."
"Even experts believe that this crisis would have been of the same tragic proportions had it broken out in any other European country."
"The unfortunate experience of the United Kingdom has enabled other Member States to be more vigilant and better prepared to deal with the disease."
"What do we do now?"
"What decisions must the European Union take?"
"The rapporteur, several of my fellow Members and the Commissioner have just explained."
"First of all, prevention is essential, and this prevention involves providing better information, on-going training of farmers - who were not always able to identify the disease early enough - animal traceability and more animal health professionals who can be called up more easily."
"Vigilance within Europe's borders is essential, but we must also increase our controls on imports, both at land borders and at ports and airports."
"We are at the heart of global trade and people are travelling more and more, and so we must take into account this international dimension."
"We must also provide solutions in a crisis by anticipating responses with more appropriate emergency plans, by encouraging emergency vaccinations wherever possible, whilst remembering that slaughter is the only possible outcome when livestock has been infected."
"The final comment I would add is that research is an area which we are entitled to expect to provide us with some results, on the condition that we provide it with the resources."
"To sum up, I would like to reiterate, in the wake of the maritime disasters which have struck Europe once again, that our reports, whilst full of good intentions, are not worth a great deal if the European Union and the Member States do not shoulder their full responsibilities by swiftly implementing the recommendations that we make in this Chamber."
"We now await the report on which the Commission is currently working and hope that it will support the conclusions of our temporary committee."
"Lastly, I would like to thank and to congratulate the rapporteur, the chairman, and all the Members who contributed to the report, as well as the committee and all the staff involved in this work."
"About a year ago Mr Sturdy put to me the idea of setting up a committee to investigate the recent foot and mouth disease crisis."
"I immediately agreed to the suggestion and am still happy that the lists of signatures that subsequently circulated in Parliament included the names of two members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and two members of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party."
"I continue to believe that it was a good initiative."
"Rarely in my career as an MEP have I experienced the degree of interest awakened throughout Europe by this committee."
"Wherever we went, in the United Kingdom or in the Netherlands, the interest was overwhelming, and to my mind it benefited the European Parliament itself."
"I should also like to express my appreciation to Mrs Redondo as chairman, for her competent leadership, and to Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, who was an excellent spokesman for the committee's work, not only in his report but also in his tactful contributions during the many meetings."
"What have been the high points for the ELDR Group over the past year?"
"Firstly: prevention is better than cure, and we strongly support the call for better border controls."
"If we compare the situation in the United States, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, etc? with that in Europe, we find that controls on the external borders of Europe are abominable."
"If I arrive at an airport there are scarcely any checks on my luggage, in complete contrast to the situation in other continents."
"I consider it essential that such measures should also be applied in Europe."
"There has also been much discussion about whether or not to re-introduce prophylactic vaccination."
"I opposed this."
"None of the experts we consulted was in favour."
"Generally speaking, one cannot assume that a single vaccine exists that will offer protection against the hundred or so different foot and mouth disease strains that are found."
"It is therefore an illusion to think that there will never be another outbreak."
"I am, though, strongly in favour of emergency vaccination from the very beginning and at the same time of the consumption of the products of perfectly healthy animals locally or in the European Union."
"It is impossible to explain to the public why healthy animals should be destroyed and I am glad that the Commission has announced that it is to change policy on this matter."
"As regards financing: the Commission has been a little parsimonious."
"Agenda 2000 assigns an annual amount of EUR 41 million for the combating of infectious animal diseases."
"The foot and mouth crisis cost almost a billion."
"We were fortunate in that the euro exchange rate was rather low and that there were surpluses in the agriculture budget, but that cannot of course continue indefinitely."
"It would therefore be good if the Commission were to reflect on insurance systems."
"And while we are talking about the Commission: we have heard appreciation from all sides for the Commission's role in the foot and mouth crisis."
"Having said this, I must mention a down side: even before the temporary committee was set up, the ELDR Group had submitted two amendments to the 2002 budget."
"One on research into marker vaccines and one on insurance systems, specifically to counter the competitive distortions in Europe, whereby farmers in one country have to pay for the outbreak of infectious animal diseases, and in another country they do not."
"As far as I know, not a single contract has yet been signed, despite the fact that today is 17 December and that I had pointed out to all the Commission services back at the beginning of the year that the budgetary authority had already given its approval."
"That is the only jarring note I have to sound in this speech."
"Mr President, as a member of the Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease, I have a very high opinion of its final report, which Parliament is to discuss today."
"The rapporteur's drafting has made the final report fair and a polished piece of work."
"The advice given by experts to the many hearings was characterised by a consensus that the progress of this disease was to be resisted."
"Taking into consideration the fact that foot and mouth disease is present all over the world, continuing globalisation and deregulation, that is to say, the increase in worldwide trade, which is already very extensive, and in passenger traffic, mean that the European Union has to reckon with a growing danger of foot and mouth disease being introduced from infected areas."
"Whereas, formerly, three types of FMD were present across Europe, and successfully combated by means of ring-vaccination, Europe now faces the danger of the disease being imported from a wide variety of sources."
"The problem here is that - much as with influenza - vaccination only works if the vaccination is derived largely from the same strain as the disease."
"There is little point in prophylactic vaccination against virus strains, as it is impossible to know in advance which actual FMD virus is being brought in."
"What does make sense, on the contrary, is what is advocated in the report - the carrying-out of emergency vaccination in the event of an epidemic, which of course presupposes that it is possible to ascertain rapidly the actual strain of the disease involved."
"This position is a controversial one, but, in the absence of effective action against epidemics in the areas from which they come, and given the current state of research, I can see no alternative and no other option."
"I would emphasise that emergency vaccination is meant to help prevent foot and mouth disease from spreading."
"It is for that reason that my group has tabled a motion to the effect that a worldwide strategy to combat foot and mouth disease should be worked out among the FAO countries."
"What we demand of a policy came to us loud and clear in the many conversations we had with cattle farmers, with representatives of local authorities and associations, and with members of the public who were deeply unsettled and, in ethical terms, outraged."
"Associated with this is the necessity of using suitable measures to at last halt the burgeoning live animal transports across Europe."
"This is far from being only an animal protection issue; it is about preventing diseases."
"There are circumstances under which the Community must involve itself in national preventive strategies, as each EU country belongs to the common internal market and can maintain important relationships with third countries."
"All the Member States must be able to call upon the services of adequately qualified veterinary personnel in the prevention and treatment of animal diseases."
"Further scientific investigation is needed into issues associated with emergency vaccination against FMD and the continued use of inoculated animals."
"It is not possible to justify sending ten million animals to what is, at the end of the day, a senseless death, if ethically and economically preferable procedures are in the offing."
"My fifth point is that I expect the Commission to come up with proposals for better legal protection for the affected parties in order to compensate for the great financial losses and resultant damage in the regions."
"In conclusion, I would like to say that I would like great public awareness of the review of the common agricultural policy, and not only in the most arduous, and bleakest, times of crisis."
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his report, which is extremely important."
"It is vital that Parliament gives a very strong signal that vaccination should be a tool of first resort in any future outbreak."
"I am very glad that our committee has come to that conclusion."
"I am also glad that we support a change in the law so that there is no automatic incentive to slaughter rather than to vaccinate."
"We recognise that in Britain over ten million animals were slaughtered - many unnecessarily - because of the overriding priority that was given to the narrow economic goal of regaining export status as quickly as possible."
"It is right and proper that we make constructive proposals for the future handling of foot and mouth outbreaks."
"However, it is also right - where it is called for - that we are strongly critical of the past handling of foot and mouth outbreaks."
"I, therefore, disagree with the rapporteur that it is inappropriate and unjustified to criticise the UK Government."
"Such criticism reflects the evidence we heard, and if we do not learn from the past, there is no guarantee of any better action in the future."
"For that reason, I am saddened by attempts from the British Government to water down this report, to rewrite history and effectively to whitewash the past."
"Amendments by the PSE Group follow closely the briefing that all UK MEPs have received from the British Government, that argues, for example, that there is no evidence for allegations of violations of animal welfare."
"That is untrue."
"I would remind them of evidence given by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to the National Audit Office inquiry, which says: 'In many cases there was very good circumstantial evidence that an offence had been committed.'"
"The government says that a veterinary inspector worked closely at every slaughter."
"In fact there was often one vet supervising ten slaughters simultaneously - an impossible thing to do."
"The government denies that farmers were intimidated in connection with the culls and it asks for evidence."
"We have evidence in plenty."
"I would remind them that the committee went to Knowstone in Devon precisely to gather that kind of information."
"They allege that the lessons learnt in the inquiry show that the contiguous cull was effective in curbing the disease - again, untrue."
"The National Audit Office demonstrated that the epidemic had already peaked before the contiguous cull policies could have had any effect."
"They allege that the firebreak or pre-emptive culling was legal - again, not true."
"It is made very clear in the UK's new contingency plan that firebreak or pre-emptive culling requires 'the passage of the new animal health bill'."
"That bill had not been passed last year and, therefore, such provision did not exist for legally enforceable mandatory firebreak culls."
"People would have a lot more respect for this government if it could just bring itself to admit that it got things wrong."
"It matters, because for as long as it does not admit that, then there can be no guarantee that in the event of another outbreak the government will not act in the same way again."
"I hope that our report is one step in the process of ensuring that such devastation can never be allowed to happen again in the United Kingdom or anywhere in the European Union."
"Mr President, the final report before us today, which was adopted unanimously by the temporary committee, represents the fruits of a most thorough investigation and consultation process, including numerous public hearings and visits to affected areas."
"Since I have lived all of my life in the countryside and have been actively involved in farming and the politics of farming, I fully sympathise with those farmers and their families who were devastated by the outbreak."
"We in Ireland were spared the worst because of our geographical location and, in no small measure, because of the extreme exemplary precautions taken by the Irish authorities - a fact referred to in today's report."
"There are many lessons to be learnt from the experiences of the outbreak."
"The rapporteur has done an excellent job in highlighting these and in showing how to avoid the mistakes of the past."
"I am pleased that the Commission has been most cooperative with the temporary committee throughout the period of its work."
"I seriously hope that the committee's final recommendations will be fully reflected in the forthcoming legislative proposal."
"In particular, I would urge that close attention be paid to those areas where resource gaps have been identified."
"I await with interest the evaluation report by the Commission as to whether the Food and Veterinary Office in Ireland has the right staff and infrastructure to enable it to carry out its duties effectively in the long term."
"In conclusion, I sincerely hope that this lengthy exercise will bring about some very tangible results."
"We have an array of legislative measures which should go a long way to preventing future outbreaks and, more importantly, to ensuring that any such outbreak does not reach the proportions witnessed last year."
"The Member States, as well as the Commission, have clear responsibilities in this area."
"Legislation on catering waste, animal transport, animal welfare, surveillance and disease control must be properly implemented and monitored."
"I fully support measures leading to a ban on all meat imports from non-EU countries where foot and mouth is endemic and likewise support stricter controls on illegal meat imports."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was essential that we learned from the foot and mouth crisis which struck the United Kingdom in 2001, because it reached such unprecedented levels in the UK, as a result, in particular, of mistakes - on the part of the British Government as well as the Commission - in the area of contingency planning, because it posed such a serious threat to other European countries and, lastly, because it gave us a terrifying reminder of how quickly this disease can break out, how fast it can spread and of the damaging economic and psychological consequences that it can have."
"Our committee has, on the whole, done a good job."
"The Kreissl-Dörfler report particularly emphasises, and this is a crucial point, that the sheer size and specialisation of herds, the livestock density in certain regions, the closure of local abattoirs and the astonishing increase in the transport of live animals are factors which, in the absence of prophylactic vaccination, enable the epidemic to spread like wildfire."
"When we come to examine the future agricultural policy guidelines, we must remember this, in order to ensure that we encourage farming that is evenly spread throughout the countryside and that we refuse to encourage regions to specialise to a major degree in high-density holdings."
"It is therefore clear, for example, that the withdrawal of milk quotas - which the European Commission appears to favour - might very soon lead to the end of milk herds in areas that have natural handicaps, such as mountainous or rainy areas, and the increase of livestock density in plains."
"We must therefore ensure that we maintain a network of family-run farms of a manageable size; this is the best possible way to prevent foot and mouth disease."
"Our temporary committee was right to recommend emergency vaccination as the best way to combat the epidemic, since this avoids the mass slaughter which, understandably, caused such great public outcry and was so distressing for farmers."
"When hundreds of millions of people are starving, it is unacceptable to destroy the meat of millions of healthy animals, which is what happened in 2001."
"With emergency vaccination, a pen will be set up near the source of the epidemic where the animals will be vaccinated, animals which could then potentially be destroyed and used for consumption without the pressure of an emergency situation."
"On this point, however, I regret the fact that the Commission did not make bolder proposals."
"With the progress made in vaccinations - we now have vaccinations with a broader spectrum, longer-lasting vaccinations and marker vaccinations which make it possible to distinguish vaccinated animals from infected animals - it is now possible to give Member States the freedom to authorise or even make compulsory prophylactic vaccination, in other words preventative vaccination, as applied before 1992, where the risks of epidemics are the highest."
"This possibility should be left to the discretion of the Member States, which are best placed to assess the consequences of specific risks for their livestock."
"I also regret that the report does not call more clearly into question the current framework, laid down by the International Office of Epizootics, the rules of which are obviously too rigid, too restrictive and too dogmatic as far as the conditions for granting 'FMD-free area' status are concerned."
"It is obvious that they are excessively in favour of New World countries, which have a large amount of open space, where the land is less densely populated and which, therefore, face less of a risk of a disease spreading."
"It is an absolute necessity that these rules are developed."
"Mr President, we are now destined to live under the constant threat of further outbreaks of foot and mouth disease, as new strains are constantly coming to the fore."
"This is especially true of Europe, which is surrounded by countries where foot and mouth is endemic."
"This is particularly true of Turkey, which represents a constant danger, and the rest of the Middle East and North Africa too."
"There have also been a number of outbreaks in Asia and Latin America."
"The globalisation of the live animal trade can therefore only encourage and accentuate the globalisation of diseases and viruses."
"This explains why short journeys are preferable, why a certain inappropriate form of extreme specialisation which increases animal transport over long distances must be rejected, why rearing and fattening on the same farm premises is preferred and why slaughter must be carried out in the producing region. These methods are dictated by common sense and are the best possible way to prevent the development of new diseases."
"We must remember this, Mr President, Commissioner, when we come to debate the future CAP, if we want to avoid a repeat of the nightmare of 2001."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is now a year since the Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease began its investigations in order to provide solutions and make proposals for the future in relation to this problem which, as well as causing serious economic damage to the European cattle sector, caused significant moral damage to all cattle breeders and had a great impact on society in general."
"We all remember the great number of animals which had to be culled following the outbreak last year which seriously affected the United Kingdom and the Netherlands."
"And the main task of this committee was to prevent situations such as that caused by this disease from reoccurring in Europe."
"During this year of intense work, the committee has listened to the opinions of dozens of experts in all fields, from economic to veterinary, dealing with logistical and political aspects, Community and international legislation, as well as tangential aspects such as tourism, goods transport, emotional aspects, etc."
"Many of the people invited to the committee occupied very important posts during the management of the last outbreak of the disease."
"But the committee also gave the owners of farms affected and the local authorities and associations in these areas the opportunity to express their opinions during the various visits organised both to the United Kingdom and to the Netherlands."
"Furthermore, as chairperson of this committee, I have held several meetings on this disease, together with the rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, with experts and top officials from non-Community countries, such as Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil."
"The fruit of all this work is the report being presented today for the vote of this House."
"The report produced by Mr Kreissl-Dörfler has achieved a broad consensus amongst all the political groups and we hope that, in the same way, the other Members of this House will find sufficient points of agreement to approve it by a majority without substantial changes, with the approval of some of the amendments presented."
"One of the essential aspects included in the final report of the committee I chair is emergency vaccination, which is considered to be an essential method for controlling any future outbreak of the disease."
"The current policy of the European Union - to quell outbreaks of this disease by culling the cattle of the farms in which any infected animal has been detected and that of neighbouring farms where there is a likelihood of contagion - cannot continue in the current form."
"The policy of emergency vaccination must be part of a strategy which allows animals to live."
"The current policy of not vaccinating prioritises the political and commercial aspects and this is something that must change on an international level, taking the approach initiated by the International Office of Epizootic Diseases and the FAO."
"The future policy must also take account of the social and psychological impact of an epidemic of foot and mouth disease on the public and must not ignore the consequences it causes in all sectors, such as tourism, commerce, social aspects and emotional aspects."
"In its report, this temporary committee advocates emergency vaccination and not preventive vaccinations, since, ladies and gentlemen, these could be considered as a backwards step in the policy of eradication for the scientific, technical, economic and commercial reasons which both we and the Commissioner have expressed."
"Ladies and gentlemen, another of the most important aspects of the work of this committee relates to the control of imports."
"The European Parliament must insist on a policy on meat imports which imposes zero tolerance in order to guarantee that not a single kilogram of unexamined meat originating from a third country enters the European Union."
"This House should insist on this issue and must remind the Commission that it cannot ignore the problem of illegal imports."
"The great food crises are always based on non-compliances with Community legislation."
"Furthermore, I believe we must congratulate the Commission on having acted so quickly with the legislative proposals the Commissioner has just announced, with regard to control, identification, the quality of products and vaccinations."
"In the same way, the temporary committee is asking the Commission to draw up a global strategy for diseases and zoonosis in the European Union."
"For all these reasons, I would ask that the House give this report its majority support."
"I would especially like to congratulate the rapporteur, with whom I have found it so easy to work; all the members of the Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease, who have worked hard, and whose work and criticisms have been constructive;"
"I would also like to congratulate in particular the secretariat for its rigour and for its bold work and our interpreters, without whom this committee would not have been able to carry out its work."
"Mr President, we have read the detailed report on foot and mouth disease in Great Britain and elsewhere, but we believe that this disease broke out and spread as the natural consequence of a number of factors."
"The first factor is that animals and products of animal origin can be transported with complete freedom - or should I say unaccountability - throughout the world nowadays, thanks to the globalisation demanded by big business looking for ways to make a fast buck."
"The second factor is that cross-border veterinary checks on movements of livestock between Member States of the European Union have all but been abolished."
"This basically means that animals can move unchecked from one country to another, as can any dangerous diseases they may be carrying."
"This is compounded by a third factor, the abolition of government veterinary services, staff cutbacks and the generally scant importance attached to government control mechanisms, all as a result of the demand by big business for any controls to be minimised between or within countries which might obstruct the need for livestock to be moved quickly, together with the profit generated."
"Finally, and this is not unrelated to what I have just said, there is the feed factor - with no controls whatsoever on feedingstuffs - which appears to have helped foot and mouth disease to spread."
"This is not a minor factor, as we know from previous crises in the livestock sector in the European Union, such as dioxins in poultry and bovine spongiform encephalopathy."
"We are under no illusion that crises such as these, which threaten livestock and public health, will keep on happening as long as production is governed by the profit motive and the rules of production, movement, and trade imposed by multinational and other capitalist enterprises in the sector."
"Any structural or other measures taken will be no more than fragmented measures which work until the next crisis strikes."
"The only long-term solution which will not jeopardise the agricultural economy of the Member States or wipe out entire livestock holdings is to abolish capitalist profit from production and introduce adequate border and other controls, contrary to the demands of the multinationals which have managed to get them lifted."
"Mr President, the end of December is a time for drawing up a balance: what went well this year, what went wrong, and what needs improving."
"Sometimes one's conclusion is: if only I had ?"
"After a year of the Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease I conclude: if only we had not agreed the policy of non-vaccination in 1991!"
"The costs of that policy have been greatly underestimated."
"But worse still is the fact that the non-vaccination policy with the accompanying culls where there is an outbreak, fails to meet any ethical test."
"Mr President, Noah's ark was filled not with production factors, but with living creatures."
"As the stewards of creation we must take that to heart."
"Parties who do not wish for such a test, should pay the penalty at the ballot box for the consequences of a foot and mouth outbreak."
"Much more far-reaching consequences than simply economic ones are involved."
"To call the combating of the foot and mouth crisis a veterinary success, as has been suggested from the liberal side, is to lose all sense of proportion."
"The combating of foot and mouth was not a success, neither veterinary, nor economic, nor in terms of communication."
"The report admits that."
"An exception is a clause on Friesland, where according to the draft text there was optimum involvement of regional experts."
"Fact and fiction have been confused here."
"An amendment that I submitted jointly with fellow MEPs Mr Maat and Mr De Roo attempted to restore a correct version of events."
"For years prophylactic vaccination protected our livestock."
"The argument that vaccination is pointless because of the number of variants of the foot and mouth virus is about as cogent as maintaining that flu jabs in human beings do no good."
"If we consider the real costs of the non-vaccination policy, only one conclusion remains, moreover: preventive vaccination is not only the most ethical but also the most economical solution."
"In conclusion I should like to compliment the rapporteur on his courageous, lucid and valuable report."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur and also the chair of the committee, Mrs Redondo, most sincerely, since both come from countries where there has been no foot and mouth disease and yet have managed to produce this report with great involvement in the subject."
"The same also applies to our secretariat, since our work as a temporary committee consisted to a significant degree precisely in visiting people who had been affected."
"Without the enormous commitment of our secretariat we would not have been able to do that and that means that this committee occupies a special place in the work of Parliament."
"Mr President, Mrs Redondo's words are close to my heart."
"She said that current policy is focused too much on political and economic values, and insufficiently on human values, if one looks at foot and mouth disease, and one must try to change course in that respect."
"I wholeheartedly agree with her and I am able to speak on behalf of the inhabitants of the affected areas in my country: the Veluwe and Friesland, who greatly appreciated the fact that parliamentary colleagues visited these areas and listened to them."
"It gives them the feeling that in this instance European democracy really came into its own."
"That strikes me as essential, partly also with a view to the forthcoming elections in 2004."
"At the same time, we must realise that we have been through a disaster in which seven million animals were destroyed, an economic loss of over EUR 10 000 million was incurred, and that in some areas, for example around Carlisle, many more people are presently taking anti-depressants than previously."
"Such was the impact."
"I will just mention the story of the school in Oene, where performance at primary level declined."
"That indicates the impact this crisis had on people."
"This means that if we are to take European citizens seriously, we must change policy."
"In that sense I am glad that Commissioner Byrne at least has indicated that he appreciates this."
"It is essential, however, that if we do not adopt general vaccination, emergency vaccination should become standard in the case of an outbreak, as the Commission has said, and that even after emergency vaccination the farms involved should receive the same treatment as if there had been a cull."
"That means that the area would be cut off for no longer than 3 months and that there will be free marketing of products."
"That is crucial if a future policy is to succeed."
"It also means that the Commission has a serious responsibility, as a result of which it will not be able, in the proposals it may present tomorrow, to avoid the fact that new rules on this matter must also be agreed in the OIE, in order to bring deadlines into line and to ensure that products from vaccinated animals can be marketed, since that has nothing to do with food safety and everything to do with ethical behaviour in agricultural policy."
"I have already indicated that this committee tried to give European citizens a voice in European politics."
"As a committee we tried at least to give the crisis a face, to show what befell people, what befell animals and to demonstrate that those things are politically relevant."
"In that respect I look forward to the new debate on the Commission's proposals."
"The Commission and the Council have a heavy responsibility."
"They cannot brush aside this report by Parliament."
"They must take this report on board in their policy, or else we shall find ourselves in new difficulties regarding democracy in Europe."
"First of all, my sincere thanks to my colleague, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler."
"He has done a splendid job, and his objective approach has made it possible to bridge political differences."
"The foot and mouth crisis has left deep scars, the culls have brought unhappiness to countless families but have also led to public indignation and rage, sometimes impotent rage at the authorities."
"Also rage at Europe, which forbade the vaccination of livestock in the area surrounding affected farms."
"The European Parliament is today presenting a closely argued view, a view that I can endorse entirely."
"Yes, we are against the unnecessary culling of healthy animals."
"Yes, we want vaccination in the event of foot and mouth outbreaks."
"Yes we must persuade supermarkets to sell the meat of vaccinated animals as a matter of course."
"Yes, there must be emergency action plans."
"We must introduce a global dimension, a clear statement must be issued by the OIE and there must be effective monitoring of imports, including at airports."
"And yes, we must improve the structural health of the sector: good hygiene, no more ramshackle transport and an end to subsidy policy that gives too much encouragement to the movement of animals."
"We must also ensure good monitoring at all times."
"I am in complete agreement with all these points."
"We cannot leave it at that, however."
"A political wish list is not enough."
"As long as the European Parliament has no say in the agricultural field, there is a risk that our resolution will remain a paper tiger."
"Unless we link this resolution to concerted pressure in the Convention, all our efforts will have been in vain."
"Worse still, we shall have awakened unfounded expectations and we shall be fuelling renewed Euroscepticism."
"In the Netherlands, the 2001 foot and mouth crisis was a kind of harbinger of the political upheaval in 2002."
"We must also at any rate learn the political lesson."
"Confidence in politics suffered a heavy blow."
"An important reason was that political responsibility remained vague, since who was actually responsible for the non-vaccination policy?"
"Was it the government, was it the EU or the international bureau for infectious diseases?"
"It was all very vague."
"Ministers pointed to the EU, the EU Commissioners pointed to the national governments and the OIE."
"For citizens, the complex structure of responsibilities was scarcely comprehensible, and that created the impression of politicians who took up positions but subsequently preferred to hide behind others."
"Politicians who shirk responsibility destroy the credibility of politics."
"This game of buck passing has backfired badly on Europe."
"The hundreds of angry letters and angry e-mails were the signs of a human but also an interinstitutional tragedy."
"A future foot and mouth outbreak must never lead to a mass slaughter of livestock."
"In the period ahead, we must direct all our efforts to this end."
"This requires a foot and mouth policy in which responsibilities are clearly established, at regional, national, European and international level."
"Parliaments must be involved."
"Our aim must be a foot and mouth policy that is not anonymous."
"Responsibilities for choices and for compliance must be clearly established, and it is our task to communicate these."
"I hope that this report may contribute to this process and again thank the rapporteur."
"Mr President, I should firstly like to thank the chairman of the committee, Mrs Redondo, and the rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, for an outstanding piece of work."
"Unfortunately, the work has not shown unambiguously that there is any alternative to the present non-vaccination policy."
"It is very clear that there are neither vaccines nor laboratory capacity and that, overall, everything is missing that would be necessary to enable us to abandon the non-vaccination policy."
"This means that, if a decision on vaccination is to be made, it will be a political decision and not a decision based on scientific and veterinary fact."
"I want finally to say a little about the consequences in terms of trade policy."
"The reactions have been very clear."
"When there is an outbreak of foot and mouth disease, the importing countries - or third countries - exclude all imports of fresh meat from the whole of the EU."
"The Commission must be required very clearly to ensure that third countries, particularly the United States, accept that the EU consists of Member States and of regions, especially following enlargement in 2004."
"If foot and mouth disease occurs in a particular country or region, it is not therefore necessary to halt all imports of fresh meat from the whole of the EU."
"On the contrary, supply and demand become totally chaotic when that happens."
"That is why I want very clearly to call upon the Commission to renegotiate the agreements, which are nowhere near specific enough at present."
"If a new case of foot and mouth disease should occur, the agreements must be in place, particularly with the United States, so that exports from those countries that do not have foot and mouth disease can continue."
"Mr President, foot and mouth disease was not created by human error, as was the mad cow disease BSE, but is a long familiar natural phenomenon."
"It used to be considered normal for every cow to be affected by it occasionally, thereby building up immunity."
"Later people attempted to eradicate once and for all that disease that was infectious, expensive, dirty and painful for livestock by means of vaccination."
"Without extreme globalisation and the world market the disease and the way in which people believe they can combat it would never have attracted so much attention."
"The rich American market does not want meat from animals that have been sick."
"Simply because, without marker vaccine, we cannot easily distinguish such animals from vaccinated livestock, people became confident that the disease would gradually be eliminated entirely."
"Just as people believed this of human tuberculosis."
"Export interests have replaced animal welfare and human ingenuity."
"Unfortunately the mistake was made not only by a number of companies or whole Member States but also by the European Union as a whole."
"For ten years Member States and our farmers have been pressured from above into collaborating in something that is neither sensible nor acceptable."
"Virtually no one had expected that during the latest outbreak in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands extensive mass slaughter of healthy livestock would be necessary in order to ensure that nowhere in the immediate vicinity could any animals be found that might be infected."
"Even rare and exotic breeds or the pet animals of country children were compulsorily killed."
"Quite rightly many people declared authorities that compel such behaviour insane and withdrew their confidence."
"Thus far Ministers of Agriculture and the European Commission may have admitted that things may change in the distant future but they have not yet changed course entirely."
"Vaccinations are seen at most as an emergency measure for healthy livestock that cannot be destroyed quickly enough."
"As is often the case government power is more stupid than human society as a whole."
"So many people are protesting."
"It is the task of Parliament to put an end once and for all to the misguided policy of preventive culling and not rule out once and for all the option of prophylactic vaccination."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, foot and mouth disease is a highly infectious disease for our livestock, but completely harmless to humans."
"I come from the Netherlands where our cattle were prophylactically vaccinated for over 60 years."
"The United Kingdom, Denmark and Ireland do not have this tradition."
"After their entry into the European Union they lobbied for 20 years for the abolition of prophylactic vaccination in Europe."
"Unfortunately they were successful."
"Export interests were placed above all else."
"In both Great Britain and the Netherlands, we have seen the dreadful consequences for animals, farmers, part-time farmers, the tourist sector, in short the whole of society."
"The proposal of the temporary committee is to make emergency vaccination easier."
"That is a good idea."
"There is also a proposal to force supermarkets to sell vaccinated meat in future."
"The latter smacks of a planned economy and will not work."
"The Netherlands produces far more meat than the Dutch themselves can consume."
"What is necessary is a return to prophylactic vaccination."
"At least for those countries, like the Netherlands, that wish to do so."
"New techniques, such as marker vaccines make it possible to distinguish between a sick animal and one that has been vaccinated."
"That means that even the sacred exports can be maintained."
"It is a mystery to me why the majority in Parliament does not opt for this approach."
"For me this report is only half a step in the right direction."
"Nevertheless, half steps in the right direction are better than no steps at all, and I shall vote in favour of the report."
"But I am bound to say that I find it a great pity that our agricultural colleagues in particular have made the interests of direct exports paramount."
"Mr President, I am very glad to say that the health crisis is behind us, but its side effects are unresolved."
"The first thing we must do is understand."
"Unfortunately, at this juncture, we can still only speculate as to the source of the infection and the factors that caused the disease to spread."
"Nevertheless, we can still learn our first lesson, namely the importance of a policy of proximity, which may mean bringing the activities at all stages of the process closer together or maintaining public services at local level in order to avoid transporting animals, which appears, in this case, to have played a significant role."
"It is clear that we cannot repeat a slaughter on such a huge scale."
"The report also puts forward proposals that we shall support such as the revision of emergency plans in conjunction with all partners, a training policy, an effective exchange of information between Member States and an increase in resources for research into marker vaccines."
"These prevention programmes should also take into account the conservation of genetic resources while wild species, game and dying breeds must be protected through specific measures."
"Lastly, prevention programmes will only be effective if adequate compensation is guaranteed."
"Mr President, as someone who was at the forefront in instigating the setting up of this committee, I would personally like to thank President Cox for his invaluable help and all those Members who have made this report and this committee such a resounding success."
"I would particularly like to thank Mr Kreissl-Dörfler for his unstinting work, his readiness to listen and his even-handed approach."
"The visits to the UK and the Netherlands allowed us to listen to everyone who was affected."
"I believe that the European Parliament has delivered what my own parliament in Westminster would not."
"What we have in this document is a fair and balanced report on the terrible devastation and suffering the disease brought to my country."
"Let us not forget that foot and mouth disease is no respecter of borders."
"This blight could have appeared in any European country and could still hit at any time in the future."
"Looking at the situation in the UK, the British Government quite simply got it wrong."
"Mr Adam may try and blame everything on the farmers as usual - and he talked much about the farmers getting it wrong - but what about the government getting it wrong?"
"There is no denying that mistakes have been made."
"That could be accepted by British farmers - we all make mistakes."
"What is not acceptable is that this government still refuses to accept they got it wrong and still refuses to apologise to those who suffered."
"Look at Mr Adam's amendments and look at the latest British Government briefing - they have learnt nothing!"
"This disease did not just affect farmers, it affected hotels and tourism; it affected butchers and traders across Europe."
"We must not allow this terrible slaughter of 10 million animals to happen again."
"I am pleased that this report contains a sensible and workable approach to vaccination in the future."
"Our visit to the Netherlands demonstrated the great benefits of emergency vaccination."
"This would remove the necessity for the huge funeral pyres and burial pits that were hallmarks of the British Government's handling of the outbreak."
"Those unforgettable pictures must stand as a lasting reminder of what could happen again if we do not learn the lessons of this most terrible disease."
"I am pleased that this report sets out plans for the future."
"It is vital that we have a workable and effective contingency plan in place."
"This report goes a long way to developing a positive approach for the whole of Europe."
"The European Commission has worked hand in hand with the committee, and it is no coincidence that tomorrow it will come forward with its proposals for the future."
"I commend Commissioner Byrne's team for their work."
"I would make one final plea to the British Government: please listen and accept this report so we can plan for the future."
"The suffering caused last year by foot and mouth disease was simply unacceptable and it must never be allowed to happen again."
"I hope you will all support this report and the measures contained within it."
"Europe's farmers and Europe's rural communities deserve to know that they are valued."
"They deserve to know that Europe's politicians are prepared."
"I hope that you will give this your support today."
"Mr President, no one on the temporary committee will ever forget the aftermath of that great foot and mouth plague of 2001."
"When we travelled the country we talked to the victims, those who could not be compensated, as well as those who were, those who could restock and begin again, hopefully in a more balanced and less intensive system of livestock production, and those whose lives were utterly changed, who had, as Mr Sturdy said, lost their dreams."
"I would like to be able to agree with every word in this report and I salute the rapporteur's attempt to produce, as the Commissioner called it, a balanced, straightforward and future-oriented account."
"Where should it begin?"
"It has to begin with the outbreak itself, with what actually happened and with the apportionment of blame."
"A balanced report is one in which all those responsible accept some measure of the blame, including the UK Government."
"I would point out to the House that there have been five separate reports in the UK alone, two by local authorities severely affected by the crisis."
"There have also been reports by the National Farmers Union and others who were participants in the whole tragedy."
