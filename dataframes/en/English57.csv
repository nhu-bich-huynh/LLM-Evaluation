"This means that certain public services, such as education, health, or culture, would have to escape wholesale privatisation, whilst still being required to enhance their efficiency and keep their costs under control."
"If we are to relaunch growth and competitiveness while reducing unemployment, it is not absolutely necessary to dismantle our provident democracy, to abandon redistribution aimed at strengthening cohesion, let alone to abandon our familiar solidarity now that we are in the enlarged EU."
"Nevertheless, the speeding up of reforms is an essential condition if the European social model is to be saved in the West and extended to the East, for the only thing that engenders solidarity is the awareness of common interests."
"Above all, I hope that the new Parliament, to be elected on 13 June, will be able, on the basis of this evidence, to save the European social model as an integral part of the aims and objectives of European integration, even if it means that these have to be redefined by all the political and social actors, among whom this House will have a leading role and primary responsibility."
"Mr President, this is not a testament, for I want to carry on working here, but I was keen to share with you my profound convictions on this matter."
". Mr President, if we could christen this evening's debate and give it a title, we would say it is a debate about solidarity."
"This was indeed the word which was heard more than any other this evening. Of course, the need to strengthen it was emphasised a great many times and I hope, as Mr Libicki and Mr Kroupa said earlier, that we shall be able to make Europe and our countries better for us and our children and that we shall be able to live with the democracy, security and freedom which the European Union and the common wish of all the peoples of Europe guarantee us, without sacrificing freedoms."
"I have followed the debate very closely, from which I can say that it clearly emerged that economic and social policy cannot be divorced from one another."
"Hence, the approach which we adopted last year, when we decided to update and combine these two policy sectors, was the right one."
"Now, in addition to this observation, I should like to make a number of other final comments."
"The slow economic growth observed during the first years of the application of the Lisbon strategy and, consequently, of the Social Policy Agenda, may create doubts, as Mrs Lulling said earlier, about the deeper logic on which the updating approach adopted in 2000 is based."
"The fact that several interim objectives will not be achieved in 2005, such as unemployment, as Mrs Ainardi and others pointed out, or the increase in the rate of employment of older workers, which is far lower than the percentage we were aiming for, may feed criticism."
"Nonetheless, the strategic choice about economic and social prosperity is the right choice."
"Not only must we remain faithful, as Mr Marini stressed, to the principles on which the economic and social model of Europe is based and which are contained in the Lisbon strategy, but also we must remain faithful to the objectives of the specific strategy."
"This does not preclude the fact that adjustments may be required as far as the specific policy measures and their methods of implementation are concerned."
"It is, however, clear that the European Union should make use of the economic recovery and the dynamics of enlargement to give new momentum to the Lisbon strategy, focusing mainly on certain priorities, such as improving investments in networks and technological know-how, as numerous members emphasised, including Mrs Grossetête, Mr Szabó and numerous others, strengthening the competitiveness of industry and services and extending active professional life."
"For the new Member States in general, they are undergoing and facing, as far as the implementation of structural reforms is concerned, the same challenges which the older Member States faced."
"Of course, as numerous members emphasised, including Mr Krasts and Mrs Šlesere, the new Member States do, of course, have greater difficulties in certain cases."
"Of course, certain countries, such as Poland, as Mrs Ciemniak said, have high rates of growth, 6%, and have achieved faster reforms in the field of structural reforms."
"In this sector of structural reforms, the new Member States must focus in particular on creating conditions for strengthening the increase in productivity, in that productivity levels are generally very low, and in dealing with the high levels of structural and long-term unemployment, to which Mr Siekierski referred."
"I should like at this point to refer also to a matter raised at the beginning of the debate by Mrs Jensen and repeated subsequently: the question of the free movement of workers."
"As you know, provision has been made for transitional arrangements."
"This has been translated into various national practices which cover the entire spectrum, from zero to seven years."
"Irrespective, however, of any graduations in the transitional periods, which I hope will prove not to be necessary and will be abolished as quickly as possible or limited as far as possible, I must stress that freedom of movement and the right to establish and work in another Member State are fundamental freedoms which are safeguarded under Community law."
"Nor should we forget that they are an integral part of the internal market and European nationality."
"Furthermore, I should like to stress once again what I said at the beginning of my speech, that economies with a large degree of unification and interdependence, which share a common market need efficient coordination in making and implementing economic policy, both at national level and at the level of the European Union."
"All the constituent elements of the economic coordinating framework are closely connected to this overall strategy."
"I too agree with those who, like Mrs Thyssen, pointed out that the only way to speed up progress is to carry out other reforms."
"We must extend our coordination beyond financial matters to cover broader questions of economic policy and we need to take account of both the social and the environmental dimension which Mrs Myller spoke of, referring to what I said and emphasised earlier and which I would like to clarify better now, that the countries which provide a high level of social protection, such as Denmark and Sweden, also manage to be extremely competitive."
"Mr President, we must find the political will needed to extend our coordination to all sectors covered by the Lisbon strategy, so that we can achieve more growth and greater employment."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the Commission statement on freedom and security for Union citizens."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by expressing my gratitude for this final opportunity to address Parliament on the development of the area of freedom, security and justice in an enlarged Europe."
"Over the past five years the Commission and Parliament have together followed a path in which Parliament’s constructive contribution and cooperation, often in very difficult circumstances and with very tight deadlines, will certainly be one of the defining characteristics of this legislature."
"Recent Eurobarometer surveys, carried out for the Commission, have shown a general desire on the part of the citizens for more Europe."
"Those expectations are greater still against the backdrop of an enlarged Europe of 455 million inhabitants."
"The EU’s new citizens, in common with those of the rest of the EU, want to live freely in a safe and secure world."
"Security is not only a matter of combating crime, it is also a means of ensuring freedom."
"These two concepts are inextricably linked and the Commission has always sought to strike a balance between freedom and security."
"The third element of this area is, of course, justice, which helps to protect freedom and to guarantee security in an area in which mobility and relationships between people and companies across national borders is increasingly common."
"Today, many EU citizens still fear enlargement’s potential impact on security."
"It is important that we address those fears rationally."
"The process of enlargement has made it possible to strengthen the new Member States’ ability to contribute towards developing stability and security throughout the European Union, not only because they have access to the Community but also because of the improvements in the police and the judiciary that the Commission has supported during these last five years."
"Negotiations with the accession countries were only concluded when it was decided by mutual agreement that a satisfactory level of compliance with the existing legislative framework and sufficient ability to implement and enforce that framework had been achieved by the new Member States."
"It transpires that all of these countries need to make further progress."
"The Commission will carry out its usual role of guardian of the Treaties and will continue to offer significant financial assistance as a follow-up to the PHARE projects, which will continue until 2006, and, subsequently, by means of a Schengen mechanism and transitional arrangements."
"No less importantly, it must be made clear that all Member States are welcome to enjoy the possibilities of European Union funding under general Justice and Home Affairs programmes, on a completely equal footing."
"A further aspect that has been brought to the fore by the media concerns the fear of a massive movement of new citizens across Europe."
"As I have had the opportunity to state here, such fears are unjustified."
"The Commission has carried out a study showing that over the next five years, around 1% of the total working population of the new Member States will exercise the right to move freely, which amounts to 220 000 people per year, in an EU of over 450 million inhabitants."
"I should like to mention, based on my own personal experience, that, on the eve of Spain and Portugal joining the EU, similar fears were raised, which turned out to be completely unfounded."
"The Accession Treaty provides for the possibility of the current Fifteen Member States implementing transitional measures."
"These measures are adequate and I trust that they will indeed be only transitional."
"Enlargement represents a major challenge for certain policies, such as tightening external border controls."
"We hope that the External Borders Agency will be operational as of 1 January 2005 to support the efforts made by the ten new Member States to improve border controls."
"As Parliament is aware, internal border controls in the new Member States will only be removed following a process of a specific evaluation and a subsequent decision by the Council."
"This two-stage process can only be deemed complete once the Schengen Information System, known as ‘second generation’ SIS, has been established."
"The timetabled development of SIS-II therefore constitutes a priority for the Commission and will require the active involvement of all Member States."
"In the field of judicial cooperation, mutual trust becomes even more crucial in an enlarged Europe, to ensure that the principle of the mutual recognition of judicial decisions applies across the board."
"Accordingly, we must improve certain measures contained in procedural law, such as those provided for in the framework decision on procedural safeguards in criminal proceedings, which the Commission has just submitted to the Council."
"We must also enhance mutual trust between all EU Member States by improving knowledge of each other’s legislative and judicial systems."
"At Parliament’s request, the Commission is in the process of creating an exchange programme for judges from all Member States, in both civil and criminal matters."
"Lastly, as regards the policies of Justice and Home Affairs, we face a number of challenges."
"One of those is visa policy and, more specifically, the principle of reciprocity in this area, an issue to which the Commission has paid close attention."
"In an enlarged EU, so that the area of Justice and Home Affairs can operate, it is essential that the Constitutional Treaty enters into force, that it sets about dismantling the pillar structure and that the codecision process becomes more commonly used, which will guarantee full democratic responsibility for decisions taken in this area."
"Judicial control must be improved, extending the Court of Justice’s competence and granting the Commission powers commonly used in infringement cases."
"The draft Constitutional Treaty addresses these challenges, and proposes that qualified majority voting be introduced in the area of common immigration policy, asylum and external borders, and that the provisions be strengthened as regards integrating third country nationals residing legally in the European Union."
"The principle of solidarity, which already applies today, will be more clearly laid down in the Constitutional text concerning border controls, asylum and immigration."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to recall, lastly, that 1 May is not only the date of the accession of the ten new Member States but also the deadline set in the Treaty of Amsterdam for completing the first stage of the phasing-in of the area of freedom, security and justice."
"The Commission will soon submit a communication in which it assesses the progress made in the past five years and which will include the first guidelines for future priorities."
"These priorities will be based on the shared values of freedom, security and justice in an enlarged Europe and must be based on the advances that we all hope will be provided for in the future Constitutional Treaty, which must be approved, and thus come fully into force, without delay."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like firstly, on behalf of my group, to welcome the 162 new Members of this House, and we hope that this first debate on freedom and security for citizens in the enlarged Europe and, for me, my last one as a Member of this House, will lead to some clear reflections, not only on the framework already created over more than 50 years of the European project, but also on the challenges facing us in this common future we have just begun."
"Freedom, security and justice."
"In my view, these are areas in which the urgent need to confront the profound changes which are approaching in a Europe of 450 million citizens and which, unfortunately, as we can see, sometimes moves forward as a result of such tragic events as terrorist attacks and the regrettable deaths of the victims of immigration, has been demonstrated."
"It is clear that the great challenge awaiting us is to organise a new geo-political and demographic space in a dynamic, changing and constantly growing Europe."
"I would therefore like to emphasise everything the Commissioner has just said on this point."
"We have worked intensively over the last five years to enshrine the guarantees and protection of the fundamental rights of our citizens, and the results can be seen, such as the approval of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the steps aimed at approving common guarantees in criminal proceedings throughout the Union and the implementation of the European arrest warrant, a guarantor for one of our principle rights, which is the right of society to pursue relentlessly those who endanger the lives and security of the citizens."
"Without forgetting the protection of the victims of crime and particularly the victims of terrorism."
"In any process, however, such as the one with which we are currently occupied, we must not forget to look forward."
"To this end, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we must change anything that is not working."
"It is crucial that we modify the current decision-making method, with its cases of overlapping initiatives or delays resulting from the unanimity rules as well as flagrant delays in incorporating Community legislation into that of the Member States."
"We must also reinforce and make progress on the achievements already made."
"I would therefore like to insist on the proposal I made in the annual debate on the report on the area of freedom, security and justice, such as producing a Tampere II."
"Finally, I believe that the new European Constitution must enshrine the hope represented by the chapter aimed at the regulation of this new area, that is, we must bring the legal instruments into line with the reality of the dangers currently threatening the freedom and security of the citizens."
"It only remains for me, Mr President, to thank your Presidency and the Commissioner for your invaluable contribution to the defence of the values and rights of a society such as ours which wishes to feel increasingly free within a new enlarged area, in which security and justice, in turn, also provide the guarantees for that freedom."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by paying tribute to Commissioner Vitorino."
"He said at the beginning of his contribution that it would be our last opportunity to hear him."
"I hope that is not true and that those Members who return to the new Parliament will again have the pleasure of working with him."
"I am sure colleagues will agree he has been one of the best and most accessible of all the Commissioners."
"He has worked closely with us in our committee on a very difficult dossier and very challenging topics."
"It is our joint challenge to enable everyone in the new wider Europe to live freely in a safer world, of which Europe is just one part."
"It sometimes seems that we are playing around with a jigsaw puzzle and do not even know what all the pieces are. We certainly do not know yet how they fit together."
"Mr Hernández Mollar spoke of the deep-rooted challenges we face."
"In the work of our committee on citizens' rights and freedom, the challenge must be to ensure that despite deep-rooted changes we are still able to maintain the rights of over 400 million EU citizens to freedom of movement, a decent education and a decent home."
"The enlarged Europe must not be an excuse for us to replace the Iron Curtain with a division between rich and poor people and rich and poor countries."
"Rights have to be equal wherever you live within this new Europe, whatever the colour of your skin, your ethnicity, your religion or whether you have no religion at all."
"Earlier this afternoon there were some bigoted contributions from the other side of the Chamber about the dominance of Christianity in Europe and how important that was."
"I reject that."
"It has no place in these debates because people's rights should not be affected by religion, gender, origin or age."
"We must do everything we can to protect minorities and to give them freedom from oppression. This includes the rights, for example, of the Roma people in some of the Eastern European countries."
"The Commissioner was right when he said that enlargement is a real challenge and it is not one that we have by any means addressed yet."
"We have the challenge of the external frontiers, to which he referred."
"In our efforts to control those frontiers and stop supplies of drugs and weapons, we must not make a barrier between our wealthier 25 countries and the poorer states just outside those new frontiers."
"I am sure, Mr Vitorino, you share with us the desire to make certain that there is justice in this enlarged Europe."
"You spoke of companies and businesses."
"That must continue and include freedom of the press – not closing down newspapers, as we have seen in some countries."
"There is a right to free television, and free media, not those dominated by a few people with vested interests."
"There is a lot for us to do."
"Commissioner, you have referred to many of the points this afternoon."
"I shall just mention a couple more."
"We must ensure that there is no oppression of those people who wish to move around, to exercise their right to free movement."
"You. have referred to the hysteria in some of the press about that."
"The right to access asylum must be reinforced, because we in this Parliament and the Commission are guardians of those rights: the right to asylum for those in need."
"The Commission is one of the guardians of those Treaties and of those rights."
"We can look forward to the future with some optimism."
"If there is anyone listening who is in a position to look for a new President of the Commission, my suggestion – for what it is worth – would be you, Commissioner Vitorino."
"I hope that will be taken on board."
"We thank you for all you have done and I thank Mr Hernández Mollar and other colleagues on the committee for everything they have done over the last few years."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is its values that make Europe great: The values of freedom and solidarity and its determination to adhere to them."
"This is why the European Union is one of the most successful, most attractive ventures, as is demonstrated by the present enlargement, because the new Member States and those that will join in the future have chosen Europe largely because of these values."
"We are talking about freedom now, the four basic freedoms."
"Permit me, Mr President, Commissioner, to talk about one of the four basic freedoms now, namely the free movement of workers."
"Over the last few months in all the Member States and yesterday here, in this room, we have all been celebrating the enlargement."
"We could freely celebrate the enlargement; we had good reason to do so."
"Even so, a small shadow was cast over the celebration: the fact that only three of the existing Member States guarantee the free movement of workers, and only one of them – Sweden – does so without restrictions."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we Liberals oppose any restriction on the free movement of workers."
"Even a temporary restriction."
"We do so firstly on principle, and secondly for practical reasons."
"On principle, we are opposed to the fact that one of the basic rights is limited, and on principle, we feel that this limitation negatively affects the festive mindset as regards accession."
"There are practical reasons for opposing it as well, and I fully agree with Mr Vitorino."
"The fears are exaggerated; every survey shows that the free movement of workers, or the demand for it, is not significant in scale."
"As far as Hungary is concerned, we are well aware that it will affect barely 2% of the workforce."
"Those affected will be well-trained young single people, 85% of whom want to find employment in other countries for just one or two years."
"Ladies and gentlemen, something else is happening here."
"The European Union wants to become a region of growth and competitiveness, and the Lisbon Process aims to achieve this."
"This will be difficult to achieve unless a unified and flexible labour market is established."
"Without this, Europe will never achieve the targets for 2010 set out in the Lisbon Process."
"If the workforce is not allowed to move to the production capacities, then the production capacities will move to the workforce."
"This connection must also be borne in mind."
"For this reason, at the end of my speech, please let me ask the Commission to make a statement similar to Mr Vitorino’s – in the form of a Commission Statement – for removing restrictions, and we call on the Member States to include this matter on the agenda of the next Council Meeting in June, and to take immediate steps to resolve it."
"Mr President, Commissioner Vitorino, I agree with you that the citizens of Europe want more Europe and I believe that, with a view to the future, the communication on the values of freedom and security which the Commission is to present to this Parliament should consider two significant aspects."
"It is true that we need greater security – as you have quite rightly said – in order to guarantee freedom, but that guarantee must not take the form currently employed by the United States Government, which identifies security with a reduction in freedom."
"If we want more Europe we must provide greater guarantees of democratic freedoms and not take the view that through greater security, with greater resources, only by reducing freedoms, will we guarantee that security."
"I would like to say that in order to combat terrorism we need intelligence at European level and coordination of police services at European level as well, elements which must be strengthened."
"Furthermore, freedoms have been mentioned, and the European Parliament is the highest manifestation of the largest democratic concentration in the world, but I believe it is clear that the freedoms of the peoples, regions and nationalities existing within the European Union must also be guaranteed."
"And the European Union must clearly condemn the massacres which are being committed against the Chechen and Kurdish people and must guarantee the rights of Stateless peoples."
"The language, culture and identity of peoples and regions must have guarantees."
"In this Europe of ours, in certain States of the Union – specifically in our State – in the name of effectively combating terrorism, initiatives have been taken which are not entirely positive, which have allowed democratic newspapers to be closed."
"As a Valencian and as a representative of a people which forms part of the European Union, I believe that this Europe of security and freedom must take full account of the national freedoms of the peoples and regions that make up the European Union."
"Given that we are talking about the issue of security, I shall talk about external security."
"I am convinced the task that the new Member States are facing is to prove their ability to have a wider view."
"They must prove that they do not see European integration merely in terms of Structural Funds, the importance of which is often overestimated."
"They must prove that they do not perceive European integration in terms of their own problems."
"They must prove that they are able to understand and to take responsibility for the further development of European integration."
"When we talk about security, we should bear in mind that our security is influenced by our immediate surroundings, by our neighbouring countries, by North African countries and by the Middle East."
"These are countries with millions of inhabitants who look toward the EU as their aim and where millions of potential illegal immigrants live."
"These people can easily fall under the influence of fundamentalist and extremist ideology and become themselves tools of terrorism, which is today the number one threat."
"If the European Union wants to ensure the security of its citizens it must, amongst other things, make its closest neighbours economically and politically stable by increasing their economic growth, reduce the possibility of migration and reduce the growth of radicalism in these societies."
"The European Union must use a new financial framework to re-evaluate its development aid policy, and must use adequate resources to ensure that those resources are used effectively."
"These are real issues and real problems that must be solved."
"I am very worried that the abstract intellectual exercises in compiling documents, such as the European Constitution, will not help us greatly in solving these problems."
"– Ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, Commissioner, it is an honour for me, as the youngest member of the European Socialists, and as a Member of the European Parliament from Hungary and Karcag, to have an opportunity to express my views on a subject that it would not have been possible to discuss 15 years ago."
"Not only because a 15-year old would have had difficulty in becoming a Member of the European Parliament, but also because at that time we did not see the slightest possibility of Hungary becoming a member of the secure and free region provided by the European Union."
"In the twenty-first century, our freedom and our security have often been in irreconcilable conflict with each other."
"Everybody would like to avoid challenges that threaten the security of one’s nation, but nobody wants to damage our civil, political and social rights won during the eighteenth century and strengthened by many revolutions, including the 1848 and 1956 Hungarian revolutions."
"It is difficult to solve these conflicts, but I believe that the Members of the enlarged European Union, together with the citizens of Europe, will be able to find the answers."
"The European area of security and the Schengen Agreement provide protection for us."
"At the same time, we must not forget that the borders of Europe are not the same as the borders of the European Union."
"In our efforts to make the Union safe, we must not ignore our solidarity with those nations whose representatives do not sit here with us at the moment."
"Europe, and within Europe, the European Union will only be able to become a great and strong community if its responsibility to ensure its safety goes hand in hand with its unquenchable desire for freedom as well."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I do not need to talk to you now about the Hungarians’ commitment to freedom, because you all know my people."
"I have often been asked what we Hungarians bring with us into the European Union."
"Among many other things, we bring our faith and our readiness to act for a Europe that is free, secure and based on solidarity."
"Mr President, I would also like to pay tribute to the work of Commissioner Vitorino over the last five years."
"He really has been a splendid Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs."
"I hope we will see more of him, not least because he would help us achieve in justice and home affairs the equivalent of the Lisbon objective to make Europe the most dynamic and competitive economy in the world."
"Why do we not have a parallel formal objective, perhaps the Tampere objective, to make the enlarged European Union the international beacon of human rights, protection of civil liberties and keeping people safe?"
"In justice and home affairs there is not the same sense of zeal from ministers about promoting freedom as about promoting security."
"Security is an aspect of freedom because no-one who is unsafe is free, but freedom is also an element in security and no-one is secure if their privacy is invaded or they are wrongly imprisoned or subject to discrimination."
"But the Council has failed to speak out against Guantanamo Bay internment and is trying to impose an agreement with the US on air passenger data transfers in breach of European data protection laws."
"It has also allowed restrictions on freedom of movement, as my Hungarian colleague has said."
"In the accession treaties there is a JHA safeguard clause, but it is focused exclusively on monitoring implementation of mutual recognition measures and framework decisions in criminal law."
"There is no clause which will check whether asylum seekers are being left destitute, equal rights are being denied to gay and lesbian people, or ethnic minority people are being abused."
"We must have a mechanism of ongoing peer review whereby we have mutual monitoring of the quality of Member States' justice systems."
"On immigration we need much better management in the future."
"Member States have agreed most of the common asylum policy, but have lowered standards of protection to do so."
"Very little is agreed for streamlining the red tape for legal migrants and there is an alarming absence of progressive and active engagement in how to respect diversity and have imaginative integration policies."
"The ceremony of raising the ten new flags yesterday was wonderful and moving, but the image it presented was exclusively white."
"In my city, one-third of the population is from ethnic minorities."
"We have to do better to serve our whole population with just and inclusive policies."
"Mr President, I very much agree with the last speaker."
"In the wake of September 11 much oppressive legislation has been forced through."
"This is a major problem because it seems that the rule of law is being pushed aside in the fight against terrorism."
"If you push the rule of law aside and ignore it you are in effect allowing the terrorists to win on another front."
"Today we had to vote for the third time on what was basically the same issue."
"This is very alarming because it showed that there was much unwillingness within the Council to accept the democratic will of Parliament: it obviously hoped that if it asked us enough times it would get the answer it wanted."
"In relation to the PNR issue, it is extremely important that citizens have the right to data protection."
"We should have the same rights as US citizens if there is any agreement, that is fundamental."
"Regarding the issue of Christianity versus Islam there is a major problem."
"This is not acceptable."
"Europe has to allow all people to live freely within society, whether they are Muslim, Christian or of no religious belief."
"Everybody should be entitled to equal rights."
"There is a lot of hypocrisy regarding people from the new Member States."
"All 15 of the 'old' Member States have introduced measures restricting the rights of the new countries' citizens coming in as regards whether they can get jobs, travel or benefit from social services in the 'old' Member States."
"This is creating double standards, which is a major problem."
"Finally, on the issue of third country nationals, we have a major problem throughout the European Union with this 'Fortress Europe' mentality, keeping out the so-called non-desirables: non-whites, non-westerners or non-Christians."
"In all countries we have a major problem with more and more oppressive legislation being introduced."
"Even things like the Geneva Convention are being pushed aside in the interests of keeping people out of Europe."
"We have to take down the barriers."
"We have to allow Europe to be open and we must help these people."
"We have to look at why they are fleeing from their own countries."
"That is the way to look at peace, security and justice for all."
"Mr President, I rise to say a few words of farewell."
"That will probably make many people happy and it might make some sad."
"It does not make me necessarily glad but, because of now leading the largest party in Northern Ireland, I have more duties at home and I feel I must attend to them, especially at this time when certain talks are taking place."
"For the past 25 years I have been a Member of this House, elected at the top of the poll from Northern Ireland."
"I have been gratified to have the largest amount of votes cast for any person elected to this Parliament."
"Its rapid growth of jurisdiction is the political mystery of the age."
"However, I do not believe it is to the best advantage of the European peoples."
"Enlargement has triggered the destruction of the cooperation of the sovereign states of Europe and brought about the construction of the sovereign superstate of Europe, the new Tower of Babel."
"The effects of the full battle between the voluntary cooperation of the European sovereign states and the dictatorial incorporation of those states into the European superstate have yet to be witnessed."
"In our history superpowers have always been detrimental to peace."
"The wars in the Balkans in recent years have been conveniently forgotten when fiery advocates of an almighty Europe tell us the new Europe has prevented and stopped wars."
"Some prevention, and some stopping."
"The present enlargement is bringing with it loads of difficulties, generally in the economic field and particularly in the agricultural field."
"Just how serious the reaping in Europe is going to be remains to be seen."
"The day has yet to declare it."
"I especially welcome the fact that the United Kingdom will have its referendum and that the ordinary European citizens in the United Kingdom will not be robbed of their right to pass their judgement on this momentous decision."
"The continent of Europe is not our fatherland and never can be."
"The nationalities of Europe are not changed, they are the creation of God."
"No matter what sinful man may do, God has enthroned his son King of Kings and Lord of Lords."
"He is the King of the whole Earth and he shall reign and rule forever more."
"Mr President, I should like to correct you."
"I believe that the Minutes will show that my colleague Mr Pirker has given up his two minutes so that I have four minutes."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the eastern enlargement of our European Union on 1 May, to what are now 25 countries did not happen overnight, but was a ten-year-long process, which demanded an enormous amount both of the old European Union as well as of the new Member States."
"In the area of justice and home affairs, many citizens of the old EU Member States were afraid of a higher crime rate after enlargement."
"Here, however, the accession negotiations, as well as an enormous amount of cooperation on the part of the new Member States themselves, have enabled us to achieve a great deal."
"Who would have thought, ten years ago, that one day German and Polish border guards would together control their borders in joint teams?"
"The new Member States were also very successful in the area of combating national crime, and so the old Member States often had to abandon their prejudices."
"Faced with more and more further threats, specifically from international terrorism, we must, in the future, act even more as Europeans."
"After the attacks of 11 September in New York, we saw what was, unfortunately, a one-off advance in our common justice and home affairs policy, with a great deal decided on in record time: the European Arrest Warrant, a single definition of terrorism, which included a framework for penalties and the freezing of all funds for terrorist purposes."
"Unfortunately, after just a year, interest was already waning and we in this House did not even manage to strengthen the Europol structure for combating terrorism."
"Once again, nations went it alone, and national plotting came to the fore; only after the tragic Madrid bombings did the issue once again appear at the top of our agenda."
"In the Council, the position of Terrorism Coordinator was quickly created, unfortunately without any real powers."
"The measures that we adopted after 11 September 2001 – that is, almost two and a half years ago – have still not been implemented in the Member States."
"The upshot is that Parliament and the European Union have done our homework but the Member States have not and so the next important questions are already on the agenda for a now enlarged Union."
"Our visa policy must be harmonised and must include the creation of a visa information system."
"Border protection standards must be unified and controlled by a European border protection agency and the second generation Schengen Information System must finally be completed."
"Europol must be even more closely involved in the national fight against crime and be given more manpower, and we urgently need the European Public Prosecutor, in order to effectively combat the defrauding of the European Union."
"Within this framework, the new Member States must take even more decisive action against corruption than has been the case to date."
"Cooperation with third countries must also be stepped up since terrorism must be combated, not just in Europe, but also across the world."
"We have, in this legislative period, achieved a number of things for the safety of European citizens."
"A great deal fell through, though, as a result of the need for unanimity in the Council and because of national egoisms."
"This is why there is hardly a content area for which the entry into force of the Constitutional Treaty is so important as that of justice and home affairs policy."
"The EU of 25 Member States will in future only be in a position to effectively combat terrorism and organised crime if we implement simpler and more transparent procedures."
"The Council in particular must change over to majority voting."
"In addition, whilst this Treaty is in place, the budget should be significantly increased, since not just agriculture and economic structures, but also safety, cost money."
"To this end, I hope for constructive and specially focused cooperation in the newly elected Parliament."
"You deserve our thanks, Commissioner Vitorino."
"We did not always agree on asylum issues, but we always gave you great support where justice and home affairs policy was concerned and I hope it was this that brought forth applause from the Left, since that shows that in the future we will be in a position to act together and be stronger than we were before."
"– Mr President, first of all I should like to welcome the first decision taken today by the enlarged European Parliament, which rejected the Council's effort to re-table the issue of the conclusion of an agreement on the processing and transmission of personal data on European passengers from airline companies to the US State Department."
"The question of freedom and security in the Europe of the twenty-five, which we are debating today, is directly linked, Commissioner, to the security of the Olympic Games being organised in Greece this summer."
"The holding of the Games under conditions of security has always been the only headache, even from ancient times, which is why the truce was the most serious part of the preparations, so that athletes and spectators could arrive at Olympia in safety."
"I believe, even if this sounds romantic, that the promotion of the idea of the truce in modern times and the education of people in peaceful coexistence would cost far less and would have more permanent results than strengthening the forces of suppression and the use of military means."
"For the Europe of the twenty-five, the 2004 Olympic Games are a golden opportunity to promote the idea of the truce at global level, by which I mean the ideals of peace, cooperation and dialogue and the rejection of violence as a means of resolving differences."
"Unfortunately, the reality of the modern world speaks of the intensification of blind violence, hatred and terrorism."
"The publication of photographs showing prisoners in Iraq being tortured and humiliated demonstrates the extent of the brutalisation and barbarity which involvement in wars and acts of violence can generate in man."
"At the same time, it demonstrates the degree of freedom of the press which we have achieved and must maintain."
"Commissioner, nearly three years since the attack on the twin towers, not only has terrorism not been eradicated, but it also appears to be creating conditions of brutalisation for those who belong to modern democracies and are supposed to be defended with fundamental freedoms and human rights."
"Will the political leaders realise that a different strategy for dealing with terrorism and strengthening security is needed?"
"The European Union of the twenty-five needs to offer an alternative proposal, a new vision and to reply to the crucial question of whether there can be security on a planet with huge inequalities in economic and social development and in the distribution of the benefits of democracy, science and technology."
"For the strengthening of security in the European Union, for a more secure world, we certainly need fresh, alternative, non-military policies and strategies and a stronger role for citizens, especially women."
"We hope that the new European Constitution will be approved soon and will constitute the democratic framework which will strengthen fundamental freedoms and security in Europe and the world."
"Finally, I too should like, Commissioner, to congratulate you on the exceptional work you are doing as Commissioner to promote the area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union, an endeavour which has, unfortunately, proven to be far more difficult than the creation of the single market and the common currency."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in our solemn speeches, we say that we are all minorities in the EU."
"What is good about this is that no one can bully any other group."
"The monitoring of minority rights was an important part of the negotiations on enlargement, yet there is no policy for linguistic minorities in the EU."
"We have demanded more of the present candidate countries than we did of previous ones."
"The situation in Cyprus following the referendum was also the most recent demonstration of the need we have for minimum rules governing the way in which ethnic and linguistic minorities are treated and governing the rights that must exist."
"It is therefore important that respect for diversity be a feature of the adopted Constitution and that the EU subscribe not only to the Council of Europe’s Convention on Human Rights but also to the Council of Europe’s conventions on minorities: both the framework convention and the Charter for Regional Languages."
"In that way, the EU would quickly obtain a yardstick for policy in relation to minorities."
"It should be possible to deal with infringements of minority rights in accordance with Article 7 of our present Treaty, in which case a Member State’s own rights would be revoked if it infringed minority rights."
"It is now time for the EU to go the whole way and recognise linguistic diversity, as well as possessing a genuine strategy for respecting such diversity."
"– Like the speakers before me, I am delighted to be speaking here for the first time."
"I will not be making any particular reference to our national situation in Latvia, nor will I talk about minorities – there will be time for that on other occasions – but about Europe as a whole."
"Freedom without security is not conceivable, as we have already heard, but the threats to freedom today are of quite a different nature to what they were in the recent past."
"If the threat to freedom previously came mainly from other countries, nowadays that is no longer the case in Europe."
"The European Union in itself is proof of this."
"The threat to freedom comes from within our country – violence is increasing, organised crime, terrorism and corruption are the most direct threats to freedom, to various human rights."
"For a long time now the criminal world has not recognised borders, so cooperation between various security bodies in the European Union, as well as beyond its borders, is especially important."
"The European Parliament must do everything in its power to ensure this cooperation."
"The sense of menace to the individual is today no longer slight."
"We must not allow a situation where fear is the defining factor in people's thought and action, where we would be prepared to yield, to compromise with those who do not respect us, because of fear."
"In order to guarantee human freedoms, sacrifices must be borne."
"Only by certain curbs on freedom can security be achieved."
"If, in our discussions of how far freedom ought to be restricted for the sake of security, we keep our ideals in mind – and these discussions should never end – then we will be on the right path."
"– The European Union – and today I finally have the right to say ‘our union’ – has been transformed from an economic union into what we call a union ‘based on values’."
"The increasing diversity of cultures, languages and religions is undoubtedly one of those basic values."
"Human rights are universal and they must be extended to everyone without any discrimination on the grounds of sex, age, material status, ethnic origin, mother tongue or citizenship."
"The rights of national minorities are an inalienable component of fundamental rights."
"Let us be honest, serious problems in this sphere remain in both the old and the new Member States, including my own country, Latvia."
"These issues were included in the Copenhagen criteria for accession."
"Experience will show how successfully these criteria are met, but what will happen next?"
"I believe that we must move on from the rhetoric of human rights to a permanent and practical involvement, we must achieve the adoption of mechanisms for monitoring legally binding statutes and their implementation."
"A very important step in this direction has already been taken."
"It has already been mentioned today that the draft Constitution included a Charter of Fundamental Rights and that the draft Constitution makes reference to minority rights."
"In particular the adoption of a Directive on racial equality must be noted."
"These, however, are just the first steps."
"I am looking at the theme of our discussion today, Freedom and security for Union citizens Within the area of European freedom and security, freedom, security and equality must be provided for all – even refugees, immigrants and guest workers."
"We have a big job ahead of us."
"I believe that we, the elected representatives of Europeans, in cooperation with other European organisations, primarily the Council of Europe, will be able to successfully resolve this extremely important challenge."
"Commissioner, as you know, organised crime is growing very strongly."
"It is mainly based outside the Union, but it is attacking our citizens and can cross internal frontiers inside the Union with total facility."
"There are record amounts of heroin coming in, cocaine, attacks on the Internet increasing every day, trafficking of illegal immigrants, of women and of children."
"There are vast amounts of money laundering, enormous quantities of counterfeit goods and currency hitting us as well."
"You know this as well as I. It is very frightening."
"However, our law enforcement agencies are only national or local and they cannot cross our internal frontiers."
"National politicians do not get credit for fighting crime outside their own countries."
"All in all, we are failing to fight international organised crime and that is why it is getting stronger."
"I have just presented you with a pamphlet."
"I also gave the press a copy this afternoon at a press conference."
"It is called 'Europe Needs an FBI'."
"Commissioner, I echo the other sentiments – you have been a very good Commissioner in this area."
"I hope, whether you stay here or go on to something else, that you will help to stir the national politicians who so far have lacked the will to muster the necessary weapons to fight international crime."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I first want to say how grateful I am to President Pat Cox for inviting President Lech Walesa to yesterday’s flag-raising ceremony at the flagpoles in my home town of Gdansk."
"Mr Walesa symbolises the changes leading to political freedom in Europe."
"The current enlargement of the European Union means that 450 million citizens now find themselves in an area of incomparably greater freedom, security, stability, and progress."
"The Union’s offer of the opportunity of membership to the former Communist countries induced the latter to accomplish the huge task of reform in order to meet higher standards such as the Copenhagen standards."
"This demonstrates that the clear offer of such an opportunity can influence the entire domestic and foreign policy of a country seeking to join the Community."
"It therefore constitutes one of the most effective instruments at the Union’s disposal, and can result in increasing the range of freedoms available to its citizens and their security."
"There is, however, a risk that following the current enlargement, the European Union may concentrate solely or mainly on strengthening the integration process instead of exerting an effective influence on its neighbours."
"This should not happen."
"The new Member States, including Poland, could be very helpful in this regard."
"I therefore wish to emphasise the urgency of introducing a bold policy with regard to areas to the south and east of the European Union."
"This includes Turkey. Despite the many current political, cultural, and economic concerns, we should keep membership open to all those willing to fulfil the criteria for joining the European Union."
"Finally, I would like to highlight that the policy of increasing freedom and security we are discussing here today and about which Commissioner Vitorino spoke, is provided for by the provisions of the draft Constitutional Treaty."
"I have in mind Article 58, concerning the European Union and its immediate vicinity, as well as the provisions on the crucial pillars respecting freedom and security."
"I would therefore like to state that in my opinion, this draft should be implemented as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, Commissioner Vitorino, over the last five years the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice has constituted a large part of the work of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and we can certainly say that there have been major reforms and tangible progress towards granting increasingly extensive rights to citizens."
"Now, as several of my fellow Members have said, the borders of this new European Union have expanded eastwards and down towards the Mediterranean Sea."
"Well, we must transfer the experience we have gained and the actions we have taken to these new borders in order, above all, to guarantee citizens’ safety: Schengen will be an acceptable development only when we have firm guarantees, firmer than those we currently have."
"Border control is a joint problem, and we must again stress that it is not a private concern for individual outer States."
"The instruments to put these synergies into practice are called Europol and Eurojust, which we must support with conviction and, in brief, with adequate resources."
"Only in this way can we fight, all together, the dangers threatening the area of freedom, security and justice: illegal immigration, trafficking in human beings, prostitution, drugs and organised crime multinationals; at the top of the list, though, is one obligation: the fight against terrorism."
"Lastly, there is a challenge, possibly just as important, waiting for those who will be here during the next parliamentary term: attainment of true European citizenship, swift asylum procedures and truly free and equal freedom of movement for all."
"Allow me, in concluding this speech and my time in Parliament, to thank Commissioner Vitorino, flattery aside."
"When I arrived here in 1994, I was told that to be a good MEP I would have to criticise and perhaps argue with the Commission every day."
"I did not manage this: either I am not a good MEP, Mr Vitorino, or you are a good Commissioner."
"I think the correct answer is the latter."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has entered an historic new phase with a total population of over 450 million inhabitants."
"Our Union, now enlarged to twenty-five countries, has greater political, geographical and economic substance."
"We have begun to share our common interests, both in the area of the economy and the internal market, and in terms of the responsibilities that we face as regards the threats to stability and security, which are not confined to borders."
"I refer to terrorism, organised crime, illegal immigration, drug trafficking and trafficking in human beings."
"The question of terrorism is an alarming problem that we currently face and should be given maximum priority."
"This is a threat to security, to our democracies and to the foundations of our civilisation; more specifically respect for human dignity, liberty, democracy, equality, respect for the law and respect for human rights are under threat."
"The European Union must do all that it can to protect its citizens, to tighten border controls and to improve security as regards travel documents, by introducing biometric data and by establishing visa systems and the Schengen Information System (SIS-II)."
"Nevertheless, I should once again like to highlight at this juncture that, if security is to be strengthened, this must always be in compliance with the other two components of our European area, which are freedom and justice."
"1 May also saw great change in the area of Justice and Home Affairs."
"A new institutional framework is now in force: in the area of visas, asylum and immigration, codecision with Parliament will enter into force, as will qualified majority voting in the Council."
"Parliament’s role will, hopefully, result in greater efficiency in addressing the repeated delays on the Council’s part, which many speakers, including Mr von Boetticher, have highlighted here."
"Commissioner Vitorino, who is here today, deserves praise for his excellent work in this area and his positive attitude towards working together with Parliament."
"It is my wish that the excellent work that he has done here helps him to rise to even higher responsibilities in our Community of Europe."
"Mr President, the right to freedom of movement, that is, the right to select one’s place of residence, both in the professional and in the private sense, is one of the many important fundamental freedoms and rights enjoyed by the Union’s citizens from the beginning of its existence."
"This right, this freedom, is enshrined in the Treaties."
"It is also contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and has its own very practical dimensions."
"I refer to the abolition of internal border controls and to the elimination of all administrative barriers to settling and taking up work anywhere in the territory of the entire Union."
"From the first of May, citizens of the new Member States may travel throughout the Union without passports."
"They have been quick to exercise this right, and have enjoyed doing so from the very first day."
"This has given them a real feeling of belonging to the Community, even if they still have to produce identity cards at the borders."
"The citizens of the new Member States of the Union understand that a partial restriction on their rights to free movement is justified, until their governments are ready for full integration into the Schengen information system."
"The same cannot be said for the restrictions introduced by several governments concerning access to labour markets."
"There is no rational justification for these decisions."
"They are based entirely on exaggerated fears or cold political calculations with the next elections to national parliaments in mind."
"There is no empirical evidence that an immense wave of citizens from the new countries will flood into the old Member States of the European Union in search of work."
"Studies by independent research centres presented by Commissioner Wallström, for example, suggest quite the opposite."
"Over the course of the next five years, economic migration from the new countries of the Union to the old should not exceed 1% of the population of the ten new Members."
"The experience of previous enlargements suggests enlargement caused a reduction in the number of economic migrants, rather than an increase."
"This is what will happen this time."
"The citizens of the new Member States want to find work in their own countries, and they believe that membership of the Union will help them to do so."
"I therefore take this opportunity to appeal for restrictions on access to labour markets to be lifted as quickly as possible."
"This would certainly not be a disaster for the old countries."
"Further, the new Members of the Union would see it as a tangible sign that they too may enjoy the full rights and freedoms available to the citizens of the entire European Union."
"– Mr President, as a member of the Convention on the future of Europe, I participated in the development of the Constitutional Treaty."
"May I therefore take this opportunity to express the hope that the new Constitutional Treaty will be adopted this year and that the procedures for endorsing the Constitutional Treaty in the Member States will take place within a reasonable time span."
"As a member of the Convention I particularly wanted the Charter of human rights and freedoms to become an integral part of the Constitutional Treaty."
"This is not only important for the sake of the Charter itself and its meaning in the European Union but because it has a special symbolic meaning for those of us who come from the former socialist States."
"It is also important for the Eurosceptics, who can see that the range of human rights and freedoms is generally more extensive than it is in our constitutions."
"I do think, however, that the Slovenian constitution is particularly good."
"At the same time this is a clear sign that we have joined a community of democratic States which respect and safeguard human rights and freedoms."
"I see Europe as a flourishing community, in which peace, prosperity and the security of people and property are not merely political slogans but a reality."
"We must do everything to ensure that terrorism and crime do not grow but are fundamentally reduced."
"We do not need large, new bureaucratic organisations at the level of the European Union, but we do need increased cooperation between police forces in the Member States."
"As far as possible we need to establish a uniform policy in the fight against terrorism and crime and to increase the effectiveness of our security services through joint action."
"It is also important that we cooperate in controlling the external borders of the European Union effectively and that balanced assistance is given to those States that bear the greatest burden in this respect."
"Slovenia is a peaceful and safe country where people can walk the streets of our cities safely even during the hours of darkness."
"It is well-known that in many places in Europe it is not safe to do so."
"I therefore express the expectation that in addition to taking care of economic, scientific and general social development, the European Union will pay particular attention to the security of its citizens and the protection of their property."
". Mr President, I will be very brief."
"Firstly, on a personal level, I would like to thank those Members of Parliament who addressed kind words to me."
"It has been a privilege for me to be the first Commissioner for justice and home affairs."
"It has been a very rewarding experience to cooperate so closely and so fruitfully with this Parliament, and especially with the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"This is not just a question of faith. It is a question of deep belief that the area of freedom, security and justice will, in the years to come, be in the driving seat of the European integration process."
"I am sure that Members of Parliament will go back to their electorates in June and feel proud of the work they have done in this area over the last five years."
"Finally, Mr President, due to the fact that you personally have chaired most of the meetings I have attended in this Parliament, I feel privileged to that you have been my private chairman!"
"Thank you so much."
"The cordial atmosphere in the Chamber is plain to see."
"I can also testify to the outstanding cooperation Parliament has always enjoyed with Commissioner Vitorino and I add my congratulations to those offered by everyone else."
"I should like to say, very briefly, that it has been a pleasure and also a great honour to chair this sitting of Parliament, which has been attended by the representatives of the citizens of 25 countries."
"The debate is now closed."
"The next sitting will take place tomorrow, Wednesday 5 May from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m."
"(1)"
"(1)"
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"I wanted to raise this point yesterday, but you did not authorise me to intervene."
"I want to draw your attention and that of Parliament to the fact that on 29 April the Council signed two legislative acts without having had the opinion of the European Parliament, the pretext being that it had fixed a deadline which we had not respected."
"I want to point out that the same pre-emptive deadline has been fixed for today on the draft agreement with the United States on the air passenger data transfers – the so-called PNR agreement."
"To avoid the will of Parliament being negated, I request that you send a formal request to the Presidents of the Council and the Commission that they should abstain from taking any decisions before the Court has given its judgment, especially during this electoral period."
"This would be the minimum that we could expect in the framework of loyal cooperation between the institutions."
"The delay should not be too long because the Court has already announced a deadline of 6 June for the parties to present their arguments and it seems that the Court is speeding up its proceedings and may well reach a judgment before the summer."
"In those circumstances, it does not seem too much to ask that the Council and the Commission should respect both our institution and the Court of Justice, and not undermine the rule of law, given that the Court is willing to progress speedily."
"I fear these two precedents on 29 April."
"I ask you to invite them formally to abstain from signing the agreement."
". Mr President, I share Mrs Ludford's view."
"I will not repeat what she said."
"I only want to draw your attention to the fact that yesterday, I wrote a letter to Mr Gargani, the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, to remind him of the debate held in that committee on 6 April, in which we decided to set the Court procedure in motion."
"In that debate, however, another procedure was discussed, in the event that neither the Council nor the Commission would take Parliament's opinion into consideration."
"Last night, there was insufficient time to discuss this letter, but the chairman promised me to take note of it and deal with it effectively."
"To be on the safe side, I shall also e-mail it to you."
"If the Council goes ahead and signs all the same, then I think we should start a different procedure."
"I wanted to draw your attention to that."
"Although the House was somewhat divided on the issue, the majority was consistent in the different votes that have been held on it over the last two-part-sessions."
"It therefore seems appropriate that I should remind the other institutions of the concerns of the House in this regard and inform them of the points made here today."
"I shall do so this week."
"Mr President, at last night's meeting of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, the chairman, Mr Gargani, and the committee agreed that they wished to stand by the substance of the committee's recommendation to you of 15 April that action should be taken against the Commission for failure to act as regards answering the questions concerning Lloyd's."
"Thank you Mr Perry."
"I shall write to Mr Gargani today and copy that correspondence to you."
"Mr President, you announced during yesterday’s part-session, 4 May, that in accordance with Rule 185 of the Rules of Procedure, written declarations that have not received the signatures of a majority of Members and written questions that have not received an answer, and so on, will be deemed to have lapsed."
"In this respect, you are basing your position on Rule 185, which states, ‘At the end of the last part-session before elections, all Parliament’s unfinished business will be deemed to have lapsed subject to the provisions of the second paragraph of this Rule’."
"The third paragraph of the same Rule states, ‘These provisions shall not apply to petitions and communications that do not require a decision’."
"What questions addressed by a Member of this House to the Commission and the Council require is an answer rather than a decision."
"We cannot therefore regard all those questions that have yet to receive an answer as having lapsed."
"Dismissing political questions out of hand, some of which are extremely important, makes life easier for the Commission and the Council."
"Politics abhors a vacuum."
"Parliament will continue to function until the new Parliament is up and running, and so will the Commission."
"There is no reason why it cannot answer all of the questions that have been asked today."
"Thank you for the precision you bring to the matter, Mr Goebbels."
"This is now our fifth directly-elected mandate."
"It is coming to a close, and I am informed by the services that this has been the precedent we have always followed."
"However, in the light of your point on the wording of Rule 185, I believe that I should correspond with the Council and the Commission and suggest to them that, subject to our Rules, it would indeed be in order for them to answer the questions you mention."
"We should set a new precedent for the future in this regard, and I shall do so.(2)"
"The next item is the presentation of the new Members of the enlarged European Commission."
". – Mr Cox, ladies and gentlemen, today is a solemn occasion for me because it is my last chance to address you, as in just over a month the European electorate will be renewing this Parliament’s democratic mandate."
"These have been five years of close and constructive collaboration between the Commission and Parliament."
"At times we have had our disagreements; at times our proposals have kindled heated debate in this House."
"This debate, however, has always been frank, open and constructive."
"I should therefore like to offer you my heartfelt thanks for the collaboration, the stimulus and also the criticism that I have been given."
"Ladies and gentlemen, today, as one chapter closes, a new chapter is opening in the story of European integration: a great new chapter."
"We have been waiting for these days for a long time, but at last enlargement is a fact."
"For me, 1 May 2004 will remain the best day I have ever spent in the Commission."
"Indeed, enlargement is leading all the institutions into the future, and the Commission is now entering a different phase, a transitional period that will end on 1 November."
"Over the last few weeks you have met the Commissioners one by one during the exchanges of views you have had with them."
"Today I can introduce them as a body, the first Commission of the new Europe."
"In this interim period we are organising the transition between the current Commission and the new 25-member Commission, which will take office in November."
"That is why we have taken the unprecedented step of teaming up our new Commissioners with ten Commissioners already in office without allocating portfolios, which would have adversely affected the work of the College in these last few months of its life."
"These Commissioners will, however, take part fully in College decisions, and their votes will have the same weight as those of all the other Commissioners."
"They are going to have – indeed they already have – a greater responsibility, because they are even more visibly the face of the European Union, to their fellow countrymen and women: theirs is a crucial role at a time when our new fellow citizens are becoming familiar with the Union and its workings."
"While in a formal sense my Commission is coming towards the end of its natural life, from a practical point of view we have a full agenda in front of us."
"In the next few months we must achieve the strategic objectives set out in the work programme that we drew up with you and which we promised you we would observe."
"We have decided not to undertake any new initiatives in this transitional period but to concentrate on completing the major commitments before us."
"I should like here to outline the main issues of these major commitments that we have already worked out with you."
"First, although it does not depend directly on us, is the long-awaited decision on the European Constitution."
"I am confident it will be adopted; this will send out a strong message for the future of the Union and will put the machinery in place for the Union to work effectively."
"The conditions are right for the forthcoming European Council in June to get things moving again and to bring the Intergovernmental Conference to a conclusion."
"The Commission will collaborate with the Presidency in every possible way in order to achieve an agreement on the Constitution."
"The second major objective is to ensure the success of enlargement."
"Now that these Member States have joined, we have to give due consideration to the aspirations of the other candidate countries, and so over the next few months we must carry forward the negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania, which are going well."
"We have already recommended starting negotiations with Croatia, and the Council is to make a decision on Turkey at the end of the year on the basis of a recommendation that the Commission has been called on to adopt in the autumn."
"Lastly, we must push ahead with the work of preparing the new financial perspective for the period after 2006."
"As you know, we have gone beyond thinking simply in accounting terms and have given the exercise a political basis, because we have to organise the political project of an enlarged Europe in line with the resources needed to carry it through."
"The political project we propose is supported on three pillars: sustainable development, European citizenship and Europe’s role in the world."
"With regard to the first pillar, sustainable development, there has been mounting concern for some time now about the health of the European economy."
"Our analysis of the situation is well-known, and has been supported by you all."
"The backbone of our action is the Lisbon/Gothenburg strategy, which marks out our path for development and growth until the end of the decade."
"Our project seeks to give fresh impetus to the European development model by focusing on competitiveness, employment, and solidarity between regions and across generations."
"Once again I must express my disappointment at the slowness of the decisions made so far: the Commission and Parliament must continue to urge the Member States to move down the path that they themselves marked out but have not followed."
"The second pillar of the proposal is to give real substance to the concept of European citizenship."
"Up to now the Union has focused especially on creating an economic area in which freedom of movement and common rules apply."
"In future, our united Europe must become an area of security, justice and civil liberties."
"As for the third pillar, Europe in the world, we propose that Europe should take its model for managing relations between countries out into the world."
"In that way we will be giving a practical response to the deteriorating international situation, which we observe with extreme concern."
"To the countries around us we are proposing our neighbourhood policy, which seeks to extend to the whole continent of Europe the model of peace, democracy and prosperity that is the hallmark of the Union."
"We will have to put some hard work into this great neighbourhood policy over the next five years."
"In general terms, then, this is the political project we are working on."
"In the next three months we have to prepare the implementing measures and the financial plan so that the new Commission can discharge its duties according to the timetable that has been laid down."
"Ladies and gentlemen, these five years have seen great developments, and I want to highlight a few events that I feel have been particularly significant."
"The first is the euro. After years of remarkable but intangible achievements, Europe now has in its common currency an exceptional instrument for political and economic unity, and I mean both political and economic unity."
"The practical and symbolic significance of all this is even greater than we might have anticipated."
"The second great event was the arrival on the world economic scene of the Asian giants, starting with China."
"All this is producing a whole new global balance in production and trade which we cannot ignore."
"It is a new reality that we have to come to terms with, and we can only cope with it if we remain united in defending our interests and our values."
"The third event is the Convention. Although we are still awaiting the Constitution, there is no doubt that the Convention was something completely new in the way politics is done in Europe."
"The debate on the future of Europe involved all the main players; it took place in the full light of day; and it produced a coherent text on which the Intergovernmental Conference has been able to work effectively."
"I believe these great steps forward in the democratic life of the Union prepared the way for the fourth event that I want to recall, which is the emergence of a truly European public opinion."
"I am referring in particular to the events surrounding the conflict in Iraq since late 2002."
"For the first time in our history we saw a wave of opinion attracting large majorities in every country in the Union."
"The people of Europe demanded that, when all avenues for negotiation had been exhausted, any military intervention in defence of our security should be based on international legitimacy of the kind that the European Union embodies and champions."
"These five years have thus seen changes that are quite out of the ordinary: the pace of our history has stepped up considerably."
"I see a very simple consequence in all this: in the past Euroscepticism was perhaps a luxury the Union could tolerate; today, with these changes, Euroscepticism can only bring us certain defeat."
"Ladies and gentlemen, these years spent serving the European cause have wrought profound changes in me too."
"I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that in the months and years to come I shall continue to fight for a decisive, passionate idea of Europe."
"The time of lukewarm beliefs and half-hearted commitments is over; the time of ambivalence is over."
"Europe needs determination, vision and courage, and I shall be throwing all the enthusiasm and strength I can muster into the fight."
"President Prodi, we thank you for the leadership you have given and we also thank you for the European conviction that has been total and consistent throughout your period in office."
"– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, new members of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, today is a solemn occasion, but it is also the day on which our work begins."
"On Monday, we welcomed new Members to our House, and we would have liked you, Mr President of the Commission, to have been here in Strasbourg to share our joy."
"You are here today, though, and we are glad that you have come to join us, along with the new and current members of the Commission."
"We have always regarded the Commission as a sort of government."
"Romano Prodi took up office as its President five years ago; some of the Member States’ governments have been fiercely critical of him, but we have always supported him, for the members of the Commission are of course politicians, albeit not tied to political parties."
"I wish the new Commissioners good luck and success in their work, and would like to assure them that our group will give them every conceivable support."
"We welcome Péter Balázs, Joe Borg, Ján Figel', Dalia Grybauskaitė Danuta Hübner, Siim Kallas, Sandra Kalniete, Markos Kyprianou, Janez Potočnik and Pavel Telička."
"From the Member States that belonged to the European Union even before 1 May, we give an equally warm welcome to Jacques Barrot and Joaquín Almunia, as well, of course, to Commissioner Dimas, with whom this plenary has already had dealings."
"I see it as very important that we should get back to a consensus on what the European Commission’s role is."
"I know that this is a particular topic of discussion in those countries that have now joined the European Union, and I regard the talk in some of them about how the Commissioners from the new Member States are too European, as utterly mistaken."
"To those among the new Commissioners who face such reproaches at home, I would like to say that we are right alongside you if you are putting the well-being of the European Union first, for that is the role you have to perform under the constitution, so to speak."
"You represent the European Union as a whole, and in your work Europe’s interest must come first; you can always rely on the support of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"If you have opposition to contend with in your own countries, we will be there to defend you!"
"I hope you will not mind my saying, by way of a recommendation, that you do of course have an important role in relation to your own countries, one that you share with the Members of this House, as, so to speak, communicators of the European ideal to the states from which we come."
"So I hope that the members of the Commission from the new Member States will, together with Members of the European Parliament, be successful in explaining to their countries the need for European policies and in getting the message across that those who consider only their national interests are actually damaging them."
"Only if you ally your own nation’s interests to those of Europe as a whole will you be able to advance its cause; there will be no allies in Europe for those who are blind to all but their own country, and so they will be unable to do anything for it."
"That is why interests have to be represented at local, regional, national and European level simultaneously, and I wish the new members of the Commission much success as they go about doing that."
"A few moments ago, I described the members of the Commission as politicians but not party politicians."
"Mr President of the Commission, I cannot spare you the serious request that you devote the remaining months of your Presidency to continuing to preside over the Commission in a truly effective manner and to concentrate on your work there rather than on domestic political disputes in Italy, your own country."
"The European Union Summit is to be held on 17-18 June, and so, Mr President, it might well be advisable for us to hold another Conference of Presidents on the afternoon of Thursday 17 June and discuss how to organise the proceedings as a whole."
"I say this as a suggestion, so that we can, together, give some thought to that."
"Let me say, by way of conclusion, that the Commission and the European Parliament are allies."
"With this in mind, our group will be alongside the new Commission, ensuring that we succeed in the joint enterprise of shaping this European Union, with the Commission playing a decisive role, possessing as it does the power of initiative."
"We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will be supportive, and what we want to see from the Commission is close cooperation."
"If we get it, then we will, together, do great things for our European Union."
"With that in mind, I wish the new members of the Commission every success."
"We are right behind you."
"– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that 1 May was a day on which – as a leader article in a German newspaper put it – we emerged from the long shadow cast by Hitler and Stalin."
"Now, though, we have to start trudging across the flatlands of day-to-day life."
"That, above all, is what the Commission is there for, but not in the sense that we need to be led by technocrats or bureaucrats."
"Far from it; what we need is politically-minded people, Commissioners of flesh and blood who are not in thrall to party policy. On that, Mr Poettering and I agree."
"However, Mr Poettering, I would congratulate you if you were to say that to certain other members of the Commission, from all of whom – and its Vice-President in particular – we have heard or read comments that do not exactly testify to the Commission’s neutrality."
"What we need is members of the Commission who have a vision for Europe and the capacity to make policy, something that I regard as crucial, and so we in the Group of the Party of European Socialists have something to ask of you."
"First, we ask you to make it abundantly clear that you possess those things; in the hearings, some of you were rather reticent."
"It may be that you still feel shy, or perhaps you were more anxious than you probably will be after some time has passed – although you should always be a little bit afraid!"
"What is most important, though, is something else, namely the European social model, which we want to make a reality."
"There are those, including within this House, who would perhaps prefer its foundations to be swept away by a neoliberal storm."
"We prefer the spring wind, which may perhaps be a bit lukewarm, but it does refresh Europe with new blossoms and new leaves, without destroying the trees that grow here."
"We also have to reduce a lot of Europe’s deficits."
"For these, you bear a great deal of responsibility – and not just for the budget deficits."
"There are others; there are, for example, too few jobs."
"Europe is suffering from deficits in employment policy."
"As the President of the Commission has said, our competitors are in America, in China, and now in India."
"I warn against competing only among ourselves, with the lowest possible tax rates, in order to push each other out of the market, and then, as a matter of policy, relocating jobs from one part of the continent to others."
"Instead, we want to join together in creating jobs in this continent of ours."
"We also need to take the Lisbon strategy seriously, and then even more seriously; that much is evident to me from seeing what is going on in some countries as regards investments in education, training, research and development, as well as infrastructure."
"Thinking of transport policy, for example, the infrastructure in the new Member States is very poor and underdeveloped."
"What I would like to see, not only from these countries, but also from the European Budget, is more money for education, research, for development, and also for infrastructure."
"There is no doubt that there is a link between this and sustainable development."
"Taking Kyoto as our slogan, the second example is the legislation on chemicals."
"In these areas, too, we in Europe must be pioneers, but, above all where external economic policy is concerned, we must ensure that we are not alone in implementing Kyoto and adopting stringent laws on chemicals."
"Instead, we must avail ourselves of every opportunity to urge others, America, Russia, China, and Japan among them, to abide by these agreements."
"Otherwise – and this is where I agree with the Vice-President, not where her comments on the Spanish Government are concerned – we will end up in serious difficulties as regards competition and our competitive position, with consequent heavy demands being made of external economic policy."
"Mrs Hübner, thank God, answered that question in the affirmative."
"External economic policy, too, must become a means whereby we defend our European social model, for example where public services are concerned."
"It is not acceptable for the Commission to keep on defying a vote of this House by attempting to put the liberalisation and eventual privatisation of water, local public transport, health and education on the agenda."
"Our group, too, is in favour of opening up markets, and we have, together with the Commission, taken positive action in this respect; I, for example, did so in relation to railways."
"There are areas, though, that are of the very essence of what we understand as being a national or European social model, so that should be accepted accordingly and they should continue as such."
"As I have already said, we want a political Commission, with Commissioners of flesh and blood who speak their political minds in this House."
"We want a Commission with which we can argue. There are several I can see here, with whom I have been more than happy to argue, for they too were emotional, because there was sometimes rage and anger underlying their actions."
"Under such circumstances, we can argue with you, and you should argue with us, but be frank with us, be honest with us, without evading the issues!"
"If your arguments with us are characterised by frankness and honesty, then we will support you for the sake of Europe as a whole, in which, of course, we all have a very great political interest."
"Mr President, on behalf of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Group I congratulate the President of the Commission on assembling a talented team of new Commissioners from the ten new Member States, France and Spain."
"We welcome the political balance that is found among the ten, as well as the presence of three women."
"My Group will be giving its support to the enlarged Commission when we vote at noon today."
"The European Union needs a strong, legitimate and accountable Commission, capable of providing political vision and leadership."
"Our leaders must reflect this in the Constitutional Treaty and in their nominations for the next Commission President – but we cannot have a strong Commission until this House takes more seriously its role as the third branch of European government."
"Once in every five years this Parliament is the Union's personnel officer."
"We are there to take the proper measure of those appointed to the Commission or its presidency."
"To date our hearings of Commissioners have been handicapped by too much partisanship and too little sustained, in-depth questioning."
"So all of the Commissioners nominated in November can expect tough questioning from MEPs of the political centre, the kind of questioning that was too little in evidence at last month's hearings."
"This Commission is the first for a new enlarged Europe and the imperative for Liberals in this House is to ensure that it is effective, committed and competent."
"It is also important that we restate and establish once and for all the long-standing principle of individual responsibility of Commissioners to Parliament for their policies and their departments."
"It is inevitable that the work of this Commission will bind that of the next, just as the work of this Parliament will not be undone on 14 June."
"Like any executive, the Commission aims to provide continuity in the management of Europe's business."
"Much of this business has political import, yet there should be no suggestion that business cannot be done simply because the Commission is approaching the end of its term."
"That argument not only impugns the professionalism of the Commission and its officials, but it parades a tenuous grasp of the European agenda."
"The Commission's mandate is for the running of the European Union and yet there seem to be some in this House who would have it closed down for the summer."
"Do they not envisage that the settlement of the European Union's budget for the next seven years or the question of Turkish membership might make some demands on the Commission's attention between now and November?"
"To close down the Commission's right of initiative at this point would not only be wildly impractical, it would be downright irresponsible."
"Let us read between the lines here."
"My Group will not be party to efforts to paint the Prodi Commission as a lame duck."
"Nor will we be a part of attempts to manufacture that lameness now by restraining the Commission's powers."
"European Commissioners are bound to leave their politics at the water's edge."
"This House should show a similar maturity."
"The treaties require a degree of impartiality from Commissioners that would be difficult to counterfeit and that is why, for all their posturing, the critics of Mr Prodi have yet to provide any evidence that his other interests have negatively affected his work in Brussels."
"European Liberal Democrats and Reformers in this House have had their share of criticism of some of the Commission's policies but we have always recognised its individual talents and its collective commitment."
"This week we need only think of the extraordinary work of Commissioner Verheugen in helping secure a successful European enlargement."
"The new Commission will begin its term with one thing in its favour."
"Many familiar faces are likely to be there again in November."
"This continuity can and should be an asset."
"Likewise the Commission must have the necessary latitude over the next five months to prepare the ground and to maintain the momentum necessary to make it a success."
"Indeed, to insist on anything else – especially just to pay party political dues – is risible."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, new Commissioners, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I should first like to extend heartfelt greetings to the Commissioners of the ten new Member States and to welcome them warmly into the institutions of our greater Europe."
"Hailing, as I do, from a cross-border region, Lorraine, which suffered greatly during conflicts with neighbours and in the aftermath of those conflicts, I am fully aware both of the need henceforth to unite our voices and our strength and of the challenges involved in doing so, yet I am also aware of what we all stand to gain from so doing."
"This enlarged European Union, this united Europe, or reunited as some would have it, with its rights and a political design finally restored in line with its geography, must establish a new European spirit that is free from the rancour of the past and from the yoke of nationalism."
"I would urge the new Commission team towards just such a shared spirit of solidarity, and of common responsibilities and common interests."
"Today, and most importantly, I would also urge your new executive – which is, of course, still in its infancy in terms of its composition – towards a completely democratic spirit, and towards ensuring that the citizens’ voices in our European Community are listened to and respected."
"It could scarcely be a worse omen or a worse baptism for your college that policies that are disconnected or far removed from what the peoples of our Union are saying and thinking are being proposed, because a shared spirit and a European public have been formed, and expression has been given to them within our European space."
"The Iraq crisis revealed this in sharp relief when political Europe once again shot itself in the foot through political calculations or strategies adopted in certain cabinet offices."
"Events, however, proved the European public right."
"Mr President, Mr Prodi, I should like to thank you most sincerely for recalling the major policy guidelines, which, as you said, Parliament had a share in deciding, and which it often encouraged."
"I should like to thank you for having again put sustainable development at the heart of the European project, because these political decisions were taken by all of the Heads of State, in agreement with the Commission."
"I refer to decisions such as those taken in Lisbon and Gothenburg, which must be complied with and enforced."
"The social environment and the economy are intrinsically linked and our proposals must be geared towards them."
"Hopefully your new Commission will not miss any further opportunities to speak on behalf of the citizens of our Community."
"The issue that most concerns them today, in the field of food safety and GMOs, must determine the European executive’s position and the precautions it takes."
"In successive surveys, the consumers of Europe have become stronger and more determined in their shared defiance and hostility towards genetically modified and scientifically dubious produce."
"In successive meetings, the Council of Ministers has failed to achieve a qualified majority on this public health requirement."
"I would therefore strongly urge you not to allow the Council to dump these genetically hazardous experiments onto your Commission, in its current interim period, thereby forcing it to take decisions endorsing such produce."
"There is no room for any wild scientific notions or leniency towards companies when the destiny and health of hundreds and hundreds of millions of European consumers are at stake, particularly since these consumers have never expressed any desire for this new generation of foodstuffs, the consequences of which are unknown."
"I would urge the Commissioners, including the new ones, not to authorise genetically modified maize during your short term in office."
"Today, you have given the unified Europe new faces."
"When major concerns or convictions mobilise the opinions of your constituents, from Dublin to Nicosia, from Tallinn to Lisbon, please ensure that you reflect them as faithfully as possible."
"The more democratic our European institutions, the greater will be the respect for our Union on the international scene."
"Mr President, as the newly elected vice-president of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I have the honour of presenting our position."
"What we are debating today is the natural legal consequence of the expansion of the European Union."
"Each of the new countries will have its own Commissioner in a new Commission for a new Europe."
"This is an outward sign that all Member States are dealt with fairly in the treaties on which the Union is based."
"We also advocate that each country should continue to have its own Commissioner on the European Commission in future."
"We feel this is a corollary of the principle of equality and respect for each and every country of the European Union, including the smallest."
"I wish the new Commissioners well in their work, and hope it will be fruitful for all the citizens of the European Union and for all the countries of Europe."
"I should now like to make two specific appeals."
"First, I call on the new Commissioners representing the ten countries joining the European Union to devote special attention to ensuring European solidarity has real meaning."
"Through no fault of their own, these new countries lag behind the countries of the old European Union in terms of economic development."
"I must reiterate that this is through no fault of their own."
"I hope that under the leadership of Romano Prodi, the Commission, together with the new Commissioners, will do everything possible to bridge this gap in economic development between the countries of old and new Europe as soon as possible."
"It is in the interest of both old and new Member States of the European Union to do away with this divide."
"My second appeal is as follows."
"We believe the European Union must be based on justice and respect for everyone of its members."
"We hope the new expanded European Commission will ensure all countries receive equal treatment."
"We cannot allow some to be more equal than others in the new Europe."
"We cannot allow situations to arise where weaker countries are unable to make progress, while politically stronger countries are able to evade even the most stringent of criteria."
"We hope that the European Commission will safeguard this equality to ensure every citizen of every country in the European Union feels he or she is being dealt with fairly, regardless of the size of the particular country’s population."
"Finally, on behalf of the Polish UEN delegation, I would like to state that we shall support the composition of the entire Commission, and will be voting for it."
"Despite the reservations on the Polish nominee we expressed in our national parliament, we shall endorse this Commission today."
"We believe we must place our trust in it and wish it all the best in this difficult work on behalf of all the nations of Europe and of Europe itself."
"Mr President, we are delighted to welcome ten new members of the European Commission today."
"For us Dutch people, it is a symbolic day, because each year on 5 May, we commemorate and celebrate the end of the Second World War, a war which ended sadly, with a divided Europe."
"Now, 59 years later, there is true healing, and Europe is free."
"We hope that the Commission will be able to continue Europe's healing process in full throttle."
"Yesterday, we voted on the motion of no-confidence, which we supported and had had a part in submitting."
"You may well expect us to be sour-faced today."
"Nothing could be further from the truth."
"These are all qualified candidates and we will give them our backing."
"However, we do have an urgent piece of advice for the new members."
"Do not adopt the usual tactics of certain Commissioners."
"Do not hide behind your officials, or Member States for that matter, and do not get bogged down in woolly statements, but provide concrete replies."
"Be clear and precise in your promises and honour them."
"European democracy only stands to benefit from this."
"In short, make sure that you are verifiable."
"This is something we, along with the electorate, greatly appreciate."
"Finally, complete your mandate fully and do not resign prematurely."
"The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities regrets that the area of policy of budgetary control has not been assigned separately to one of the new Commissioners, of whom there are many, and so this could have easily been done."
"Past experience has taught us that it is impossible for one Commissioner to be responsible for the budget and budgetary control at the same time."
"That leads to a conflict of interest in the fight against fraud."
"My group has given the new Commissioners a motto that will hopefully inspire them: do not step down, but act."
"We wish you God's blessing in your responsible work."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, it is time to wake up to the fact that Communism is dead, and that the inhuman version of capitalism is also doomed."
"You speak fine words to the people, but your deeds are directed against them."
"You act to their disadvantage."
"You say you are on the side of the poor, but in your actions you help liberals and the globalists at the expense of the poor."
"Most Members of this House are liberals with social-democratic roots."
"You are aware of the poverty, corruption, and immorality that are tearing Europe apart, yet you turn a blind eye to the poverty affecting hundreds of millions of people in the European Union."
"It is time to introduce a European social model."
"You must know that our countries have adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child."
"These are the most important of all international instruments."
"Nonetheless, citizens’ rights and children’s rights are being infringed in our countries."
"Allow me to remind you of part of Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: ‘Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care …’"
"Are these to remain empty words?"
"Are we not bound to implement them?"
"It is high time the European Union introduced a social market economy in accordance with the social teachings of various religious groupings."
"This would be neither Communism nor capitalism."
"Rather, it would be an entirely new approach to the socio-economic development of the European Union."
"We must work together to find a way out of this difficult socio-economic situation for the well-being of the citizens of the European Union."
"I wish all the citizens of the European Union wisdom and perseverance in the struggle for a dignified life for the working people."
"Mr President, I would like to enquire how Commissioners perceive their constitutionally delicate position."
"It should be borne in mind that on the one hand, they act as a type of government for the European Union."
"On the other hand, each Member State is entitled to propose a Commissioner."
"This means that a Commissioner is simultaneously a representative of his or her country."
"At any given time, it is difficult to reconcile the interests of the whole with the interests of one’s country."
"I therefore believe Commissioners must be guided by the basic principles of the European Union."
"The principle of solidarity is the most important of these."
"I call on the Commissioners to make a statement in this regard."
"I also wanted to take this opportunity to thank the President for attending the ceremonies that took place in Poland on 3 May, Poland’s national holiday."
"I am sure I am speaking on behalf of my fellow Members too."
"We are most grateful to Mr Cox for his participation in the solemn ceremony connected with the building of the Church of the Divine Providence, which is the votive offering of the Polish people in thanksgiving for regaining their independence."
"Thank you very much."
"President Prodi, do you wish to respond on the public purpose of a European Commissioner?"
". – This is a sensitive issue."
"We all know that the Commissioners are appointed by the individual countries but in agreement with the President of the Commission."
"This very process gives rise to the position that the Commissioners should adopt: they come from their own countries but put the interests of the Union first."
"In the simplest terms, I would say that the background they depart from is their own country, while the purpose they arrive at is our common interest."
"Mr President, it is now exactly 20 years since I was lucky enough to get speaking time on my first day in Parliament."
"I am particularly pleased that I caught your eye on my last day in Parliament!"
"As I look around I see lots of familiar faces, amongst them some silver threads among the gold."
"I would like, on this my last occasion, to make a plea on behalf of the Commissioners from small countries: small may be beautiful, but small can also be highly competent, colourful and efficient."
"I believe very strongly that Parliament and the Commission have been very ably served by the Commissioners from small countries – naturally, in this context I think of my own country."
"I would hope to see in the future – particularly as other small countries are now present and we are no longer in a minority – the continuing, full participation of Commissioners from smaller countries."
"I would like to express, in this my final moment in Parliament, my deep appreciation to Parliament, the Commission and all the institutions, and also to my country for having given me the privilege of having a ringside seat at some of the most momentous political occasions of the last hundred years."
"Thank you."
"Thank you for that valedictory statement, Mrs Banotti."
"I could not have insisted on the speaking time rule on that occasion!"
"Mr President, ten new countries and ten new Commissioners."
"The ten new countries have to meet the new criteria, and so do the Commissioners."
"Unfortunately, the outcome of the hearing of one candidate, Mr Borg, was that for the time being, Parliament is not persuaded by his approach to development cooperation."
"It is in public that we consider candidates for office, and in public that we deliver our verdict on them."
"I should like to make it quite clear that we do this with full respect of the person, but also completely independently."
"We have to take our work seriously and that is why specific reference is made, in the draft resolution on which we are voting this afternoon, to the critical verdict of the competent parliamentary committee."
"We would like to see a drastic change by October; if not, we ought to look for another candidate for development cooperation and poverty control."
"I am pronouncing this verdict openly."
"However, if the Commission would at least indicate that it has taken due notice of the critical verdict in the draft resolution, that would greatly increase the value of our work in the hearings."
". – I totally agree."
"– Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Prodi for presenting the new members of the Commission and also for the considerable efforts he made to secure the accession of the ten new States."
"In its negotiations with the European Union, Slovenia attempted to use its very best people."
"In this we succeeded."
"The team conducting these proceedings within the government of the Republic of Slovenia performed its task with distinction, naturally with the consensus of all the parliamentary parties."
"The proposed candidate for the new Slovenian Commissioner is undisputedly one of these people and I am therefore delighted that he has been nominated."
"Dr Potočnik's team, and before him Mr Bavčar's team, based their success on the fact that all their negotiating positions had been endorsed in the Slovenian parliament, which was something unique and an example of great cooperation on both sides."
"Mr Prodi, the ten, or rather twelve, new players will strengthen the fine team that you lead."
"If this team also cooperates closely with the European Parliament, it will be even more successful and that is something we must not forget."
"Mr President, as a supporter of enlargement to the whole of Europe, I was deeply disappointed by the statement from President Prodi which gave the green light for eventual Turkish and Balkan countries' membership but excluded Ukraine permanently."
"This position in my view contravenes Article 49 of the Treaty, of which he is the guardian, unless of course he regards Ukraine as not being a European country."
"I hope that the new Commissioners will be more positive in their attitude towards Ukraine's aspirations."
"I welcome in particular today Mr Kyprianou's nomination as the Commissioner from Cyprus, a Commonwealth country."
"I call upon the new Commission to cease to vilify the Greek Cypriot people post-referendum."
"I too am in favour of ending the isolation of the Turkish-occupied northern community, but, before this happens, surely the handing over of EU aid money – and I call upon Mr Talat in particular – is inappropriate for as long as they are offering sanctuary to wanted fugitives from justice, particularly from the United Kingdom."
"Can the Commission look into this matter urgently?"
". – I believe the debate on the outer limits of the Union that we have had both here in Parliament and in the Council has been one of our most serious, profound and clear-cut debates."
"From it there has emerged a strategy which, for now, is considered a common strategy, although nobody can tell what will happen in future."
"It is a very clear-cut strategy: we hope to be able to conclude negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania in 2007;"
"Croatia has started its fast-track move towards the Union; as regards Turkey we have already set the timetable, as I pointed out this morning: in October the Commission’s report, and in December the decision, the frame of reference and the Copenhagen rights; then for the other countries we make a start straight away on what is suggestively termed the ring of friends, that is to say ‘sharing everything but the institutions’."
"This in no way means leaving these countries out in the cold; it means beginning a period of close cooperation, giving Europe some soft security, which is vital for us, giving these countries a chance to develop, and giving all of us together a chance to cooperate, both to the east and around the Mediterranean."
"I think this is an extremely clear-cut political doctrine, but it will take us decades to achieve."
"We are starting to carry out this policy conscientiously and in earnest, but we must not keep the continent constantly wondering what our horizons or frames of reference are."
"We have set these together; they will guide us on our way, help us make progress and will in no way jeopardise our future."
"I am sure this is the path that we all want to take together."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today, you will receive Parliament's confidence, including mine."
"However, you still need to win the confidence of the citizens, in the sense that many of them have great expectations of the enlargement, but also a degree of mistrust."
"I should like to give two reasons for this."
"Many members of the public are still of the opinion that money is being wasted in Europe, that supervision is ineffective and transparency is in short supply."
"What they would like to have from this Commission is the reiterated assurance that a zero-tolerance approach will be taken to fraud."
"That is what Commissioner Prodi promised at the beginning of his term of office and it is on that, certainly in the current climate, that the public will judge him."
"Furthermore, I still see equality and equal participation of men and women as an objective."
"Over the past few days, I have seen a huge number of men, and few women, at the highest echelons in this House."
"Finally, I should like to echo the desire that solidarity with Africa should not be overlooked."
"At a time when we are celebrating, there is war in Darfour and still no peace in Congo."
"I could make the list of conflicts much longer."
"I would urge you to carry with you, throughout the world, as far as the Middle East, Iraq and Africa, the hope for peace, which we in Europe cherish as a basic ambition."
"Good luck!"
"Mr President, if the premise is that there cannot be security in Europe without a stable Mediterranean, and whilst recalling all the sterling work done by the Commission in fostering and establishing a Mediterranean doctrine, I should like to ask how the Commission envisages establishing a less reactive but much more proactive approach to the thorny situation in the Middle East."
"How will it go about establishing a real Mediterranean policy, conscience and foreign policy for the European Union?"
". – Mrs Maes, you have raised some fundamentally important issues, the first of which is zero tolerance."
"I can honestly say that, for the first time in the history of the European institutions, we have conducted a thorough, in-depth reform of our working methods, and here I really must thank Commissioner Kinnock."
"This tends to be a job that no one wants to take on, precisely because for many long years it only causes headaches and brings no benefits; nonetheless, we really have laid the foundations for zero tolerance."
"We now have strict rules and I hope we shall truly be able to abide by them."
"The other two issues you raised are exceptionally important, and I should like to link them together."
"You will say, ‘What has Africa got to do with gender equality?’"
"You see, the other day the European Commission met with the African Union Commission, in which there were as many men as women."
"Well, I must say I felt a little ashamed, because they taught us an amazing lesson about being able to move with the times."
"Moving on to the Mediterranean, I would say that our Mediterranean policy is a fundamental part of what I have called the circle of friends."
"We must not forget that it will require substantial resources in the coming five-year term."
"I hope that the Mediterranean Foundation and then the Bank will also be approved straight away, for the question of peace hinges on this."
"The dividing line between our different cultures is precisely where tensions are running high at the moment, and this is a barrier we have to tear down."
"Thus, with economic dialogue through the Bank and cultural dialogue through the Foundation, there are great prospects for close relations and a ring of friends in the southern Mediterranean."
"I believe another solid, genuine step forward has been achieved in recent days in our relations with Libya."
"It has not been achieved for the sake of demagogy but because we really have to create an area of peace in the Mediterranean."
"No one can understand the situation as well as you who live here in the middle of it, but it is essential for our future."
"– Commissioners, I am conscious of the fact that you will be carrying upon your shoulders great responsibilities, which are to some extent controlled by this Parliament, but ultimately, it is your decisions, accepted by the Council, that count."
"You must remember that you are representing each and every one of the millions of citizens in this united Europe."
"You are faced with great challenges: the creation of employment, social security, the inclusion of those that are marginalised, the creation of wealth for the growth of the economy and prosperity."
"I know there is a lot to be done."
"We know that you have brilliant technocrats working with you, but you must never lose sight of the political aspect."
"There are wise politicians who are sensitive to the needs of the people and these reports and discussions reflect the concerns of the citizens most in need."
"Commissioner Prodi, you said that euroscepticism has been defeated and is a lost cause."
"Well, you are in for a surprise!"
"Euroscepticism is alive and growing."
"Euroscepticism does not concern Europe as such, but the European Union."
"Europe is a continent composed of states that are the property of their nations."
"Such a Europe will survive."
"The traditional Europe of Christian rules will survive, but if the European Union continues to develop in the direction of a single federal state, it will disintegrate."
". – We have to be extremely clear about this, because we very often confuse it with the tension or discontent that all European citizens feel and that all institutions, beginning with the institutions in their own countries, may have towards the European institutions."
"I am aware of the fact that it is our duty to develop closer relations with our citizens, to act transparently and to make ourselves understood, but when we look at situations more closely we see that people very often have a tougher, less open and more negative attitude towards politics in their own countries than they have towards the European Union."
"We very often mistake a crisis in modern democracy for a specific crisis in relation to our European institutions."
"In this sense it is clear that we have overstated, and still overstate, the Eurosceptic aspect and people’s positions on Europe."
"We have to work on improving the situation, but we must not confuse a passing crisis – the growing pains of democratic systems – with a specific crisis of our institutions."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to warmly welcome the new Commissioners."
"I am fortunate to know many of them."
"They are very experienced, skilful, good people."
"I would like to congratulate them and would like to express my full support for the new Commissioners."
"They are not junior Commissioners, they are not taking turns in riding in the BMW, they are fully-fledged Commissioners with the same rights and the same experience as any of the others."
"Mr Prodi, you made some very important and interesting statements on the free movement of labour."
"That is a very sensitive and important issue."
"I would like to ask you whether you are ready and prepared to take a firm stand on behalf of the Commission to abolish all restrictions on the labour market."
"It would be a very important and positive message for the new Member States."
". – Yes, because I believe that this measure is not only wrong but also pointless, absolutely pointless."
"History has shown us that there were the same fears in relation to Spain, Portugal and Ireland, and you can see how they have fitted into the Union: emigration has stopped and people have even started to go back."
"We have no particular problems with these countries."
"Our main immigration problems come from the countries of Africa and Asia; they come from the poverty-stricken world around us."
"This is the main problem."
"What is more, there is also a profound contradiction: on the one hand we are closing our borders, while on the other we are starting to make overtures to the top-level workers that these countries have."
"We are thus operating a double standard."
"I tell you again, Mr Szent-Iványi: I am absolutely against these measures, not only because they are wrong but also because they are pointless."
"I would like to take the opportunity offered by your maiden speech to underline the fact that our first contact with these Commissioners has confirmed what you have said: we have ten first-rate Commissioners, and that is a really comforting fact."
"Indeed, we will have a situation in the next Commission where these will be the senior Commissioners while most of the Commissioners from the old Member States will be the junior ones."
"The new countries will thus be teaching the old countries."
"That is Europe for you!"
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, and the new Commissioners, I offer you my congratulations and I believe that your candidature will be confirmed by our vote today."
"But it is not simply a matter of approval, for huge commitments and great challenges await you in your new posts."
"Much has been said here about money, about the Far East and the Near East, but I should like to direct my question towards a resolution of the Roma problem."
"The European Commission and the European Parliament have often reproached our country, the Slovak Republic, for not doing enough to resolve the Roma problem."
"I should like to ask you, perhaps you Mr Prodi, whether you would not consider perhaps supporting the establishment of an institute for resolving this problem, since this question has now become a matter for Europe and the resolution of the Roma problem is not just a question of financial resources."
"It is a question of an overall philosophy and a general approach and I believe far more will have to be done in this regard in the future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the implementation of Basel II will be on the agenda in the next parliamentary term."
"This deals with credit rating and collateral needed for small and family-run businesses and is of course a very important issue in the enlargement phase."
"Since Europe is shaped by small and family-run businesses, in which two-thirds of employees work and by which 80% of taxes are paid, I would be interested to know what the Commission plans to do, in order to implement Basel II as smoothly and as well as possible, so that our companies will have a chance, in the future, to ensure wealth and job security."
"Mr President, to date, the European Parliament has always been very devoted to the basic principle of equal opportunities."
"The same applies to the Commission as we know it."
"That entails a task not only for the Commissioner who has equal opportunities in his or her remit, but also for all Commissioners in their respective areas."
"I should like to have the assurance that that will be the case in the new Commission too."
"Needless to say, we are delighted that there are three female Commissioners, but we expect all Commissioners to raise the flag – if I may put it that way – for equal opportunities for men and women."
"With all due respect for the new Commissioner, Mr Borg, who is undoubtedly highly qualified, he did not convince me with regard to development cooperation during the hearing."
"Surely development cooperation should also have a strong gender dimension."
"Would the President of the Commission be able to confirm once again that equal opportunities are still important to the newly-expanded Commission too, that the Peking platform, which has been signed by all our Member States, remains a guiding principle for it, and that sexual and reproductive rights and health, for both men and women, remain an area of concern for the Union?"
". Mr President, I wish to express gratitude to both Mrs Van Lancker and Mrs Maes for raising the issue of gender policy and equality practice in the Commission."
"This provides me with an opportunity to report that, in the lifetime of this Commission, recruitment has reached a level of 50-50 between men and women for the first time in history."
"Maybe the citizens of Europe will show similar assiduousness and wisdom in ensuring that this Parliament becomes 50-50 or maybe Parliament itself would want to take the initiative and include in its policies the improvement of gender mix in the appointment of its senior management."
"I can inform the House meanwhile that, in its current lifetime, the Commission will hit its target of ensuring that 20% of its middle and senior managers are women."
"That has been done entirely on the basis of merit, but also by the deliberate fostering and encouragement of women to seek and obtain posts for which they are very well qualified."
"On wider policy issues, I am certain that the inheritance that the Prodi Commission would want to leave will bear a very strong mark of the priorities cherished by the President himself."
"In developing all other policies, I am absolutely certain that the European Commission will continue to seek to give prominence to the critical question of encouraging and supporting women as the majority gender in the population of the world as, indeed, in our continent and Union."
"Mr President, thank you for giving the floor to this very fleeting Member of Parliament."
"I joined the House on 19 April and I will leave on 19 July, with two months of interruption."
"In other words, I will have been a Member for just one month, but, over this month, I entered a Parliament with 623 Members and 15 countries and I will leave a Parliament with more than 700 Members and 25 countries."
"What a change I have brought to these institutions!"
"Over the last eight years, however, I have also been working in connection with the institutions and particularly in the world of communication."
"I have had meetings with several Commissioners, first with Commissioner Marcelino Oreja, then with Mrs Viviane Reding and recently with Commissioner Vitorino."
"It is communication that I would like to talk about now and my question to President Prodi will focus on it."
"Communication is very important and I believe that the European institutions must have a genuine communication policy."
"Not a propaganda policy, but a communication policy."
"I would like to ask President Prodi whether he believes that the last method he used, taking the communication of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and giving it directly to the Presidency, is the most appropriate, and whether he believes that now, with a much expanded College of Commissioners, the communication policy – always in accordance with the guidelines established by the European Parliament – should be led by the Commission in a more direct fashion, with a view to creating a genuine European spirit."
". – I will reply very briefly because I also have to reply on the Basel II issue, which was raised a moment ago."
"Basel II is an extremely important issue, and we worked on it precisely so as to make amendments to the initial proposals, as they were devastating for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"We were asked by the Council to amend these proposals further and we were especially asked to look in depth at all the implications for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"With the Council’s agreement, we commissioned an in-depth study from PricewaterhouseCoopers; the study is now nearly done and we will hand it to the Council for further discussion in a few weeks."
"The subject is not closed, then; it is still open and being debated."
"On the question of communications, the experiment we carried out was so that communications could be coordinated better throughout the Commission."
"I believe the improvements that we made have worked, and I think you can actually see that in the more integrated way in which we have been able to function."
"Of course, I am not prejudging the future organisation of communications: that will depend entirely on how the new President organises the whole work of the Commission."
"I do see a need, however – and here I go back to what you said, Mr Vila Abelló – for much more incisive work on communications: until now, in fact, our communications have always gone through national media and so they have reached the people indirectly, and sometimes with major problems of distortion."
"Mr President, I have just returned from a meeting with President Chissano of Mozambique, with whom you and President Prodi met this morning."
"One of the issues raised by President Chissano was the concern that ACP countries have about the prospect of enlargement and the impact of it on them in terms of the likelihood that there will be less resources for them."
"They are also concerned about the level of commitment to development cooperation which they might expect from the new countries coming into the Union."
"We in the Committee on Development and Cooperation, and the ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly, would like reassurance that we can expect the same level of commitment from the new Commission as we have from the current Commission."
"Secondly, my question relates to the prospect for the Relex family of directorates under the new Commission."
"We do not want to see our development objectives and priorities subsumed by foreign policy strategies, interests and priorities."
"We very much want to see a Development Commissioner with a remit which covers our development work across the world."
"The EU is, after all, the world's major donor in this regard; it has an enormous role to play that I hope will not become secondary in the future."
"Mr President, I should very briefly like to answer Mrs Kinnock’s first point. I have the same impression that she expressed, because yesterday evening I was in Dakar, where I attended a meeting with the least advanced countries, and we spoke with them about enlargement."
"You are right, Mrs Kinnock; there is a certain degree of anxiety in developing countries as regards EU enlargement."
"It is, indeed, one of the characteristics of developing countries that they are anxious about many things, but there is particular anxiety about enlargement. I feel that we must put it across to them that enlargement is good news for them, and we have attempted to do this with a certain number of them."
"It is good news because the enlarged EU has more weight and is potentially stronger; because the enlarged EU has opened up markets to them with 70 million new consumers, whereas, until now, those new markets had been less open to them than ours; because the enlarged EU represents a rosy future for them, especially in terms of trade."
"I feel that these are strong arguments."
"The idea nevertheless persists in many quarters outside the EU that the EU is incapable of accomplishing enlargement at the same time as attending to other matters."
"I believe that they are wrong, and that the past has shown this to be a fallacious viewpoint."
"To conclude, we have a good case, certainly as regards the developing countries, and especially the ACP countries."
"There are, therefore, many points on which we can reassure them."
"On the second point, Mrs Kinnock, I am sure that the Commission as a whole will take this request and this wish on board, which will be passed on to the relevant person at the appropriate time."
". I would like to address the concern that was expressed by Mrs Kinnock as to whether, in view of the current situation, the Commission is still providing enough resources to combat poverty in developing countries."
"I can inform her that the funds that are to be provided within the framework of the development policy to combat poverty will, for the first time, exceed the magic threshold of EUR 1 billion in the draft budget for 2005, in line with the Commission proposal."
"I believe that this shows that this Commission feels extremely committed to the aim of combating poverty."
"– Permit me firstly to also congratulate the new Commissioners, but I have a specific question for Mr Prodi."
"I have the impression that the standing of the European Commission is not particularly high, either among the general public or within the structures of the European Union itself, as a result of the instances where the wishes of Member States have predominated over the Commission’s prescriptions, one example being adherence to the principles of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"The Commission’s standing has not been helped by the fact that three Commissioners have resigned prematurely to take up posts in their national governments."
"My question is: ‘How would it be possible to improve the European Commission’s standing?’"
". – I hope the Commission’s reputation will improve now that five of its members are going to be Ministers of Economic Affairs or Foreign Affairs Ministers in their own countries."
"We are very proud that they are being drawn from the Commission to fill the highest posts in the new governments of some countries."
"We hope, and I trust, that the new Commissioners who have arrived here will include among them some future Prime Ministers or Foreign Affairs Ministers of their countries."
"This is the Commission’s job: to establish a firm bond between the various countries, with the national governments seeing the Commissioners as a kind of lifeblood helping the country to develop."
"As for the other observation you made, Mr Berg, on the matter of relations with the Member States and the effectiveness of our actions, I would just like to emphasise one thing: the consistency of the actions and programmes we have undertaken over these last five years."
"We have not always been successful, and the Council has not always matched our pace, but the Commission has never deviated from its own path for a second."
"I would recall that, if we had been able to impose our proposals, or if our lead had been followed, the Lisbon strategy would have given our European Union some very different results."
"I would like to take a moment to reply further to Mrs Kinnock."
"I hope that for the next term of office – indeed, this is something I am announcing here to you – there will be a specific directorate for Africa within the Development Directorate because, in the development context, Africa has to be a particular duty of ours."
"Africa is our responsibility."
"On other continents there are shared responsibilities and complex situations, but Africa is a specific task for us."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank the outgoing Prodi Commission."
"I would also like to welcome and congratulate the incoming Commission."
"I think the incoming Commission will have to begin by tackling three main issues."
"First, it must repair relations with other European organisations and reinforce cooperation."
"I give you the example of the Council of Europe, an organisation that is especially close to me."
"It has its headquarters nearby and is where the idea of creating an agency for migration arose."
"The purpose of the latter is to find a solution to one of the most pressing concerns for this continent."
"Second, it must also be remembered that 22 countries remain outside the European Union."
"Europe has 800 million inhabitants."
"Of these, only 450 million are citizens of the Union."
"This is why it is important to create an agency for external relations."
"Further, it should be recalled that the Union has almost 4 000 kilometres of external borders."
"1 150 kilometres of these are in my country, Poland."
"My final comment is addressed directly to the President."
"I would like to ask him how he envisions the future development of the relationship between the three main integrated groupings in the world."
"I refer to the Union, NAFTA, which is expanding to all of Latin America, and ASEAN and APEC, the Asian groupings"
"Mr President, perhaps the most important decision the Irish presidency faces is the choice of Mr Prodi's successor as President of the Commission."
"I am sure the President-in-Office of the European Council, the Taoiseach, consults you, Mr Prodi, on the sort of qualities that a President of the Commission requires."
"What answer do you give him and where can this paragon be found?"
". – My answers will be very brief."
"Regarding the new structure of Europe, I obviously refer you back to my previous reply."
"There is, of course, a further consideration to make, which is the idea of the common guardianship of our borders, the fact that we must understand that they are no longer the borders of an individual country but the borders of the Union as a whole."
"The reference to the length of these borders and especially the specific reference to Poland is a call for the solidarity of the whole Union."
"For my part, I remind you of all the progress that has been made over the past year on this specific issue."
"As for the qualities of my successor, it will be the President-in-Office of the Council and the Heads of Government who will decide on these."
"Based on my own experience, I only recommend one thing: great patience and great physical stamina."
"The President of the Commission above all needs to have the stamina to do this job; everything else will depend on the decisions that the Members of the European Council make."
"– While greeting all of the commissioners, especially those new ones, I have a question for Mr Romano Prodi."
"Mr President of the Commission, in its next term will the Commission, which you lead so well, consider some sort of more permanent European integration strategy for the Königsberg – Kaliningrad question?"
"In your opinion, would it not be of value to Europe, and allow a better understanding of this region's historical position and problems, if it were proposed that the Culture Commissioners organise an international academic conference on the contribution of the two figures – Immanuel Kant and Mikhail Kalinin – to European culture?"
". – We have debated the Kaliningrad question on numerous occasions."
"We had a very interesting discussion during our last meeting with Russia because, of course, on the table were all the problems that you, Mr Landisbergis, know only too well: the movement of labour and the movement of goods."
"Above all, though, we proposed that we should work together on the economic and cultural development of the city of Kaliningrad, so that it can truly become a point of reference both for Russia and for its neighbouring countries."
"This was a proposal, then, to move from a simple policy of good neighbours with rules in common to a strong policy of cooperation."
"The answer to your question, then, Mr Landisbergis, is in the affirmative: yes, and the cultural chapter is among those proposed."
"I hope that the climate of cooperation that existed at the last meeting with Russia will continue to prevail when, in a few days, in just a couple of weeks, we have the bilateral summit with that country in Moscow."
"I think a climate is beginning to develop in which being neighbours is not just something to sort out with border guards or legal issues or travel permits, but rather with active, mutual cooperation. This can also include commemorations of particular personalities, which must, however, be decided in the context of this true mutual collaboration."
"Mr President, 25 years ago I was working here illegally, doing manual labour."
"I was a second-class citizen."
"Now I am here as a Member of the European Parliament."
"I represent a country that has joined Europe."
"Nonetheless, many of my fellow countrymen and women still feel like second-class citizens within the Union."
"This is because they cannot legally take up work in it."
"I would like to ask the Commission what it plans to do to shorten the periods in which restrictions on taking up work apply."
"This would enable the citizens of my region of Europe to become first-class citizens."
"I would also like to say that it would be most unfortunate for the Union to distance itself from Ukraine."
"Ukraine is a part of Europe."
"It shares our cultural heritage."
"If you travel to Lvov or Chernovtsy, you will feel as if you were in Vienna, Budapest or Bratislava."
"I would like to make this appeal: let us not turn our backs on Ukraine!"
". – I think I have already answered the first of these two questions."
"The Commission is inclined to keep these transitional periods that have been adopted by many countries as short as possible; indeed, for the Commission, it would have been much better if they had not been adopted."
"As for Ukraine, I agree entirely."
"We are not turning our backs on that country."
"The circle of friends policy, the policy of sharing everything but the institutions with our neighbours, has been thought out with Ukraine very much in mind, and we have established extremely close relations with it in recent years."
"I can assure you, Mr Gadzinowski, that the Commission will stand alongside Poland in every inter-regional cooperation initiative imaginable in relation to Ukraine, precisely because we believe that the bond between Ukraine and the Union is a very close one, not only economically but also culturally, as well as in the emotional roots that connect us to that country."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by wishing the new Commissioners well and I hope they will do their best in the difficult tasks facing them in the coming months."
"However, I propose that one of them takes on a new task that concerns the stateless nation issue inside the European Union."
"I hope and expect that a newcomer in the Commission will deal with that matter."
"Mr Prodi could choose a Commissioner now or just think it over."
". – This is not an issue that one Commissioner should deal with: the whole Commission should deal with it because it comes into the essential definition of Europe."
"This is a union of peoples and nations."
"There should not just be one single Commissioner in charge of these basic definitions: they should be dealt with by the whole Commission and the whole of Parliament, because it is on this that we define the future of, I repeat, our union of peoples and nations."
"– Mr President, whilst I would like to congratulate the enlarged Commission, I want again to ask the same fundamental question others here have already referred to."
"We female citizens of the European Union are worried about the future of gender equality."
"We know that 14% of the Members from the new Member States here now are women."
"We do not know how the forthcoming Parliament or the next Commission will be made up, but I imagine I would not be very wrong in predicting that the current female representation of 31% will see a downward turn."
"How will the Commission ensure that equality remains one of our basic values in the Union?"
"Should there perhaps be a Commissioner for equality during this time of transition and change?"
"As I have been so brief, may I greet and thank the interpreters, whom perhaps we are meeting today for the last time."
"Mr President, health is a much treasured gift and one of the most important concerns of every citizen of the European Union."
"Unfortunately great inequalities in standards of public health and healthcare provision exist between the different Member States."
"It is my strong belief that a sick child in Cyprus or in Poland should have exactly the same standard of treatment as one in Germany or France."
"Would the Commissioner responsible for public health confirm to us today that every effort will be made to implement an effective strategic plan to ensure that European citizens are made equal in the fight against disease and that no borders exist in the treatment of disease in the European Union?"
". In response to the comments by the last speaker, one of the important developments that has taken place over recent times in relation to this issue has been the collaboration between the European Court of Justice, the Parliament and the Commission."
"Last year the Court of Justice decided that the citizens of the European Union have a right of access to healthcare in all Member States."
"This decision has generated a new discussion at EU level on healthcare in the EU."
"I am happy to say that in December 2003 the Commission established a high-level group of health ministers of the European Union to report on that issue, following which the Commission produced its response."
"We are now at the stage where we have put forward a policy in response to this, which will put in place a high-level group which will guide the discussion on the appropriate response to healthcare and the delivery of healthcare at EU level."
"The Commission will lead the debate in conjunction with the health ministers of the Member States of the 25 EU countries."
"This development has provided the kind of impetus necessary to form a bridge between the exercise of EU-level competences relating to public health, and how these relate to and impact on the delivery of healthcare – a responsibility which remains with the Member States."
"The contact between those two points is important and Parliament will be aware of the establishment, during this Commission, of the European Centre for Disease Control located in Sweden."
"These factors have contributed considerably to the further development of healthcare in the EU, an issue which is gradually increasing in importance for citizens."
"I am happy to say that the Commission, the Parliament, the Court of Justice and indeed all the institutions have shown support for this issue."
"This is likely to continue throughout the life of the next Commission."
"Mr President, in welcoming the new Commissioners, I should like to ask the whole Commission to redouble its efforts to promote good relations with, and good governance in, the countries of Central Asia and the Caucusus."
"We see on our screens today the problems in Georgia."
"We know the human rights problems in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan."
"We know of the new great game being played around the oil pipelines with Russia, the Americans, the Iranians, the Turks and the Afghans all vying with each other."
"We see the health threats from that region; we see the drug threats and the environmental threats."
"We need stability among our near and next-door neighbours to be a key priority for the new Commission and the new Parliament."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his intensive and hard work on the enlargement of the European Union."
"It will be written down in golden letters in history."
"We need more cohesion."
"I would like to ask Commissioner Barnier's successor whether he is prepared to draw up or create a new and effective cohesion strategy."
". – In relation to the first question on the Caucasus, I must say that I fully share the concern that has been expressed."
"I recently met President Saakashvili and I hope to be able to visit the countries of the Caucasus as well, if possible."
"Relations with the European Union are essential for this area to develop towards a situation of security and democracy, which it vitally needs."
"As regards the cohesion strategy – the strategy prepared by Commissioner Barnier – it has actually been carried out by the whole Commission and is shared by the new Commissioner."
"This strategy has a very important aim, which is to create solidarity with the new countries without abandoning the regions in the old Member States that are still having problems adapting to the average European income."
"It is a complex yet harmonious strategy that we can achieve, of course, with the budgetary conditions we have proposed, which we hope will be adopted in the financial perspective for 2007-2013."
"Mr President, although I share the view that the Commissioners from the new Member States are more than sufficiently qualified to fulfil their mandate in the next six months, there is a problem."
"As Mr Prodi has already stated, it is to be expected that the Commissioners from the ten new Member States will also want to keep going through the next five years, but I fear that this has not really dawned on Members of this House."
"The turnout during the hearings was generally very low."
"The chairmen of the other committees share my view on this."
"I think that in this connection, we need to draw the attention of the new Parliament to the fact that it should take the hearings in the autumn extremely seriously, also with regard to the ten Commissioners who are taking up office today."
"As first vice-chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should like to give this piece of advice to the forthcoming Parliament."
"I myself would very much have liked to have returned to Parliament, but unfortunately, my party has not given me the opportunity to do so."
". – I just want to thank the whole of Parliament for the cooperation you have given the Commission over these five years."
"They have been years of hard, solid work, and I am really proud to have had Parliament’s stimulus, teaching and also, in many cases, censure and signs of a dialectic that has helped us all."
"I thank the new Commissioners who have come and who have already started work, and perhaps, on this day which has seen Parliament enlarged, I should like to single out one member of the Commission for special thanks: Mr Verheugen, who has managed this complex, wonderful process of enlargement."
"Thank you all, and keep up the good work!"
"That concludes the item."
"On behalf of Parliament, I should like to welcome to the official gallery President Chissano, President of the Republic of Mozambique and current chairman of the African Union."
"Several colleagues and I had an excellent exchange of views with the President earlier today."
"I trust, Mr President, that your visit has proven interesting and informative and will enhance our relations in the future."
"I should also like to welcome Her Royal Highness Princess Victoria of Sweden, who joins us in the official gallery once again today."
"Today, colleagues, is the last occasion for me to use the privilege of addressing this House as its President."
"It is a moment to reflect and to look back on this mandate."
"Thanks to the determined leadership of our committees and their chairmen, I believe you, the Members of this House, can be proud of a solid record of legislative achievement."
"You have managed an important gearshift and have been an extremely hardworking Parliament throughout this mandate."
"Your work has demonstrated that a European Parliament given responsibility acts with responsibility."
"The extent of our legislative engagement and our engagement across the European institutions, which has contributed to a climate of trust, provided legitimacy, efficiency and confidence."
"The sheer scale of our extraordinary – if I may call it – exit velocity in recent months, involving the adoption of over 80 reports in our last several part-sessions, bears testament to the general upscaling of Parliament's work in the course of its fifth mandate."
"The lesson – and I hope this will be understood by the electorate in June – is that this Parliament makes a political difference."
"The key message of this mandate is that the European Parliament has shown itself to be a mature and reliable legislative partner for the Council and the Commission."
"We have emphasised at all times the primacy of politics."
"During the last 5 years, 403 codecision procedures and 86 sets of conciliation negotiations have been successfully concluded."
"This is 250% more than in the preceding 5 years."
"Only 2 proposals were not adopted and that by democratic choice: the takeover directive of 2001, the port services directive of 2003."
"The legislative legacy of this Parliament from 1999 to 2004 is one that will improve the quality of life of our peoples and lay down the conditions for improved prosperity."
"The list of legislation illustrates the range and the depth of our activity in fields including the environment, transport, cultural exchange, financial services and consumer protection."
"We have also used our legislative powers with flexibility and skill: 28% of our codecision procedures were adopted at first reading; half of the total concluded at second reading through pre-conciliation."
"In plain language: we have not always pushed our parliamentary prerogative to its limits, we have used our prerogatives strategically and with a strong political sense."
"Throughout the mandate, we in Parliament – alone of the law-making institutions of this Union – can boast at the end of our mandate a 100% legislative record, of which, in terms of delivery, we can be truly proud."
"We proposed, as you know, and reached an important interinstitutional agreement for the future and better lawmaking."
"Legislation has been an important role but not the only one we have played."
"Our actions have ranged much wider."
"For example, in budget terms, the figures show clearly – and let this message be understood by the Council regarding the Constitutional Treaty – that this Parliament has been prudent in terms of discretionary expenditure of the Community budget, more prudent indeed than the other arm of the budget authority – the Council."
"We have shown yet again that the endowment of responsibility in the budget field begets parliamentary responsibility in return."
"Parliament has learnt from the experience of 1999 the lessons of executive accountability."
"The maturing role of this House and its Committee on Budgetary Control shows how we have absorbed the lessons of the previous crisis, in particular that parliamentary accountability is an indispensable requirement of executive action of the Union and not simply an add-on extra."
"The power of assent has been exercised responsibly as, for example, the assent given by this House to the Accession Treaty."
"While, at the same time, as the discussions and votes on the passenger name register have amply demonstrated, this Parliament is nobody's rubber stamp."
"Increasingly, we as parliamentarians have fulfilled a role as a focal point for the expression of concerns held by people on the ground."
"The debates, for example, on the and disasters led to real remedial legislation."
"In summary, our Parliament has been an efficient lawmaker, a prudent budget-maker, the European Union's platform for executive accountability and an effective tribune for the peoples of Europe."
"Colleagues, you may remember the headline goals that I set myself when I spoke to you after my election: our contribution to enlargement, enhancing communication with citizens and the promotion of internal reform in our House, particularly the Statute for Members."
"I invested myself in all three objectives and I would like now to report back to you today."
"I have completed a full and busy schedule as President."
"Inside Parliament I have had 90 meetings of the Conference of Presidents, covering 669 agenda items."
"I have had 54 meetings of the Bureau of the House, treating 934 agenda items."
"I have had 450 other meetings in this European Parliament."
"I have had 334 meetings with visiting personalities and politicians and 16 visits by Heads of State."
"I have represented you in this House at 12 meetings of the European Council."
"Outside Parliament in Strasbourg and Brussels I have made, on your behalf, 203 visits."
"I have been to 33 States, including the European Union States and candidate States of tomorrow."
"In 24 States I had the privilege, on your behalf, to address the plenary sessions of national parliaments."
"I have given more than 1 000 media interviews in Brussels and Strasbourg and an equal number on my 203 visits abroad on your behalf."
"I have addressed this plenary over and above the normal duties of the chair on 24 occasions and I have made 130 major speeches outside this House on your behalf."
"Our correspondence total runs to nearly 10 000 and another 10 000 dossiers."
"I thank my cabinet for their patience and their work."
"My first priority – and the overriding public purpose of my presidency – was the enlargement that has reached its culmination this week."
"The work of the Vice-Presidents and the Bureau, the group leaders and the Conference of Presidents, the advance budgeting for pre-integration, all this meant that our work this week with our new Parliament of a Europe of 25 has proceeded without a hitch."
"I am proud of that fact."
"This did not happen by accident: it was part of a strategic political and administrative plan."
"I thank Julian Priestley and his team for the work they have put into this on such professional terms."
"What did we as parliamentarians bring to enlargement?"
"We did this through the actions of our Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and our rapporteurs, through our political groups and my own visits."
"We brought the animation of politics."
"We brought the Europe of values."
"We brought a sense of trying to communicate the historical and exciting nature of the moment and to project that to Europe's publics."
"We moved the debate on from the sterility of the to the vitality of the moment, encouraging necessary compromises, reaching necessary agreement on the financial perspective."
"At the same time, the prospect of membership induced an extraordinary transformation in the new States themselves."
"In Parliament, we emphasised the parliamentary dimension."
"November 2002: a special staging post when we invited all the parliamentarians to be with us before the Copenhagen Summit of that year; 2003: the year of parliaments and parliamentarianism."
"You took the unprecedented step – the fifth enlargement but the first time ever – to invite observer MPs from every State, and that is greatly to your credit."
"Let me express the hope that, in this reconciling Europe, reconciliation can and will be found on the island of Cyprus and that our last divided capital can, in time, be reunited."
"Enlargement brought with it a recognition of the need for a new rulebook for the Union and the convening of a Convention on the future of Europe to prepare it."
"Against expectations, the Convention formula, proposed by this Parliament and by our Committee on Constitutional Affairs, was adopted and, against many expectations, it proved to be an unqualified success."
"There is still work to be done on the Constitutional Treaty."
"Let me reassure this House here today that in this interim period – between now and July when the House resumes for its sixth mandate – I will focus with determination, together with our representatives, Mr Hänsch and Mr Brok, and the group leaders, to ensure that the European Parliament plays the fullest role possible in the weeks that remain."
"Let me express this resolve: we will work with others for the successful completion of a Constitutional Treaty during the mandate of the Irish presidency."
"On economic reform, Parliament has done what was asked of us."
"There is no European parliamentary delivery gap but there is for Lisbon, unfortunately, a considerable gap, which risks becoming a credibility gap."
"Communications are an indispensable and growing requirement of parliamentary democracy, particularly for a continental-scale parliament such as ours."
"We have intensified our communications with other European institutions and national parliaments."
"In doing so, we have demonstrated that the European Parliament is a determined and reliable partner for European progress."
"The next Parliament would do well to invest yet more resources into communications, into selling our story – a story of which we can be proud."
"However – and this is my strongest belief – there is no public relations or information campaign substitute for real politics based on conviction, passion and reason."
"We parliamentarians are in direct contact with our constituents."
"We know their anxieties and aspirations."
"We must bring vision and give leadership."
"We are an indispensable link in an unbroken chain of democratic accountability between our constituents, regions, States and the European ideal."
"The difficult days and weeks of 2003, when we lived through the European Union's Iraq crisis, amounted to a setback for effective multilateralism through the United Nations and also for the European Union and transatlantic relations."
"We have much to reflect on and lessons need to be learnt for the future."
"The crisis marked a departure from our European way of doing business."
"It showed that institutional or constitutional provisions risk becoming merely empty vessels if they are not animated by political will and by common public purpose."
"This mandate has been marked by our standing for real decency in international affairs, for European values."
"I have great pride that we have stood for the due process of the International Criminal Court compared to its absence in Guantanamo Bay."
"My great pride in our reaffirmation of multilateralism, the visit of the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan on 29 January 2004 to accept the Sakharov Prize on behalf of the UN and the colleagues, who died in Baghdad, marked a high point."
"It signalled in a powerful and emotional way our Parliament's commitment to the multilateral way of doing politics."
"We have sought to develop relations in other areas such as with Russia and the US."
"We have had some limited success but more needs to be done."
"I can report to you with great pride the achievement of establishing a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, which was constituted last March in Athens."
"As you know, from the outset this Parliament played a central role in ensuring that Assembly from day one will be an effective instrument of democratic dialogue and where pluralism is visible and real."
"On reform, the last topic that I gave you promises on almost two and a half years ago, internally the Bureau has accomplished important work under the title of ""Raising the Game"" in terms of new internal structures, putting a new focus for the next mandate on assisting Members by providing legal and procedural advice on a scale and of a quality not available before."
"These reforms have been tangible and beneficial and I have no doubt they will bring a quality and improvement to our work, but a major disappointment of my mandate has been the failure, finally, of the Council to find a qualified majority for the adoption of a common statute for Members of the European Parliament."
"We made the compromises, even those suggested by the Council, and yet at the last moment a minority blocked our way."
"An arrangement whereby Members of the same parliament have 25 different legal and financial regimes in my view is neither desirable nor tenable in the long term."
"Although our efforts did not come to fruition this time it is my strong hope that the statute can finally be adopted early in the next legislature."
"The Parliament, as you know and as you voted, clearly needs reform."
"On the issue of expenses, important progress has been made by Parliament in reforming our rules and regulations to ensure greater transparency and accountability."
"Specific reforms of travel allowances, secretarial allowance and other allowances have been decided by the Bureau and the Quaestors in the course of recent years and have continued under my presidency."
"At the outset I sought a global reform based on two elements: the fair treatment of Members of the House based on equality, and transparency on allowances to be based on costs incurred."
"The failure by Council is not our failure."
"It is regrettable however – and let me make this clear yet again – that currently there is a campaign abroad using questionable and deplorable methods, the main purpose of which appears to have been to seek to discredit this institution and which seeks to call into question the honour of Members of this House."
"This has been done to wreak maximum damage on zero evidence against individuals, their careers, and their families."
"It is a disgrace."
"We now have an experience of more or less 50 years of European policy-making."
"In that time policy and very many aspects of day-to-day life in our Member States through the Union has been Europeanised."
"European public policy and regulation is deeply embedded in the national political decision-making environment, but for all that we have Europeanised policy we are still searching for the way to Europeanise politics itself."
"I have therefore tried, particularly in the last year, to deliver this message."
"There is such a wealth of European issues on which we have in our many parties represented here clearly differentiated points of view that we do not lack a European platform to fight a genuinely proper European election."
"That is my invitation to you as you leave here for that election."
"Stick with Europe and try to make sure it is not only about mid-term tests and national or local beauty contests, but that it is about real, genuine, shaping of the future of Europe."
"I would like to make some final remarks as regards the conduct of my presidency."
"What success I have had in my short time I owe to all of you."
"I wish to thank you all, but perhaps most especially my colleagues, the Group leaders, who have slogged in the political trenches with me on so many occasions."
"I realise more fully than I did at the outset that you cannot please all the people all the time."
"I have always sought to serve this House without fear or favour, without malice or prejudice, to serve the interests of the whole House and not any of its component parts."
"I very much believe that I have tried to work according to the principles of a fellow Irishman, Edmund Burke, who said to his constituents in correspondence in 1774: 'Your representative owes you not his industry only, but his judgment and he betrays instead of serving you if he sacrifices his judgment to your opinion'."
"I stand by the judgments I made from this chair and I am prepared to be judged on them."
"I thank my cabinet."
"I thank the European Parliament and again I do not have enough words of thanks or praise for Julian Priestley, Harald Rømer, and wonderful leadership, professional leadership of a quality transnational world class public service."
"Allow me to finish on a much more personal note."
"Serving as a Member of the European Parliament for 15 years, as a Vice-President and President of the ELDR Group for more than seven years, as President of this House for almost two and a half years, has been the great experience of my life."
"With what I can assure you were very mixed emotions, I informed my supporters in my Munster constituency this morning that I do not intend to stand in the forthcoming election."
"I want to thank the people of Munster for their consistent support over the years."
"I thank my own supporters and my family, some of whom are here today."
"Although no business in politics is ever finished, I have made a contribution and I know others are there to take up the challenge."
"Europe has been the cause of my political life."
"I will continue serving that cause in any way I can."
"I leave this House but my friendships, insights and abiding respect for what this Parliament does will never leave me."
"Above all, my thanks to all of you for your friendship and for your support."
"I have to take a deep breath!"
"Mr President, it is a fine tradition for the chairmen of the groups to sincerely thank the outgoing Presidents and so I, like the other group chairmen, have asked to take the floor."
"For the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, it is in no way an obligatory exercise but rather a wholehearted and warm word of thanks, one that is sincerely meant."
"Mr President, Pat Cox, you are a person who combines vision and pragmatism and you are person who is full of political and personal fairness."
"You combine the best traditions of your country, the Republic of Ireland, with our European conviction."
"You will always be numbered among the great Presidents of the European Parliament and you were lucky that your Presidency fell in a successful time, at a time when the constitution was being debated and when ten new Member States joined the European Union."
"You mentioned the one task that remains unfinished: the Statute for Members."
"Immediately after a new Parliament is elected, it will be our duty, the duty of those who are re-elected, to put into effect your work to complete the Statute."
"Mr President, you can take pride in the dignity with which you held office and carried out your duties."
"We all have reason to sincerely thank you and I am also doing so at a personal level."
"I wish you all the very best for your personal future and for everything that you will do in your country."
"On behalf of our group, I sincerely wish you all the very best."
"Mr President, you are aware, as is the whole House, that the Group of the Party of European Socialists did not vote for you."
"Today, however, this group has unanimously applauded your work and your speech."
"Allow me to make a personal comment: welcome to the club of former Presidents of the European Parliament!"
"It is one of the most exclusive clubs in the world."
"Mr President, you have given 15 years of tireless service to this House and on behalf of the ELDR Group I would like to pay tribute to the leadership and the vision that you have shown during your term of office."
"You have proven an outstanding President of our House, raising our profile, ensuring that our voice is heard in the Council and beyond."
"Through your eloquence and your judicious use of the well-crafted sound bite you have communicated the practical benefits of our work to our citizens."
"I am proud that the first Liberal President of this House in 22 years should be one of its most successful."
"I would like to highlight briefly two achievements."
"Your energetic campaigning for enlargement and the determination you have shown in reforming this House will go down to your great credit."
"As my predecessor as leader of the ELDR Group, you demonstrated our commitment to enlargement by involving MPs from the candidate countries in our work."
"You continued with your energetic campaign for a 'yes' vote in the candidate countries and in bringing observer MEPs here to our Chamber in 2002."
"You have brought this Parliament closer to reforms than ever before and I have no doubt that as a result of your work we will succeed in reforming this House."
"We are sure that you will still have much to contribute to Europe in whatever you do in the months and the years ahead."
"We say today 'au revoir' with a vote of thanks and our best wishes for the future."
"Mr President, I should like to join my fellow group chairmen in paying tribute to your thoroughness, to your respect for pluralism and to your genial nature in dealing with people."
"You have shown that there are no small groups, only men and women with a devotion to duty."
"Mr President, as a Member and a President, you have set an example in the way in which you have acted on Parliament’s behalf."
"This is why I shall take this tribute to you as an opportunity to ask you to do so once again."
"Three times Parliament has rejected the Agreement between Europe and the United States on PNR data."
"Next week ..."
"... We are members of a parliament. We do not spend our time patting ourselves on the back; we take our parliamentary role seriously, as Mr Cox has done for five years."
"This is why I ask you, Mr President, to speak to the Commission to ensure that next week the Council and the Commission do not disregard Parliament’s decision to request a ruling from the European Court of Justice."
"That is our right, and it is your duty as President to respect the wishes of the large majority of Members of this House, just as it is the duty of the Commission and the Council to respect the wishes of the majority of this House."
"This is my last wish."
"You have been an excellent President. We will hold you in even higher regard if you can persuade the Commission and the Council to respect Parliament’s wishes."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit, I am grateful for your advice."
"What you are requesting has, however, already been decided."
"It was concluded this morning."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, it is no easy task to run such an important political chamber, in which there are so many shades of opinion, which are themselves further sub-divided."
"I feel, however, that it was in the Conference of Presidents that, as far as I am concerned, I was really able to appreciate your qualities."
"I do not wish to indulge in what some would consider an example of our mutual admiration society, which would strike me as somewhat excessive, but at the moment when you have decided to leave this House – to which you have brought a great deal, both as a Member and as its President, although we have disagreed on a number of points, which is part and parcel of a democratic chamber – I wish to bear witness to the high regard in which you are held within our group and to express our recognition for the way in which you have dealt with people who represent a minority in this House."
"This is the measure of a true democrat."
"I can testify to this, Mr President, and wish to express our gratitude."
"I feel sure that you will not stray too far from the institutions, Mr President, so perhaps we shall see each other again."
"In any event, I wish you all the very best in your personal and family life."
"As for your political life, that is in the hands of others."
"– Mr President, towards the end of your speech you thanked the Group Presidents, but I should also like to remind you of the existence of the Non-attached Members – even though you are well aware of them."
"Many Non-attached Members will have asked to speak, and so I shall use the fact that I, together with Mrs Garaud, have represented you over the years in the Conference of Presidents."
"I shall use this opportunity for the last time to take the floor, not of course as a group, as I naturally respect the nature of this group of the Non-attached, of which we have spoken on so many occasions."
"Unfortunately the problems of my group – problems, let us say, of organisation in this Parliament – have not been resolved, although I am not holding it against you personally, Mr President, of course."
"Let us say that the group is composed of a few dozen Members and so the next Parliament will need to look at it more carefully."
"Speaking for myself, Mr President, and I believe for Mrs Garaud as well, I should like to join in the expressions of admiration and recognition for the role you have played, especially in defence of this Parliament, for the way in which you have run the House, regardless of individual circumstances or the political judgment that each of us might make of your actions."
"I too felt I must pay you my respects in this way and offer you my very best wishes for your political and personal future."
"Mr President, I too should like to thank you for some unusually constructive cooperation over the years you have been part of the Conference of Presidents."
"Very loyal relations have been created between the group chairmen."
"There was a time when it was determined in advance what we would decide at the meetings."
"At that time, we had a large coalition, in which it was not much fun representing a small group."
"In the five years that have passed since the last election, it has not been possible to predict the decisions from the meetings before they were held."
"People have been listened to, including minorities, and I hope that we can continue that tradition."
"You are, in a way, Parliament’s first proper President, because you came up through an election campaign."
"We had never before had an election campaign in the history of Parliament, says he who is now celebrating 25 years of being an MEP."
"You came up through an election campaign in which you fairly and squarely beat Mr Martin and myself and Mr Onesta and Mr Wurtz."
"The election was a result of constructive debates, in our groups too, and I hope we can continue that tradition so that, before the President is elected, there can be debates on how Parliament’s work is to be organised."
"When we arrive in Parliament on Mondays, ordinary Members can now take the floor, as they could not previously."
"That is a small, practical outcome of an election campaign."
"I can confirm that you have not completely satisfied everyone, at the same time as confirming that it is not your fault that there has been no shake-up in our travelling circus, such as you pressed for on every possible occasion."
"Thank you for your constructive cooperation and good luck in your new life. I hope that, as your final act, you can see to it that the Bureau makes some decisions concerning the reimbursement of travel expenses of which we need not be ashamed in the presence of our voters."
"The next item is the verification of the credentials of the new Members of the European Parliament.(1)"
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it really is an honour and a pleasure for me to report on the confirmation of the mandate of 162 Members appointed by the ten new Member States as from 1 May 2004 and six Members elected in place of others who had previously stepped down."
"Through procedural steps too – and I believe that I am interpreting the feeling of the whole House – we are stressing the entry of the representatives of the citizens of the enlarged Union as full Members of this Parliament."
"In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, as you all know, it was necessary to deal with the procedure of verifying credentials, and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was required to submit a report to Parliament, pursuant to Rule 7(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"This report has been prepared. Therefore, under this Rule, as modified by the other regulations, the Committee on Legal Affairs met yesterday evening."
"In view of the large number of credentials to be verified and the lack of time, given that we should process them immediately, it was considered appropriate that the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs should present this oral report to Parliament, which can be summarised by announcing that at yesterday’s meeting, the Committee on Legal Affairs verified the credentials of the 168 Members."
"We examined the customary documents, Mr President, including the declaration on incompatibility and the declaration of financial interests."
"We unanimously agreed that everything was in order, which means a recommendation can be made to proceed."
"You have informed us that Mr Kadis is a minister and therefore incompatible with the post of Member of the European Parliament: it is necessary, then, to confirm his mandate from 1 May 2004 until today."
"Of course, we cannot proceed to verify his successor’s credentials during this sitting."
"I too take the opportunity of thanking you, Mr President, and the whole of Parliament."
"In the light of the report from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market I propose that we confirm the validity of the mandates of the new Members."
"Mr President, thank you very much for letting me take the floor once again."
"I would like to tell my fellow Members a little about the issue of nominating the members of the European Court of Auditors."
"We carried out a procedure in the Committee on Budgetary Control, as we are instructed to do by the Rules of Procedure, and in which we were guided by the provisions of the Treaty, which state that what is most important in order to be a member of the European Court of Auditors is professional qualifications and, above all, total independence."
"Ten Members completed a written questionnaire, we received the answers and the respective curriculum vitae were passed on."
"We then carried out an individual public hearing for each proposed member, and then, behind closed doors, we held discussions, just amongst the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"In order to include the new Members, who belong to our Parliament as of 1 May since the accession countries are now legally full members of the European Union, we carried out the vote in the Committee on Budgetary Control last Monday, 3 May."
"The result of the voting, in the form of nine reports – and I want to make this clear now and I will explain it in a moment – is before this House."
"We will hold a ballot – a secret one – on nine individual reports; on the reports by the Committee on Budgetary Control, which include its recommendation concerning the candidacies."
"The result was that the large majority of the candidates received the approval of the majority in the committee."
"Two out of the ten candidates did not gain this majority, one of whom – namely the Cypriot candidate – withdrew his candidature in a letter to the Council."
"That leaves the Slovak candidate, who, unfortunately, did not gain the support of the majority in the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"I would like to make it very clear that we have a great responsibility in voting now on the reports of the Committee on Budgetary Control since the members of the European Court of Auditors are appointed for six years."
"There are no transitional periods like there are in other institutions."
"They will, therefore, belong to the European Court of Auditors for six years, and so the Committee on Budgetary Control was also very conscientious and carried out a very careful investigation."
"Also, everything that was carried out behind closed doors, took place in secret."
"I would thank all of the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control for this very complex and responsible work and I now put forward these reports."
"I would like to make one more request: after this totally thorough procedure, it would be desirable for a future Parliament to not just be consulted on the nomination of members of the European Court of Auditors, but also to be able to give its approval to them."
"I have two further announcements to make."
"In the translations of the reports in a whole range of languages an incorrect verdict of the Committee on Budgetary Control was printed, which has now been corrected."
"A positive verdict in the committee was recorded for Mr Molnár in the Danish, French, Hungarian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Portuguese and Swedish versions."
"Apart from the Hungarian, all versions – and that was the situation at 11.21 a.m. – have since been corrected."
"I ask you to be aware that the Committee on Budgetary Control does not produce standard results of the voting, but that a verdict is in actual fact different, as I have explained."
"Since this is my last appearance in this Parliament, I would like to thank everyone in this House, including you, Mr President, for such fantastic cooperation and for an incredibly exciting time and I would like to wish all of you as individuals the very best for the future."
"Thank you very much."
"Thank you, Mrs Theato, you have our best wishes."
"Mr President, although I am sure that I, together with the sessional services for my group, prepared the voting list correctly, questions have been asked about it."
"I would therefore like to ask you to clarify again for all Members that we will vote on the report, as Mrs Theato said in relation to the corrected versions for various languages."
"It should once again be stressed that we are to vote on the texts of the report."
"I can confirm, as Mrs Theato outlined, that it will be an electronic secret ballot."
"(1)"
".The European Commission today includes members from 25 countries and, although the role of each Commissioner is to serve the common European interest, there still exists an important element of national representation."
"This representation should only the Union and not divide it because this means that the Commission, in its entirety, is conscious of the social and economic situation of each country, and, where necessary, can act flexibly."
"Certainly it is not in the European spirit to take action without considering the consequences on certain social sectors."
"I believe that the Commissioners recognise the importance of flexibility when some actions can have repercussions on families that live a somewhat different life according to the economical and social limitations of the region."
"I come from a small State that is also an island in the Mediterranean and this is, therefore, the standpoint from which I speak."
"We also know, however, that flexibility is not only necessary in the case of small countries."
"Even large States have found themselves needing a certain flexibility to abide by the union’s common objectives."
"To conclude I would like to state that the diversity that exists within the European Union is positive, however, it is this same diversity that requires flexibility."
"I believe that the Commissioners are all aware of this, and, for the common good of Europe, they will be acting in a flexible manner in order to assure European citizens that the Commission is not a threat to them, but is actually there to protect them."
"We extend a warm welcome to the Commissioners from the ten new Member States. It therefore follows that I approve of the composition of the new Commission."
"I am disappointed, however, with the resolution on which we voted, because an amendment was rejected asking the Commission, entirely appropriately, not to take any initiatives or decisions regarding any lifting of the moratorium on GMO authorisation, during the coming period, from now until the new Parliament starts work."
"Predictably, the Council did not manage to reach agreement on genetically modified maize BT-11, and, in line with the procedures in force, it is the Commission alone that will decide."
"I object to the attitude of the States, which knowingly accepted this procedure."
"I also object to the contempt shown by the Commission towards the public, given that Commissioner Byrne repeats every day that it will lift the moratorium, even though most European citizens are opposed to this."
"This is a fine example of Europe operating without the people. Europe’s citizens must be made aware of the fact that Europe cocks a snook at them on a daily basis, and this situation must be rectified."
". – In principle it is right to take a critical view if Commissioners are continually changing."
"We cannot, however, accept any procedure whereby Finland, after the departure of Erkki Liikanen, would be accorded a status inferior to that of other countries that have already changed their Commissioner."
"This is also a matter of what is lawful, which is to say compliance with the Treaty."
"Under the Treaty the post of Commissioner may only remain unfilled by a unanimous decision of the Council."
". The resounding rejection, notably by almost all French Members of the House, except for the Greens and the anti-federalists, of the amendment calling on the Prodi Commission – which is, in any case, at the end of its term in office – not to go back on the moratorium on GMOs established by the Council, is tantamount to Parliament giving its blessing to the decision that the Commission is set to take and which has, furthermore, already been announced by Commissioner Byrne, in favour of marketing BT-11 genetically modified maize and the varieties that will follow."
"Commissioner Byrne will probably make his announcement the day after the forthcoming European elections ..."
"This is an extremely perverse process, in which the Commission overrides the States, with their tacit approval, as regards a question that is crucial for public health and for the environment in our countries."
"This legislative term is, therefore, coming to a close with a mean trick played on European citizens."
"It is essential that we reform this process if we are to rediscover a Europe that conforms to the wishes of the European public."
"Parliament has completed its agenda."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.(1)"
"Pursuant to the Act concerning the election of Members of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage, I declare the first sitting subsequent to the elections open."
"– As a consequence of this universal vote and despite its limitations, which we must also understand, for the first time a union of peoples and governments has been formed based on democracy and rights and not on the dominance of one country over the others, as has often happened in the history of our continent."
"The role of the European Parliament is growing in parallel, as a result of both the positive experience of past years and also the rules of the new Constitution now in the process of ratification, and our borders have expanded to include 25 countries."
"I especially want to welcome the arrival of Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia."
"Our borders have expanded to 25 countries and the bounds of the European Parliament’s activities will also be expanding, in a Europe that started as the Coal and Steel and the Atomic Energy Communities, which then became the Common Market and afterwards a common currency in order to encourage financial exchange and trade, and which now, with the implementation of the Lisbon Agenda and the commitments of the European Constitution, is beginning to turn into a Europe of work, solidarity, social justice, reception and integration: in a word, a Europe of the people and of its citizens."
"A Europe open to the world, to the suffering and aspirations of other peoples in all countries; above all, a Europe open to peace and the search for personal and collective security.(1)"
"– Pursuant to the Rules of Procedure, I have received the following nominations for the presidency of the European Parliament:"
"Josep Borrel Fontelles"
"Bronisław Geremek"
"Francis Wurtz"
"The candidates have informed me that they consent to their respective nominations."
"According to Rule 13(1) of the Rules of Procedure, a candidate must obtain an absolute majority of the votes cast in order to be elected."
"Blank or spoiled ballot papers shall not be taken into consideration for the purposes of counting the votes cast."
"The following Members have been designated as tellers:"
"Mr Louis"
"Mr Pálfi"
"Mr Paleckis"
"Mr Ortuondo Larrea"
"Mr Onyszkiewicz"
"Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou"
"Mr Pannella"
"Mr Pistelli"
"Before the vote I shall give each of the three candidates the floor to make a speech which, according to the Rules of Procedure, may last for no longer than five minutes."
"– Mr President, I warmly welcome all the honourable Members and in particular the other candidates."
"I belong to the generation of Spaniards who, with Europe on the horizon, played a leading role in the transition to democracy, and at a very young age we took on important political responsibilities."
"Councillor and trade union delegate, Member of Parliament for eighteen years, five as Chairman of the Committee on European Affairs and twelve as Minister or Secretary of State, and then candidate for Prime Minister."
"I have also been a member of the Convention, and for ten years in a row I have represented my country in different formations of the Council."
"I lost battles there which were then won in Parliament, from its position closer to the citizens."
"I can say that I have good knowledge of the functioning of the Community institutions, but for me Europe is more than a political experiment, it is a vital project."
"I am as European as I am Spanish and ‘ [I am also Catalan]’, but I am neither of the old nor of the new Europe."
"I am simply a European who rejects denominations intended to perpetuate our division."
"At some point we have all been new Members of the Union and, from Vilnius to Lisbon, or from Edinburgh to Athens, we are all of the same Europe."
"Reunification put an end to the tragic inheritance of Hitler and Stalin, but there is still much for us to do in order to make it effective."
"It will put our solidarity to the test and require us to respect the most diverse of opinions."
"As President of the European Parliament I shall ensure that it operates correctly within a more complex linguistic context."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must eliminate any grey areas which harm the image of this Parliament."
"We need a Statute so that the Members of all the countries can carry out their duties under the same conditions of transparency, dignity and efficiency."
"I will therefore begin by being demanding in our relations with the Council."
"Ladies and gentlemen, over the next few years, this Parliament will be standing at the crossroads of history."
"We have reached it by means of the path of success."
"The centuries-old enemies of yesterday are now the world’s most cooperative neighbours, but today the European project is suffering the threefold problem of size, efficiency and legitimacy, for which the Constitution – to which I contributed – provides the best solution we have."
"Without it we would be, for a very long time, nothing but a big market."
"And, if Europe abandons its political ambitions, the world will suffer the destructive confrontation between materialism on the one hand and fundamentalism on the other."
"I will therefore be calling on all Members of Parliament to participate in the great task of ratifying the Constitution."
"That will be a great moment for this Parliament: to talk to the Europeans about Europe, to convince them that ours is a living project, with soul, although it is inevitably a complex one, which has an effect on the problems that concern them most, such as employment and security, terrorism and migration, problems which cannot be resolved without European integration."
"We must project the image of this institution towards the citizens we represent, making our message intelligible."
"In a Europe with an unemployment rate of 9% and with 50 million poor people, we must convince our citizens of the importance that Community policies, the Lisbon strategy and the Gothenburg environmental dimension have on cohesion and competitiveness, which we believe to be complementary rather than the contradictory."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we all want a President of Parliament who is close and accessible, but their role is not that of a Head of Government who applies a party political programme."
"The President must have solid support and play the role of strategically promoting the institution they represent."
"I am very aware of this."
"If I am elected, I will represent the diversity of Parliament and firmly promote its role in relation to the other Community institutions."
"I will end with a message of optimism: Europe is a long-term project and its path is made by walking."
"The crises awaiting us will not be any more serious than the ones we have already overcome."
"We must and we can mobilise the peoples of Europe to write a new page in our history in peace and therefore, and to this end, I would ask you to vote for my candidature as President of the European Parliament."
"Thank you very much."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you are all aware of the history of my homeland."
"It has played a leading role in all the dramatic events of the twentieth century."
"My country, Poland, was also the birthplace of the revolt against totalitarianism, a revolt that made the unification of Europe possible."
"As a result, this House is now one of the institutions of a Europe that is drawing closer together."
"I come from Central Europe."
"Poland and all the other countries in this region shared a common fate."
"Our freedom and independence were threatened on a daily basis, and we feared for the future."
"Nonetheless, we won through."
"We are now free and independent nations."
"Such is the background from which I come before this House."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am sure you are familiar with my past, and that you know how I came to be what I am today."
"I have friends across the whole spectrum of political groupings represented in this House."
"With that in mind, I should like to make the following statement."
"It was exceedingly fortunate for Europe that we were not left alone to fight for our freedom."
"We were able to count on the support of all those who believed in their hearts and minds that Europe had to be free."
"You will recall that Martin Luther King said it is impossible to engage in politics without first having a dream."
"As I come before this House, I too have a dream."
"My dream is of a Europe of solidarity."
"Incidentally, Poland was responsible for bringing the word 'solidarity' into our political vocabulary."
"As I said, I have a dream of a Europe of solidarity and justice."
"This House is an institution for such a Europe."
"Having described how I came to be what I am today, I should like to move on to explain what I would like to become, and why I am standing as a candidate for President of the European Parliament."
"My ambition is to serve a Europe that grows ever more united."
"I hope to serve it as a representative of that part of Europe kept apart from the rest for half a century against its will."
"I hope also to serve it as a representative of a Europe credited with one of the greatest achievements of the twentieth century, namely the creation of the European Union."
"It is my ambition too for Parliament to become a forum for debate."
"There are Euroenthusiasts, Eurosceptics and Eurorealists in this House, just as there are in societies across Europe."
"Nonetheless, I hope the House will become a forum for a strategic debate on the future of Europe."
"It is important for Parliament to fulfil its political role and succeed in bringing together political groupings with differing programmes."
"These groupings competed against each other in the elections, but it is now time for them to join forces in the House in order to build a united Europe."
"Allow me to emphasise once again that my aim is for this House to become a forum for strategic debate."
"I trust that, like the Union itself, it will become a community of nation states and citizens, because Europe owes its greatness to its nations."
"We need to learn to live together if we are to fulfil our role."
"Finally, I aspire to become President of a fine and great European Union institution."
"The Union is one of the greatest democracies in the world."
"This institution is itself capable of being free and democratic."
"I stand before you, Members of this House, and appeal to you to have confidence in me and cast your votes in my favour."
"If you do, yours will certainly be a vote for Europe!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the election of the President of our Parliament constitutes our first political act of this new term of office."
"What clear and coherent message are we going to deliver to our fellow citizens on this occasion?"
"The question is an important one, given the extent to which the public image of the European institutions has become confused, if not suspect, and with good cause: how are people to find their way around the issue when, for all these years, votes from the left and right have systematically combined to administer the liberal economic model, or when Mr Blair and Mr Aznar, like their supporters in this House, have combined their efforts to support George W. Bush in his military adventure."
"As many of us said during the recent election campaign, the moment has come to put an end to these confused identities and to make the divisions between progressives and conservatives visible and comprehensible."
"My candidacy has no objective other than that of being faithful to this commitment."
"In the first round of this highly symbolic election, it offers all left-wing MEPs the opportunity to express their disagreement with unnatural arrangements, whether they be traditional ones, such as that linking the Group of the Party of European Socialists to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, or less expected but no less pernicious arrangements, like that which at present links the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party."
"In the second round – if second round there be – the vast majority of my group will adopt an attitude in keeping with the adage: in the first round, you choose; in the second, you eliminate."
"We respect Mr Geremek as an eminent European intellectual, and we recognise the importance of the role he played as a political player during a crucial period in the history of our continent. We cannot, however, support his candidacy when it comes either to the very orthodox options he perceives in economic and social matters – options we believe are at the heart of the disaffection demonstrated by our fellow citizens at the last elections, both in the old Member States and still more so in the new ones – or when it comes to his positions on the war in Iraq, which is, for us, the symbolic issue."
"I would point out that Mr Geremek – who, I am not embarrassed to say, usually has the courage of his convictions – has embraced the logic of the Vilnius Ten’s manifesto, whereas the left in the European Parliament has, for its part, sided with public opinion, the majority of which, unlike Madrid in Warsaw, aspired to a political solution under the aegis of the United Nations."
"In our view, the attitude adopted to the war is even more than an issue of political etiquette."
"That is the way it is."
"The former group chairmen will remember the proposal I made that the latest Sakharov Prize be awarded to a liberal politician, Mr Hans Blix, who, above and beyond the political choices he perceived, symbolised this other way for which we hoped and prayed."
"With the exception of three MEPs, who have stated that they will abstain, my group will therefore transfer its votes to Mr Josep Borrell in the second round of this ballot."
"Although our choice can of course be criticised, neither its coherence nor its clarity can be disputed."
"That too is what democracy is about."
"– Thank you to the three speakers for what they said and for not having exceeded their speaking time."
"We shall now proceed to the election."
"– I announce the result of the ballot to elect the President."
"Number of voters: 700"
"Blank or spoiled ballot papers: 53"
"Votes cast: 647"
"Absolute majority for election in this ballot: 324"
"The votes cast for each candidate are as follows:"
"José Borrell Fontelles: 388 votes"
"Bronisław Geremek: 208 votes"
"Francis Wurtz: 51 votes"
"José Borrell Fontelles has obtained an absolute majority of the votes cast and is therefore elected President of Parliament."
"Mr Borrell, I congratulate you on your election and I would invite you to take your rightful place on the presidential chair."
"Ladies and gentlemen, my first words as President of the European Parliament must be words of gratitude; also of commitment and looking to the future but, above all, words of gratitude."
"Firstly, to the Oldest Member, Mr Berlinguer, for the way he has led our first parliamentary sitting of this term in office ..."
"... and, secondly, to the candidates who have offered their abilities and their will to serve Europe as President of this Parliament."
"I am sure that I will be able to cooperate in an honest and positive way with all of them, taking advantage of the huge political experience in this Parliament of Mr Wurtz, and of Mr Gueremek, in terms of the events which have modelled our Europe."
"I must express my respect for, and my desire to cooperate with, those Members who, for whatever reason, have not voted for me, and my gratitude to all of those who have put their trust in me, beginning with the Group of the European Socialist Party who proposed my candidature."
"The majority I have received gives stability to this institution and, following the debate and the democratic decision made, I now feel that I have all the legitimacy I need to direct the work of this Parliament and I would call on you all from now on to work effectively."
"I would like to pay tribute to our former President, Mr Pat Cox, for the way in which he has carried out his duties over the last thirty months."
"His has been a brilliant presidency, respectful of all groups and all Members, very active in seeing through the process of European reunification and constantly mindful of the political visibility of this Parliament."
"The very existence of the Convention and the impetus Parliament gave to its work is due, to a large extent, to the will demonstrated by Pat Cox to move the Union away from its inter-governmental tendency and make Parliament, as now expressly acknowledged in the draft Constitution, the representative of the European citizens."
"I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Members of Parliament of all countries who represented our Parliament in the work of the Convention for their work."
"I know from my own experience how important their contribution was and, though I cannot mention them all by name, I will refer in particular to the important role played by those who represented us in the Praesidium, Mr Klaus Hänsch and Mr Íñigo Méndez de Vigo, and also Mr Elmar Brok, who followed the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Finally, as President of this Parliament, I would like in particular to welcome the Members representing the ten new Member States, and I hope that soon Members from Romania and Bulgaria will also join us and thereby put an end, in the words of Milan Kundera, to the kidnap of half of the West."
"While quoting that great European writer, I would like to remind you that in the film version of 'The Unbearable Lightness of Being', the roofs and cupolas we believe to be Prague are in fact those of Lyon, firm proof of the common identity shared by the two halves of an area which has inherited the same culture."
"So, at what for me is a highly emotional time, I feel that democracy is not just a system of political organisation based on institutions elected by the citizens."
"It is based – in particular ours, a plurinational and therefore more complex one – on an idea of Man which came before systems of government."
"Aware of my enormous responsibility from this point on, in which passion for democracy and passion for Europe come together in one single challenge, I wish to leave the explanation of my strategic outlook for this term of office for the next plenary sittings after the summer."
"I believe this is best for two reasons: firstly, because we must have the time and the opportunity to exchange impressions and to draw up this strategic vision together with the Vice-Presidents, when they are elected, and with the leaders of the political groups."
"We must all contribute to a vision which is not just of the President, but of the whole House."
"Secondly, the President of the Council is here today and in a few hours time we will hear from the candidate proposed by the Council as President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, who will be subject to vote by Parliament, and I believe we need a better window of opportunity in terms of media attention than we have at the moment with so many other events taking place."
"As I said to you in my presentation, it is my political responsibility to do everything I can to ensure that the European Parliament is involved in the process of ratifying the Constitutional Treaty, particularly in the countries which are going to do so by means of a referendum."
"We are all aware that, apart from this great issue, our agenda is already overflowing with matters we must deal with: the new Commission, initiating working relations with it and with the Council, examining the Union’s financial perspectives, analysing the situation of the Stability and Growth Pact following the recent failure of the Court of Justice, future enlargements, implementing the new legislative powers of this Parliament and continuing the work of Pat Cox in cooperation with national parliaments and the Euro-Mediterranean Assembly."
"Furthermore, many international issues will demand our attention."
"The world will knock on Europe’s door and particularly on Parliament’s door."
"Perhaps the most urgent issues are those relating to the dramatic situation in the Middle East."
"Ladies and gentlemen, honourable Members of the European Parliament, it only remains for me to assure you that I will apply all my will and all my abilities, all my reason and all my passion, that I may be a match for the high institutional and strategic position you have entrusted to me."
"I would like finally to thank all the workers in this institution without whose work we would not be able to carry out our own."
"Thank you very much to all of you."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I offer my most sincere congratulations to President Borrell Fontelles on his election."
"His previous experience is a guarantee of a useful and fruitful presidency."
"This is a great undertaking, since the President has to direct the work of an institution which, precisely because it has been directly elected, will be affected more than the others by enlargement, by the approval of the Constitution and by the great international tensions that are rocking the world today."
"This House will be a place of debate and decision even more than it has been in the past, and it must ensure that the citizens of Europe can play an ever greater democratic role."
"I just want to stress that this Parliament has elected its new President at an extraordinary juncture."
"We have seen how complex our constitutional reform has been, as it was approved only a few weeks ago after heated and difficult debate."
"The result was not a foregone conclusion at all and I welcome it enthusiastically, but it has also created a decisive role for Parliament in the campaign for ratification, which is to start straight away and will be one of the most difficult tasks ahead of us."
"Let me now recall our enlargement, another unquestionable success for the Union."
"Tough negotiations in which our common interests prevailed have enabled 25 countries to share their hopes for the future."
"I also recall – and with less satisfaction – the low turnout of voters in the European elections."
"Even though all the opinion polls show that Europe is considered to be increasingly necessary in order to face up to our great challenges, we are still faced with the need to bring the institutions closer to the daily lives of Europe’s citizens."
"This is one of Parliament’s foremost tasks."
"As happened during the last term, the Commission and the European Parliament are collaborating closely so that our common interests can prevail; this is one reason for this alliance, which in formal terms is reflected in the European Parliament’s vote of confidence in the President of the Commission."
"My Commission has made every effort to develop this collaboration, thanks also to the framework agreement and the daily work of implementing it."
"Once again, I thank President Cox for having been a fully cooperative and open partner."
"The results of our work on codecision and in other areas are exceptional and unprecedented, and I am sure that this collaboration will continue with the new Commission, which will be called upon to consolidate this year’s results and to develop them further."
"Together, the Commission and Parliament must impart fresh impetus to the European integration process, with the fundamental objective of continuing along the path towards enlargement and the Constitution."
"Mr President, please allow me to say a last word of thanks to your institution, with which I have worked for five years."
"Without Parliament’s stimulus, without its checks and without its in-depth political debate, even though it may be harsh at times, we would certainly not have achieved this enormous volume of work."
"These have been years of major results, which have been transformed into concrete benefits for the people and stronger hopes for our common future."
"Mr President, I wish you and the new Parliament all the best in your work."
"– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, you, Mr President, are now the elected President of the European Parliament and of all its Members."
"On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to extend to you heartfelt congratulations and to wish you success in your office as President of Parliament, for success for you is success for us all."
"I would like to express warm respect and high regard for Mr Geremek, whose life’s achievements I personally hold in the highest estimation – as does our group – and thank him for what he has done for Poland and for Europe."
"I would also, though, like to testify to the respect I have for Mr Wurtz, even though I have no sympathy whatever with what he had to say in his speech today."
"Mr Wurtz, you are always, however, an honest partner to have, including in the Conference of Presidents, and I have personal regard for you."
"I believe that it will be to this House’s benefit if we continue to work together in a spirit of mutual trust despite all our political differences."
"Further to that, let me observe that no group, not even the largest – the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which has 268 MEPs – holds a majority in the European Parliament."
"Experience tells us that it is quite normal, a quite normal political activity, to seek out majorities in such a situation."
"In the last Parliament, which sat from 1999 to 2004, we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats came to an agreement with the Liberals, with Mr Watson, with whom I have generally worked well, and I hope that I will continue to do so in future."
"My friends, Parliament would, however, be somewhat out of balance if one Liberal were now to be succeeded by another, and if the second-largest group in this House were to be kept out of the Presidential office for at least twelve-and-a-half years."
"For that reason, we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have come to this agreement with the Socialist Group, and we have given you our support."
"Let me make, if I may, a final observation."
"We in this European Parliament – and I see that Mr Prodi is here, to whom we, as a rule, gave our support, even though that was sometimes very difficult – have a great interest in the stability of the European institutions, and so I appeal to everyone, now that we have taken this decision today, to vote on Thursday for José Manuel Durão Barroso and thereby to demonstrate that we seek stability for the European Commission too."
"The last thing I have to say to you is that, in this House, issues of policy will continue to be the subject of tough debate between the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialists and others."
"The issues will still be there, and will still be bones of contention, but it is important that the institutions be stable."
"What joins us together and unites us is our defence of democracy, our defence of the rule of law, our commitment to solidarity and peace in our continent as it comes together as one."
"That is our common task, and in that, Mr President, I wish you success with all my heart."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even in the lives of Parliamentary groups there are great days, and, for ours, today is one of them."
"It is only right, in the hour of triumph, to think of those who do not share in it, so let me address the opposing candidates, such as you, Mr Geremek."
"Even though we voted for our own candidate rather than for you, I think I speak on behalf of all the Socialist Members of this House when I say how proud I am to be able to work together with you, and that your membership of this House does it honour."
"The only thing to be said about Mr Wurtz, in fact, is that we agree 100% with what he had to say about President Bush’s policies."
"That, unfortunately, was not enough to make us give him our votes, but I thank him warmly for his cooperation, which is always excellent and constructive."
"I have nothing to add, in this speech, to Mr Poettering’s description of him."
"To you, Mr Borrell, our President and our colleague, I wish three things: firstly that you may actually do what you have undertaken to do in the conduct of your office."
"Such an office is always bound up with many burdens, some of them personal."
"From the depths of my heart I wish you the capacity to bear and endure those burdens you have taken on."
"Secondly, let me observe that you no longer preside over the Social Democrats, but over all the Members of this House."
"You have my assurance that, when you have to take decisions in this capacity, we – even if we as Social Democrats are perhaps unable to support them in detail – will always faithfully obey them, coming as they do from a President of the whole House who is one of our own."
"Thirdly, let me say that we are proud that, after ten years, a Social Democrat – and what a Social Democrat – again presides over this House."
"My dear Josep Borrell, you have our best wishes, and let me say to you, our President, that I am sure that you will be as outstanding a political figure in Europe as you have been in Spain."
"All the best and congratulations!"
"– Mr President, I should like to add my words to those of my colleagues Mr Poettering and Mr Schulz in thanking all the contestants in this competition for the Presidency of our House."
"The result that we have is an honourable one."
"I am proud that the political family I represent gave the European Parliament a first-class President in Pat Cox."
"I believe that he will be a hard act to follow and I wish you, Mr President, all the best in your term of office."
"I would, however, like to put on notice the Group of the European People's Party and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"I believe that the alliance they have formed is an unnatural one."
"Such an alliance, when it happens in national parliaments, happens only at times of war or crisis."
"If these parties try to use this alliance to carve up the way things are done in this House, my group will fight them every inch of the way."
"If they conspire to block the necessary reforms in this House, we will stand up for the interests of the citizen."
"I believe that the citizens of the European Union are fed up with opaque government and back-room deals and look forward to the day when we have a mature Parliament, building a political majority not a technical majority."
"Mr Poettering spoke of the need for stability."
"The trouble is that democracies are run by crisis management: serious problems are not tackled until they have to be."
"Our Union has problems and resolving those problems will require leadership."
"We will judge you, Mr President, on your capacity for showing leadership to this House in the period to come."
"Mr Watson, you may rest assured that the Presidency will ensure that the rights of all the groups are fully respected."
"– Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance also congratulates you on this election, even though, as you know, the majority of my group chose another candidate, Mr Geremek, who represents this new Europe that we are creating today."
"You can, however, be sure of the collaboration and loyalty with which our group will be ready to work with you over the coming years, as it has worked with the other presidents before you."
"We had offered your group a different alliance, one which in our view was possible and could have had a majority in this Parliament."
"We think the question of stability is indeed much less important than the transparency of the political agreements that are made and also the transparency of the laws we are to make as the European Parliament."
"We therefore truly hope that today will be the last time that this vote and this unnatural alliance are seen here, because otherwise it will not be at all easy for citizens to recognise their Parliament as a body that openly conducts European politics in a clear, definite and specific manner and thus reflects their choices and their political views."
"Mr President, we consider that what Mr Hans-Gert Poettering has said about President Barroso is rather worrying and we think it would be interesting for the whole of this House to learn what the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is going to do about the election of President Barroso and whether that too really is part of a package, as was hoped."
"Mr President, we believe that it is only through succeeding in creating majorities about issues, about what the citizens are really demanding, clearly and not through ambiguous, opaque alliances, that this Parliament can be respected and European democracy can really work for all its citizens."
"I thank you and wish you all the best in your work."
"– Mr President, I wish, in my turn, to express my group’s congratulations to Mr Borrell on his election."
"I said just now what I thought of the context of this election; I was critical of it."
"I want now to say what I think of Mr Borrell; by way of complete contrast, I greatly admire him."
"I admire him for his left-wing commitment on what, in our view, are crucial issues at stake, particularly in the international sphere."
"I also admire him for his ear for dialogue and for the importance he attaches to warm relationships."
"That also matters, including in political life."
"I am sure that my group and I shall be able to cooperate constructively with him as our new President."
"It remains for me to express my respect for Mr Geremek and to thank Mr Poettering and Mr Schultz most sincerely for what they said about me."
"May we transcend our differences and divisions and, throughout the life of this Parliament, give full sway to this spirit of tolerance and mutual respect."
"I think that, in the process, there would be no loss to democracy and that much would be gained in terms of human relations."
"– Mr President, the Union for Europe of the Nations Group is working within Europe to build a common commitment that will take us away from preconceived ideas."
"We believe we should all collaborate to strengthen a Europe that is free of terrorism, discrimination and monopolistic temptations, whether in the economic sphere or in politics or culture."
"It is therefore vital that you should be President of the whole of Parliament and that Parliament should find a more effective way of bringing the people closer to our institutions and having them take part in our decisions."
"Mr President, to bring the people closer to Europe and Europe closer to the people, we must declare here in this House that it is our common commitment, within a context of mutual respect, to find a way to provide full and correct information at last."
"The work of Parliament is all too often insufficiently understood in our own countries."
"Mr President, as I give you and this House my best wishes for your future work, allow me on behalf of my group to offer my esteem and friendship to Mr Geremek and to recall once more the example he has set and still sets for all of us and the whole of Europe."
"– Mr President, having expressed our sincere gratitude to your predecessor, Mr Cox, we wish, in accordance with the forms and courtesies of this House, in turn to offer you our sincere congratulations on your election."
"These are, of course, congratulations that are offered not so much out of political considerations as to you, yourself, since, as has become apparent, this election is, as much as anything, fairly symbolic of the basic agreement that exists between the two main groups in this House, over and above the differences of opinion that, all in all, are relatively superficial."
"As a number of previous speakers have said, we hope you will defend the rights of all MEPs, including those who are at present in minorities and who, as has happened to certain other minorities in history, will perhaps be the majorities of tomorrow."
"They will include MEPs who, as they have every right to do, share their electorate’s unshakeable hostility towards the way in which our institutions are currently developing and who are resolved to defend the identity and fundamental freedoms of their respective nations."
"They will include MEPs whom, following the pattern in previous terms of office, hostile governments wish to strip of their mandates because of what they have said or because of their protests against the persecutions to which they are subject."
"They will include MEPs who do not belong to groups and who, although much larger in number than the members of certain groups and although representing no less than eight or ten nationalities, do not have a single interpreter, in French or English for example, at their work meetings – a form of discrimination that, during the previous Parliament, the Court of Justice had occasion to condemn in principle."
"In a word, we hope that you will be a President for all MEPs and ensure that the principle is respected whereby, in this Parliament, all MEPs are fully-fledged MEPs, whatever their opinions."
"Mr Gollnisch, please rest assured that I will do so.(1)"
"The next item is the election of the Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament(1)."
"I have received the following candidatures: Mr Luigi Cocilovo, Mr António Costa, Mr Ingo Friedrich, Mrs Silvia-Yvonne Kaufmann, Mr Edward McMillan-Scott, Mr Mario Mauro, Mr Pierre Moscovici, Mr Gérard Onesta, Mr Janusz Onyszkiewicz, Mr Miroslav Ouzký, Mrs Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, Mr Jacek Emil Saryusz-Wolski, Mr Antonios Trakatellis and Mr Alejo Vidal-Quadras Roca."
"The candidates have informed me that they accept their candidature and, given that the number of candidates does not exceed the number of posts to be filled, I propose that the election be by acclamation, in accordance with Rule 12(1) of the Rules of Procedure."
"I therefore declare the candidates I have just named to be Vice-Presidents-elect of the European Parliament and I congratulate them on this election."
"We shall now establish the order of precedence for the Vice-Presidents."
"– Just one question, Mr President: is there a minimum number that have to have a cross against them for the voting paper to be valid?"
"Again, is there a minimum number of names that have to have a cross put against them in order for the voting paper to be valid, or is it valid if you put a cross by 2, 3, 4 or 8 – or indeed any other number?"
"Mr Friedrich, there is no minimum number of boxes to tick."
"– Mr President, it is regrettable that we do not have an opportunity to hear from the vice-presidential candidates, even though we have the right number."
"It would have been good to know who the candidates are."
"We have to remember that 50% of the Members here are new and do not know the people they are voting for."
"It would have been in the interests of transparent democracy for us to have heard who the people were, so we could choose and put them in order."
"The vice-presidential role is not just a ceremonial role in presiding over these debates but a key decision-making role in the Bureau."
"Some of the candidates are very new."
"I suggest that in future candidates make one-minute presentations."
"I also suggest that we hear from the Quaestors when they are elected tomorrow, because they are the people who are meant to be representing MEPs."
"Otherwise, we have no say whatsoever as to the people we are electing."
"Finally, we should depoliticise the Quaestors, so we have real representatives for MEPs."
"Mrs Gill, I am grateful for your suggestion, but nobody has requested the floor in relation to it."
"I shall communicate your views to the political groups so that they may consider the matter."
"But now, we have already begun the vote and it is too late to deal with your request."
"We shall proceed to the vote(2)."
"(3)"
"(1)"
"– Mr President, yesterday, you addressed us prior to your election, and your own words were that we must do away with all the grey areas that do damage to this Parliament."
"There is one decision that many Members find incomprehensible, and that is the quaestors’ decision on 26 May, which has meant that over two hundred former Members of this House have drawn a daily subsistence allowance for yesterday."
"I would ask you to have this matter investigated, and also to consider whether this allowance can be withheld, as it has led to the taxpayer yet again having to cough up between EUR 50 000 and EUR 100 000."
"Thank you very much, Mr Martin."
"We will examine your comment and the appropriate measures will be taken if necessary."
"The next item is the joint debate on the Report of the European Council and the Commission Statement – European Councils of 17, 18 and 29 June 2004 – and the Council Statement – Six months of the Irish Presidency."
"(President Borrell, President Prodi, honourable Members of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to be here today at this first Plenary session of the new European Parliament."
"I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all Members, from across the twenty-five Member States of the European Union, on their election last month in the greatest supranational exercise in democracy that the world has ever known."
"It is good to see familiar faces and new faces alike.)"
"Mr President, I see that some Members are having difficulty receiving their Irish language interpretation."
"Perhaps when Irish is fully recognised in Europe we will have one difficulty less."
"I am very pleased to be here today at the first plenary session of the new European Parliament."
"I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate all Members, from across the 25 Member States of the European Union, on their election last month in the greatest supranational exercise in democracy that the world has ever known."
"It is good to see familiar faces and new faces alike in this new Parliament."
"I would also like, President Borrell, to congratulate you on your election to the post of President of the European Parliament and to wish you well."
"In Ireland, and particularly as outgoing presidency, we are very conscious of the crucial and constructive role played by the Parliament in the work of the European Union."
"During our presidency we enjoyed an immensely cooperative and mutually supportive relationship with the European Parliament, which was an essential element in the realisation of many of our presidency goals."
"I wish you every success in the exercise of your office over the coming years."
"I have come here today to report on the outcome of the June European Council and on the work of the Irish presidency of the Council for the first six months of 2004."
"Before I do, however, I want to outline the two key principles which underlined Ireland's presidency and indeed underpin Ireland's general approach to European affairs."
"The first and most basic principle that informed our approach was that Europe must work - and must be seen to work - for its people."
"Too often, the debate on European issues can drift into a world of jargon and theory."
"In doing so it runs a real risk of losing the attention and, in due course, the support of its citizens."
"The European Union is not a matter of theory."
"It has and will continue to make a real difference to the lives of its citizens."
"Without it, Europe could not have recovered from the devastation of the world wars."
"Without it, Europe could not have created a vibrant single market and a strong and stable single currency."
"Without it, we would not have had the frameworks of social and environmental protection which are the cornerstones of the European model."
"And, of course, without it we would not have been in a position to embrace and support the Europeans who have suffered half a century of totalitarian oppression."
"We all need to focus on making the new enlarged European Union relevant and responsive to our citizens."
"To do so we need to focus on that which unites us rather than that which divides us."
"We need to focus on the key concerns of the citizen: jobs, social and environmental protection, peace and security."
"They have been the ingredients of Europe's success."
"They must remain at the centre of our attention as leaders, legislators and Europeans."
"The second principle that has underpinned our approach to Europe has been the principle of fairness."
"Whether you are large or small - as Ireland is - rules matter."
"The fair, even-handed and transparent application of those rules matters even more."
"The European Union has created a zone where the concerns of all can be respected, the identities of all can be strengthened and the fundamental interests and rights of all can be protected."
"It is essential that the traditions of equality, fairness and cooperation that have been the keystones of the European Union be reinforced in the new enlarged Union."
"When I addressed this House in January, I set out five main areas of work for the Irish presidency."
"We wanted a speedy and successful outcome to the work of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"We wanted a successful enlargement and we wanted to progress the ongoing enlargement negotiations."
"We were determined that the Spring European Council would help to revitalise and reinvigorate the Lisbon Strategy."
"I reported comprehensively on this issue to Parliament in March 2004."
"In the Justice and Home Affairs area we wanted to deliver on the commitments made in the Amsterdam Treaty and in the Tampere programme."
"Last, but by no means least, we sought to give renewed coherence and impetus to the European Union’s external agenda."
"One of the main issues on our agenda, and one on which, I am delighted to say, we had a successful outcome, was the nomination of the new President of the European Commission."
"José Manuel Durão Barroso played a full part in the search for the next President of the Commission."
"It was only towards the end of the process that he allowed his name to go forward as a candidate for the position."
"I was therefore very pleased that the European Council by consensus agreed to propose Mr Durão Barroso as its nominee for President of the European Commission."
"At such a crucial time in the Union's development we could not have found a better candidate."
"He is a man who is prepared to lead and is able to take decisions."
"He is a committed European and has a deep understanding of the interests of all Member States, large and small, old and new."
"I have no hesitation in recommending him to you."
"I am also delighted that it was possible to reach agreement on other important appointments."
"Javier Solana, who has been outstanding in his present functions, will continue in the post of Secretary-General of the Council, and Pierre de Boissieu will continue as Deputy Secretary-General."
"On the entry into force of the European Constitution, following its ratification in every Member State, Secretary-General and High Representative Solana is set to become the Union’s first Foreign Minister."
"A particular highlight of our presidency was, of course, the agreement we reached on a new Constitution at the Intergovernmental Conference on 18 June."
"This was the culmination of more than two-and-a-half years' work that began with the Laeken Declaration in December 2001."
"The new Constitution is a tribute to the commitment and political will of all of the participants in the European Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Today, nonetheless, I want to pay a special tribute to the work of the European Parliament."
"Throughout the process, in the European Convention and the IGC, Parliament has shown a deep sense of commitment to the European Union and to the citizens whose interests it directly represents."
"The Convention outcome in particular - the great bulk of which was unaltered in the Intergovernmental Conference - reflected much that was brought to the table by the representatives of this Parliament."
"I am conscious, too, that in the course of the Intergovernmental Conference the same positive, flexible and constructive attitude was struck throughout."
"I want to acknowledge especially the hard work that was done to find solutions to issues of particular concern to Parliament, and which was essential to finding an overall agreement."
"A final deal would not have been possible without the assistance and commitment of Parliament."
"I want to express my warmest thanks to you all, in particular to Mr Brok and Mr Hänsch and, of course, the former President of the European Parliament, Mr Cox."
"They gave enormous help, assistance and commitment to me and Mr Roche, my Minister for Europe, who is with me today."
"We deeply appreciate all their help."
"You will all be more than familiar at this stage with the contents of the Constitution."
"I would still nonetheless like to highlight some of the features that make it such a positive step forward for the Union."
"We have succeeded in setting down clearly in one single document what the Union is and what the Union does."
"We have defined a set of values and objectives that we can all share and which make the European Union unique across the world."
"We have enhanced the democratic legitimacy of the European Union by extending the powers of the European Parliament."
"We have also strengthened the role of national parliaments and opened the Council of Ministers to more public scrutiny."
"We have clarified the division of powers between the Union and the Member States."
"It is now clear how decisions are taken, and who is entitled to take them."
"The principles of subsidiarity and proportionality have also been strengthened."
"We have incorporated the Charter of Fundamental Rights as an integral part of the Constitution."
"In a significant advance in the area of human rights, the Union's institutions and the Member States when implementing Union law will be bound by the Charter, and the Union's citizens will have the right to legal redress if they feel their rights have not been upheld."
"In addition, the Union is to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights, which will help to ensure consistency between the Courts in Strasbourg and Luxembourg."
"We have agreed an institutional framework that fully respects the rights of all Member States in all of the Union's institutions."
"Each Member State will nominate a member of the Commission until 2014."
"At that time a move will be made to a smaller Commission with members from two-thirds of the Member States selected on the basis of absolutely equal rotation, unless the European Council decides unanimously to fix a different size."
"We have thus provided the basis for an effective Commission into the future which, I know you agree, is of crucial importance for the Union."
"The principle of double majority voting, enshrining the dual nature of the Union as a Union of States and citizens, will be implemented in a way that respects the concerns of all IGC participants and enhances the efficiency of decision-making."
"The new team presidency arrangements bringing three Member States together to implement an agreed programme will help the Council to become more effective and efficient."
"The new permanent President of the European Council, Foreign Minister and External Action Service will enhance coordination and allow the Union to play a more effective role in the wider world."
"These are all remarkable achievements, which many would have believed impossible at the outset of the Convention process."
"I thank all those in the Convention, all those who helped us, my good colleague the President of the Commission Mr Prodi, his colleagues who worked so hard to help us in our work, and, of course, Mr Giscard d'Estaing, who was the President of the Convention."
"Work is now getting under way to prepare the text for signature by Heads of State or Government on 29 October in Rome."
"Following signature, attention will focus on ratification, which is intended to be concluded at the latest by 1 November 2006."
"Some Member States will hold referendums, others will ratify the text using parliamentary procedures."
"Irrespective of the choices made by Member States, it is incumbent on us all to explain what is in the Constitution, and why it will be so beneficial for the Union, the Member States and especially our citizens."
"The questions posed at the European Council in Laeken in December 2001 - how to make the Union more effective and efficient; how to prepare it to play a more effective role in the wider world, and how to bring the Union closer to its citizens - have been well answered."
"Our new Constitution will equip us to meet, with confidence, the challenges that the Union is facing as it continues to widen and deepen."
"The Union has undergone a lengthy and exhaustive process of Treaty change in recent years."
"It is now time for us to have the confidence to see the new Constitution as the Union's bedrock in the same way that the Treaty of Rome has served us so well over the course of more than half a century."
"Our focus must now turn fully to formulating and implementing those policies our citizens expect of us."
"As our Union enlarges, continuing to be able to take decisions that will serve the needs of our people will be critical."
"The new European Constitution will enable the Union to engage constructively with the future challenges and opportunities that it will face."
"During our six-month term as presidency, Ireland was honoured and privileged to welcome 10 new Member States into the European Union on 1 May."
"We marked the occasion by a formal and symbolic ceremony - a 'Day of Welcomes' - in Dublin."
"This was a truly historic moment for the European Union."
"It was a moment of great opportunity and hope for all the people of Europe."
"Of course, the enlargement process did not end on 1 May."
"We are delighted to have achieved substantial progress in negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania."
"The European Council noted with great satisfaction that Bulgaria had provisionally closed negotiations in all outstanding chapters."
"In addition, Romania made significant progress, provisionally closing negotiations in three chapters of the ."
"As an example of a very concrete step towards accession, work has just commenced, under the Dutch presidency, on the drafting of the Accession Treaty."
"We encourage both countries to maintain and accelerate their efforts and look forward to their accession in January 2007, if they are ready."
"The June European Council welcomed the significant progress which Turkey has continued to make in the reform process, and the sustained efforts of the Turkish Government to meet the Copenhagen political criteria."
"The Union has reaffirmed its commitment that, if the December European Council decision on the fulfilment of the political criteria is positive, accession negotiations with Turkey will be opened without delay."
"This decision will be taken on the basis of the Commission's report and recommendation."
"It will be taken in an objective and transparent manner."
"Also in June the European Council decided that Croatia is a candidate for membership and that negotiations should begin early in 2005."
"Our presidency had responsibility for managing the initial phase of negotiations on the future Financial Perspectives which will determine funding for the Union from 2007 to 2013."
"Our aim was to examine the Commission's ideas in detail and to offer feedback to the Commission in preparing its legislative proposals."
"This we did, and the June European Council found the report we prepared to be a useful contribution."
"In June we also agreed to reach political agreement on the dossier next year."
"The focus of our presidency in the Justice and Home Affairs area was on the delivery of commitments under the Amsterdam Treaty and in the broader Tampere programme for the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice."
"The last six months saw very substantial progress."
"We adopted the asylum qualifications directive and achieved political agreement on the asylum procedures directive."
"The two cornerstones for a common asylum system are now in place."
"We moved the agreement on establishing a European Border Management Agency forward."
"This is a significant measure in the effort to fight illegal immigration."
"We also reached political agreement on the admission of third country nationals for studies and related purposes which recognises the positive contribution that legal migration makes to the Union."
"We worked to facilitate better access to justice across borders for citizens of the Union, adopting, for example, the victims of crime directive to ensure compensation to victims of violent crime."
"2004 marks the end of this five-year Tampere programme."
"In June the European Council agreed that the time had come to launch the next phase of the process and the Commission will now prepare proposals for consideration in December."
"In the related area of terrorism, and in the aftermath of the appalling terrorist attacks in Madrid, the March European Council adopted the Declaration on Combating Terrorism."
"In June we noted the significant progress made in implementing the measures set out in the Declaration and the work of the European Union Counter-Terrorism Coordinator."
"The next steps are now mapped out in the revised plan of action, which was also adopted in June."
"In the external relations area we sought to give renewed coherence and impetus to the European Union’s complex external agenda guided by the European security strategy adopted by the European Council last December."
"I believe that our efforts in this area were very successful."
"We emphasised effective multilateralism, conflict prevention and the development of a European Security and Defence Policy."
"We worked to strengthen and develop key partnerships, including the transatlantic relationship, on the basis of our shared interests and values."
"We worked hard to ensure that the Millennium Development Goals, with their strong emphasis on poverty eradication and sustainable development and the HIV/AIDS pandemic, were given the high focus that they deserve."
"Many of you in this Parliament follow closely a range of external relations issues which are of particular interest to you and your constituents."
"You know, therefore, the progress that has been made during the past six months and what remains to be done in many challenging areas."
"Across the range of issues - be it the transatlantic relationship, the European Union's engagement with Africa or the need to strengthen our relations with Russia and with Asia - we can report real and lasting progress."
"We have circulated a report on Ireland's presidency of the European Union to each Member of Parliament which sets out the key developments in the external agenda for our six-month term, as well as developments in relation to the Union's internal agenda."
"I will be happy to respond to your queries in the debate that follows."
"It has been a challenging and rewarding six months for us all."
"At the beginning of the presidency, when I addressed this House, I said that our overall objective was to secure outcomes that would have a positive impact on the lives of Europe's people."
"I strongly believe that, with the successful enlargement of the Union, the agreement on the European Constitution, the good progress made over the last six months on the Lisbon Agenda and Justice and Home Affairs, as well as in our relationships with key partners, the Union has made a great step forward."
"We must all continue to work to communicate better with our citizens so that they can become better informed and engaged in relation to developments within the Union which affect their daily lives in so many positive ways."
"I have no doubt that the Netherlands presidency will be as successful as we know it will be challenging."
"Like Parliament, I wish it well."
"The theme of Ireland's presidency was 'Europeans working together'."
"During the last six months, I believe that the Council and the European Parliament have worked together in an exemplary way."
"The experience has left me firmly convinced that, working together cooperatively - as Member States and institutions - we can build a better Europe and contribute to a fairer, more secure and more peaceful world."
"It is a great honour for me to report on the six months of the Irish presidency, but it is not just on the six months, because in any presidency there is a lead-in of about a year."
"Thus, for the last 18 months I have been dealing with the leaders of the groups in Parliament."
"I wish to thank them for the time they gave to me and their visit to Dublin in December 2003."
"They gave me very good advice."
"Throughout the presidency both Minister Cowen and Minister Roche in particular were here many times."
"Courtesy was shown to all my colleagues."
"We were determined to work closely with Parliament, to give it a lot of time, listen to its views and to reflect that through the institutions and our work."
"The experience has been enormously rewarding."
"It is a challenge for a small country."
"We do not have 800 officials to bring to European Council meetings, nor three planes."
"We do not have an enormous bureaucracy."
"We have Ambassador Anderson and her people, who worked very hard in Brussels for us, and our people who worked here in Parliament."
"It adds up to a small team and thus we got to know so many of the people here personally."
"For that reason, I wish to say how delighted I am to be here today, to thank you for your cooperation and to wish the new Parliament well, in particular the newly elected Members."
"They start an exciting part of their own political careers."
"I wish to say to the returning Members that I hope we in Ireland can keep up the good relationships that we have established."
"In particular I wish all my Irish colleagues of all political persuasions well for the six months ahead."
"Lastly, as I said at the outset to you, President Borrell, you have a difficult job - a very demanding task - both within Parliament and internationally."
"I wish you every success with it."
". – Mr President, my esteemed , ladies and gentlemen, first of all let me congratulate the new President once again on his recent election, and I am delighted to see the Members elected in all the Member States meeting at last in Parliament in an enlarged plenary."
"For the first time, one can reach out in this House and touch the new Europe, and this is an exciting and significant event."
"Our Union now needs the tools for making decisions and taking action."
"This links in with what the has just said about the successes of the Irish Presidency and especially the outcome of the European Council."
"I congratulate the Irish Presidency, and Bertie Ahern in particular, together with his colleagues, on their diplomatic skills, political sense and great commitment to the European cause."
"First, the Intergovernmental Conference closed during the last term with agreement on the European Constitution."
"As everyone knows, the last stretch on the road to a constitution is always the hardest, and the Irish Presidency directed the Conference with respect for everyone’s positions and attention to every detail."
"It proposed innovative solutions without losing the overall balance, and it convinced all parties that this is both a strong document and a serious and realistic compromise."
"In other words, this Constitutional Treaty is today the best possible agreement."
"We must not underestimate the work of the , who made a great personal effort to overcome the obstacles on the most sensitive issues."
"If we look back at the last five years, we cannot fail to see the extraordinary developments in our Union."
"When I addressed this House for the first time on 5 May 1999, the Treaty of Amsterdam had only just come into force."
"Nobody imagined at that time that we might be having a new Constitution."
"Now, however, it seems obvious to us that not only does it exist but it is also needed, and the reason is simple: the Constitution enables the Union to operate more efficiently in the interests of our citizens."
"The Constitution strengthens democracy, transparency and the sense of responsibility."
"It contains our values and our principles, and it provides a solid legal basis for our policies."
"I want to underline the fact that above all it includes the Charter of Fundamental Rights and introduces the double majority principle for Council decisions made by qualified majority."
"Nobody is pretending that this is a perfect Constitution."
"The Commission, as you well know, would have preferred stronger powers for the Union in certain areas, particularly economic governance."
"In this respect, I welcome the recent European Court of Justice decision clarifying certain rules in the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Unanimity is still required in areas such as taxation, own resources, the financial perspective and, in part, social policy and foreign policy."
"Even so, the Constitution is clearly a great step forwards along the road to European integration, and in the near future we must all work together and focus on the ratification process."
"Voters will be called upon to give their views on the Constitution in many countries in referendums."
"Whether there is a popular referendum or parliamentary ratification, this is the moment when positions must be made clear."
"Over the next few months, we must therefore explain to the voters what the Union is and what it is not, why we have to make it work properly and what the new rules are."
"We must launch a thorough debate on the Constitution and what it means for the future of Europe."
"We must ensure that the referendums or parliamentary votes are not just a reflection of the political situation in each Member State but provide an informed and considered response to the real issues at European level."
"The real issue, as I was saying, is Europe itself, because rejecting the Constitution would be an enormous setback to the integration process."
"My fear, in effect, is that national questions will overshadow the real issues in the European debate and that short-term vested interests will end up jeopardising the step forwards that the Constitution will enable us to take."
"That means that first of all we have to raise the right questions in the national debates in each country."
"In particular I want to reply to a criticism that has been circulating for some time, according to which the Constitution is a step backwards in the European social dimension."
"I must say that that is not the case."
"The Constitution retains the Union’s common policies substantially unchanged, but creates a frame of reference within which the institutions can act for the common interest with greater focus."
"This applies both to measures involving the internal market and to social policy."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I remind you that the Constitution also takes some steps forward."
"Full employment and social progress have become the Union’s goals, while gender equality and minority rights are recognised as common values of the Member States."
"It also lays down that the Union must promote economic, social and territorial cohesion, as well as solidarity among the Member States; that the Union recognises and formally promotes the role of both sides of industry at European level and facilitates their dialogue while fully respecting their autonomy; and that the Union’s commercial policy must not hinder the organisation of social, educational and health services."
"Lastly, it recognises the value of public services and their role in promoting social and territorial cohesion."
"Overall, therefore, the Constitution is more ambitious, more coherent and more comprehensive than the current Treaties even in the social sphere."
"These are essentially political rather than technical points, and we must continue our political work in order to make progress in this direction."
"Our citizens always take more notice of Europe’s social dimension, and a more political Union will thus help to consolidate it."
"I therefore beg all Members to ensure that the citizens know what the real issues on the table are when we have to ratify the Constitution."
"Voting for the Constitution also means voting for this diverse European social framework."
"The Constitution is certainly an achievement of historic dimensions, but it is not the only decision taken by the last European Council."
"Among the other items, I recall the recognition of Croatia as a candidate country."
"This decision confirms the Union’s willingness to hold out the prospect of accession to the tormented countries in that part of our continent."
"Now that the Council believes that Croatia meets the Copenhagen criteria, negotiations can begin early in 2005."
"The Macedonian Government has also now submitted its own application to join and is working hard for its request to be accepted."
"In the area of justice and home affairs, the action plan for the fight against terrorism has seen plenty of progress but also some uncertainties."
"We are still moving forwards on the Tampere programme, which now, however, must enter a new phase of implementation."
"The Council has also asked the Member States to finalise the implementation of measures associated with the Lisbon strategy."
"This is a complicated item on which the steps taken and the progress made have been insufficient and, above all, do not meet the expectations we had in Lisbon when we approved this chapter."
"Finally, I congratulate the Irish Presidency on having achieved agreement on the name of José Manuel Durão Barroso, who gained absolutely unanimous support in the Council; to me this agreement was a tour de force of democracy and politics."
"I also congratulate it on the decision to appoint Javier Solana as the Union’s Foreign Minister once the Constitution has come into force."
"To José Manuel Durão Barroso and Javier Solana I offer my most sincere felicitations, and to Bertie Ahern and his colleagues my very warmest thanks."
"– Mr President, Taoiseach and outgoing President of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by very warmly thanking the Irish presidency on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"It has been conducted very purposefully, very efficiently and very sympathetically, and the Taoiseach’s speech had joy in it."
"Joy, I think, is what Europe needs; the further progress of this Europe of ours must be a pleasure."
"The Irish Presidency has been a great success, and I would like to thank you personally, the Taoiseach of Ireland, the outgoing President of the European Council, and also your Minister for Europe, Dick Roche, most warmly and on behalf of our group as a whole."
"It was a happy time for us, and the former President of the European Parliament, Pat Cox, is now sitting over there; that is something else we have to get used to."
"My dear Pat, I hope we will have another opportunity to work closely together, and the fact that you are in the plenary today shows that the passion for Europe will still be with you."
"Again, heartfelt thanks for the great work you did as President of this Parliament; it will never be forgotten."
"I would like to mention another Irishman, one whom perhaps not everyone will know, particularly not the new Members, but you know him – our friend and former colleague Joe McCartin, who was a Member of this Parliament from 1979 until the last European elections, and was the only member of our group to be honoured by the award of the Robert Schuman Medal."
"We need people like Joe McCartin, who do their duty day in and day out, for only those Members who do their duty day by day can help you and us to achieve things together."
"As the outgoing President of the European Council, you spoke in terms of a great exercise in democracy."
"This continent of ours is so complicated, and its diversity makes it so problematic, that holding the whole thing together is a daily exercise, and chairmen of groups have particular experience of it."
"As you said, Europe must function, but the most important thing is – and we are grateful to you for saying so – that we in Europe have overcome totalitarianism and the dictatorships, and that it is democracy that holds us together."
"That is the great European project that brings us together across party boundaries."
"You spoke about the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Let me say, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party, that we see the great priority above all others as being the European Constitution."
"Even more than we have done already, we should be telling the public that it not only strengthens the European Parliament, but the national parliaments as well, and thus also parliamentary government and democracy in Europe."
"I think we have to put even greater stress on this."
"The Council of Ministers is made more transparent."
"We would also, of course, have preferred the Preamble to make reference not only to Europe’s religious heritage, but also to the Judaeo-Christian tradition."
"That has not, unfortunately, been achieved, and we very much regret it, but many of our common values are to be found in the Preamble and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, so that, all in all, we can say yes to it, and it will be signed in Rome, that great European city in which, in 1957, the Treaties of Rome were signed."
"There are two people whose appointments you mentioned."
"These have to do with high ideals, and ideals – as you said – can become reality only if Europe, in the final analysis, actually works."
"You mentioned the former Prime Minister of Portugal, José Manuel Durão Barroso, with whom we will be having discussions this afternoon, and whom I knew both when he was leader of the Opposition, and then as Prime Minister."
"He has not changed."
"It often happens, when someone goes from being leader of the opposition to being Prime Minister, that their personality changes."
"He has always stayed the same, and I can only congratulate you on having proposed him."
"If he becomes President of the Commission, I am convinced that he will occupy this office with success."
"We are also grateful, though, that you have again nominated Javier Solana, who, in both political and human terms, has done a tremendous job in recent years, as High Representative and then as the first Foreign Minister of the European Union."
"These two nominations are, I think, excellent, and we also have to consider them in their context."
"I would like to conclude by mentioning something that I have been getting worked up about for a long time."
"It is no reproach to you;"
"I will also be saying it to the new President of the Council. In the family photographs, the President of the Commission and the President of the European Parliament are always standing somewhere well on the fringe."
"That is not on."
"The summit of Heads of State or Government is a Community institution, at which you cannot marginalise two important Presidents, the President of the Commission and the President of Parliament."
"Their place is with the President of the European Council in the middle of the family photograph."
"That is not just a matter of protocol,"
"and I would like to say that to the persons responsible in the General Secretariat of the Council."
"Protocol, however, is the symbolic expression of an attitude."
"It is not the intergovernmental Europe that we want; instead we want the Community Europe, which you have served, and for that we want to warmly thank you."
"– Mr President, Taoiseach, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Irish Presidency of the Council was active in many areas, not always to my group’s satisfaction and not always successfully, but it is now my happy task, on behalf of my group, to congratulate you, Taoiseach, Mr President of the Council, on the historic and outstanding role you played as chairman of the Intergovernmental Conference that brought about the European Constitution."
"It was your astute, persistent and calm negotiation in the last six months that made this Intergovernmental Conference a success."
"It was a success for you, Taoiseach, and for your team."
"I also want to express my personal gratitude to you for the way in which you involved Parliament’s two representatives, and its President, in the Intergovernmental Conference’s work."
"As you know, we had a few difficult stages to get through, but our being able to do so, and do so successfully, is something that we owe not only, but particularly, to you."
"Indeed, not everything needed for the Constitution has been achieved, and I have to tell the House that not everything that was achieved was 100 per cent right."
"You know that as well as I do, as well as many others too."
"We did indeed have to make compromises, and some of them were hard for us, as representatives of the European Parliament, and for the governments of the Member States, to take."
"I am sure that you too, as head of the Irish Government, found some of the compromises difficult."
"It is also the case that some simple solutions that we arrived at in the Convention were made more complicated – there is a large number of supplementary protocols and declarations, restrictions on the one hand and exceptions on the other."
"That must not be allowed to obscure the big picture, the great achievement of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Although public attention has, over the past months, been focussed on a few contentious points, the Intergovernmental Conference adopted over 90% of the Convention draft, virtually without any debate."
"In saying this, I am not doing as the former President of the Convention did and counting words; that is nonsense, or, to be less blunt about it, rather childish."
"Rather, I can see that the structure, coherence and substance of the draft Constitution produced by the Convention have not been touched."
"That is the first great success, which also confirms the methodology that the Convention adopted."
"The second is democracy; although there are some deficiencies in that area, the European Parliament’s new status as a legislator with full and equal rights, the fact that the election of the President of the Commission is to be proceeded with in future not only in the light of the European elections, but also following a consultation procedure before the candidates are nominated – that, too, I regard as a success."
"You yourself know, Taoiseach, that we, as representatives of the European Parliament, had to draw a red line when it came to the Budget procedure of the future."
"On a personal level, I am grateful to you for ensuring that we did not reach that red line, but instead were able to come up with a good, workable compromise in the teeth of all those finance ministers who, of all things, wanted to make changes to Parliament’s budgetary rights, and to change them for the worse."
"The European Union has greater capacity to act and more transparency."
"Let me just say two things in general terms."
"We know that this is not the constitution of a European federal state; it is the constitution of a union of citizens and states, which will always be more than just provinces of a Federal Republic of Europe."
"The EU is not a copy, at European level, of the European nation-state of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries."
"It is something , and so we turn a deaf ear to the critics who keep on drawing comparisons between us and the American Constitution, saying that this draft Constitution is far too complicated, too long, and so on. None of that is fair."
"We must judge the Constitution in terms of what Europe needs."
"The Constitution must be judged by whether or not it manages to establish on a common basis the joining together of twenty-five different peoples and states that have plundered, murdered, waged warfare on and devastated one another for centuries."
"The Constitution must be judged by whether or not it can bring together on the basis of a shared constitution, twenty-five and more European states and peoples, all of which, while being bound together by their political destiny, want to retain their own identity, language, culture, and historical memories."
"Our having achieved this is a great and historic triumph in the annals of the European Union, one in which the Irish Presidency of the Council has played an outstanding part."
"What matters now is that the peoples of Europe, through their parliaments and through referendums, should make the Constitution a political reality."
"My group, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, will play its part in this, and we will make sure that Europe gets a Constitution that will take it into the new century."
"Mr President, my group also wishes to congratulate the Taoiseach and his team for their prize-winning presidency: canny, courageous and committed."
"As you say, this Parliament can also claim a share in the success story."
"What we have achieved together is something rather remarkable: we have changed the political discourse in Europe, we have established a constitutional framework for a Europe that can stand on its own feet in world affairs and deliver effective common policy to address our shared problems."
"The IGC accepted the same concept of constitutional fidelity that Member States show to the Union, a concept that informed the proceedings throughout the European Convention."
"Although there were certainly remnants of the old-style quarrels about the pecking order between states, the IGC successfully managed to transcend these and leaves us with a fairly clear picture of what the European Union will be like for the foreseeable future."
"There is a sense of constitutional settlement, of democratic legitimisation that this package deal has achieved, a sense that previous IGCs have failed to establish."
"The European Union comes out stronger."
"We trust each other more and are more trustworthy for the citizen and the outside world."
"This Parliament will now develop its own positive critique of the outcome of the IGC and prepare to exploit it, but we must also explain and justify to a fairly sceptical electorate what has happened."
"We must be a campaigning Parliament for the Constitution."
"We can be proud of our own role inside the process so far and we must not be shy of marketing Parliament on the strength of the success."
"This time Parliament cannot absolve itself of responsibility for the outcome of the IGC."
"We were there, we were players."
"It could be that a referendum will be lost somewhere in Europe."
"It will be partly our fault as Members of the European Parliament, and that of the political parties that sent us here, should a referendum fail."
"It will also be our problem to resolve thereafter."
"– Mr President, I too thank the Irish Presidency for the cheerful and elegant way in which it steered the Presidency through a very complicated period, and I particularly acknowledge the charming courtesy of Minister Roche, who in all these months succeeded in never answering the questions I put to him."
"The Presidency conducted the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations in a truly gracious manner, but it arrived at a result that is a long way from the text adopted by the Convention, and 10% of it – Mr Hänsch, please note – is very hard to accept."
"The inconsistencies between the first and third parts of the Constitution, the limitations and full implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the potential conflict between the President of the Commission and the President of the Council, the retention of the power of veto in too many areas of competence, the exclusion of the European Parliament from the ratification process – these are all serious steps backward, courteously guided by the Irish Presidency."
"In the same way, the Presidency conducted negotiations for the Commission without ever consulting Parliament, presiding over the naval battle – truly depressing for any Euroenthusiast – between small and large Member States for this or that supercommissioner and finally arriving at the appointment of a respectable gentleman, but one who emerges most of all as the Member States’ man at the head of what we would like to see as the government of Europe."
"Mr Ahern spoke of the asylum agreement."
"The sad experience of the 37 African citizens confined on board the German ship for weeks outside Italian territorial waters and today illegally detained shows quite clearly that Europe is still keeping silent on asylum and that asylum policy and control of illegal immigration, which Mr Ahern mentioned, are still being seriously and dangerously confused."
"Mr Ahern, the rights of migrants have been a low priority for your Presidency, but also the lack of action over Guantanamo Bay and the silence over the passenger name records (PNR) issue show that your Presidency probably had other priorities."
"I thank you all the same."
"Our group has enjoyed collaborating with your Presidency, but it is clear that, once again, the Council has shown that it wants to lead the European Union, while we would like it to share its power a little with the other institutions."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, it was in a difficult situation that Ireland took up the Presidency."
"Your time as President of the Council saw the historic enlargement of the EU, the adoption of the Constitution and the elections to the European Parliament."
"What concerns me in particular is the low turnout at the European elections, although that was not primarily a problem with the Irish Presidency."
"We MEPs, rather than merely continually lamenting this sad state of affairs, should be learning whatever lessons we can from it."
"The fact is that fewer and fewer members of the public have any confidence in the European Union, and the reason for this is that the Community is not there for them and fails to respond to their day-to-day concerns."
"According to Eurostat, some 70% of people in the European Union wanted the issue of unemployment to be at the heart of European policy-making and of the election campaign, whereas in fact the debates were dominated by national issues and institutional EU-speak."
"We really cannot go on like this!"
"You are right, Mr President of the Commission, to say that what matters most in future is the social Europe, but it is important that, instead of us just talking about it, the European Union must take action once and for all; in the eyes of the public, only actions count."
"Now, with the ratification of the Constitution, we have the opportunity to have in-depth discussions with the public about the European Union’s future."
"It is because people are directly affected by it that they need to be asked straight questions, as President Chirac of France said."
"I think he got it right."
"What is feasible in France or the UK must be a possibility in Germany, my own country."
"I therefore call on all Members of this House to work with persistence towards the holding of referendums on the Constitution in every Member State of the European Union and, above all, for in-depth dialogue with people on the future of the European Union."
"Thank you to the Irish Presidency for its splendid technical implementation of what is the largest planned loss of democracy to date."
"Never before have Europeans in one go faced having to lose so much power."
"Each time, power is shifted from the electorate to other people."
"Nowhere will the electorate now have had their say in drafting the Constitution."
"The right to amend the Constitution is to be shifted from the electorate to the prime ministers who, in future, will be able to amend the Constitution themselves."
"The process is described in terms of – a word that we cannot translate into Danish but whose content is conveyed by the term ."
"The right to be given the last word is to be stolen from the electorate."
"With the Constitution, a group of Heads of State or Government will obtain the right to give the EU more power without ever having to consult the electorate again."
"In a long list of new areas, the right to amend the laws following subsequent elections will pass from the electorate to a majority of non-elected Commissioners and a qualified majority of officials and ministers behind closed doors in secret working parties and councils."
"The right to elect the executive and hold them responsible is to disappear in favour of a top-down bureaucracy without democratic control, administrative law and ministerial responsibility."
"The right to regret the outcome of an election and take a different decision is to be taken away from the electorate, which will only be able to get its decisions changed with the approval of the Commission in Brussels – the same Commission in which we, as voters, are to lose the right to have our own national Commissioners."
"Without any participation by our countries, a majority of the Commission will be able to adopt a Commission law that takes precedence over each country’s constitution, even if there has not been a single person from that country present."
"In the course of a long and bloody history, the Irish have fought for their own democracy."
"During its Presidency, Ireland has paved the way for having to lose that right again."
"If we are to limit democracy, let it at least be done democratically."
"The electorate is entitled to a vote."
"Put the Constitution to the vote in all the countries, preferably on the same day."
"In this Parliament, we have created a group for independence and democracy that calls upon the electorate to reject the proposed Constitution."
"We should like to invite opponents of the Constitution to set up a common forum to help organise the resistance."
"Please note that we are to meet during the next sitting, on Tuesday at 1 p.m. after the vote, if you wish to help defend the right to our democracy against the new draft Constitution."
"Mr President, I would like to join my colleagues in congratulating the Taoiseach, Mr Bertie Ahern, and the Irish Government, for their tremendously successful presidency."
"It is one which has delivered on important political initiatives that were stalled or delayed for so long under previous presidencies."
"The most moving sight during the Irish presidency was the raising of the flags of our ten new partner countries at Aras an Uachtarain, the home of the Irish President."
"That image represents the final lifting of the artificial barriers that separated eastern and western Europe for so long."
"Taoiseach, you have proven your skills as a negotiator, as somebody who understands the difficulties each country faces, particularly when discussing the Constitution."
"You were able to find a way for those countries to ensure that their vital national interests were not overturned or upset, in particular as regards the doctrine of conferral within that Treaty, clarifying the issues of subsidiarity and proportionality, as well as ensuring the continuation of equality between all Member States and in the application of the rules."
"These are very important issues for the continuing development and growth of the European Union."
"I fully commend you, Taoiseach, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Brian Cowen, for all your work on this."
"I also want to mention the Minister for European Affairs, Mr Dick Roche, who here in Parliament was so open to meeting with individuals and political groups, who engaged fully with all Members on any issues or discussions that needed to be carried out - not only with regard to the Treaty, but also with regard to ongoing political developments here within Parliament."
"He is an example to other Ministers for European Affairs who come to this Parliament as regards how best to engage and obtain Parliament's support."
"I would also like to mention - as I have on previous occasions in this House - the role of Ambassador Anne Anderson and the Irish civil service."
"They have proven their efficiency and professionalism in bringing together different ideas and ensuring that there was a seamless run from the very start to the very end of the presidency, with full delivery of all the commitments and promises made."
"Indeed, their vigour, their enthusiasm, and most importantly, their all-round good humour in dealing with difficult issues should be recognised."
"These new roles – of selling the Treaty, of ensuring that the citizens understand its benefits and of ensuring that we show the peoples of Europe that it does not undermine their own national interests – will help us guarantee that the European Union functions smoothly."
"They ensure that there is equality between all the Member States and help us to guarantee that we can move forward within a framework suitable for further building and a more efficient operation of the Union as we enlarge even further."
"During the presidency many important summits took place."
"The biggest and most important of all was the EU-US summit which took place in County Clare."
"This was the first step in rebuilding the relationship between the US and the European Union."
"Many people in America now recognise that unilateralism is not the way to go, that we require cooperation, not just in geopolitical terms but also in trade terms, and to ensure that the United Nations and other international bodies can operate effectively."
"Taoiseach, I want to congratulate you on being able to bring forward a nominee for President of the Commission in Prime Minister Barroso."
"It was difficult to find somebody who could encapsulate all the desires and wishes of all the Member States, someone who will also have the necessary degree of independence to give proper political leadership to the Commission in the future."
"We have in Mr Barroso the ideal candidate."
"I hope there will be majority support for his nomination in the House tomorrow, and I am delighted that our group will be fully endorsing and supporting his nomination for Commission President."
"Finally, Taoiseach, you deserve a rest after all your hard work."
"Minister Roche deserves a boost after all his work and, most importantly of all, the civil servants deserve not only a good pat on the back, but also perhaps a few extra euros as a result of the new agreements!"
"Mr President, Taoiseach, ladies and gentlemen, the Irish Presidency will go down in history mainly because it saw the greatest ever enlargement of European structures."
"Only now has the European Union become genuinely European."
"Enlargement has been merely formal and political in nature, however."
"It has failed to impact on a number of areas."
"One of these is the labour market, where Europeans are still being segregated into first and second class citizens."
"The transitional periods before citizens of the New Union can enjoy full access to the labour market demonstrate that Europe remains divided."
"They bring to mind by the British author George Orwell."
"In that novel, some were deemed to be more equal than others."
"Such a Union is a disgrace."
"Changes must be introduced at the earliest opportunity."
"There has to be an end to all discrimination within Europe."
"I should like to address one comment to the Taoiseach."
"He referred to Old Europe and New Europe."
"It can hardly be appropriate for him to refer to Central and Eastern Europe as New Europe, when the history of the nations concerned goes back over a thousand years."
"I suggest to the Taoiseach that he would be better advised to refer to the New Union, which is also the Old Europe."
"President Prodi spoke of increasing the Commission’s competence in economic affairs."
"I trust this does not include the competence to raise taxes in Member States, notably in the new Member States."
"I can assure you that the citizens would not tolerate such a Union."
"Finally, there is something I should like to thank the Taoiseach for."
"Throughout his country’s six month Presidency of the European Union he never forgot that the Union is first and foremost a Europe of the nations and must remain so."
"Mr President, on behalf of my colleagues in the Irish delegation in the PPE-DE Group, I wish you every success in your term as President."
"I should like to acknowledge the wonderful work that our former Irish President, Pat Cox, did while in your Chair by saying that you have a hard act to follow."
"Welcome."
"I should like to welcome personally the Taoiseach, Minister Roche, Ambassador Anderson and all of those from the Irish permanent representation here to Parliament this morning."
"On behalf of all my colleagues in the PPE-DE Group I should like to add a few words to the summation of the sixth Irish presidency of the European Union, at what has truly been a historic time."
"We use the word 'historic' glibly, but it has been a time when our central and east European colleagues, along with Cyprus and Malta, have rejoined the European family."
"I would particularly like to commend the Irish permanent representation for their careful planning and preparation of the solid administrative, diplomatic and policy foundations that underpinned the great success of our presidency."
"When Ireland unexpectedly took over the mantle of mediator in the wake of the IGC's failure to reach agreement on the new constitution for Europe last December, it seemed a daunting challenge. Taoiseach, your success in this area has become your and our crowning glory."
"The selection of a new Commission President was also a testament to your sound negotiating skills and those of your team."
"Whether it was responding to the tragic Madrid terrorist blasts in March, repairing transatlantic ties, or celebrating the historic enlargement of the EU by welcoming our new colleagues to the Community in May, the actions taken by our presidency were measured and appropriate."
"So much was done in these areas it is perhaps unsurprising that the core Lisbon objectives of promoting economic competitiveness and sustainable growth must now be left for the Dutch presidency to address - a bit of 'pass the parcel' here, I suggest."
"This includes the important Services Directive, your promised initiative to promote better regulation and the implementation of national reform partnerships in the run-up to the mid-term review of the Lisbon Agenda."
"On 14 January 2004, in welcoming you at the start of your presidency, Taoiseach, I warned that most businesses, particularly the SMEs in Europe, feel that time is running out - if it has not already run out - for Lisbon."
"I said that we need concrete actions and not just repetitions of wish-lists and words."
"At that time, I asked you and your presidency for facts and the specifics which would turn your plans into reality."
"It was the eighth time - and today is the ninth time - that I and my colleagues have sat through the twice-yearly mantra of lip service to Lisbon."
"What exactly has been done to make the Lisbon Agenda a reality under your watch - apart from setting a menu for the Dutch to get on with?"
"For the Irish Government I hope that the increased project management and organisational capacity that you particularly have demonstrated this year, Taoiseach, will now be taken home and applied to the domestic scene."
"I am not talking about transposing EU directives onto national statute books, but about proper consultation of stakeholders, proper drafting of legislation that takes account of national requirements, proper implementation of legislation and proper enforcement of these laws."
"At every stage of the domestic chain our record has been extremely bad: only last week nine more infringement proceedings were brought against Ireland in the environmental area."
"The Nitrates Directive is a case in point: years late, cobbled together at the eleventh hour, minimal consultation, less planning and a total mess."
"You, Taoiseach, will now have to deliver at home."
"I am delighted to acknowledge the great success of your presidency of the European Council, but this is against a backdrop of some neglect on the Irish front."
"Indeed, the nomination yesterday of Minister McCreevy as our Irish Commissioner here brings a wry smile to my face."
"I wish him well and I welcome your nomination, but the term 'poacher turned gamekeeper' comes to mind in relation to European matters."
"My call to you, Taoiseach, is that you take the skills and capacities you have built up as President of the European Council back home."
"Make your Irish presidency a role model for the continuation of the Irish Government."
"I thank, in particular, my colleagues Mr McCartin, Mrs Banotti and Mr Cushnahan, who retired at the end of the last parliamentary term."
"In particular I should like to mention Mr McCartin and the acknowledgement that Mr Poettering, Chairman of the PPE-DE Group, gave him on winning the Schuman Medal for 25 years' service to this Parliament: a wonderful testament to his contribution here."
"Between them, my three colleagues gave 60 years' service to the European Parliament."
"Those of us replacing them have a lot to do to catch up."
"I thank you, Taoiseach and Minister Roche."
"I also thank Ambassador Anderson for all the excellent work that she and the permanent representation have done."
"We were very proud of your Irish presidency."
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate you on your election to your new post and I wish you well."
"I join with those who have praised the Taoiseach and his team today for the successful conclusion of the constitutional negotiations, in particular the retention of the broad framework, values, objectives and citizens' rights which the European Convention had negotiated."
"By doing so the legitimacy of the European integration project has been enhanced and the potential for creating a more democratic and inclusive Europe has also been created."
"It must be said, however, that the Irish presidency also presided over a rather regrettable list of failures."
"The failure to protect temporary agency workers, the failure to push for debt cancellation for the world's poorest, the failure to stand up to George W. Bush and his zealotry, and the failure to advance the Lisbon Agenda in a socially inclusive manner."
"The Council and the Commission also ganged up in an appalling effort to push through the legislation on providing personal data records relating to air transport to the United States, in the face of opposition from the European Parliament."
"Taoiseach, you are not here to answer for your domestic policies."
"However, I am appalled at your decision to nominate Mr McCreevy as Irish Commissioner."
"He is one of the most right-wing finance ministers in Europe."
"He is one of the finance ministers who sought to deny this Parliament its democratic right to control the budget of the European Union."
"He believes in providing incentives for the rich by giving them more wealth, more profits and more tax incentives – and in providing incentives for the poor by giving them a kick in the arse."
"If we believe in a social-market Europe rather than in a supermarket Europe, we should not allow Mr McCreevy near the economic levers of this Union."
"(Mr President, thank you for the opportunity to say a few words on the Irish presidency."
"Before I make my comments I would like to wish the Irish Government well in their application to have Irish recognised as an official working language in the EU."
"For all nations, but perhaps smaller nations in particular, cultural identity is very important."
"We can all be true Europeans and yet fully retain our cultural identity and language is a vital part of this.)"
"So, moving on from language to what I consider to have been a very successful Irish presidency, I want to congratulate the Taoiseach, his ministers, and in particular Minister Cowen and Minister Roche, who is with the Taoiseach here today."
"I also congratulate Ambassador Anderson and the Irish civil service."
"The major achievement of the Irish presidency was to secure agreement on a Treaty that establishes a Constitution for Europe but, allied to this, a key priority was to communicate Europe better to its citizens."
"Therein lies the opportunity and the danger: the opportunity to engage citizens from all of the 25 countries in the European project, but equally the danger of failing to achieve that objective."
"While politicians must lead, that leadership must be accompanied by the involvement of citizens and the promotion of civil society."
"Otherwise, as a famous poet from my own city of Sligo, W.B. Yeats, once wrote: 'The centre cannot hold'."
"For us and for Europe the centre must hold, because the very future of the European Union depends on our efforts to involve our citizens and to communicate our positive vision for Europe."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I too welcome you here and wish to thank you."
"I was born in Salzburg, a city re-established on Roman ruins by Irish monks in the tenth century, who drained the swamps, laid the foundations of the city and mediated in the disputes between tribal chiefs."
"So you will understand why we are not amazed when Irish missionaries civilise Europe and carry out the fundamental tasks of draining swamps – including the swamps of national egoisms – and laying foundations, including those of European democracy."
"While we are on the subject of mediating in disputes between tribal chiefs, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am grateful to you for your achievement in civilising Europe."
"You have maintained the constitution’s architecture, and that is no doubt your most crucial achievement."
"The governments, of course, have given us a lesson in who really wields the power."
"On the basis of possessing, formally, the right of final decision, they have been arrogant enough to rearrange the Convention’s draft according to their own tastes and, on various points, to take their pick."
"That is a pity."
"What makes the lesson in power all the sadder is that Parliament could, now that we are dealing with the Presidency of the Commission, deliver an appropriate response, for it, formally speaking, has the right of final decision and could well show whether or not it is willing to make the decision more real than a formality and compel respect for the House."
"That would show who has the will to power and who does not."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"Where the Constitution was to be signed was a long-standing bone of contention for the Italian Presidency, which made it possible for something to be able to be signed in Rome by coming up with the text."
"That is a quite different achievement, and one for which we are grateful."
"It is not quite accurate to say that the Convention draft has come through unscathed."
"Removing the Legislative Council from the Convention draft amounted to doing away with one of the Convention’s great ideas and with what would have been an immense democratic leap forward in terms of the separation of powers, one that has now not been taken."
"What we have is the Council making more laws, with all the dubious legitimacy of legislation by a government."
"Out of double majority, a formula for decision-making that every citizen could understand and accept, we have brought forth another mass of confusing mathematical formulae."
"Where the Convention envisaged decisions by qualified majority, unanimous decisions have been introduced, and the EU’s capacity to act has suffered thereby."
"The social dimension, too – and that is an area where the Convention was not successful either – has been further circumscribed, with, instead of full employment, merely a high level of it."
"I do not believe that Parliament has had much of a part to play in the later stages of all this."
"Now, though, the governments will need us if people are to accept this Constitution and if their parliaments are to ratify it."
"Let me express my particular gratitude to you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, for having held to the original concept of the Constitution and of the Convention draft."
"(Mr President, Mr President-in Office, Taoiseach, I am proud to be here today as part of the first Sinn Féin team in the European Parliament.)"
"As Irish republicans, following in the tradition of Bobby Sands MP, we are committed to the politics of equality, justice and freedom."
"We bring Sinn Féin's agenda for change, for Irish unity and independence to this forum."
"I would like to acknowledge the work of the Irish presidency over the last six months and to wish the new Dutch presidency well."
"Sinn Féin believes that the enlarged EU must adopt a new set of priorities."
"We oppose attempts to turn the EU into a superstate or a military and economic superpower."
"We support EU reform that gives power back to the people, the elimination of poverty, support for public services, revitalised rural economies, and the reform and strengthening of the United Nations."
"This, we believe, is the new direction for Europe."
"This is the EU that we will work towards."
"Mr President, I can safely say that we in Ireland have been proud of our Irish presidency and of our Taoiseach in the role of President."
"This presidency was characterised by enthusiasm and diplomacy."
"Despite a short six months in which to work, Ireland sponsored positive initiatives like the 'Communicating Europe' initiative."
"However, I am alarmed by the unholy haste in pushing through such a sweeping, power-shifting and undemocratic initiative as the proposed European Constitution."
"We have had the Irish presidency."
"We were privileged to host the welcome of the ten new nations last May in Dublin."
"We have shared our Taoiseach with the world."
"Mr Ahern's slogan at home is 'more to do'."
"We would say to Mr Balkenende and the new presidency that there is more to do to bring greater protection to vulnerable people, to bring about equality and respect among nations, to bring help to suffering countries like Sudan and to bring democracy and transparency to the EU project itself."
"To Mr Ahern I say: now it is time to come home."
"There is more to do."
"You have a disability bill to introduce, a health and education system to sort out, fishermen and women, farmers and many small businesses in great difficulties, and numerous environmental crises."
"You have demonstrated the potential in the world of a small, vibrant and - I remind you - still neutral nation."
"Now bring your energy home."
"Well done to you Taoiseach, and to your team."
"You have more to do. , which means 'thank you'."
"I also greet Mr Cox and extend to him as well."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"I should like to thank the Taoiseach and his team for their accomplishments."
"The result gives grounds to refute, entirely, those speculations, which were voiced before the start of the Irish Presidency, that the Irish Presidency would be time lost for the European Union in matters of vital importance."
"In reality the Irish Presidency turned out to be so successful that it makes one question the ineffectiveness that is imputed to the rotation of the Presidency of the European Union."
"There was all-round pessimism regarding the possibilities of the draft European Union Constitution being accepted during the Irish Presidency."
"As a member of the European Convention, I can now safely say that the version approved during the Irish Presidency is more viable than that on which we were able to reach agreement in the Convention."
"In this regard, one should not forget, of course, the achievements of the Italian Presidency."
"To my mind, the proposed candidate for President of the European Commission, who was named at the close of the Presidency from amongst the supporters of a market economy, can be deemed as successful."
"I hope that the proposed candidate will also gain the support of Parliament."
"As a representative of a country on the eastern border of the European Union, the Presidency's realistically founded position as regards the development of relations between the European Union and Russia has earned my respect."
"This contrasts favourably with those opinions which, unfortunately, one often observes in the European Union's relations with Russia."
"I hope that the quality of the Irish Presidency will set a standard and create a favourable spirit of competitiveness in those who work for the good of the European Union."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, in my first remarks in the House I wish to state that the great sense of honour that I feel derives not from membership of this institution, but from the confidence in me manifested by the people of Northern Ireland in making me their first choice in terms of representation in this Parliament."
"It is to them, not to the institutions of Europe, that I owe my allegiance."
"My purpose in being here is to defend and promote the interests and good name of Northern Ireland and to secure for its people their fair share of European funding."
"Turning to the Irish presidency, I am sure that Mr Ahern will remember my illustrious predecessor telling him six months ago in this House, with characteristic humour, that the most beneficial thing likely to emerge from the Irish presidency would be that Mr Ahern would have less time to meddle in the affairs of British Northern Ireland."
"And so it proved to be that meddle time - happily - was at a premium."
"That apart, the legacy on the constitutional front which this presidency bequeaths to us is not, in my opinion, welcome or happy."
"The new constitution is nothing to be proud of for anyone who believes in democratic control and its essential companion, national sovereignty."
"It is an affront to and an assault upon both."
"I appeal for honesty in the presentation of this Constitution, for recognition that it is a charter designed to facilitate and build a European superstate with ever-diminishing national powers and ever-increasing centralised powers and all the apparatus of statehood."
"Statehood properly lies in nation states and that is where it should remain."
"Finally, I compliment and reassure Mr Ahern on his continuing mastery of the English language so that he might have the confidence to abandon the foolish notion of wasting millions of euros of taxpayers' money on making Irish an official language of these institutions."
"I say to him to leave such archaic nonsense to Sinn Féin, from whom one expects no better."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I think Mr Allister threw something pretty amazing into the debate by saying, as he did, ‘I am against the European institutions, but in favour of Europe giving Northern Ireland lots of money.’"
"That is not, I think, the way we should think in this House."
"The region from which I come was – like Mr Voggenhuber’s part of the world – converted to Christianity by an Irishman, Saint Boniface, known as the Apostle to the Germans."
"I hope you will not come to the same end as Boniface, who was killed by the Frisians, most of whom are now Dutch."
"It is of course purely fortuitous that we now have a Dutch Presidency of the Council."
"From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank you, Taoiseach, your Foreign Minister Dick Roche, your team, but also a number of people sitting further back in its second, third and fourth rows, whose extraordinary dedication and expertise have made it possible for us to have a European Constitution."
"In doing that, Ireland has written history."
"This constitution does not bring about a superstate; instead, it creates balance by allocating competences, a role of which national parliaments fight shy."
"It is meant to create a fair balance between the levels."
"The citizens have a part to play, because the Charter of Fundamental Rights gives them rights, and so, in future, there can be no such playing about with the presidency of the Commission as we have experienced this year, for it will be the citizens who will decide who the President of the Commission is to be."
"We will see decisive improvements."
"There will be a canon of values; it is a veritable miracle that twenty-five states can agree on one that is binding, one that – as I see it – is founded upon the Christian conception of what man is."
"This canon of values will enable us to really join together in making policies, rather than relying on the mechanistic process envisaged by the old treaties."
"It also gives the EU a capacity to act."
"It is vital that we should all go back to our own countries and ensure that the ratification goes through."
"We should not be discussing – as people are in some of our countries, including my own – what is most advantageous in terms of party or domestic politics, or how we can thereby make a name for ourselves."
"I hope that the governments – and oppositions too – in all our countries will be strong enough to embark upon this ratification process with a sense of responsibility for us all and not with a view to showing their party to its best advantage in domestic politics."
"That is what our task will be now."
"Mr President, Mr Hänsch has just told us how highly the Socialists think of what the Irish Presidency did at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"If one compares Mr Ahern’s actions with Mr Berlusconi’s, one might well wonder why the future Convention does not make provision for the presidency of the Union to be rotated among the smaller States, since those States’ presidencies seem have been more productive than have certain Heads of State or Government whose greatness lies only in the size of their respective countries."
"Yet any presidency does no more than preside; it does not decide anything."
"The greatness of a presidency lies in its power to propose and in its sense of compromise."
"The draft Constitution is far from perfect, but it is thanks to Ireland it exists at all."
"Having said that, I should mention the fact that although, overall, the Irish Presidency can be assessed as positive, there remain, nevertheless, considerable areas in which the picture is not so bright."
"My friend, Mr De Rossa, has just expressed the Socialists’ regrets about the Irish Presidency’s performance on social matters."
"The European Trade Union Confederation has drawn up a ‘social test’ for the actions of the Irish Presidency."
"Of the ten points tested, six are regarded as somewhat negative, including, in particular, the failure to take action to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Agenda, the lack of interest in protecting public services, and certain directives of a social nature."
"Mr Savary will refer to other failings in the performance of the Irish Presidency, in particular the scandalous decision taken by the Council to supply the Bush administration with personal details about transatlantic passengers."
"Finally, Mr President, let me finish by mentioning an event which is not directly concerned with the performance of the Irish Presidency, but which will have important consequences."
"I want to talk about the judgment, by the Court of Justice, on the Stability and Growth Pact."
"I was among those who criticised the Commission for having brought the matter before the Court, because the Stability Pact is a policy matter and is not governed by the courts."
"However, in that respect I have to admit that the judges at the Luxembourg Court have resisted the temptation to meddle in the Union’s economic policy."
"In a Solomonic judgment, the Court has reminded the Commission that the Ecofin Council does indeed have the power of assessment, but that the Ecofin Council does not necessarily have to follow the Commission’s recommendations."
"At the same time, however, Ministers have been called to order for failing to observe the rules which they themselves laid down."
"Nevertheless, as far as the pact is concerned, the most important point in the Court’s judgment remains the confirmation of the Commission’s sole right of initiative."
"Thus the Council cannot amend the rules ‘without being prompted again by the Commission’."
"The Commission’s right of initiative is thus upheld, but all rights, President Prodi, also include obligations."
"The Commission now has an obligation to make proposals to turn a ‘stupid’ Stability Pact into a really intelligent pact."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the Irish Presidency for the diplomacy, method and correctness with which it approached its difficult work, eventually achieving the objective of approving the Constitution."
"I only regret the fact that the Italian Presidency was not successful in this."
"I also thank President Pat Cox and the President of the Commission, Romano Prodi, who, through their constant, determined action, have brought the term to a close and achieved two great objectives together: enlargement and the Constitution."
"They have been inspired by a different vision of Europe, which today presents us with a great Europe, strengthened through the democratic legal basis represented by the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Constitution together: Europe as a civil power."
"The Irish Presidency’s exceptional mediation has given us something which, if not perfect, is at least what we need today to be able to stand united and play a political role for peace on the world stage."
"Now Parliament must commit itself to an extensive campaign in favour of the Constitution with a view to success in the ratification process."
"For this reason, Mr President, I dare to suggest that a specific heading should be inserted in the budget to provide timely and necessary funding for the initiative, in order to make the people of Europe more aware and to bring them effectively closer to our institutions."
"(Sinn Fein stands for change in Ireland and across the EU and we look forward to working with others who want to see a Europe of equals and a globally responsible EU.)"
"I look forward to building support for the Irish peace process and Irish unity and independence."
"It makes sense for Ireland to be treated as one whether in employment, agriculture or human rights."
"In Ireland we are engaged in a peace process to which the European Union, the United States and others have contributed greatly."
"I welcome the Council's call for the Commission to examine the possibility of extending funds for Peace II and the International Fund for Ireland."
"Despite much progress, the peace process in Ireland faces great difficulties with the democratic institutions suspended by the British Government."
"Just last week people in my home city of Belfast were penned into their communities while a sectarian unionist parade was forced through."
"..."
"I would ask the Netherlands presidency to focus also on the Irish peace process."
"Mr President, the agreement reached on the Constitution at the June European Council was a bad one for Europe."
"My position on the Constitution – and that of my fellow European Democrats – is clear and well known."
"We believe that the Constitution is a mistake."
"We believe that Europe does not need a Constitution: countries have constitutions, and the EU is not – nor should it seek to become – a country or a state."
"The Laeken Summit of 2001 called upon the European Convention and the IGC to ensure that the outcome of their work brought the European institutions closer to the people."
"I do not think that has happened."
"The Constitution does nothing to involve the nation states and people more closely in the decision-making processes of the Union."
"In fact, with major extensions in majority voting, the powers of the centre are greatly increasing."
"This is a view that has perhaps been endorsed by the remarks recently made by the Dutch Foreign Minister, suggesting that we need to engage in a process of self-reflection with a view to deciding whether some policy areas should not be transferred back from European to national level."
"These are interesting remarks from the government that now holds the presidency of the Union for the next six months."
"They demonstrate that I am not alone in putting forward these ideas."
"Europe could have chosen a better way."
"It could have decided to tidy up the treaties in a simplifying document; it could have given national parliaments a real say in EU legislation; it could have looked more closely at what is done by national governments; and clearly it could have set out an obligation for the Union to tackle fraud and maladministration."
"I feel that we have missed an opportunity."
"I welcome the fact that France is to have a vote on the Constitution."
"I welcome the debate initiated by Mr Stoiber on a possible referendum in Germany."
"It is right that the people have the final say in deciding their own future."
"The leader of my own party believes in a live-and-let-live Europe, in other words, one where those who wish to integrate more closely should be enabled to do so, provided that those of us who do not are not compelled to do so."
"When the referendums are held, I hope and believe that many people will take the opportunity to vote for a Europe of diversity and not uniformity, and a Europe that respects the rights of nation states."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Taoiseach, ladies and gentlemen, as part of the consultation process, on 4 May this year the European Parliament expressed a critical opinion on the draft agreement between the United States and the European Union."
"The agreement requires that European air carriers disclose certain data pertaining to passengers travelling to the United States, such as bank account numbers, for example."
"The data is to be passed to the office responsible for customs and border protection in the Department of Homeland Security in the United States."
"Parliament stated that the agreement infringes European Union legislation."
"In particular, it felt the agreement eroded the level of protection of personal data guaranteed in Directive No 46 of 1995."
"Accordingly, Parliament approached the European Court of Justice and requested its opinion on the matter."
"Nonetheless, the Council finalised the agreement, disregarding the concerns expressed and taking advantage of the interruption of the business of the House due to the elections for a new Parliament."
"This leads me to a question."
"Is it the Irish Presidency’s view that the level of protection of personal data afforded to European citizens should have been reduced as required by this agreement, despite the serious concerns expressed by Parliament?"
"Does this not amount to a restriction of personal freedoms?"
"I should like to know whether the Presidency has recognised the problem and whether it has endeavoured to take a stance on such an important issue."
"In conclusion, and on a somewhat different note, I should like to congratulate the Irish Presidency most sincerely on concluding the negotiations on a Constitutional Treaty."
"The compromise achieved represents a success for the Presidency and a personal success for yourself, Taoiseach."
"It is actually a success for us all, because Europe and all of us need a constitution."
"The Irish Presidency succeeded in convincing the governments of the twenty-five Member States to support the Constitution."
"The task now is to convince the 450 million citizens of the European Union to support it as well."
"We must all work together to ensure that they do so."
"It will then be possible for the Constitution to come into force on 1 November 2009."
"– Mr President, we cannot fail to see that the net balance of the Irish Presidency was positive. It worked effectively and brought the whole European Union two great political results: the agreement on the first Constitution and the selection of the new President of the Commission, who should be voted in by Parliament tomorrow."
"The work on the Constitution was thoroughly positive."
"We have just one major regret: that an explicit reference to the European Union’s Christian roots, which form the true bridge linking western Europe with eastern Europe, was not inserted into the preamble."
"We regret this, and the Group of the European People’s Party will fight on so that Europe will never forget its own origins."
"Even so, the Irish Presidency was successful and brought to a conclusion the task done so remarkably by the Italian Presidency, which had achieved agreement on 95% of the Convention’s work."
"It is no coincidence that this result has been acknowledged by all the countries of the European Union, which have decided to have the Treaty signed in the Italian capital – the City of Rome – which represents not only a benchmark in Italian history but also an important benchmark in the history of Europe and the history of the European Union."
"The second important and positive result is the selection of the new candidate for the Presidency of the European Commission."
"This result not only respects the vote of 13 June but at the same time acknowledges the Portuguese Prime Minister’s balance – a President of the Commission who represents renewal and a new interpretation of how to run the Executive, increasingly detached from the petty affairs of individual countries and leaning increasingly towards creating a Europe that is allied to the United States but is also politically strong and a player on the international stage."
"Mr President, I should like to join in the chorus of praise for the Irish Presidency, which has proved that when there is great European inspiration there are no small countries."
"On a more specific point, and speaking as a member of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should also like to congratulate the Irish Presidency on three of its very important achievements."
"The first of these is the adoption of the second railways package, the second is the adoption of a very ambitious programme of trans-European transport networks, and the third is the constellation of navigation satellites forming Galileo, the European Global Positioning System."
"I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate all the Irish negotiators, who showed great savoir-faire and very great skill."
"When anyone exercises responsibility, however, there are always grey areas and there are failures."
"I should like to mention two of them, and to associate myself with all that has been said here about the agreement with the United States on personal data in relation to transatlantic air safety."
"This agreement is not in line with what Parliament wanted."
"It is a denial of democracy and we cannot accept it."
"This agreement represents a risk to human rights and is a manifestation of Europe’s servility towards the United States at a time when the United States is not demonstrating very much openness in relation to human rights and the protection of citizens."
"In some respects it is contrary to the elementary requirements and the ideals of our European project."
"Nevertheless I welcome the fact that it was an Irishman, Mr Pat Cox, who tried to expunge this affront to the European Parliament by initiating proceedings before the European Court of Justice."
"The second great disappointment is the decision of the ‘competitiveness’ Council to go back on this House’s vote at first reading on the patentability of software."
"It is unfortunate that you chose to go back on a text which is a credit to the European Parliament, striking, as it in one sense did, a miraculous balance between protecting our industry and guaranteeing the universality of the language of software and the freedom of access to it."
"I think that this is a great pity."
"The ball is, admittedly, in Parliament’s court, but the option chosen is the result of an extremely narrow conception of property and the weight of the industrial lobbies."
"In all, your Presidency will be remembered as being a great technical presidency but as being slightly less successful as regards social matters, and this is something that is regrettable."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I must start by contradicting the previous speaker."
"The Irish Presidency has been a great political Presidency, rather than a technical one; and it has been so in difficult conditions, and at the time of the massacre of 11 March in Madrid."
"The first measures you have taken, such as the appointment of the anti-terrorist Coordinator, are steps in the right direction in terms of combating the scourge of terrorism, which affects our public freedoms."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have succeeded in reaching an agreement on the European Constitution."
"This Parliament is going to give its opinion on that text over the coming weeks and therefore – everybody knows my position on this issue – I do not wish to talk about it in advance, but I congratulate you because it was not easy to reach an agreement and, in the end, that agreement and the Constitution Europe needs are currently on the table."
"I would also like to congratulate you, Mr President, on the proposal to name Mr Durão Barroso as candidate for the Presidency of the Commission, because that agreement was not easy either."
"We have a great candidate and, above all, I believe we must make a political effort to put the Commission where it should be: at the centre of the Community method and of the life of the European Union."
"I hope that this important vote in favour of the candidate proposed to us by the European Council also moves in the direction of restoring relations between the Commission and the European Parliament, which are so important."
", I believe, however, that the most important issue during your Presidency has been enlargement."
"When, a few weeks ago, we celebrated the anniversary of Monnet and Spinelli, my group had the honour of representing you in this debate."
"I thought that if Monnet and Spinelli had been here, sitting on these benches, they would have thought that the enlargement achieved under the Irish Presidency, ‘the stitching together of the two Europes’, to use the expression of Mr Geremek, was the most important thing we have done over recent years, and that will always be to your credit."
"Much has been said here about large countries and small countries;"
"I believe it is a pernicious distinction, which has never existed in European history."
"Why is a country large or small?"
"Because of its population, the size of its territory, its GDP?"
"No, a country is large or small depending on whether its leaders, its peoples and its citizens have ambition and vision."
"You, , and Ireland, have been large in Europe during this Presidency."
"Mr President of Parliament, Mr President of the Commission, Taoiseach, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, we are today reviewing the six-month period of the Irish Presidency."
"It most certainly proved a very successful time for the European Union."
"In particular, the greatest enlargement in the history of the European Union took place during this period, as several previous speakers have stated."
"Enlargement was finally accomplished amidst much rejoicing and celebration in Dublin on 1 May."
"In June, the enlarged Europe demonstrated it could function effectively when 25 European leaders agreed on the choice of candidate for President of the European Commission."
"That was an achievement equally worthy of celebration and I congratulate the Irish Presidency most sincerely on this further success."
"I would also like to express my appreciation of the Presidency’s response following the tragic attacks in Madrid on 11 March."
"I am confident that both the resources earmarked for prevention of further terrorist attacks on our continent and those already deployed will produce the desired result."
"This will represent a significant and distinctive Irish contribution to the creation of a safer Europe."
"By way of contrast with the aforementioned undisputed successes of the Irish Presidency, concerns have been expressed regarding the compromise over the draft Constitutional Treaty."
"Clearly, a compromise would never have been achieved without the determination and drive the Irish leaders demonstrated at the Brussels Summit."
"Nonetheless, the question does arise as to whether that June compromise and the drive demonstrated at the time will not prove counter-productive in the future, when the draft Constitution for Europe comes to be ratified, especially through referenda."
"My misgivings arise from impressions gained during a number of meetings in the course of the recent European Parliament election campaign."
"To a great many Europeans, the lack of any reference to Judaeo-Christian traditions in the preamble to the Constitution will present a major obstacle when they are called on to vote for its ratification."
"A great many Europeans are not opposed to a united Europe, nor are they opposed to further integration within the European Union."
"They do, however, feel that this ambitious project is being built on shaky foundations by omitting the fundamental and obvious fact of the importance of the Judaeo-Christian tradition in shaping the Europe of today and of the future."
". Mr President, I will be brief, but I wish to thank Members for their constructive and positive comments."
"There were some comments on the shortcomings of our presidency, and I shall take these in the spirit in which they were made."
"I want to thank Mr Poettering, Mr Hänsch, Mr Duff and many others who welcomed the agreement on the European Constitution."
"The agreement on the Constitution was historic: agreement would not have been possible without all the participants working together to achieve it."
"The important thing is that the Union has shown that win-win solutions are possible if we work towards compromises, as many people have stated."
"It is impossible for people to set down what they alone want."
"Via compromise, this unique system can create positive outcomes that benefit everybody."
"All of you who have just been engaged in the election campaigns and earned the privilege of being in this Parliament know how important the European Union is for the prosperity and well-being of Europeans."
"At the same time, you, more than most, know the difficulty of making European Union agenda heard above the clamour of what some people often mistakenly consider to be more pressing bread-and-butter issues."
"I say 'mistakenly' because the European Union is about vision and a vast array of practical issues of great importance."
"Many Members, from different countries and different perspectives, have mentioned those issues today."
"We must explain to people what is in the Constitution."
"It will be important to provide a space for informed debate in countries that will and will not be holding a referendum."
"The period between now and the entry into force of the Treaty will give us the opportunity to describe and explain what the Union does and does not do."
"We can articulate the values and objectives that underpin the Union."
"Although we should not underestimate our task, we should not underestimate the text of the European Constitution itself."
"A clause that states that the Union's values are respect for human dignity, liberty, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights is one that can be clearly understood by all our people and should be sold to them on the basis of those values."
"When the Constitution states that the Union's aim is to promote peace, its values and the well-being of its peoples, this too will resonate with everybody."
"At the same time, however, there will be genuine concerns and many opposing views will be raised."
"These concerns must be heard and the issues must be addressed in a measured and reasonable way."
"A fear without foundation is still a fear, and all fears must be addressed, as I have discovered over the last six months."
"Those of us who support the European Union and the Constitution whose values it embodies must remain passionate advocates of it."
"At the same time it is important that those who support and those who oppose the new European Constitution approach the debate with moderation, reason and accuracy."
"I just wish to touch on a few of the issues Mr Poettering raised."
"He and some others mentioned the issue of Christianity."
"The preamble of the text acknowledges Europe's religious inheritance."
"We would have preferred to see an explicit reference to its Christian heritage, but it was not simple to achieve a consensus on a suitable wording."
"However, an important new article recognises the special contribution of Churches and, for the first time, provides for open and regular discussion with them."
"This has been widely welcomed by Church and faith organisations."
"So although there is no explicit reference in the preamble - which I personally would have liked - it was important to include that new clause."
"A number of Members mentioned the nomination process, which I know is very important to Mrs Frassoni."
"Back in the Convention, the Irish Government proposed a radical way of nominating future presidents of the Commission."
"Our vision was to involve this Parliament and the parliaments of all the Member States in the process of electing the new Commission President."
"I would ask the new Members of Parliament to look at our proposal."
"We received no support when we advocated it, so I hate to hear the people who did not support us now criticising us, but that's politics!"
"Members should consider the proposal for the next time around: it may be complicated, but it is a good idea."
"Remarkable work was done in the Convention on the European social dimension."
"Mr Katiforis led the working group on Social Europe."
"It is an area of particular concern to me personally and to the Irish presidency because we value the social solidarity that is the central feature of the European project in Ireland."
"We are a country that fully involves employers and trade unions - a 'voluntary pillar' - in all legislative decisions."
"We have been doing that for 17 years."
"I have to remind my good friend and colleague Mrs Doyle of that - the point has obviously passed her by over the 17 years."
"We value the concept, and President Prodi is quite right: we have adopted a positive, progressive aspect of the Constitutional Treaty."
"This is the European people's Constitution."
"We must remind our citizens of that fact."
"I agree with Mrs Doyle's point on small business: we have to continue to try to do that for small business."
"Mr Czarnecki spoke of the issue of freedom of movement."
"From day one we in Ireland have opened our doors to all parts of Europe and we did not distinguish between people from old and new Member States."
"We are proud that we have done that."
"Mr Goebbels and a number of other Members underlined the importance of the Lisbon Agenda and regretted that more of the goals involved were not achieved."
"I am the first to acknowledge that the Lisbon Agenda is work in progress."
"We have to intensify efforts and improve our delivery if we are to reach the goals we have set ourselves for 2010."
"That is why we set up such a thorough process in the mid-term review."
"We have set out what we would like to do in the future, but we have also said what we have done."
"As regards practical delivery over the last six months, and to give one concrete example as to what I was asked to do, people should just look at the details set out in a chapter of a report we drafted dealing with working together for growth and employment."
"I have been asked to look at the financial services area, which was most effectively steered forward under the leadership of Minister McCreevy."
"By securing an agreement on the financial services instruments, the market directives and the transparency directive, Minister McCreevy and his team - with excellent cooperation from Parliament - completed this services action plan."
"This is a critical area for the future growth of the European economy and one I can cite as a practical example of what is being delivered on the Lisbon Agenda."
"Indeed, I have underlined the importance I attach to the Lisbon Agenda in nominating Minister McCreevy as Commissioner."
"I am sure his experience will help there in the future, because the Lisbon agenda is all about delivering growth and jobs for Europe, and the Minister knows about delivering those two things."
"I would invite you to look at Ireland's record on these issues, which is would be of some value."
"Mr De Rossa is correct that we should discuss domestic issues at home, and I will be very glad to do that with him at any time."
"Our finance minister has liberated Irish workers from the punitive tax rates established when the administration with which Mr De Rossa was associated was in power."
"I always find it interesting when a Socialist mentions a 'right-wing person': definitions are always interesting."
"Mr De Rossa says he is left-wing and Socialist and he gave under two euros to old people."
"Mr McCreevy is right-wing and he gives 10 euros every year to old people."
"Work out the definitions for yourselves: they are quite interesting."
"I have only been in politics for 27 years: I need to be around a while longer before I understand the definitions of right and left, which I believe are rather nonsensical in any case."
"It is a true honour to be here reporting to the House."
"I believe that 2004 will be seen as a highly significant year for the European Union."
"We enlarged to 25 Member States."
"We have agreed a Constitution."
"We have renewed our commitment to achieving the Lisbon Agenda goals."
"We have reinforced our relationship with our global partners."
"While the work of the Irish presidency is done, the work of the Union obviously continues."
"I wish Mr Balkenende and the Dutch presidency every success."
"I also wish President Prodi every success for the remainder of his term of office and hopefully the same will apply - with the House's support - to Mr Durão Barroso in the future."
"I wish you well too, Mr President."
"On this first working day, I wish everybody here happiness and success in their political work in the European Parliament."
". – Mr President, the , Mr Ahern, has already answered all the questions."
"I will have to speak in a few minutes to comment on the beginning of the Dutch Presidency, and so I shall really confine myself to thanking the Irish Prime Minister and all the Members of Parliament."
"I should just like to take up a thought, a suggestion made by Mr Goebbels, who invited us to examine the Stability Pact and its reforms."
"I can tell you that the Commission, encouraged by the Court’s decision, has already started work and on 3 September we shall be presenting the results of our considerations, so that a thorough debate on the subject can begin."
"For the rest, the debate has been very one-sided with few voices raised against the Constitution, and the feeling that Europe is becoming a civil power, as Mrs Sbarbati put it, is widely shared in this Parliament."
"Thank you all for your attention."
"Finally, I must just say to Mr Poettering that it may be true that being in the middle of the photograph is important, but it may equally be true that having one on one side and one on the other, embracing the States of the Union, may have an even stronger political meaning."
"The joint debate is closed."
". As a member of Scotland's Party of Independence, the SNP, I congratulate the Irish Government for the exemplary manner in which it conducted its six-month presidency."
"Ireland, a member state smaller than Scotland, has provided inspiration to those of us who aspire to see Scotland resuming all of the normal powers of an independent nation, speaking for ourselves in the International Community, and cooperating with our neighbours on terms which suit Scotland's priorities - not London's."
"Ireland, with healthy economic growth, continues to demonstrate how to gain maximum benefit from EU membership, while Scotland lags behind in terms of job opportunities and is suffering a decline in population."
"I look forward to the day when Scots ministers will sit alongside Irish in the Council of Ministers, as equal partners with full rights to negotiate and vote, putting Scotland's interests first and not, as at present, merely acting as bag-carriers for their Westminster bosses."
". – The decisions, assessments and conclusions of the EU summit on 17 and 18 June run counter to the interests of the workers of the nations of Europe who, in voting or abstaining from the European elections on 13 June, expressed their condemnation of the ΕU and its policy."
"The European Constitution approved by the summit incorporates the previous Treaties which safeguard the freedom of big business and the reversal of the achievements and rights of the working classes and grass roots."
"It is supreme institutional protection of the dictatorship of the European monopolies."
"The US military doctrine of 'preventive war' against a country or countries on the pretext of combating terrorism has been adopted, thereby overturning the basic principles of international law set out in the UN charter."
"The ΕU, which supports and works with ΝΑΤΟ, is being militarised."
"Decisions have been taken on greater cooperation between the ΕU and the USA in order to intervene and crush nations, on disgraceful cooperation with the occupying government in Iraq, on a European army mission to Bosnia-Herzegovina, the scope of action of which is to be extended as far as Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, and on the application of the American/NATO plan on the Middle East."
"New measures have been promoted to suppress grass-roots rights and freedoms by hitting out at working-class and grass-roots struggles and imposing terrorism on peoples."
"The working classes of Europe and the peoples must strengthen resistance, insubordination and disobedience in the EU in their fight to prevent the European constitution and bring about the downfall of the ΕU."
"The next item is the debate on the Council Statement – Work programme of the Dutch Presidency."
". – Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the beginning of the Dutch Presidency is a good time to reflect on the achievements made over these years and, most of all, the commitments awaiting us in the near future."
"Later, this House will be hearing from the President designate of the next Commission, José Manuel Durão Barroso, and together we want to wish the new President every success."
"It will certainly be essential in this new phase to ensure full and close collaboration among the three institutions while respecting the prerogatives of each one."
"Cooperation among the three institutions is indeed a top priority, especially while the new institutions are being set up."
"We have worked well over these five years: we have done so much and have left the institutional structure completely renewed."
"It has been a great privilege for me to direct this College of Commissioners, and the people who comprise it form an extraordinary team of whom all the citizens of Europe may be proud."
"The greatest achievement of these five years has been the final demolition of the wall that had divided the continent for half a century."
"A real political tour de force was completed on 1 May, and never before has the Union been able to express so well the strength of its model and the values on which it is based: peace, freedom and solidarity."
"I am convinced that enlargement has improved our security and the prospects for growth in the Union, and these, as Prime Minister Balkenende has said, are the problems that the Dutch Presidency is most concerned about."
"Looking to the future in the wake of this success, we must complete the unification of Europe by opening the door to the Balkans."
"The Macedonian Government has already submitted its application to join and is now setting off along that road with determination."
"For Croatia the journey has already begun."
"The other countries will follow, each at its own pace, but the Commission will never fail to support this process, which truly rounds off the European frame of reference."
"Ever since the start of my mandate, I have in fact maintained that only the European Union can guarantee lasting stability and development in this part of our continent."
"Only the European model can help these peoples, our close neighbours, to overcome their old divisions and their old tragedies."
"In our new neighbourhood policy we have found an original and realistic formula for proposing a new model of ever closer relationships with our new neighbours, creating a ring of friendly countries throughout the region from Morocco to Russia."
"Setting up a broad, new region in political, economic and human terms was one of this Commission’s great strategic objectives."
"Today this objective is a political reality."
"Over these five years the Commission has also promoted the economic and social renewal of the Union and has worked hard to ensure macroeconomic stability."
"The most important measure, without doubt, has been the introduction of the euro."
"The single currency has already kept its promise of stability and, in these difficult years for the world economy, our own economies have shown how well they are able to withstand external shocks."
"There has been no turmoil on the exchange markets and no crisis in public finances, not even in the difficult times of recent months, and inflation has remained low."
"Just think what would have happened if we had not had the single currency."
"Lastly, we must recall that during this Commission’s mandate the text of the first Constitution for Europe was created; I have already spoken about this at length this morning."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while the euro, enlargement and the Constitution are the most visible achievements, we must not forget the other successes of this Commission."
"Without listing them all, I must recall the extraordinary work that has been done on state aid and the management of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"In this the Commission has remained faithful to its role as guardian of the Treaties and has ensured absolute equality of treatment for all the parties involved, large countries and small countries."
"We can indeed discuss the rules we have been given and we can see how to change them, how to make them more suited to the new economic reality, but it is the Commission’s specific duty to apply the existing rules impartially, seeking only the common interest."
"In addition, I cannot fail to recall the constant work of constructing the internal market, in which we have often had to overcome the Member States’ resistance and lack of cohesion."
"Thanks to this work, however, it now costs European consumers less to fly, to connect to the Internet and to make payments from one country to another in the Union compared with five years ago."
"I must add that there is no genuine growth in the European project if it does not involve all the regions in the Union."
"Because of this measure, in recent years there has been a noticeable narrowing of the gap between the regions of Europe in terms of income and development prospects."
"This is an exceptional fact, because what usually happens in large economic aggregations is that, unless there is a strong policy in place, the richer areas get richer and the poorer areas get poorer."
"Of course, more needs to be done in future even in this direction, especially to respond to the request for solidarity voiced by the countries that have just joined the Union."
"Nevertheless, while the euro ensures our financial stability, our future growth depends on the renovation of our economic system as provided for in the Lisbon Agenda."
"As you know, this is still a sore point because the results are not up to expectations, but I assure you that the project would have run aground completely had it not been for our constant pressure on the Member States."
"We have almost reached the half-way point in this ten-year strategy and there is still a lot left to do."
"I am grateful to Prime Minister Balkenende for committing himself to this road, which is still the road that has given the least favourable results compared with expectations."
"The Commission has, however, laid a solid basis for the eventual success of the operation."
"Since the Lisbon Agenda is based on both the renewal of the economy and the creation of a truly competitive knowledge society, we have, for the areas within our remit, substantially increased the funds for research, education and training in Europe."
"Together with the projects to create networks of excellence, we are leaving the next Commission our proposal to double the Community research budget for the period 2007-2013, thus setting all the Member States an example of strong decision-making."
"On the subject of education, one of the best days in our mandate was when the millionth university student went to study abroad under the Erasmus programme."
"A million is an extraordinary number, and by the end of the decade we will have trebled that."
"Pulling down these borders helps to create the knowledge society but it will also help to develop a generation of truly European citizens, since mobility and European citizenship are closely linked, and it is especially by targeting young people and students that we are laying the basis for the Union of tomorrow."
"I am therefore delighted that the Dutch Presidency considers mobility and young people to be one of its priorities."
"The same concept also applies to our external borders."
"It is essential to take full advantage of the external dimension of European policies on education, training and young people."
"This is why this Commission has launched the university cooperation and exchange programmes with the Mediterranean, the Balkans and Central Asia."
"The latest addition to this family is Erasmus Mundus, a programme of crucial importance that will bring thousands of students from all over the world to our universities and will help to restore Europe’s role as a world leader in research and higher education."
"This is precisely the objective that Mr Balkenende illustrated earlier, without which Europe will not be able to achieve the Lisbon objectives."
"Ladies and gentlemen, having recalled some of the achievements of this mandate, let us now look at what remains for us to do by the end of October."
"First, we shall continue to press ahead with the preparations for the new Financial Perspective."
"As you know, last week the Commission approved a legislative package that follows on from the political programme adopted last February."
"The strategy is simple: first we defined the political priorities for the period after 2007 and then we put on the table the schedule of the minimum financial resources needed to achieve these objectives."
"We focused, therefore, on the content and the political objectives and not just the financial aspects."
"I am pleased with the great amount of work that has been done, because it shows we are up to the new tasks that the European Council has entrusted to the Commission."
"In 2007 the European Union will have over 100 million new citizens; even so, our proposal leaves the current own resources ceiling unchanged because, with strict – or rather the very strictest – budgetary discipline and careful programming, we shall even be able to raise the number of Member States in the Union to 27 while spending on average only 1.14% of gross national income."
"The fact is that Europe really can make a difference, but if financial resources are lacking European added value will be zero."
"We have prepared our proposals with the aim of maximising the efficiency of Community spending, demonstrating chapter by chapter that one euro spent at European level yields more than one euro spent at national level."
"Where this is not the case, we have not made proposals."
"The Union’s priorities, as the European Council has so often reaffirmed, are competitiveness, European citizenship and Europe’s role in the world."
"We have made these decisions very seriously, and it is our job to find the resources in the Community budget to achieve them, because they are tasks that have been entrusted to us by the European Council."
"All the institutions – the Commission, the Council and Parliament – have a common duty to honour their commitments and respond to the people’s expectations."
"If the European Union cannot keep its promises it is bound to lose its citizens’ trust."
"Since 1 May 2004 we have continued our efforts for the unification of Europe."
"With Bulgaria the negotiations are technically over."
"As regards Romania, I intend to do everything in my power to advance the negotiations as speedily as possible, thus honouring the commitments made, which – I must remind you all – foresee the conclusion of negotiations in 2004, provided the country is ready."
"In early October, the Commission will adopt the report and opinion on the start of accession negotiations with Turkey, which will be the basis for the Council decision in December."
"I did not hesitate to accept the mandate conferred on me by the European Council in December 2002 to present this report on Turkey’s compliance with the Copenhagen political criteria and to issue an opinion on it."
"It would be premature to reveal its contents now, but I can only say that we are collecting analyses, facts and statements across the board."
"I can thus assure you that the work we are conducting is exhaustive and thoroughly objective."
"This total impartiality is our duty towards our governments, our citizens and the Turkish people, who hope to join us, as well as towards the people of Europe."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I opened my speech by explaining why, in my opinion, the College I preside over is leaving behind a strong legacy and a renewed and vigorous institution."
"I have given a few reasons for saying this and I could give many more."
"The Commission, however, is not just the College of Commissioners."
"I should like to take this opportunity to pay due tribute to all the women and all the men who keep our institution alive and make it grow every day, often in the face of incomprehension and lack of awareness."
"In Brussels and the other seats of the European Commission, I have found levels of excellence, competence and commitment that would be the envy of many national administrations."
"This will be one of the fondest memories I shall keep of my experience at the head of the Commission."
"All of us, Commissioners and staff, believe in Europe and believe that the Union is the only road that will lead the continent to a future of peace, prosperity and autonomy in the world."
"This is our true strength."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats warmly welcome you, along with Mr Nicolai, your Minister for Europe, and your colleagues."
"In the Netherlands, you have always been committed to European integration, and that will be of immense value in making your Presidency a success."
"Let me also say that the Dutch delegation in our group, led by our new Member Camiel Eurlings, does an excellent job of work, and they will generate the support your Presidency will need from our group; it goes without saying that you will have it."
"The most important task before us is more a matter of political psychology; it involves the inward completion of the enlargement of the European Union, and our gaining an understanding of each other. It is about ministers in the Council of Ministers understanding each other, about the peoples understanding each other and being willing to learn from one another and to meet each other halfway, and, if we have that respect and regard for each other, I am sure that will make for great success."
"Your Presidency will see the signature of the European Constitution, and the Group of the European People’s Party sees the success of that as having the utmost priority."
"That is crucial, whether the decision is taken by referendum or by parliamentary bodies, as some countries’ traditions require."
"It must be a success, and that is where you are the vital link in the chain of which you have spoken."
"You mentioned the internal market."
"I cannot but emphatically endorse what you said about the continuing completion of the internal market, and also about the further realisation of the research area that you mentioned – as did the President of the Commission as well."
"We have to get young scientists to stay in Europe; they have to have prospects here that will keep them from emigrating to the USA or to other countries."
"Where the completion of the internal market is concerned, that is a priority."
"You mentioned enlargement."
"Contentious though the issue of Turkey is for us, it is important that the criteria should be complied with, that there should be no political opportunism and, should negotiations take place, that consideration be given to alternatives, such as, for example, a privileged partnership with Turkey."
"You mentioned the Financial Perspective."
"We are in favour of establishing a committee in this House to consider these issues, and I would remind you that the Financial Perspective is not just the responsibility of the ministers on the Council, but we have an equal share in these matters, and that is something on which we insist."
"I would now like to turn to an issue that may appear a matter of form or symbolic – that of the family photos, about which I said something to the Irish presidency earlier today."
"We do not accept the constant marginalisation of the Presidents of Parliament and of the Commission."
"This Europe of ours is a community, and so, when such photos are taken, the Presidents of the institutions should be at the centre."
"You spoke of Europe’s values."
"We are very much behind you in calling a number of conferences on the subject, and that will build up our optimism for Europe."
"I trust that all Europe’s media will now take up your reference to Ilma Kaulina from Riga, who believes in Europe’s future."
"I am quite convinced that, if everyone does his or her duty, this continent has a great future ahead of it."
"That is what you are working towards, and in that our group wishes you much success."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you, Mr Balkenende, in what you had to say about the economy, focussed on the Lisbon process, and my colleagues Mr van den Berg and Mr Désir will set out our group’s position on this at greater length."
"One thing, though, is quite clear; we want the Lisbon process to be a social one."
"Economic renewal, a fitter Europe – which is indispensable – Europe as a global player not only in economic terms, a Europe that wants to be a success and will be one – only by maintaining internal social cohesion can these things be achieved."
"If we want that, we need social stability."
"Social cohesion is an indispensable part of the Lisbon process."
"If you concentrate your efforts on that during your presidency of the Council, then we European Socialists will be right alongside you."
"There is a second observation I want to make about enlargement."
"It has to be clear to us that there are two stages to enlargement."
"Bulgaria and Romania are now knocking on the EU’s door, and that is something we need to debate."
"Explicit promises have been made, and we have to talk about them, and if we are to talk in terms of fairness, let us talk about fairness towards both these countries, towards Bulgaria and Romania."
"We in the Socialist Group insist that there must be no gradations here."
"There also needs to be fairness in our dealings with Turkey."
"I know that you, Mr Balkenende, are well-versed in modern German history."
"Let me remind Mr Poettering of the former chairman of the CSU, Franz-Josef Strauss, and of his favourite dictum, ‘Pacta sunt servanda’, which he used in Vilshofen, and later in Passau."
"Treaties are to be kept to!"
"You cannot, for forty years, make promises to a country like Turkey and, when it comes to the crunch, say that you did not mean it like that."
"If the European Union wants international credibility, it has to keep to its promises."
"What that means is that, if the criteria have been met, negotiations have to start."
"Let me repeat that: if the criteria have been met,"
"the two belong together."
"And Islam is not the problem, on the contrary."
"If we were to succeed in bringing together in reconciliation a society of Muslims – which is what Turkish society is – with a society to whose values you have referred, such as freedom, solidarity, fraternity, civilian control of the armed forces, respect for human rights, the abolition of the death penalty, the freedom of the justice system; if we were to succeed in demonstrating that Islam and the Western value-system were not mutually exclusive, but mutually compatible, it would prove the Bin Ladens of this world wrong."
"The security dividend that could thereby accrue to Europe is not something we can risk without serious thought."
"I do not know whether Turkey will become a Member State of the EU, but to deny it the chance to do so would be a calamity."
"Mr Balkenende, I listened with great attention when you said you wanted to concentrate your efforts on combating terrorism and also on a new policy on drugs."
"We very much welcome that, but fighting terrorism also involves the EU institutions established for that purpose being capable of doing their job."
"That is why I will tell you, in your capacity as President-in-Office of the Council rather than as Prime Minister of the Netherlands – for as that you can do nothing about it – that Europol, the institution set up to combat terrorism in Europe, has been without a director for months because two Member States cannot agree among themselves."
"That is, quite simply, a scandal."
"We expect your presidency of the Council to see it brought to an end."
"While we are on the subject of counter-terrorism, let me say that we are all willing to join in a coalition against terrorism."
"What we are not willing to do is to allow, as part of counter-terrorism, the abandonment of fundamental values for which we stand and to which you have referred, such as freedom, justice, and fairness in our dealings with one another."
"I find it unacceptable that the European Union’s High Representative has not yet had anything to say about Guantanamo; that is something we cannot tolerate."
"If Europe is to discuss values with the USA as an equal, then we have to tell them that this is not acceptable."
"There is much else I could mention that is not acceptable, but if we want to make sustainable policies, we need Kyoto; if we want to make peace more secure throughout the world, we need the International Criminal Court, without special rights of immunity."
"If we want to seize a new opportunity in the aftermath of the failure of Cancún, then we need cooperation with the United States of America, just as we do when it comes to Kyoto and the International Criminal Court."
"Perhaps the American electorate will give us a happy event in November."
"That would be desirable, but, Mr Balkenende, what I expect of the Prime Minister of a country that has always stood up for these values is that the European Union should insist upon them in its dealings with our main partner on earth, and hence, also on the ratification of Kyoto and on fair trade."
"If you take that to heart, then we Social Democrats will be right behind your Presidency."
"Mr President, one quarter of the Netherlands is below sea-level so you have a long history of trying to keep dry!"
"I suspect that your presidency will be about digging channels and containing the tides - tides such as the challenge of funding the new enlarged European Union, the deepening importance of rebuilding our economic strength, the ebb and flow of the dangers of international terrorism."
"You need to inherit some of the momentum of your predecessor, without being caught in its shadow."
"The Irish presidency has passed one crucial legacy to yours: the European constitution."
"Liberals and Democrats in this House will lead the way in campaigning for the constitution and we expect every one of Europe's governments to be in the vanguard."
"If we cannot sell it, it was not worth a single glass of Justus Lipsius champagne."
"For the rest of the work that you have set, time is short."
"With the summer recess and a new Parliament and Commission rushing to find their feet, you must achieve in three-and-a-half months what many presidencies struggle to achieve in six."
"We look forward to working with the good team that you have in Mr Nicolaï and his colleagues."
"Liberals and Democrats in this House welcome your commitment to renewing the economic reform agenda."
"We agree that the need now is to focus more on better implementation and less on new regulation."
"The foundation of social cohesion in Europe is a strong and dynamic economy."
"With careful consideration for the needs of local and regional economies the single European market can be a tide that can lift all of our boats."
"An important part of this is the credibility of the euro and the eurozone."
"We joined your presidency in welcoming the principle at the heart of last week's ruling by the European Court of Justice that a pact is a pact: that Member States cannot and should not break with impunity the rules they set for themselves."
"We will be watching closely to see that a rethought Stability Pact can command the respect of big and small states alike."
"We welcome your commitment to push ahead on the justice and home affairs agenda."
"We welcome the launch of a debate on the best way to integrate our migration controls, closing the door to illegal migration while protecting those who justly flee oppression."
"But we need qualified majority voting and codecision in asylum, immigration and judicial cooperation as provided for in Article 251 of the Treaty."
"My group also agrees that Member States have to work together better to tackle terrorism, but we remain suspicious of the Council's intent to employ biometric identifiers widely."
"Too many of our questions about fallibility, cost-effectiveness and privacy have not been properly answered."
"You must not pre-empt the decisions of Parliament in these matters."
"Yours is also the presidency that will oversee the nomination of the new Commission."
"Last week my group asked the Commission President-designate to commit himself to striving for a better gender balance in the Commission."
"But in reality this is your job, Mr President-in-Office."
"Liberals and Democrats in this House want a Commission that is at least one-third women."
"We might remind you that if the gender balance of the Council reflected that of Europe itself, it would be thirteen to twelve."
"We need a debate on Turkey."
"Let us have that debate, openly and frankly."
"What we are committed to is hearing out the Commission when it makes its recommendation in November, and we expect the Council to do the same."
"Nor do we all agree on the correct level of funding for the European Union over the next seven years, but we do share a commitment to ensuring value for money and focusing on the Union's key priorities."
"If this presidency can publish guidelines and principles for the negotiations in December we will have the basis for an intelligent debate on future financial perspectives."
"Liberals and Democrats share your realism, but we hope it comes with a ballast of ambition and vision."
"You must decide on questions which will define the future of our Union."
"Mr President-in-Office."
"We are relying on your leadership to keep this ship afloat and keep it steaming, just as impressively as Manet's 'Steamboat Leaving Boulogne', which is on show at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam."
"– Mr President-in-Office of the Council, your Presidency will be judged by how well you manage two subjects in particular: the Financial Perspective and the decision on Turkey."
"On the first point, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance remains extremely worried, because the figures you insist upon, as when you enthusiastically signed the infamous ‘penny-pinchers’ letter’ or attacked the Commission for daring to propose that the budget for the Union of 25 should reach the monstrous level of 1.14% of Europe’s GDP, just do not add up."
"We agree on the need to reopen the debate on the European Union’s spending priorities."
"We should like to be able to support a proposal of yours to eliminate agricultural export subsidies or to re-examine certain monumental and costly trans-European network projects."
"It is not by aiming at making savings indiscriminately that the European economic system can be made ecologically and socially sustainable and also competitive."
"You yourself seem to admit as much when you speak of the need to give the European economy a boost by encouraging employment, innovation and research."
"You also used the word sustainability, a very fashionable term these days but one that for many has very little substance."
"Even so, there will be a lot to do over the next six months to encourage not only producers but also governments to make economically sustainable decisions."
"For instance, greater effort could be put into implementing the Kyoto Protocol, standing up to the pressures from the chemical industry on the Reach directive, truly enhancing the action plan for environmental technology, cutting aircraft fuel subsidies, or re-examining the Bolkenstein directive."
"Mr President, we shall meet again in six months’ time to judge how sustainable your Presidency has been."
"Lastly, in relation to Turkey, we support your approach and are delighted that you have stated that Islam in itself is not a topic of debate for its accession."
"This statement is particularly significant to us because it comes from a leading Christian Democrat."
"Perhaps you can make a contribution to this discussion in other countries too."
"In this you can certainly count on our support."
"Mr President, the President-in-Office of the Council has referred to the feeling of distrust expressed by European citizens on the occasion of the recent elections."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is precisely the main thrust of your actions over the next six months that will show our fellow citizens to what extent Europe has listened to the message that the European people have sent it."
"The social partners, and in particular those who will be meeting in October at the European Social Forum in London, will certainly pay close attention to the three principal issues which you yourself, as well as Mr Prodi, have just mentioned, and which my group would like to put on the agenda right now."
"First of all there is the draft directive on the liberalisation of services, known as the ‘Bolkestein Directive’, which you described as a step in the right direction."
"At the heart of this text, however, lies the principle of the law of the country of origin, by virtue of which the social law of the supplier country would apply everywhere."
"That would leave the door open to all kinds of abuse involving social dumping."
"The perverse system of flags of convenience would thus apply to more than half of all economic activity."
"For that reason, we see this text as unacceptable."
"Next, there is the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"As far as reform is concerned, at this stage we have still not managed to put an end to our obsession with reducing public and social expenditure, or even to the 3% myth."
"On the contrary, and even worse, there is talk of the reform having a hidden face, with particularly severe treatment for those States with a pay-as-you-go system, which would be treated the same as hidden indebtedness."
"We must be aware that such a measure would give rise to strong public disapproval in the countries concerned."
"Finally, there is the revision of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The working party chaired by Mr Kok is due to submit its report in October, but you are already calling for more flexibility and deregulation, as a way of helping countries with a very low level of social acquis."
"We would urge you to beware of the temptation to make a headlong dash towards liberalism. Even the Commission, in its report to the European Council in March, admitted, in its own way, the failure of that strategy, which was supposed to lead the Union into full employment and an economy of dynamic growth by the year 2010."
"I would also like to add that the very restrictive measures which you have outlined regarding asylum seekers, migrants and refugees, as well as your vision of the WTO negotiations, are also certain to give rise to legitimate debate."
"In other words, Mr President-in-Office, we are waiting to see what the Dutch Presidency will do."
"See you in September."
"I should like to warmly welcome to this House the Netherlands Council Presidency in the person of our Prime Minister."
"The theme of this Presidency is innovation."
"Now we have a new Parliament; soon there will be a new Commission."
"In this connection, we ought to focus on the challenge that this entails rather than the threat emanating from excessive aspirations."
"Many new people with fresh ideas bring with them a wind of change, and that is what we need, for the public are still not excited by the European Union and the European institutions."
"Despite this, if everything goes well, they are the ones that really matter in all of this."
"All those good intentions, though, have led to an endless stream of regulations, and it is unclear which of them we really need."
"That is why I applaud the fact that the Presidency is prepared to work on keeping objectives realistic and in tune with the expectations of Europe’s citizens."
"How does the President-in-Office of the Council intend to achieve that?"
"The Presidency wants to devote attention to a possible temporary application of parts of the so-called Constitution."
"In so doing, is the Presidency not running ahead of the ratification process, which also involves referendums?"
"Are we, then, still taking our citizens seriously?"
"After all, we take complete freedom of choice between a yes and no to this Constitution as a basic assumption."
"Another thorny issue is the position of Turkey."
"Will there be a serious assessment of the question of whether Turkey meets the Copenhagen criteria, or is it the case that, after 40 years of promises, we cannot do anything but say yes, even though we should, in actual fact, say no?"
"What is the President-in-Office of the Council’s opinion about recent statements by some Heads of Government who apparently no longer need such an assessment and already know that everything is in order with Turkey’s application?"
"The human rights situation in the world remains worrying."
"In large parts of the world, intolerance, repression and exploitation are more the rule than the exception."
"A chilling illustration of this is the religious law that was adopted yesterday in Sri Lanka and which, in effect, bans evangelising on pain of a long prison sentence."
"Are you prepared to take up this serious infringement of religious freedom with the Sri Lankan Government?"
"Mr President, first of all I want to thank the Presidency of the Council for their well-prepared programme for the next six months."
"I should, however, like to make a few recommendations."
"Firstly, it is true that enlargement of the European Union with ten new Member States has made it even stronger globally than ever before and particularly as regards such matters as trade policy and coordination of development."
"Therefore we expect that when leading and possibly completing negotiations on Russia's admission to the World Trade Organisation, the Dutch Presidency will be successful in getting Russia to lift its discriminatory tariff policy on transit cargo, in particular by rail, which Russia continues to impose on the European Union Member State, Latvia."
"Secondly, the Presidency's wish to ensure the safety of energy supplies in a liberalised market is commendable, therefore the Council wishes to intensify talks with Russia on the compatibility of electricity and natural gas pipelines."
"One should, however, bear in mind that Latvia has experience in cooperating with Russia regarding energy supplies – unfortunately Russia does not always operate according to market principles."
"Thirdly, the Dutch Government justifiably refers to its wealth of experience in matters of human rights as Chair of the OSCE."
"In your opinion that would allow you to carry on negotiations with Russia and tackle conflict situations."
"We should, however, like to inform you that despite Latvia having met all of the OSCE's recommendations, this does not prevent Russia from continuing to exert pressure on Latvia and Estonia supposedly on matters of human rights, but for an entirely different purpose – to legalise the consequences of occupation."
"Be vigilant in your work and I wish the Dutch Presidency every success."
"Prime Minister, there is no doubt that the thorniest issue you will face during your European Presidency will be Turkey’s membership application."
"Not only because your Cabinet appears divided over that issue; you will meet with very heavy pressure to assess Turkey not on the basis of meeting the Copenhagen criteria, but merely on the basis of the progress it has made to date."
"As you talked about a strict application of the criteria laid down in 2002, I can now only hope that you will put your money where your mouth is."
"It is, in any case, clear that Turkey failed to meet the prescribed criteria yesterday, fails to meet them today and will fail to meet them in December too."
"You spoke a moment ago about the people of Europe whom this is all about."
"Well, it should be possible for those people to have their say about an essential, fundamental issue such as the accession of a non-European country to the European Union."
"A country that, in some 20 years, will not only boast the largest surface area within this Union, but also the highest population."
"A country whose accession would constitute a financial and social drain and would set in motion a new and massive wave of immigration."
"Are you convinced that this is backed by democratic support?"
"It also remains to be seen whether we should give much credence to a Turkish Prime Minister who claims he will respect the lay state and democracy but who, a few years ago, was still making statements along the lines of ‘the mosques are our barracks, the minarets our bayonets, the domes our helmets and the believers our soldiers’."
"Indeed, we should think very carefully about how consistent this is with our European values."
"The European Constitution will prompt a referendum in various Member States."
"If we want to avoid the people in Europe turning away from the European Union even more, we must keep this referendum linked to the issue of the Turkish application."
"Mr President, during this Netherlands Presidency, all 25 Union partners are for the first time responsible for the success of these six months of cooperation, six crucial first months."
"As President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Balkenende can, and must, provide considerable impetus in vital areas."
"In so doing, the Council itself will need to develop and apply new and effective working methods."
"This is necessary so as to ensure that the progress of the Union of 25 is not at a snail’s pace."
"In the same spirit, the Council needs to approve the European Parliament’s new statute rather than standing in its way."
"Democratic transparency is what the public expects from us, and rightly so."
"I should like to hear from Mr Balkenende how he intends to give the necessary signals in terms of approach and communication."
"From my own experience as a national member of parliament, I know how capable he is of forceful policy and of perseverance in his policy, even if that is unpopular or even controversial."
"That is why we can rely on his political vision and his ability to do what is needed."
"His speech yesterday in Berlin, in which he paid tribute to Count Klaus von Stauffenberg, was another illustration of this."
"The President-in-Office of the Council was right to make an actual link between the civil and moral courage and conviction of Stauffenberg and his sympathisers and the chance of reconciliation which Europe was given following liberation."
"It is in the same spirit that we must now also do what is needed following the liberating enlargement to 25 Union partners."
"What is to be done?"
"Europe must be more visible."
"Rather than deny that its public image is that of a complex Moloch, it is important to change it in a concrete manner."
"Europe should, together, dare to address the big questions of this time, which directly affect each citizen."
"These range from a coherent and humane asylum policy that immediately tackles human trafficking, to a united stand against worldwide terrorism."
"This requires concrete action and the exchange of information and signals for citizens’ safety, and one clear line must be adopted in tackling criminals and their networks, including in relation to the drugs trade, across the national borders."
"In the context of credibility, I agree that no fresh requirements should be added in respect of candidate Member States such as Turkey."
"Instead, we must hold firm to the requirements already laid down in the Copenhagen framework and not yield to any pressure regarding these."
"If we Christian Democrats want to ensure that the community of values is not a pious platitude but an item on the daily agenda, we must specify what lines common and concrete policies must take."
"Also in terms of the economy, the document by Mr Kok, our ex-Prime Minister, would be ambiguous; I therefore expect clear proposals of their own from the Council and the Commission and essential action points in order to give the Lisbon agenda a shot in the arm."
"There is every reason to ask a great deal from this Presidency in those areas."
"Mr Balkenende has been graced with a huge opportunity and with much energy and decisiveness, and of those to whom much is given, much may be expected."
"Mr Balkenende knows that, in terms of decisiveness, he can count on the complete confidence and support of MEPs, myself included."
"We have every confidence in the personal vision, attention and decisiveness of this President-in-Office of the Council, and we wish him every success."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Dutch and European Social Democrats, I warmly welcome the Netherlands Presidency in the European Parliament."
"Your European Affairs Minister has asked us, above all, to lead the political debate."
"As European Socialists, we gladly take on this challenge."
"You spoke about modernisation, competition with the US and Asia, and about achieving the Lisbon objectives."
"We Socialists fear that, with those enticing words, you intend to do something quite different in fact, namely to press Europe into the conservative corner."
"While a few years ago, enormous efforts were being made to combat unemployment by reducing working hours and introducing job sharing, there is now all of a sudden talk of extending the working hours and you mention shorter holidays."
"What is so modern about that?"
"Whereas we used to concern ourselves with job quality, care for the workplace, the prevention of illnesses and accidents at the workplace with a European-wide regulation, you now talk about deregulation."
"Have, along with this, the objectives of higher labour participation and lower absenteeism through illness disappeared?"
"We used to talk about more flexibility within the labour market with greater legal protection; you are now talking about deregulating that protection."
"It therefore seems that your objective of abolishing the administrative burden is more of an excuse for abolishing certain social and administrative achievements."
"At the same time, you fail to address the European tendering rules that are throttling the small and medium-size companies."
"Whereas we used to talk about investing 3% of the GDP per Member State in research and education, areas where, incidentally, the Netherlands has so far been lagging behind badly, you now only talk about the Stability Pact, economising and holding firm to the deficit of 3% maximum, without making resources and scope available for holding just as firm to 3% investment in research and education."
"This is something I would have liked to have seen fought out before the Court of Justice."
"In all fairness, the Kok report on ‘work, work, work’ would take this really seriously."
"Whereas in 2000, we used to talk about high-quality public provisions not only in infrastructure, you now talk about liberalising and privatising the service sector, which involves electricity, health care and public transport."
"Are you actually prepared to stop those disastrous proposals by Mr Bolkestein to liberalise the services?"
"After all, they would enable Poles to offer their services in the Netherlands at Polish prices without being subject to prices current in our country, and this would, in fact, lead to social dumping."
"To the Social Democrats, it appears that the Lisbon agenda is being used to your advantage to adopt a hard conservative economic agenda, under the guise of modernisation."
"In our opinion, you are turning back the clock and refusing to create jobs that require brains and to commit to quality, research, education and high-quality public services."
"We fear that, as a result, unemployment will increase in Europe, that the weaker members of society will pick up the tab of the cost-cutting measures and that you, with your candidate Mr Barroso, are not going about things the right way if we want to win the fight against Asia and the US."
"We are throwing down the gauntlet before the debate."
"Although we warmly welcome you and your Presidency, we are still struggling to accept your political choices, and we are looking forward to the debate under your Presidency."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in a former political life, I was on the council of Amstelveen, a medium-sized town in the Netherlands."
"A fellow member of the council, who is now well known in Europe and to you, once entertained us about what he referred to as the paradox of the mediocre brass band."
"To cut a long story short, the conductor of such a mediocre brass band had a dual task."
"He had to ensure that the players started and finished simultaneously."
"What happened in the middle was not that relevant."
"Mr President, an analogy with the Council of Ministers urges itself upon us."
"The programme of the Netherlands Presidency is good."
"I really mean this."
"Moreover, I am delighted that, following his somewhat qualified rhetoric during the election campaign, Mr van den Berg has simply continued on the old-fashioned Socialist path."
"I think your programme is a realistic one."
"Unlike some other presidencies, you do not underestimate your task, but then you face a different challenge."
"The European elections have demonstrated that voters are not only indifferent, as you quite rightly pointed out; they are also outraged by the European institutions."
"People say that things cannot go on the way they are."
"It is not good enough that, for example, the Council’s brass band starts and finishes at the same time; the tune should also be worth listening to. This should, in fact, also be of concern to Parliament and the Commission."
"Europe must regain a human dimension."
"I am pleased with what you had to say on the matter, for I have not heard this enough in the Council so far."
"If you succeed in this, your Presidency will be successful in my view, and I wish you every success in this endeavour."
"Mr President, at long last we see JP the NP in the EP."
"I should really like to warmly welcome the President-in-Office of the Council to the European Parliament."
"In the Netherlands, Prime Minister Balkenende has appointed himself as the man of standards and values and, in Europe too, he is keen to seize upon the Presidency as a means of having a debate on European standards and values, which I welcome."
"I just hope that the debate does not turn out to be a vague and insipid discussion."
"My group would be in favour of measuring asylum policy against the yardstick of decency."
"For example, the Dutch insisted that the European directive on asylum procedures, which the Justice Ministers adopted in May, should allow asylum seekers to be deported before the final outcome of their appeal procedure."
"If that were to be the case, they could follow the appeal procedure via video conferencing, provided, of course, that they had not, in the meantime, been put into prison in their country of origin."
"That would be as good as useless and would also be completely at odds with international standards."
"I can say that my group will be proposing to the European Parliament that this directive be nullified before the European Court of Justice."
"I do, though, also want to congratulate the Netherlands Presidency."
"I have, at any rate, understood that countries where referendums will be held about the European Constitution have been asked to keep those dates as close to each other as possible."
"That is really an excellent initiative, but it would be even better if an actual Europe-wide referendum were to be held."
"I would therefore ask the Netherlands Presidency in any case to make the necessary arrangements."
"An important advantage of the Constitution is that the Council of Ministers’ legislative meetings will from now on be held in public, something about which I am delighted."
"It is also absurd, of course, that at the moment, laws are still being adopted behind closed doors."
"There is absolutely nothing that stops you from introducing public access today."
"My group would therefore urge the Netherlands Presidency to throw open the doors, allowing citizens to follow the discussions and their governments’ voting behaviour from today."
"On a final note, I would like to mention the Stability Pact."
"It becomes inevitable that the Stability Pact’s future is at risk."
"We need a smarter Pact that is less fixated on the annual budgetary balance and, instead, makes greater use of long-term indicators, such as public debt and pension duties."
"The Commission has already tabled some suggestions in this connection, and it remains to be seen whether the Dutch Government will take decisive action in this area. I do indeed hope that it will."
"Mr President, the Dutch Government is calling for priority to be given to economic growth and to the fight against terrorism."
"It embraces the now outmoded illusions of the Lisbon Summit in 2000, which assumed that before 2010, Europe would be able to beat the United States and Japan in a competitive battle by making things as bad here as they already are over there."
"It has meanwhile transpired that the resources for education for the benefit of the expected knowledge economy are insufficient."
"The drawbacks of Lisbon may have become more visible by now, but the much touted benefits have not."
"The same is true of the Stability Pact."
"Without acting contrary to democracy, the 3% standard is becoming increasingly unfeasible."
"The Netherlands is increasingly being seen as the Goody Two-Shoes of the European Union and NATO due to its requirement of stricter compliance with the Stability Pact, its contracting-out of public transport to international companies, its introduction of longer working hours, Commissioner Bolkestein’s pressure for a service directive and its continuing military involvement in the American protectorate of Iraq, which is drawing the terrorist threat closer to Europe."
"I sometimes hear other Member States remark that it would be good if the Netherlands left the European Union, because that country has become the motor behind the lamentable aspiration for restricting public expenditure and disposing of public provisions."
"That aspiration involves exchanging hallmarks of European civilisation for America’s tough and ruthless system."
"If Mr Balkenende wants to transform the whole of Europe in this way, he will bring about major social conflict, because public opinion is heading in a different direction."
"Although the Lisbon Summit has decided to dispose of public services, this Parliament subsequently decided, at my proposal and by a large majority, to dispense with this requirement concerning public transport."
"Instead of striving for unbridled economic growth at the expense of social security, public services and the environment, it is preferable to keep taxes to an adequate level and seek a redistribution of national and European income for the benefit of the weakest and of useful community tasks, and also for the benefit of integrating immigrants and removing poverty and despair in the world, which are still providing a continuous breeding ground for terrorism."
"Mr President, indeed we have much to look forward to in the course of the next six months and I notice in these proposals that there is an absolute mass of proposed financial services regulation."
"The Dutch presidency is going to push for the reinsurance directive."
"It is going to push for the third money laundering directive."
"It is going to push for the capital requirements directive and much, much more."
"Financial services is Britain's biggest and most successful industry."
"All of this agenda is nothing less than a disaster for the City of London, and it is a policy of beggar thy neighbour because the businesses of investment and insurance is not going to move from London to Frankfurt or Paris: it is going to be forced outside the European Union."
"It is going to move to the offshore centres."
"Frankly this is a deliberate policy that is being pursued by the European Union year after year after year, and it is costing my country a great deal of money."
"That said, I do admire your sense of humour because you are still banging on about the Lisbon Agenda."
"Do you remember that - the great proclamation a few years ago that we were going to create the high-tech, dynamic economy with full employment?"
"Here we are half way through the programme and we see high unemployment, sclerotic growth and not a cat's chance in hell of any of the Lisbon Agenda being realised."
"And then you want to renegotiate Britain's rebate and we will lose a further GBP 2 billion a year!"
"This is all so bad that it is really very good because the genie of public opinion is now firmly out of the bottle."
"We know that this is a political project."
"Frankly what I would like you to do is to press this programme as aggressively as you can because you will make the British public and the public in many other Member States so furious that when we get our chance in these ten referendums we will say no and we will say it loudly."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is important to ensure continuity between Presidencies."
"I should therefore like to begin by referring to the Irish Presidency."
"It proved a historic Presidency, because it saw the enlargement of the European Union through the accession of ten new Member States."
"That was a momentous event for the new Member States and indeed for the Union as a whole."
"The issue of the draft of the new Constitution also fell within the Irish Presidency."
"During the coming presidencies, these drafts will be considered."
"They will be debated at European Union level and in all the Member States."
"I believe it is important to make it clear at the outset that a full assessment will only be possible after the new Constitution has been endorsed."
"But to achieve this, several concerns must first be addressed."
"In a number of countries notably my own, Poland, very large sections of public opinion are gravely concerned by the decision to omit all reference to God and to Christianity from the preamble."
"There is concern too about Union legislation taking precedence over national legislation in certain fields."
"The change in the voting system presents a further difficulty."
"We cannot agree to it."
"There is also the matter of the unfair advantages granted to the eastern German ."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Montesquieu said that local legislation and traditions must be respected when establishing central legislation."
"There is much talk about bringing the Union closer to the people."
"It is important to give very careful consideration to the implications of increased centralisation of the European Union and of extending the economic competence of the central bodies of the European Union."
"In theory, the principle of mutual support must always be applied."
"Will this actually be the case in practice?"
"Will Montesquieu’s warnings be heeded as the Union gradually strengthens its central bodies?"
"Mr President, allow me to wish you all the best in your new role."
"The Dutch Presidency has set out a programme for us which is also a challenge, namely the signing of the European Union Constitutional Treaty."
"As a member of the European Convention, I can guarantee that this Treaty contains the basic principles for a future strong and prosperous Europe."
"As we look to the future, I feel it is incumbent on me to mention some of the steps taken by the Slovak Republic in the past."
"This very month sees the 12th anniversary of the signing by the Slovak parliament of the declaration of sovereignty of the Slovak Republic."
"This was the first step in the creation of an independent Slovak state."
"The second step was the adoption of the Constitution of the Slovak Republic on 1 September 1992."
"This period culminated in November 1992 with the peaceful division of the Czechoslovak federation into two independent states – the Czech and Slovak republics."
"I can assure you that despite this separation of their states, relations between Czechs and Slovaks have improved substantially."
"The foundation of the Slovak Republic was a step towards the EU and it was my own party, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, led by Mr Meciar, which submitted the application of the Slovak Republic to join the European Union."
"I therefore regard our current membership of the EU as the fulfilment of our goals, our ideas and our programme."
"We are interested not only in the removal of borders that hinder the free movement of individuals, but also in overcoming the separation between Old and New Europe or, as I heard it referred to yesterday, the separation between Western and Eastern Europe."
"The three Members representing the HZDS, the movement for a democratic Slovakia, Mr Kozlík, Mr Baco and myself, are working in the Group of Non-attached Members, but I would like to assure you that our efforts will be directed towards the building of a future Europe that is both prosperous and ever more closely unified."
"We support the steps taken by the Dutch Presidency and the programme that has been presented to us."
"Thank you."
"Thank you very much."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am going to propose to you that we suspend the debate and proceed, as scheduled, to the vote on the Quaestors."
"Otherwise, many Members who have come with the intention of voting will not be able to do so."
"Before suspending the debate, however, we are going to give the floor to the President-in-Office of the Council, so that he may respond to the comments made so far."
". Mr President, surely it is the intention that I first listen carefully to the views from the European Parliament."
"I think it would be best if you proceeded with the vote first and if I gave my reaction once all the speakers have taken the floor."
"That means that, in principle, I too will be taking to heart the responses to the European Council Presidency."
"The debate is suspended."
"Mr President, I am sorry that I have to repeat the request I made yesterday to have the candidates identified so that we can see who we are voting for."
"We have no idea as to who some of the candidates are."
"It would be good if they could stand up, be identified and, ideally, say something."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Gill."
"Yesterday you asked that the candidates for Quaestor speak for a minute so that the Members may know them in more than just a physical sense, but a majority of the political groups did not consider it appropriate."
"Nevertheless, I believe there can be no objection to their standing up as I name the candidates so that at least you may know them by sight."
"I do not know whether this is going to help in terms of their election but at least they will not be entirely unknown to you."
"Mr James Nicholson"
"Mrs Godelieve Quisthoudt-Rowohl"
"Mrs Mia De Vits"
"Mrs Genowefa Grabowska"
"Mrs Anneli Jäätteenmaki"
"Mrs Astrid Lulling"
"You will have noticed that it is a list predominantly comprising women."
"Now, at least, we know what one another looks like."
"We are still waiting for the electronic system to load."
"It is a difficult system to load, it would appear."
"Ladies and gentlemen, technology has rebelled against us."
"The system is refusing to load and I cannot tell you how long it may take."
"In these circumstances, I think it would be reasonable not to carry on waiting."
"I therefore feel obliged to schedule the vote for 3 p.m. and resume our debate."
"Mr Nassauer, I feel obliged to give you the floor in order not to waste any more time, but I would ask the honourable Members to remain silent."
"I would ask the President-in-Office of the Council to forgive this technical incident and to remain in our debate."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by giving the new President of the Council, on behalf of the CDU/CSU delegation, a very warm welcome to the European Parliament and assuring him of our support should he need support from this House."
"It has been apparent even from the very first minutes of this debate that the issue of the European Union’s relations with Turkey will have a major part to play."
"We see the relationship with Turkey as being of fundamental significance, and Turkey as a dependable and important partner."
"We have to make that clear without reservations, and, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that involves not constricting this relationship or reducing it to membership, but instead bearing other options in mind as well."
"The newly-elected chairman of the Socialist Group has now made it known to us that negotiations are to be commenced with Turkey, provided that it has complied with the necessary conditions by the autumn, and, in so doing, he has acted as if Turkey’s compliance or non-compliance were at present a hidden mystery, one to be revealed in the autumn when the Commission produces its report."
"There is, of course, not a shred of truth in this. Far from it; everyone in this Chamber knows that Turkey, at present, does not comply with the conditions for the commencement of negotiations."
"That is apparent from the dominant role that the armed forces still play there."
"It is evident from – and here I am resorting to charitable understatement – the problematic position as regards the rule of law in Turkey, and I am mentioning only two of the conditions."
"Let me tell you, Mr Schulz, that we cannot reckon on any change in this regard before the autumn."
"I fear, therefore, that it amounts to something very like misrepresentation, not to say hypocrisy, to assert that we are starting negotiations once the conditions have been fulfilled."
"Are you seriously trying to tell us that they will be by the autumn?"
"The fact is that I cannot seriously believe that they will be."
"It follows that honest dealing with Turkey is also about nobody, come the autumn, fooling us into believing that the Turks already fulfil the conditions, so that we can negotiate with them."
"It is also about the issue of negotiations – and of when they are to get going – not having the inevitable conclusion that they have to be started; instead, we have to be honest and frank in our dealings with them."
"I think it very important, Mr President-in-Office, that you should bear this point of view in mind as you set to work."
"The second relevant point is that the European public have, as we know from the elections, considerable reservations about us."
"If I may adapt Berthold Brecht’s phrase, we cannot elect a new public in Europe; we have to live and work with the one we have."
"I am therefore firmly convinced that we have to seize the opportunity presented by the debate on the Constitution to bring Europe and its citizens closer together."
"The debate on the Constitution offers us a unique chance to do that."
"Implementing the Constitution and making the public more familiar with it is a matter of obligation for us all."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, your Presidency will have to prepare the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The least that one can say is that the European Union is a long way from achieving its objective of becoming, by the year 2010, the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world."
"On the contrary, throughout Europe there is growing concern about businesses relocating, about workers being blackmailed into accepting longer working hours, and about continuing unemployment."
"The recovery is all the more fragile for not being based either on internal demand or on sustained public investment; instead, it remains exposed to the impact of external factors such as the rise in the value of the euro and the increase in the price of oil."
"More than ever, Europe needs a strategy for sustainable growth and employment, and for investment in research, in major trans-European networks, in education, in knowledge and in the environment."
"It needs economic and social cohesion."
"It needs the Lisbon Strategy."
"Yet certain people are trying to use the present economic slow-down as a pretext to return to an ultra-liberal programme, and to destroy the achievements of Lisbon and the integration of the various economic, social and environmental dimensions into the policies of the Union."
"In that respect, your Presidency’s priorities cause us great concern."
"You say that you support the Lisbon Agenda, and we have heard you say so."
"Yet your priorities – and here again we have read what you have written and we have heard what you have said – show that your approach is very unilateral and does not take into consideration the coherence of the Lisbon Agenda, which comprises the liberalisation of the market, in particular in the services sector, deregulation, and the reduction of administrative costs."
"As for the financial perspectives – another major area for action during your Presidency – you want to restrict the Union’s budget to 1% of GDP."
"Yet such an initiative is incompatible not only with the efforts which have to made in research, and on the subject of which Romano Prodi has put forward some proposals, but also with the policy of territorial cohesion in the new enlarged EU."
"You reject any revision of the pact to take more account of economic cycles and, in particular, public-investment requirements."
"As far as you are concerned, public-investment policies, employment regulations and environmental regulations are really no more than obstacles, unnecessary burdens and restrictions on growth."
"We, on the other hand, believe that all these things make the EU more competitive, and we also believe that respect for the integrity of the Lisbon Agenda will be a test of your Presidency’s success and will determine what support we shall be able to give it."
"Mr President, I should like to wish the Netherlands Presidency every success with its priorities."
"The Presidency is working under the motto ‘realism and ambition’, and that is something that appeals to me greatly, because, over the past few years, we have witnessed a growing trend of ever more fresh priorities being added to the agenda, and while solemn declarations are made at every Council summit, in reality they often turn out to be hollow phrases and no action is taken at all."
"Public disappointment and scepticism should therefore come as no surprise, and no manner of promotion campaign can do anything about that."
"It is therefore time we rolled up our sleeves, and that also applies to the Lisbon agenda, because, a moment ago, I heard a number of speakers on the Left of the political spectrum, and, ironically, to the right of me, saying that this Lisbon agenda is not social."
"However, in my opinion, the interpretation of this Lisbon agenda is extremely social."
"We are faced with 9% unemployment in Europe and with unemployment among young people, some of whom will never get a job."
"It is high time we implemented this agenda, and I would actually like to point out that we can learn an awful lot from the ten new countries in the European Union, because although they have carried out many difficult and painful reforms over the past 15 years, they have, in the process, managed to accomplish greater economic growth, from which everyone stands to gain."
"I therefore find it incomprehensible and also irresponsible that some parties try to undermine the Lisbon strategy."
"Finally, agreements should also be made about EU funding."
"It is a well-known fact that the Dutch Government is in favour of drastic financial cutbacks, and I should like to find out from you how this fits in with the ambitions which you mentioned in the motto, because, in addition to an effective treasury, at the moment, what Europe needs more than anything else is vision, decisive action and political leadership, and I look forward to a successful Presidency."
"I should like to thank the President-in-Office for putting innovation and environment at the heart of the mid-term review of the Lisbon process."
"Both the current climate change threat and the current crisis in the prices of a series of commodities, like oil, copper and other resources show us that we urgently need a de-linking of resource efficiency, energy efficiency and the economy."
"Europe has an answer to both these questions, and that is to strengthen Europe as a leader in environmental technology and services."
"Already today German and Swiss companies are leading the world in providing clean water and air."
"Dutch companies are leading the world in urban planning."
"Why?"
"It is because Europe has the strictest and most ambitious legislation on these policies."
"Therefore, it is not by watering down environmental policy and regulation in Europe that we will give the necessary impetus for innovation in our industries."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all allow me to congratulate the Irish President, Bertie Ahern, for the work he has done in bringing to a successful conclusion a task of historical importance, namely the signing of the European Constitution."
"If, as I fervently hope, all twenty-five EU countries ratify the Constitution over the coming months, this twice-yearly examination of the Union’s priorities will be abandoned in favour of a system of presidencies lasting two and a half years, which will be more stable and therefore more effective."
"The priorities of the Dutch Presidency include enlargement, the consolidation of the reunification of our twenty-five countries, and the continuation of negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania, and soon with Croatia too."
"Above all, however, in December the European Council will have to take a crucial decision on whether or not to open negotiations with Turkey."
"On this point, may I remind you of the position of the French MEPs belonging to the (UMP) and of many in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. We say ‘yes’ to a preferential partnership with Turkey, but ‘no’ to its accession to the Union."
"In adopting that position we are absolutely in line with the statements made by Hartmut Nassauer."
"We are counting on you, Mr Balkenende, you who are leading your country with determination and success, to strengthen the European economy by freeing it from its administrative and fiscal obstacles, by giving back to our businesses the ability to adapt to a globalised market in a European Union marked by both freedom of movement and the defence of its humanist values."
"The famous European model will be neither an illusion nor a mere magic formula, provided that we equip ourselves with the necessary political resources. Political resources include financial resources too, because the European budget has solidarity: solidarity between new and old Member States of the Union, between more and less favoured areas, between net contributors and beneficiaries."
"I should like to congratulate the Commission on the courage it has shown in lifting the taboo of the British rebate, and I should also like to congratulate the Council of Finance Ministers on having approved, at first reading, an ambitious draft budget for 2005."
"At the last elections, European citizens showed their desire to see the creation of Europe as a reality. Let us not disappoint them."
"It is a heavy responsibility, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, and we shall be there at your side if you contribute towards making Europe a political and effective Union."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we agree with the priority document of the Dutch Presidency where it states, in relation to the new financial perspectives, that we will face complex negotiations which must begin on time so that they can be completed before the beginning of the 2007 budgetary cycle."
"There is no rush."
"In fact it could be said that it is rather risky to make spending forecasts almost ten years in advance; and what is more, perspectives which – as we in this House know - become entirely rigid rules."
"However, we must begin now."
"When I talk about negotiations, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am referring to negotiations with Parliament."
"I am therefore delighted with what you said earlier: with Parliament and not just between national delegations in the Council."
"If you wish to lay the foundations for proper negotiations, you must remember that, throughout the process of discussing the new financial perspectives, including at the point when they are approved, the European Constitution will not yet be in force."
"This Parliament will not, therefore, be content with simply saying yes or no to what the Council has discussed."
"Without going into detail, since time does not allow it, I would like to say that the Socialist Group believes that the priorities within these new perspectives are, in short, cohesion between the different regions, which has become even more important with our recent enlargement, and the disparities in income it has brought; job creation and, finally, development aid for third countries, the current Category 4, the category which has grown least since 1999, the year when the current financial perspectives began, despite the many new obligations."
"– The programme of the Netherlands’ Presidency relies on realities and we welcome these endeavours."
"One of these realities is the accession on the first of May of the ten to the Union’s institutions, in other words, a big step towards the re-union of Europe."
"From this point of view, I would like to deal with two objectives of the Presidency."
"First: the Presidency’s programme lays down fast and effective integration for the ten in the Council’s decision procedure."
"This is important but it is not enough."
"In order to have a successful enlargement and for Europe and the European economy to strengthen itself by its own means and also to be an active player in the Lisbon process, it is essential to consider not only the technical integration, but also the existing hurdles and their gradual reduction and the deepening of the content of the integration."
"Connected to that, is the second important objective: the preparation of Agenda 2007."
"The aim of the Presidency is to have the basic principles and directives discussed by December 2004."
"Well, we are facing interesting and exciting debates."
"However, it must be the objective of all of us to have the successful integration feature amongst the basic principles."
"If I were to re-formulate this sentence in the spirit of the Netherlands’ Presidency, then I would say that it is an ambitious but realistic objective to count the successful integration as a basic principle."
"Prime Minister, you mentioned the brain drain to overseas."
"This particularly affects us Hungarians."
"We support all your endeavours that bring this opinion into the basic principles of the budget."
"Finally, I would like to express my appreciation to the Netherlands’ Presidency for having initiated a dialogue and communication from the richness and colourfulness of our European culture."
"We are indeed very strong in this."
"We wish you much luck!"
"– Mr President, if Lisbon taught us anything, it was that strengthening the competitiveness of the European economy, of companies, does not suffice for us to have jobs and social cohesion and to protect the environment."
"That is why Lisbon laid down these criteria as a separate pillar in its development."
"The work programme of the Netherlands Presidency appears to ignore this."
"It proposes a series of measures to reduce administrative controls of the market, to reduce costs, even hinting at increased working times, but it makes no reference to social viability."
"In other words, the Netherlands Presidency implies, in a way, that liberalising the market will automatically create jobs."
"This, however, is precisely the philosophy that Lisbon refutes, which is why it emphasises the rest."
"Therefore, what we want from the Netherlands Presidency is to hear specific policies on full employment and sustainable developments: simple things."
"As far as the financial perspectives are concerned, it is hypocritical of all of us to say that we need cohesion targets and market integration without, at the same time, increasing the budget of own resources."
"We cannot have it both ways."
"For us, 1.24% of GDP is the minimum threshold for financing the new European Union."
"As far as immigration is concerned, if I understood correctly and did not misunderstand the views of the Netherlands Presidency, you can address it primarily as a police matter and look on immigrants as criminal elements."
"In other words, you can instigate fear in immigrants, instead of primarily integrating them."
"However, the emphasis on police work, rather than on integration in the programme is particularly worrying: it is a vicious circle which will bring about racism and crime."
"Finally, as far as terrorism is concerned, of course we all know what it is and we all want to combat it, but we cannot have a work programme of a Presidency of the European Union which only talks about police measures and makes no reference to the human rights and personal freedoms which these measures often infringe."
"We, in Greece, experienced this problem on a daily basis during preparations for the 2004 Olympic Games and we are trying to strike the right balance."
"The Netherlands Presidency should therefore do likewise and stop focusing solely on policing."
"– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, those who bear responsibility at the outset of things – Mr President-in-Office of the Council – have a decisive influence on what happens in later years."
"Mistakes made at the outset, or a failure to successfully carry out the programme of work, amount to liabilities for later Presidencies."
"Yours is a double responsibility in that your Presidency of the Council coincides with the beginning of a new Parliament and the allocation of portfolios to a new Commission."
"While this is an opportunity for continuity and for adjustments, you have also taken on long-standing liabilities, and so there are two things I call upon you to do: one is to put a stop to the Council’s blocking of a decision on the Members’ Statute and give us, by the end of this year, the Members’ Statute that we have demanded."
"Secondly, we need a new system for travel expenses, for only then will we be able to practically implement the new travel costs arrangements that we have decided on."
"The second burden you have shouldered is that of the declining turnout of voters to the European elections."
"What we need is for regions, Member States and European institutions to adopt a uniform strategy for information and communication."
"This is where the signing of the Constitutional Treaty offers you an opportunity; use it as the beginning of a professional information and communication campaign."
"Rather than have this great European project returned to the national level, see to it that there is a Europe-wide referendum."
"Use the Financial Perspective to plan political priorities up to 2013, use the consideration of the Commission’s report on Turkish accession to have a debate on the European Union’s geographical boundaries and on what it is capable of doing, and produce alternatives to full membership for Turkey."
"And, in order that we may speedily conclude the road-pricing directive, I ask you to bring the Council round to a single line on transport policy."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we have little time, and so I will not go into the reunification of Europe, in respect of which, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you quite rightly indicated that confidence is the key word, although it is not because it is necessary that it is adequate, but I am sure you do not need me to tell you that."
"I will also refrain from saying anything about the composition of the new Commission, even though I hope that, together with the Commission’s new president-designate, you will, in tandem, strive to form a strong team, and will also succeed in doing so."
"Needless to say, that should be a strong team of men and women."
"Neither will I say anything about the Constitution, the ratification of which, I do of course hope, along with many fellow Members here, will really be brought on track."
"I would like to sketch out three other points."
"First of all, the financial perspectives."
"In Flanders, we have a saying ‘de gierigheid bedriegt de wijsheid’ – penny-wise, pound-foolish."
"There is a lot of truth in that, and I am convinced that people north of the border, and even in the north of Holland, will understand this."
"Secondly, the Lisbon objective."
"It is important for everyone, including Member States, citizens, trade unions and NGOs, to be convinced that the efforts required to achieve these objectives are actually quite small compared to the risks for the future generation of our possibly doing nothing quite comfortably."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you are convinced of this, and I hope that you can propagate this conviction during your Presidency of the EU."
"Thirdly and lastly, I should like to say a few words about the service directive."
"Needless to say, barriers to the free movement of services in the internal market should disappear."
"That does not mean, however, that everything has to be thrown out, that all protective and corrective measures have to be done away with."
"In my view, at least part of this service sector is socially too delicate for such action."
"Mr President, your workload is considerable."
"I hope that you can achieve your ambition."
"Europe needs this."
"You can count on our constructive attitude and I wish you every success."
"Mr President, speaking as a European Democrat, it is about time that the Lisbon strategy of driving forward competitiveness and innovation in European economies be properly implemented."
"Can the presidency deliver?"
"That is the question."
"As European debates become more idealistic and polarised many people are simply turned off, as evidenced in the recent European elections."
"Policies adopted by socialist governments have stunted the growth of economies and drowned us and our vital businesses in costly regulatory frameworks."
"The world economies outside Europe will show no mercy to us, nor should we expect them to."
"They will exploit our weaknesses and our citizens will suffer as a result."
"The demographic time-bomb is ticking, as more people become unproductive too soon."
"Nonsensical ageism removes experience and expertise often where and when it is most needed."
"The response from all of us must be direct and urgent."
"We must re-energise economies, cut the cost of the state, cut superfluous regulations, complete the single market, and encourage innovation to revive the manufacturing sector in particular."
"Above all we have to show the people that Europe is working in a friendly way: supporting them, not smothering them, giving them more freedom to improve the quality of their lives and the lives of those close to and around them, and to achieve their aspirations in the medium and long term."
"That is our first duty and we should discharge it."
"I wish them well in the presidency."
". Mr President, let us begin by once again expressing our thanks and appreciation to Commission President Prodi and his Commissioners."
"You have rightly pointed out that much has been achieved over the last few years: the euro, enlargement, the new Constitutional Treaty and, in this, the Commission too has played an important part."
"For this, very many thanks, and I look forward to working with you until the inauguration of the new Commission."
"You have heard words of appreciation, from Mr Poettering for example, who is also proposing to upgrade you where the team photograph of the European Council is concerned – the same goes for the President of the European Parliament for that matter."
"It seems a good idea to me to take another closer look at this."
"I would also like to thank the speakers for their contributions."
"Thank you for the support you have expressed for the Netherlands Presidency, but also thank you for your critical observations."
"When I spoke earlier, I said that criticism is not at all bad, it is part and parcel of democracy."
"Far more serious is indifference, and today I have seen no indifference at all, and that means that we are engaged on the same thing here today and for that I thank you from the bottom of my heart."
"Then Mr Watson told us that it is indeed a short Presidency – three-and-a-half months in fact – in part because of the summer recess."
"This means that we must work effectively during our Presidency, and of course it also means that, for this reason, we are glad to be working with you, for example as regards progress in the legislative process."
"On behalf of the Minister of European Affairs, I should also like to appeal to you to cooperate as much as you can on this legislative process."
"Then you said that you have just under ten minutes."
"I have had 26 speakers, which would work out at around 23 seconds per speaker."
"It seems better to me to combine the subjects somewhat, and I would like to do this with reference to three subjects that you also mentioned."
"I believe that there are three important things for the Europe of the future."
"First of all, credibility and fair play, secondly, being forward looking and thirdly, having time for the citizens of Europe."
"Firstly, something about the subject of credibility and fair play: let us begin with the discussions of the Copenhagen criteria."
"If criteria have been laid down, then they must be taken seriously."
"This is true for a country such as Romania."
"I have spoken to Prime Minister Nastase about this."
"It is their move, and they will have to change their legislation and other things."
"The same credibility and fair play must characterise the debate about Turkey."
"I have listened carefully to you."
"There are different views in the European Parliament, but at the moment I would like to say: let us pay heed to consistency in decision-making and procedures."
"The term ‘’ has been mentioned here, and it is all about an honest process in which we are strict in the verification of the criteria, but at the same time do not change the rules during the game."
"This means, moreover, that we shall listen with interest to the findings of the European Commission when the report on Turkey is published at the beginning of October and this will also set the tone for the decision-making in December."
"The Netherlands Presidency is working on a decision so that, in a few years, people will be able to say: it was a tenable decision and it was the right decision."
"Again where credibility and fair play are concerned, a brief word about the Stability Pact."
"Many of you have spoken about this as well."
"As far as the Presidency is concerned, the Stability Pact is not simply a matter of a few criteria, it is about the goals that are sought with them, and I have, for example, heard that there has been talk of the future reliable funding of pensions; it is important to look at the objectives behind the Pact again and, partly for this reason, a declaration about the Stability Pact has been attached to the recently agreed Constitutional Treaty that once again confirms that it is a ‘rule-based system’ and that we must also take these criteria seriously."
"The debates will of course continue; the Commission is working on it, and we shall also be discussing it further at the level of Ecofin, and the debate about this will undoubtedly continue with you too."
"It is of course important that we take the rules seriously precisely in view of the credibility of Europe."
"A third point concerns the ratification of Europe’s Constitutional Treaty."
"Many of you have spoken about the referendums to be held, the debates that will take place."
"Let me first consider what Mr Blokland has said."
"He says: are we not running too far ahead of the new constitution?"
"I do not think that we can run ahead of it to the extent that no decisions are being taken that have a legal basis in the constitution."
"That means that you cannot run ahead of it, out of respect for the ratification process."
"On the other hand we can also see that 25 governments have ranged themselves behind the constitution, and the constitution is going to be signed in Rome on 29 October."
"That too is a political fact; we are going to have to take account of the ambitions in the constitution in our planning."
"This is true for example of the discussion of public access – Mrs Buitenweg spoke about this."
"It is of course true that matters will be settled once there is a new treaty, but we can see what – even running ahead of it – we ought to be able to do."
"There has also been some discussion of whether we should not work on a referendum on a single day."
"Moreover, I understand this wish."
"This point has been raised regularly by Austria too."
"I should, however, refer to the fact that the constitutional traditions are different."
"The position of a referendum is not the same in each Member State."
"For this reason too it will not, I think, be possible to organise everything on one day, simply on the grounds of the different constitutional traditions."
"On the other hand, it is important that we have time for coordination, for a proper debate and, in that context too, there will be discussions with one another about it in connection with RASEP."
"Where credibility and fair play are concerned, another brief word about the financial perspectives."
"We all know that this is a sensitive subject, with major differences of opinion."
"Reference has been made to a letter about the 1%."
"I am not standing here as the Dutch Prime Minister. I am standing here as the President of the European Council, who is responsible for a fair process in which the different arguments are exchanged."
"A process that must be characterised by openness and transparency."
"A process that will also have to be characterised by good contacts with your Parliament."
"I know that you appreciate the intensive involvement of Parliament and, as part of the conciliation, agreements were made on 16 July about contacts between the Presidency and the European Parliament."
"I think that there is a need to have an honest debate about posteriority and about priorities, about the question of how we could also do things differently in Europe, and I think that we should also heed the observation from Flanders, ‘penny-wise and pound-foolish’."
"I have listened carefully to you. On the other hand, we must also always see that we apply the funds as best we can, are efficient and that we also see how, sometimes with the same money, we can achieve more."
"All these elements must have their place in an honest and open debate."
"I now come to my second point: being forward looking."
"For I have so clearly sensed in your contributions that you are saying ‘let us have time for the Europe of the twenty-first century, time for the future’."
"Many speakers have spoken about the importance of the European economy and the strengthening of the economic structure and, in that context, you have asked for a lot of attention for the Lisbon process."
"Mrs In 't Veld for example has raised this in no uncertain terms."
"It is good to say again that the Lisbon process will have to be characterised by three elements: it is about growth and about the strengthening of technology, of knowledge and of innovation."
"Secondly, it must be about social cohesion, the social cohesion of which Mr Wurtz, Mr Poettering, Mr Schulz and others have spoken."
"I have also nearly already had a debate with Mr van den Berg, my esteemed countryman, who made a number of critical remarks."
"Moreover, after Mr Schulz had already said let us have time for social cohesion, you said again ‘how does that fit in with this agenda’?"
"May I remind you of Mr Kok’s report, the first Kok report of the employment task force, the ‘jobs, jobs, jobs’ report. In my view a good connection is made in that report between dynamism in Europe and social content and, in preparation for the discussion here and in preparation for our work, I have this week also had discussions with the representatives of the European trade union movement."
"I asked them whether they can identify with that first Kok report, the report of the employment task force, and I had a positive response to the content of this report from the Secretary-General of the European trade union movement. It seems to me that we could go a long way with the content of this report."
"My third point is sustainability."
"When I spoke earlier, I referred to the importance of concern for the environment."
"This too is part of the Lisbon agenda; and, if we are talking about strengthening the economy, then, Mr van den Berg, this includes doing justice to reduction of the administrative burden."
"We all know that it is sometimes difficult to be innovative and to be successful even as a company."
"We may then do very well to take a look at this administrative burden."
"I am looking forward to a good debate with you about this very important subject, because we can talk about a treaty, we can talk about the citizen, but it is in the interest of this citizen that there are more jobs in Europe, that there are opportunities for our children and grandchildren and that, in 30 or 40 years, Europe will still be in a strong position, on the global stage as well."
"It is indeed a combination of growth, of social cohesion and of sustainability."
"A second point, when it comes to Europe’s focus upon the future, concerns the Justice and Home Affairs Council agenda: doing justice to the constitutional state in Europe, responding to security and fighting terrorism."
"Mr Schulz has rightly said ‘make sure that the institutions are in order’."
"In this context you referred specifically to the director of Europol."
"Last Monday it was decided that the procedure should be restarted, and there is a commitment from all the Member States that, precisely because of the arguments you mentioned, a new director should be appointed during the Netherlands Presidency."
"You are quite right: if you are working on security, then the institutions have to be in order."
"Of course it goes further when we talk about the Justice and Home Affairs Council agenda."
"There will have to be a follow-up to the Tampere process."
"We shall, for example, have to ensure that the discussion of asylum and migration can be moved forward."
"Mention has been made of whether we should not have more QMV, majority decision-making, and I think that it is good to say again that the general aspiration is of course towards QMV."
"However, we are of course dependent on the Member States and when there is more room for manoeuvre, then this area too will become easier."
"I have listened carefully to you, to Mrs Buitenweg for example, who is critical of a directive relating to asylum."
"We were aware of your point of view, and here you have raised it once more in no uncertain terms."
"The point now is that there is a directive requiring asylum seekers to have a right to an actual legal remedy. Moreover, the question of whether an appeal must have standard suspensive effect is left to the Member States, as you know."
"How does that happen, because the different legal systems vary enormously?"
"Which is why this formula has been chosen."
"If, moreover, there is no question of a standard suspensive effect of an appeal, then the directive requires that the Member States determine when an asylum seeker can ask for suspensive effect."
"With regard to the question of whether it is possible first to expel asylum seekers and only then to allow them to lodge an appeal, I would say the following: the directive states that all regulations must be in conformity with international law, including the European Human Rights Treaty."
"The standards that are contained therein and in the jurisprudence of the Court will therefore have to be observed."
"Then it is good to refer to another point, the point about the constitutional state, and in this context Mr Schulz has referred to Guantanamo Bay."
"This subject has your interest and rightly so."
"The European Union has always demonstrated its concern about the situation in Guantanamo Bay and, on several occasions and at several levels in its contacts with the United States, has spoken out in favour of the treatment of the detainees meeting the standards of the Geneva Conventions and human rights."
"Just last week there was consultation at official level between the European Union and the United States in which the US explained the setting up of combatant status review tribunals following the recent judgments of the American Supreme Court."
"The EU representatives passed on the concerns that remain on the European side, including those relating to the creation of a new category of detainees, the so-called hostile combatants."
"You are aware of this."
"In its contacts with the United States, the Netherlands Presidency will keep seeking attention for the concerns that exist regarding the status and treatment of the detainees in Guantanamo Bay."
"Finally, I come to my last point, and you have said it clearly, it is about the Europe of the citizen."
"How does the citizen experience Europe?"
"What does Europe mean for welfare, for the prosperity of citizens?"
"I then discern two voices."
"One voice says: we see mistrust in the citizen, there is euroscepticism."
"Is there sufficient support in the population, for the implementation of the Lisbon strategy for example?"
"That was one sign, the critical comment."
"On the other hand there are also voices – Mr Eurlings’ was a very clear one – in favour of an efficient Union with the ability to take action, and I would like to underline his words; if we want Europe to mean something to the citizen, then we must make progress in the areas of security, asylum issues, the economy, subjects that must be taken up with vigour, and I believe that you gain the trust of the citizen when Europe is a living force that can operate with authority and that contributes to the resolution of issues that concern the citizen."
"That is what it is all about."
"What appealed to me in the words of Mr Poettering was that he said let us also have time for the psychological dimension, because we have a Europe of 25, and Member States and people must be able to identify with the other Europe, and it is good to bring this psychological side closer from time to time, because we are so accustomed to talking in terms of what does Europe cost me, what does Europe do for me, how are the finances doing?"
"However, let us also have time for the question of what makes us Europeans?"
"What is the psychological side of it all? What are the values in Europe that bind us?"
"Often we have far too little time for this."
"I noticed in 2002 on the eve of enlargement that there was a kind of enthusiasm about us becoming one again and, afterwards, we were talking worldwide about Iraq and difficult issues, but let us ensure that the European fire lives in people, that Europe is not something abstract, something belonging to bureaucrats in Brussels and Strasbourg or even to ourselves, but that it is something that lives in the hearts and minds of people."
"In my view that will also be the attitude if you talk about values in Europe."
"We shall take initiatives on this point."
"Freedom, solidarity and respect."
"You are dedicating yourselves to the community of values of the twenty-first century and, as President of the European Council, I am very conscious that, when it comes to progress in the area of the fight against terrorism, a powerful implementation of the Lisbon strategy, having time for the follow-up to Tampere and all those other subjects, we can only be successful when we have a high level of cooperation between your Parliament, the European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Council, and therefore I am so delighted with the contributions you have made this morning and this afternoon, not only your observations of support, but also your critical observations."
"I have listened carefully to the critical observations; they were probing, and we shall take them into account in our Presidency."
"If we are having a discussion here, it is not for its own sake or because we are working simply as politicians."
"We are doing all this with a view to the interests of citizens."
"This is what it is all about, and this is what we are dedicating ourselves to."
". – Mr President, just a word of thanks, partly to prevent the Members from dying of starvation."
"I thank Prime Minister Balkenende for his speech, his response and especially for the cooperation with which his term has begun. We have started to work together and we are in perfect agreement as to our objectives."
"I should just like to make two recommendations."
"First, when we talk of the Financial Perspective we really must remember that the Commission has made an incredible effort to put on the table the minimum resources needed to achieve the objectives that the Member States have given us and to use these resources in the best way possible."
"Secondly, the Commission has listened very carefully to the dialogue of cultures."
"Over these years, we in the Commission have been deeply committed and have succeeded in setting up the Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for a Dialogue of Cultures, which will begin its work under the Dutch Presidency."
"I ask you to launch this instrument, to use it and to really make it a forum for the active dialogue that we need."
"The debate is closed."
". – The declarations by the Netherlands Presidency on its work programme are a provocation to the workers and peoples of the European Union."
"The speedier and more efficient promotion of capitalist restructurings, the changes in the labour market and to working times, further privatisation of public-sector services, pressure for new reductions to pensions and leaner social security systems and insistence on the Lisbon strategy and anti-grass roots policies in general demonstrate once again that the ΕU only serves big business."
"The shaping of the Tampere strategy and the promotion of new measures to repress the grass-roots movement which blatantly infringe personal and social freedoms, such as personal files on workers, monitoring all telecommunications, handing data over to the USA and strengthening the prosecuting and intelligence authorities on the pretext of terrorism, are all meeting with vigorous reaction on the part of the workers and the legal world."
"The strengthening of the mercenary European army, its now definitive presence in the Balkans, the creation of direct intervention units and the synchronised defence of the new order and imperialist interests by the EU and the USA, run counter to the will of the people for peace and social progress."
"The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece condemn this policy and stand by and with the grass-roots movement in its fight against these measures."
"(1)"
"Mr President, I want to sympathise with you as I assume that, because of the time of day, you also encountered the problem that I and a number of other colleagues experienced in trying to get to this vote this afternoon."
"Could you try to get the services to do something about the state of the lifts in this building?"
"I and other colleagues waited ten minutes for a lift down to this floor."
"If there is a vote taking place and it is a normal procedure, a ten-minute wait means that we will be late for the vote."
"We came out as soon as the bell rang for a vote."
"Could you try to get something sorted out so that we can restrict access to main lifts during voting sessions to Members only?"
"That seems to be the problem."
"We take note of your comment and we shall try to resolve any material problem that hinders the proper functioning of this House."
"It shall appear thus in the Minutes."
"Mr President, my dear José, I warmly congratulate you on your election. I wish you and the institution you preside over every success."
"Mr President, I shall not be taking the same tone as the previous speaker."
"My problem is not so much the Council as the policy that the future Commission President will follow."
"My group has appreciated the readiness with which Mr Barroso has submitted to this crossfire, this barrage of questions from Members who were not among his closest political friends. This capacity for dialogue is a real quality, but it does not of course hide the well-known differences there are between us over the essential directions of European integration."
"Economically and socially, Mr Barroso is a liberal."
"He has amply demonstrated that in the exercise of his national responsibilities."
"Even though the choices he made as Head of the Portuguese Government do not automatically mean he will take identical decisions in the European offices for which he is proposed, they clearly show where his preferences lie."
"They are revealing."
"I would have liked Mr Barroso to have told us about the lessons he has drawn from his national experience for his European mandate, if he receives it."
"The severe cuts in public expenditure, including on education, in Portugal, for example, or the uncompromising application to the hospital sector of management criteria commonly used in private enterprise. Some have described it as shock therapy."
"If it was a real shock to the population, I think the truth is that the therapy itself is more than debatable for the economy of a country that has undergone a severe recession and is suffering from a chronic lack of investment in human resources despite these being the key to modern development."
"What is your assessment of that experience, Mr Barroso?"
"Do you think that is the way forward, or should we close our ears to the liberal siren song?"
"Up until now, we have been less familiar with Mr Barroso’s big international policy options, apart from one far from minor one which projected him on to the world stage;"
"I am speaking of the famous Azores Summit of March 2003, of sad memory for us."
"I have already had occasion to emphasise what the question of war and peace meant for our group and I will not return to it."
"I will say in more general terms that in my opinion for all the major positions of responsibility within the Union we need men and women who are prepared to consider far-reaching challenges to the severe trends that are plunging Europe into crisis before our very eyes and making it helpless in the face of many of the world’s problems."
"We are not suffering from an excess of lucidity in this regard but rather from a cruel lack of critical intellect that means we do not have a vision for the future that is capable of motivating us."
"The world needs Europe, but a different Europe. We know that six million – yes, six million – people died of Aids, tuberculosis or malaria last year, that global warming is advancing much faster than the measures devised to contain it, not to mention that those measures are not being adhered to, that there are a billion people without jobs, that one human being in six has no access to drinking water, that war is brewing in the Middle East, continuing in Chechnya and bathing Darfur in blood; it is therefore our duty, at whatever level decisions are taken in Europe, to see further than the market and further, too, than mere Atlantic solidarity."
"That, I think, is the challenge Europe has to face today. We really are not up to it."
"That is why, if we refuse to put our confidence in Mr Barroso tomorrow, that will not be a vote against an individual, it will be the expression of a universal call for change."
"The results and the low turnout in the recent elections to the European Parliament demonstrated that there is enormous dissatisfaction with, and alienation from, the Community policies and moves towards integration enshrined in the European Constitution. No one wants to admit that a policy of indifference continues to be pursued in the face of the worsening economic and social situation, turning a blind eye to high levels of unemployment, poverty and social exclusion and an increase in social inequity, and a deaf ear to the protests of workers threatened by relocation and restructuring by multinationals."
"This requires a review of economic and monetary policies, a halt to liberalisation, and a review of the Stability Pact, failing which we cannot fight poverty and ensure social inclusion and a high quality of life for the entire population. This implies revisiting the Commission's mandate within the World Trade Organisation to defend fair trade, food sovereignty, European industry and jobs in particularly vulnerable areas, and in particular sensitive traditional sectors such as textiles, glass-making, the extractive industries and shipbuilding, which involves giving dignity to workers, adopting measures to promote equal rights and opportunities, and placing welfare, social progress, stronger democracy, cooperation and peace at the heart of decision-making on Community policies."
"The President was in fact right that Catalan, like Sorbian, a language spoken close to my Berlin constituency, is not an official language, neither an official language of the European Union nor a working language."
"We can however work on getting minority languages made official languages so long as we provide the necessary capacities."
"Mr Poettering would be willing to agree to my home city’s Berlin dialect as an official language."
"Thank you very much for that."
"First of all, I would like to say well done Portugal, congratulations on your football team."
"There is no doubt that your players were the best in Euro 2004."
"Nevertheless, they did not win."
"Unfortunately, at this point you are not the best player in the political game, but you are going to win."
"We know that the world is not fair."
"Dr Durão Barroso, just as in other speeches you have made to this House, your message today was one of fresh hope."
"In your address you managed to touch upon issues such as terrorism, environmental degradation, an ageing population, regional and social asymmetry, the problem of long-term unemployment, the alienation of the public from the European project and issues relating to the approval of the Constitutional Treaty and the Lisbon strategy. You also referred, by omission, to the feebleness of our Common Foreign and Security Policy, and were also wise enough to mention the serious problems we are going to have to confront as regards the diversity and complexity of a Europe of 25, and before long one of 27 or 28."
"It is against this background that it is essential to nurture the idea that it is possible, in the face of all these challenges, to achieve consensus, to establish dialogue and to build bridges, and to do so without dogmatism or prejudice, while making available to everyone, rich or poor, large or small, new or old, the option of helping us to define relevant parameters and objectives for Europe. I would quite simply say that we need a Delors-style Commission, a Commission with leadership and ambition, but also an effective Commission."
"Dr Durão Barroso, weak people do not go down in history – they never have done."
"I know your qualities, I know what you are capable of, and I know your determination, your common sense and your moderation."
"Combined with your youth and your love of parliamentary debate, I am convinced that your term of office will usher in a new era in Europe, and a new partnership between Parliament and the Commission that is vital if Europe is to move forward, to carry on building and to assert itself. I therefore have a question for you: I would like you to tell us in greater detail about your ideas for a relationship between a strong Commission and a European Parliament that we also wish to see becoming ever stronger."
"Do we trust him to play his part correctly as guardian of the Treaties amid the constant tension between Council, Parliament and Commission? I would like to say loud and clear that I trust the candidate and I am sure that a majority in this House will be able to place the same justified confidence in him."
"At the same time, I would like to point out, however, that the issue is also that this confidence must not be abused."
"Is the candidate capable of maintaining his independence when it comes to putting his team together?"
"I do not think it is acceptable that there are and were Member States who made their assent to you, Mr Barroso, conditional on having particular wishes granted in the allocation of Commission portfolios, but I am confident that you are independent enough for that not to happen automatically."
"You have said as much very clearly today."
"We are now entering a period where we will no longer be in a permanent Intergovernmental Conference but where we shall have to bring this European idea to life politically."
"Over the next few months, we will of course have to draw up the work programme together."
"In that connection, I hope that you and the European Parliament will cooperate closely and there, too, I am confident that you will make that cooperation a success, because we will have a lot of questions to answer together."
"Subsidiarity: how can we bring this concept to life, how can we ensure that rules are only created where Europe is really involved and that in all other cases the Member States, regions and local authorities can continue to act as they think fit?"
"There, too, I would ask you, when you are in office in the Commission, to give some thought to whether there are not proposals from the old Commission that deserve to be withdrawn. The policy on chemicals, for example."
"I might mention the Budget Regulation. We are suffering because we are no longer able to do what the legislator, Parliament and Council, decide in the budget because the Budget Regulation, the Commission, puts so many shackles on us in the administration that the legislator’s intentions can no longer be carried out."
"We are looking to you for initiatives here and I therefore hope that you will not abuse this trust, but that together we will be able to ensure that Europe makes progress in the next five years and will therefore in five years’ time, too, regain the citizens’ confidence."
"(1)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the statement by the President-designate of the Commission."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this legislative period, our Parliament has to take on a new role, one that is also prefigured in the draft of the constitutional treaty."
"It is generally said that this treaty will give the House new rights; on closer examination, it appears that this House gains a role for itself only when it can rely on an absolute majority of its Members in doing its job."
"That is particularly the case when it is engaged in making laws."
"Only if Parliament acts with an absolute majority does it play its part in the triangle of power formed by it, the Commission and the Council."
"Such, it is becoming apparent, is the constitutional reality in this House, and there are political conclusions to which we must come as a result."
"In the past, it was all too often the case that Parliament was ground down between the Council and the Commission, for lack of any solid majority, and because either the Council or the Commission could play Parliament off against the other."
"For that reason, we are convinced that we in this House must, from now on, make the effort to take up a position and also accept our responsibilities."
"That presupposes political cooperation in this House."
"Looking at the relative strengths of our political groups, it is inevitable that even the two big ones will have to consider whether they can cooperate with each other, and, if so, in which areas."
"The fact is that, numerically speaking, that is the only way in which a majority in this House will come into being, and that is why we are presented with the unaccustomed sight of parties that, in their domestic, indigenous, national reality are as a rule the complete natural antithesis of each other – Socialists on the one hand, Christian Democrats and Conservatives on the other – attempting in this House to work together from time to time, which, in many cases, evokes misgivings back home."
"Here, though, politically speaking, the natural order of things is different."
"I do not think we should allow the rules whereby we come to decisions to be subject to merely national considerations."
"We should possess sufficient self-confidence to make it clear that we have ways of coming to policy decisions that differ from the national, indigenous realities of our nation states."
"For that reason, we urge the need to attempt to establish solid majorities, for only then will Parliament, along with the Commission and the Council, be able to play a part in the triangle of power."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Barroso, as chairman of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I must say one thing to you today."
"For ourselves in the PSE Group, the vote we are to have in a few hours’ time is not a chance occurrence."
"It is not an impulsive act."
"It is the result of a carefully planned hearing in which, Mr Barroso, we put a list of very practical questions to you which are of absolutely crucial importance to social democratic populations throughout Europe."
"We did not spare you."
"We put some tough questions to you because we are serious about the issues on which we stood for election in the European Parliament elections in June."
"Mr Barroso, we have listened with great care to what you have said to us."
"We have taken note of your answers, and I have to say today that you have used the right words."
"You have said what we wanted to hear but, even though the right words about solidarity, progress and security are important, they are not enough."
"They must be accompanied by practical and specific political content and focused action and by programmes that are politically binding and that the people of each of the European countries can use in their day-to-day lives."
"Mr Barroso, we are concerned here with more and better jobs and with European cooperation that strengthens the social security that people feel is under threat. In an international context, we are concerned with cooperation that combines economic efficiency with social security and more jobs."
"It is not a case of first the one and then the other, but of both at the same time and in the same place."
"As Portuguese Prime Minister, Mr Barroso, you in practice pursued the opposite policy to that which is fundamental to us in the PSE Group."
"We would therefore ask you again today, Mr Barroso, if, firstly, you are going to commit yourself to reforming – and I emphasise the word ‘reforming’ – the Stability and Growth Pact so that we obtain more and better jobs."
"Secondly, will you today genuinely commit yourself to pursuing the objectives we set ourselves and decided upon four years ago in Lisbon concerning progress in employment, social security, education and equality between men and women?"
"Thirdly, will you genuinely ensure that European enlargement becomes a day-to-day reality for people?"
"Mr Barroso, we have the market."
"We do not have the policies."
"You have not so far provided us with clear answers."
"We are anxious to hear whether we are to be given them today."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, allow me firstly to congratulate you on your nomination to the post of future President of the European Commission, and allow me also to make a few comments on three points I believe to be important."
"Firstly, on the role of the Commission and the appointment of its President, secondly, on the common foreign and security policy and, thirdly, on diversity, subsidiarity and shared sovereignties in the European Union."
"Firstly, the role of the Commission and the appointment of its President."
"For the moment, you have been nominated by the Heads of Government, by the European Council, and it falls to this Parliament, to this House, to approve your nomination, which will finally be ratified, together with that of the other members of the Commission, by the Governments of the Member States."
"With the new Constitutional Treaty, which will enter into force during these five years of your coming term in office, and also that of this Parliament, this issue is going to change, and it will be the European Council which, taking account of the result of the elections, will propose to Parliament the candidate to be elected President of the Commission, who will then be elected by the European Parliament."
"I believe this to be a step forward, although I do not yet consider it to be a decisive step."
"I would like to ask you, Mr Barroso, whether you believe that, with the new Constitutional Treaty, the Commission is really going to become a genuine executive government for the Union; whether you believe that, when the citizens vote in the elections to the European Parliament, they are truly going to feel that their vote is decisive and that with it they are going to be electing a President who will govern the Union over the coming years."
"We have had an entirely negative experience, because turnout has been extremely low."
"I believe this is because the citizens have not felt that their vote would achieve this."
"Secondly, you hosted the meeting in the Azores which determined the invasion and war in Iraq."
"I would like to ask you whether, in your new post, if a similar situation arose, you would allow individual Member States of the European Union to take a similar decision without having first consulted the Council, without there previously being a common position amongst all the Member States of the European Union."
"And thirdly, with regard to diversity, this Constitutional Treaty talks about the powers of the European institutions and also of the state institutions."
"It talks about the Union's exclusive competences and about shared competences, but there is real diversity within the Union which has not been considered: the stateless nations and the constitutional regions, which have competences which the central governments of the States cannot decide upon."
"What do you intend to do during your mandate to genuinely integrate the Union's true cultural and institutional diversity into the European Union?"
"– Mr President-designate, you are aware that my group has decided not to support your candidature."
"We have misgivings that you will be the Council’s man, somehow put there by the Council to weaken the Commission."
"It will be up to you to show that we are wrong and, as we are open-minded, we shall be quite ready to admit that we were wrong."
"I should like to take the opportunity to underline three issues about which, if you are elected, we shall really keep bothering you."
"You said that being the Portuguese Prime Minister and the President of the Commission are two different things and, when you were the Portuguese Prime Minister, you said that if there should be a war between Saddam Hussein and the United States the choice clearly had to be the United States."
"I would ask the honourable Members to be seated and to allow the sitting to proceed normally."
"– Mr President, I am just coming to the point that justifies this demonstration, which for us is very important."
"I believe my fellow Members have the right to know – although I think most of them do already – why we chose to make ourselves visible like this to Mr Barroso."
"Right now in the Council there are nine governments that are in favour of authorising the entry of new genetically modified organisms (GMOs) into the European Union; nine are against and seven are abstaining."
"This means that the Council is unable to express a position."
"Eighty per cent of public opinion is against GMOs."
"The current Commission has nonetheless decided to use its powers and systematically authorise new GMOs, with incalculable consequences for the quality of our products and for European agriculture."
"Mr Barroso, we believe this is a very serious mistake."
"What is more, the current Environment Commissioner thinks it is unnecessary to label seed contaminated with less than 0.5% GMOs, thus contradicting the European Parliament’s position which was passed by a huge majority at the end of the last parliamentary term."
"Within a few years, then, all organic and non-organic crops will be contaminated."
"I am very well aware that you are not keen on this topic, and you told us this quite clearly during our meeting by hiding a little behind the notes that the Commission and its staff had prepared for you."
"Even so, if you are elected, we invite you really to look closely at this matter; we ask you to be brave and open-minded enough to change the current Commission’s attitude."
"We ask you not to bow to the multinational lobbies or our Big Brother in the United States, because it is our Big Brother who wants to call the shots on these issues."
"Mr President-designate, if I may I should like to return to the matter I was talking about before: the war in Iraq."
"I should like to ask you to give us some idea about the future in your reply."
"Unfortunately, when you came to see us, you did not succeed in getting beyond a complaint about your decision as Prime Minister of Portugal to support the war."
"I ask you, therefore, also regarding the relationship that the Commission should have with the United States, to tell us what political subject you, as President of the future Commission, have in mind for your relationship with the United States."
"At the moment, we as the European Union have our own independent position on a number of subjects and I should like to know how you intend to act on foreign policy, particularly on issues on which we hold distinct views, such as Guantánamo Bay, the WTO and Kyoto, because your replies have been rather vague and come more from the Portuguese Prime Minister than from the future President of the Commission."
"Ladies and gentlemen, no change can ever be brought about without constant and open consultation with the people affected by that change."
"Our absurd experiences in Central Europe of the exercise of power have been described both in Hašek’s novel ‘The Good Soldier Švejk’ and in Robert Musil’s ‘The Man Without Qualities’."
"It all began with the Habsburg monarchy, which was in some respects similar to the present-day European Union."
"During the peaceful seventy-year reign of Emperor Franz Joseph I, a committee was set up to search for a big idea for the monarchy."
"War broke out, the Emperor died, but the committee continued its work."
"It continued to search for a big idea whilst ignoring the views of entire nations."
"The situation has also changed for us."
"The old European Union has ceased to exist; the new European Union must be far more flexible, more cost-effective and more transparent to its citizens."
"I fear, however, that the Commission has up to now behaved and continues to behave exactly like the committee set up to glorify Emperor Franz Joseph I’s seventy-year reign of peace."
"Karel Čapek said of the modern era that the end has been replaced by the means."
"We are preoccupied by procedures and become involved in trifling matters, but the end goal escapes us."
"I should like to ask our President-designate a question."
"How will the new European Union differ from the old European Union?"
"What new forms of consultation with the public does the Commission intend to offer and, finally, Mr Barroso, what is your big idea for the new Europe?"
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like a different voice to be heard in this Chamber."
"Our Independence and Democracy Group in fact challenges the very principle behind this system, which is a carbon copy of that in use in states and involves appointing the President of the Commission as if he were a Head of Government."
"The adoption of this system boils down to the European institutions functioning in exactly the same way as states, as if it were our common vocation, by means of this procedure, to inch our way towards becoming a state."
"We call this system into question because we believe that the Commission cannot be anything other than a mere administrative college."
"We challenge the very principle underlying this appointment, along with the new Commission’s programme, in particular its twin objectives of Turkish entry into the European Union and the future adoption of the Constitution of a federal superstate."
"I would like to take this opportunity to say that there is a connection between Turkish accession and the future Constitution, which determines power and influence by reference to population size."
"For all these reasons relating to the system, the principle itself and the programme of the new Commission, our group will be voting against Mr Barroso’s appointment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a major enlargement of the European Union took place just a few months ago."
"For recent entrants to the Union, Mr Barroso’s term of office will be the first full term of a President of the European Commission."
"This is a momentous event."
"Mrs Muscardini, our group leader, has already stated that Mr Barroso can count on our full support."
"I would like to assure Mr Barroso that he can also count on the full support of my home party in Poland, the Truth and Justice Party."
"It is through that party that I find myself in this august assembly."
"The initial challenge facing Mr Barroso will be to ensure the consolidation of this new-look Europe of twenty-five Member States."
"That will be the first problem he must tackle."
"Of course, he will also need to ensure that the next group of candidate countries is ready for accession."
"Consequently, priority must be given to economic consolidation and to levelling out the differences between countries of the so-called Old Union and the New."
"Two crucial issues spring to mind in this connection."
"Firstly, free market principles must continue to be upheld."
"This means recent entrants to the Union should not be subjected to political or practical pressure to change their systems of taxation."
"That would be unacceptable, when the existing systems can create better conditions for their economies than the higher taxes levied in countries of the Old Union."
"The second economic issue arising is the budget."
"We cannot agree to cuts in the budget."
"This is because after allowing for standard budget expenditure, the funds remaining for aid to recent entrants would be inadequate."
"Yesterday I referred to the concerns expressed on the subject of the Constitution."
"Clearly, these represent a further challenge for the next President of the Commission."
"In conclusion, I shall simply remind the House of Montesquieu’s assertion that respect for local legislation and traditions is essential for the efficient operation of a centralised body."
"Let us say ‘yes’ to mutual support and ‘no’ to centralisation."
"– Mr President, on behalf of the independent Slovak members of the people’s party, the HZDS, I can assure Mr Barroso, that, as realists, we support his development plans, and particularly in science, research and education, a limiting factor, however, in the progress of the European Union is the rationalisation of the common agricultural policy, which is a highly challenging area in terms of budget."
"The current common agricultural policy and the reforms to it are, alas, common only in name, since, for example, the common agricultural policy gives support to the original Member States of the EU in the form of direct payments several times greater than the amounts given to the new Member States."
"As a result, up to a third of the market for food products in the new Member States is accounted for by products from the 15 original Member States, despite the fact that the new Member States were, until recently, net exporters of foodstuffs."
"This common agricultural policy, by promoting lower levels of activity and production, significantly worsens the prospects for all of us as regards remaining competitive vis-à-vis third countries."
"The new agricultural policy of the United States in particular is almost aggressively focused on development and expansion."
"At the same time, the US is already producing food at half the cost."
"After the next meeting of the WTO our position will be distinctly worse."
"We are therefore prepared, Mr Barroso, to support the kind of agricultural policy that, rather than provoking administrative battles within the European Union, will enable us to concentrate our efforts on growing competitively-priced food, our own common European Union food."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Polish group within the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats I would like to express our high esteem for you."
"The speech you made yesterday, as well as your address to our group, the European People’s Party, leave us in no doubt as to your ability to provide the strong leadership needed."
"From the perspective of the new Member States, you hail from a distant country."
"Indeed, your candidature fills us with expectation, because you come from a country that has undergone far-reaching structural changes, much like our own."
"Your candidacy does bring certain questions to mind, however, which I shall now put to you."
"In theory, enlargement has been successfully accomplished."
"In practice, reintegration is still not a reality."
"This seems to be the greatest challenge for your term of office, Mr Barroso."
"Europe was torn apart at Yalta."
"Will healing those wounds be a priority for your Presidency?"
"That is our first question."
"You have two major tasks before you, Mr Barroso."
"One is to uphold, nurture and develop European solidarity in its political and economic dimension."
"The other relates to the Eastern dimension, which is a new dimension for the European Union."
"This leads me to the next question."
"Do you intend to do all you can to persuade the Council to make adequate provision for the additional tasks of properly integrating the new Member States into the body of the Union through the allocation of funding in the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective?"
"The new Member States must be given the opportunity to make up for lost time."
"Social and economic cohesion policy needs to be fostered too."
"As you rightly pointed out yesterday, Mr Barroso, it is not possible to have more Europe for less money."
"This latest enlargement was done on the cheap."
"There can be no question of making further savings."
"Any cuts would deprive the poorest countries in the Union of the opportunity of catching up in terms of development, an opportunity that was enjoyed by Spain, Greece, Portugal, Ireland, southern Italy and the eastern German"
"Unfortunately, the amendment to the Constitution agreed at the European Union’s June Summit enables wealthier countries to block budgets they disagree with."
"Hence my next question to Mr Barroso."
"Will you retain the Prodi Commission’s proposal for 1.24% of GDP as a basis for calculating the budget?"
"We are also concerned that the principle of solidarity has been linked to proposals for harmonising corporate taxation across the Member States."
"We cannot agree to this if it means putting pressure on recipient states by threatening them with the loss of structural funds unless they raise their already high taxes."
"We call on you, Mr Barroso, to defend the fundamental principle of fiscal competitiveness between the Member States."
"We believe this would be the best way to keep faith with the Lisbon Strategy."
"I shall now turn to the second task, namely the Eastern dimension."
"We look to you, Mr Barroso, to ensure guidelines are consistently adhered to, and to defend the related financial neighbourhood instrument."
"The Union’s commitment must be conditional on beneficiaries respecting human rights and the principles of the rule of law."
"We hope for substantial developments in the Union’s Eastern policy."
"Nonetheless, such a policy has to be demanding, rather than permissive."
"After all, our aim is to change for the better the lives of millions of people in the Mediterranean Basin, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldavia and Russia."
"The Portuguese have long been renowned as great mariners."
"The European Union is now setting sail to the east."
"We trust you will have a firm hand on the wheel, Mr Barroso, as you steer the European Union’s course through those uncharted waters."
"Good luck."
"– Mr President, over the next five years, the European Union needs to strengthen its institutional and democratic functions."
"It needs to implement an efficient development policy which targets full employment and it needs to guarantee social rights and regional and social cohesion."
"It also needs to be able to speak to the world with one, strong voice as a force of peace and cooperation."
"Mr Barroso, you are the President-designate of the European Commission, but the policy which you exercised as prime minister and your statements yesterday before the European Parliament do not convince us that you can respond to these priorities."
"When you visited the Group of the Party of European Socialists yesterday, you told us that you are not a technocrat; you are a politician who makes political choices."
"We today are making a political judgment of the economic policy of your government, which led to a dramatic drop in development and social spending and to unfortunate economic results in your country."
"We are making a political judgment of your stand on the war in Iraq, your identification with the choices made by the United States and the famous meeting in the Azores."
"We are making a political judgment of your choice to support a war without a United Nations resolution, causing a schism within the European Union."
"We are also making a political judgment of the lack of self-criticism in your speech today, now that it has been clearly demonstrated that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq."
"The question that I should like to put to you, as President-designate, is this: how do you believe you will respond to these major priorities of the European Union through vague proclamations when your policy, all these years, has constantly served different perceptions?"
"We believe that the vote for the nomination of the President of the European Commission is a political vote; it is a vote which relates to the European priorities we are setting for coming years."
"That is why we are not persuaded by your political pronouncements and we are against your nomination."
"– Mr President-designate, my colleague Marco Pannella and I will support your appointment and we will do so primarily for institutional reasons."
"We believe that only a Commission with strong parliamentary support can perform its role, which must first of all, as the Treaties themselves state, be the result of a strong connection between Parliament and the Commission."
"This is a natural alliance for anyone who believes in the evolution of Europe’s institutions."
"Please allow me, however, to offer a comment and a recommendation for what I hope will be strong parliamentary support."
"First, you remarked on widespread Euro-apathy throughout Europe, as shown in the recent elections."
"In my view, this Euro-apathy is precisely the consequence – the other side of the coin – of the apathy of the European institutions and European leadership, starting with ourselves, starting with the fact that nearly all of us campaigned on national issues, starting with the fact that we ourselves, you yourselves, the leaders of Europe themselves very often give the impression of an introverted, frightened, often paralysed Europe, a Europe that prefers to deny problems rather than tackle them and accept the associated responsibility, risks and consequences."
"Without risks, leadership and responsibility, I wonder how we can have citizens who are passionate about Europe when, in the vast majority of cases, we are not passionate ourselves."
"Lastly, I put an important political request to you."
"You have obviously mentioned the need for an agenda for prosperity, stability, solidarity and a Europe that promotes peace and stability."
"I am quite sure that nobody would want an agenda for poverty, war, instability and so on. The problem, in effect, lies in the means."
"We Radicals are convinced that even prosperity, peace and stability make no sense and cannot be achieved without a strict, clear and coherent agenda to promote and support the rule of law, democracy, freedom, and civil and political rights, not only for the 400 million European citizens but also for the people of the whole world, starting with the world close to us."
"It is up to you and us together to express this deep-seated conviction that there is no development without freedom, there is no peace without freedom, and there is no stability without the rule of law."
"This is Europe’s identity."
"We are not a religious project or a geographical project, but we are a political project based on the rule of law."
"I believe this is what we should be promoting, with strength and leadership."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, having listened to Mr Barroso with a great deal of interest, both here and in his hearings before our group, that of the Greens and European Free Alliance, my opinion of him has not changed."
"I am still not satisfied, as you, Mr Barroso, have not responded to our questions concerning REACH, for example, which includes among our policies a bold policy on chemical products, or to our questions concerning comitology, a barbarity according political power to the Commission and not to the representatives of the people, namely ourselves."
"As you will have gathered, the Greens do not accept a system that involves electing Europe’s future head by pulling a name out of a hat at the last minute."
"Mr Barroso, much as I, of course, appreciate your willingness to take up the cudgels in the European cause, it really is stating the obvious to say that this House is largely pro-European."
"It is on the project that our opinions differ, and by your project I am not convinced."
"You headed the delegation representing the Council in Rio."
"I was there too, Mr Barroso, and I do not feel that, since then – and it was fourteen years ago – you have taken on board the facts that justify a radical change of course on development matters."
"I get the impression that you are not convinced that climate change calls into question our model of growth; that global warming will have indescribable consequences for Europe’s economy and the world’s; that the energy crisis risks dragging us into conflicts right up to our own – at present peaceable – borders, if petrol runs out, which the Hubert’s peak theory confirms that it will; or, finally, that there are immeasurably more victims of environmental disasters than there are of terrorism, unacceptable though that latter figure certainly is."
"It is the winner of our own Sakharov Prize, Mr Kofi Annan, who has highlighted these facts."
"By their lack of interest in the latest European elections, our fellow citizens have shown that the EU is not bringing to pass the European dream that we promise them."
"Your project is not equal to dealing with what is at stake for Europe and the world, or to making our fellow citizens’ European dream a reality."
"Which would you rather believe: a promise of independent relations with the United States or the fact that the candidate was photographed in the Azores with the leaders who decided to go to war?"
"The importance you attributed yesterday to social, environmental and cultural issues or your acknowledgement that when you were Prime Minister the important was never regarded as urgent?"
"Your praise for the Community method or the fact that governments including London, Bonn and Madrid have been giving precise voting instructions to their Members?"
"In two hours' time we shall see whether the electorate can be convinced that democracy is a system under which those who lose elections in their own country can win them in Strasbourg."
"We shall see what wins the day – fine words or having the courage to accept one's responsibility."
"Madam President, my party cannot support the candidature of the President for the institution because we do not support the institution over which he desires to preside."
"My constituents do not doubt the authority or the legitimacy of this democratically elected Parliament, but they do not wish to be governed by it."
"They want to be governed by their own people in their own parliament – and they will be during the lifetime of this Parliament."
"Believe me."
"For the same reasons we – and they – do not wish to see the Constitution enacted because they see it as based on obsolete economic and political theories of the 1950s, of the fear of war and an outdated threat of communism."
"They see it as creating a Europe that is inward-looking, that is bureaucratic, that is restrictive, whereas we should be creating a Community that is innovative and outward-looking, that reaches out to the rest of the world, that is flexible and democratic."
"That is not the institution that we are creating here in Europe today and we wish to have no part of it."
"We will not support it."
"My constituents do not want to see the creation of a federal state called Europe."
"They want to be governed by their own people in their own parliament."
"They do not wish to give their destiny, their independence and their sovereignty to a group in Brussels, or indeed in Strasbourg."
"Some 20 years ago Mrs Thatcher went to Fontainebleau and said: 'I want our money back' – and she got some of it."
"We want our country back and, believe you me, we are going to get it."
"You naturally have the right to use the time available to you as you wish."
"However, you well know, as we all do, that Irish is not a working language of the Union."
"Therefore our colleagues and Mr Barroso could not understand what you said, although it sounded very nice."
"You can work towards having Irish as a working language of the Union."
"We will see how successful you are, along with our colleague who spoke Catalan yesterday, or my German colleagues who speak Sorbian."
"Madam President, we made arrangements that Irish would be interpreted."
"It is a Treaty language and it should have that status."
"I am very disappointed that those arrangements were not made and that this is the attitude of this House or its services."
"I will speak English when I have to, to explain, but my own language comes first."
"I appreciate that, but at Council meetings the Irish Government will have to try to make Irish a working language, alongside English."
"It is not a working language at the moment."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as a non-attached MEP from a small Member State like Austria, one cannot avoid a feeling of total powerlessness when this House takes important decisions about who is to do what job, and of having absolutely no influence over them."
"It is well known that the election of the President of this House was organised beforehand behind closed doors, and the same is equally true of the election of the President of the Commission."
"I nevertheless want to ask the new President of the Commission, who is evidently already firmly established, as a matter of urgency, not to overlook the views of the broad majority of EU citizens on what will be one of the most important issues of his term of office, namely that of the accession of Turkey to the EU."
"In my own country, Austria, before the European elections on 13 June, people were more or less clearly promised that Turkey would not be joining the EU, as it was not a European country and was not ready for Europe."
"Negotiations with Ankara are now to be set in motion, and it is reported that you, Mr Barroso, have declared yourself to be in favour of Turkey’s accession."
"In Austria, at any rate, people feel they have been duped about this important issue; they sense that Turkey’s accession to the EU is yet another done deal, and that whether or not they are in favour of it is quite irrelevant."
"That being so, we in this House cannot be surprised that there is growing disenchantment with Europe in every corner of the EU, whilst you, Mr Barroso, speak in terms of a few people being sceptical about Europe and many being apathetic about it, which is much more dangerous."
"This Euro-apathy will become rejection of Europe if we go over the public’s heads in this way."
"Mr Barroso, I urge you, in future, to fight for a citizens’ Europe, to listen to public opinion, and that includes where Turkey is concerned."
"Madam President, in his speech yesterday, the chairman of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe compared the project of European integration to a pilotless aircraft."
"That reminded me of an anecdote from the chess player Bobby Fischer, who has recently been in the news as a result of his arrest in Japan."
"One day, the chess player’s teacher wished to teach the champion a lesson and, with a swipe of his hand, threw all the pieces from the chess board and said: ""Now, with the board empty, invent the great move""."
"Mr Barroso, to see the end before beginning and to see what cannot be seen, is an ability which, in politics, is not within everybody’s reach."
"Many of us in this Parliament hope that you have a political vision for the European project and that you can set the course for it."
"There were things that I liked in your speech yesterday, such as when you spoke of a strong, political and credible Commission which must be based on the great wealth of resources represented by the Commission’s officials, who must be motivated and enthused."
"In my opinion, this project must be carried out with the emphasis placed both on its internal dimension – the internal market and economic and monetary union – in line with the Lisbon process, and its external image, so that the Union may carry weight on the international stage in line with its economic, financial, commercial and industrial weight."
"Mr Barroso, the European Commission is rather more than the honest broker you referred to in your speech yesterday, or the ."
"Contrary to what has been said this morning in this House, the Commission is not an Aeropagus for stateless bureaucrats, but a key and fundamental institution to the project of European integration, the political driving force behind the project and the promulgator of its advances."
"I therefore very much agree, Mr Barroso, with your comment to the effect that the Commission must restore that positive collaboration with this Parliament and that harmonious partnership between Parliament and the Commission which has led to so much progress in the project of European integration."
"We therefore want a strong Commission, with a strong Parliament which controls it democratically, which invests it, which legitimises the project of European integration, which debates, which rejects, which ratifies and which rectifies."
"Mr Barroso, we hope that, on this occasion, a large majority of this Parliament ratifies the European Council's proposal – because you deserve it and your career bears this out – to appoint you as President of the European Commission."
"Madam President, President-designate Barroso, I note that Mr Barroso declared his support for the Lisbon Strategy."
"He stated that it is supported on three pillars economic, social, and environmental."
"I note too that Mr Barroso failed to mention the reasons why the Lisbon Strategy has not yet been satisfactorily implemented."
"A number of politicians and economists believe one of the main reasons for this failure is that implementation of the strategy requires unpopular political decisions to be taken."
"Are you prepared to take the necessary unpopular political decisions, Mr Barroso?"
"I would also like to ask how you intend to persuade the Member States to take such decisions."
"I hope you will provide a detailed response, as rather too many general statements have been made in the House today."
"Turning to a second issue, you said that one cannot have more Europe for less money, Mr Barroso."
"As a representative of Poland, I fully agree with you on this."
"Nonetheless, we are all aware that several Member States are strongly opposed to increasing the Union’s budget."
"Indeed, they actually advocate cutting it."
"I should like to enquire how you intend to act on your slogan ‘More Europe’, Mr Barroso."
"How do you plan to go about influencing those particular Member States and convincing them to agree to increase the Commission’s resources?"
"Only then will it be possible to make economic and social cohesion a reality, and bridge the income gap between old and new Member States."
"My third concern is the recent infringement of the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"This caused alarm in certain Member States."
"They felt others were infringing jointly agreed rules in order to promote their own interests."
"It also undermined confidence in the European institutions."
"I should like to ask you, Mr Barroso, whether you are prepared to insist on compliance with fiscal policy within the European Union."
"I should also like you to state which instruments you plan to use for that purpose."
"In particular, do you intend to modify the Stability and Growth Pact Mr Barroso, and if so, how?"
"Madam President, I wish to begin by expressing my pleasure at speaking for the first time in this Chamber as a Member of the expanded Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"I am extremely pleased at this development."
"Mr Barroso, I admit I was somewhat prejudiced before I heard you."
"You were appointed through a process of rather squalid intergovernmental bargaining, which was not very impressive."
"I was not keen on your enthusiasm for the Iraq war, which I regard as misguided and illegal."
"However, I have been favourably impressed by your presentational and communication skills and your clear attachment to a successful Europe and a strong European Commission."
"I am also impressed by your assertion that you intend not to be beholden to the Member States and in particular that you do not want super-Commissioners."
"I will therefore vote for you."
"However, I am wondering how consistent and truly reliable you will prove."
"For instance, you say you will strive for eight or nine women Commissioners, which, of course, I support."
"But what will you do if the UK insists on appointing Peter Mandelson, France Jacques Barrot, Germany Günter Verheugen, and Italy Mario Monti?"
"What will you do if the smaller countries say that, as you have failed to change the gender of these big boys, why should we carry out the sex-change operation?"
"Everyone wants gender balance in theory, but finds a pretext to fail to deliver it in practice."
"I wish you every ounce of conviction and determination on this issue, but I will watch with interest to see the outcome."
"I cannot quite marry your concern for women with what is happening in Portugal, where some women are being prosecuted for carrying out abortions."
"In a situation where the Bush administration has withdrawn funding for international organisations on women's reproductive health if they even include abortion advice in their functions, it is crucial that the new Commission carries on the work led by Poul Nielson of substituting EU funding for the American cuts."
"This means standing up to George Bush."
"I hope we can rely on you."
"Secondly, I worry that you will be all things to all people."
"You describe yourself as a centrist, a reformer and a Social Democrat, but you belong to the conservative group."
"You somewhat remind me of your mate Tony Blair."
"I am not sure in what political direction you are really heading."
"Pragmatism has its virtues, but we need to know the hard political choices that you will make when the chips are down and the principles that you will not compromise on."
"Lastly, I hope we can rely on you in the field of civil liberties and human rights."
"Your compatriot, Mr Vitorino, did a great job and, on the whole, struck the right balance between freedom and security."
"However, there are ever-increasing pressures to sacrifice personal freedom to the quest for security, to compromise our humanitarian obligations to refugees and to fail to integrate legal immigrants."
"The European Union failed to take a united stand on Guantánamo Bay."
"I hope we can rely on you to prioritise civil liberties and human rights in the future."
"– Madam President, the reasons why we shall be voting against the candidature of Mr Barroso are very simple."
"We find ourselves in a rather paradoxical situation."
"We have just had elections in which practically all the governments were defeated, not because the citizens did not understand or were not informed, but because there was mass protest at decisions such as those on the war, some of which Europe made itself and some of which it did not oppose."
"What we have here is a protest at liberalist policies, deep social malaise and a social, economic and environmental crisis, all due to the failure of these liberalist policies, starting with the Stability Pact and the privatisations."
"A certain approach to European integration is in crisis, and rhetoric is not enough to resolve this crisis."
"In view of this, there is swing to the right, to conservatism, and an attempt to propose a philosophy of compromise in the name of so-called governability, which means taking a position between bureaucracy and governments without facing up to the problems."
"We, however, take the opposite view, that Europe needs a change inspired by the movements demanding rejection of the war, social policies, democracy and citizenship through residence."
"Frankly, these are all things that Mr Barroso does not represent."
"Madam President, our group’s Dutch sub-group is contemplating backing Mr Barroso’s candidature despite our constitutional reservations."
"The reason for this is that he, during his visit to our group, underlined a number of our policy priorities."
"Like us, Mr Barroso values good solid relations with the United States."
"During this time of global threat and terror, close cooperation with Washington is preferable by far to a European policy that aims to compete with the United States."
"We are also pleased with the attention Mr Barroso gives to the family as the cornerstone of society and his striving towards solid financial economic policy within the Union."
"With the near future in mind, we would like to commend two important matters to Mr Barroso’s attention."
"First of all, we would ask the European Commission to take an objective approach to Turkey’s possible accession, which is a politically sensitive issue."
"This autumn’s progress report should therefore be based on the factual situation in Turkey, and not on the positive attitude of a few Heads of State and Government in the Council."
"Secondly, we would ask Mr Barroso’s attention for the Palestinian Authority’s serious loss of authority."
"We expect from him, and from the Commission, as much support as possible for the urgent reform of this Palestinian Authority, which is a necessary stepping stone if we are to have the prospect of a real peace process in the Middle East."
"(Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Barroso, whilst listening to you, I was pleased that you referred to the significance of the justice and security package."
"Therefore I should like to address current issues related to European security."
"Mr Barroso, you will have to give due consideration to the fact that the European security policy has, unfortunately, been too slow in meeting its objectives."
"Europe's real military and crisis management capabilities are still insufficient."
"It is important that you realise this."
"There is no need to convince you that twenty-first century asymmetric and transnational threats are not just illusions, but a reality."
"Despite what we may hear here about the coalition forces involved in operations in Iraq, one must remember that until such time as Europe's military capabilities and security instruments have reached the necessary level of effectiveness, it is important to maintain the existing EuroAtlantic link, by improving Europe's cooperation with NATO."
"Countries still need to be encouraged to allocate adequate resources for European security needs."
"An effective exchange of information and trust among countries must be ensured, which would guarantee timely European counter-terrorism operations."
"Thank you for your attention."
"I wish you every success."
"– Mr President-designate, ladies and gentlemen, I represent men and women in our continent who hope for a political Europe that is free and independent of the geopolitical and geoeconomic interests of the United States today and of anyone else tomorrow."
"We hope for protection for our markets and the products of our agricultural, industrial and service sectors, which are threatened both by imports from outside Europe and by relocation. This is the result of financial and economic globalisation, against which few have so far raised the arguments of sovereignty and identity, first for our nations and then for Europe itself."
"We hope that demographic and family policies will be developed within a broad framework of social protection."
"We hope that policies that threaten job security and thus the individual’s livelihood will be scrapped."
"In order to have a strong, credible and independent Commission which can, as you have stated, interpret the needs and expectations of what has to be a social and cultural Europe, it is necessary to work towards everything I have mentioned and thus aim at introducing economic policies that revise the Stability Pact."
"That does not come across in what you have already announced, in your actions or in your intentions."
"We shall vote against your Presidency because the policies you pursue and represent have already shown themselves to be Atlanticist and hyperliberalist."
"On a number of occasions you have publicly supported US policies and have come out in favour of a further transfer of powers from the Member States to the Union, a Union that will centralise and manage the future of the peoples of Europe without regard for traditions or identities."
"Moreover, you are in favour of enlargement to include countries like Turkey that have nothing to do with our culture or history."
"We shall therefore vote against this Presidency, which represents policies favouring the interests of the banks, global finance and countries whose interests and policies are at odds with those of the nations of Europe."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome Mr Barroso as a dynamic representative of the Europe which we all envision for the twenty-first century, of a Europe whose main objective will be to meet the expectations of the people, by bringing different countries together in a common ambitious future, in which there must be smooth cooperation between the twenty-five countries today and, later, between more members following their integration into the European Union."
"We welcome his assurance that the confidence of European citizens in Europe and how it operates will need to be strengthened."
"The objective of us all must be for Europe not to be an abstract concept, but to be experienced by the citizens and to express them."
"Following enlargement, the primary objective of the European Union is to ratify the Constitutional Treaty, which will confirm the agreement of the people to a Europe in federal form, and to create the preconditions for it to make fast strides towards a single foreign policy and security policy."
"In this new era, European citizens are demanding support for diversity and, at the same time, participation in an even more democratic future, which needs to provide a feeling of security and prosperity."
"It is our common conviction that democracy is strengthened through criticism and I am certain that Mr Barroso will, with our support, accept this position also."
"The Lisbon process includes both development and the strengthening of knowledge and technology, together with social cohesion, environmental sustainability and strengthening Europe by creating employment conditions and equal opportunities."
"We shall monitor exactly how these will be adhered to."
"We shall also monitor the emphasis which we are certain will be placed on dialogue between cultures."
"We believe that Mr Barroso will, of course, be the leader of the European Commission."
"However, his familiarity with issues relating to southern Europe doubtless gives him an awareness of the problems which these countries experience."
"We shall contribute towards creative relations between Parliament and the President of the Commission, so as to safeguard constructive cooperation the two institutions."
"I am also convinced of Mr Barroso's capabilities and of his awareness of the huge responsibility which he is undertaking."
"That is why I wish him every success."
"Madam President, Mr Barroso, I have just come from the Swedish Parliament where, in the last ten years, every other politician has been a woman."
"Here in Parliament, there are all too few women, less than a third."
"The Commission and other EU institutions have so far had far too few women."
"Half of the electorate are women who, in many cases, are also doubtful as to what the EU can offer them."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists here in Parliament always looks nowadays at the proportion of women."
"I turn now to my question."
"If you are elected, Mr Barroso, how many women will there be in the Commission?"
"What policy on gender equality will you pursue?"
"Will women be included in the partnership you talked about?"
"In one speech, you talked about having ‘more women in the Commission’."
"That is much too vague and woolly."
"How many women do you aim to have in the Commission?"
"– Madam President, Mr Barroso, as a left-wing MEP, I shall vote against you, because I want a Europe which does not act as Mr Bush's delivery boy, as you did in the Azores, because I am against your neo-liberal policy in Portugal and, furthermore, because I refuse to allow the European Parliament to simply ratify the orders of the summit."
"As a Greek MEP, I should like to thank you for hosting the recent football championship in Portugal, congratulate you on the dignity with which you accepted the outcome of the final match between Greece and Portugal and wish you the same dignity in coping with the European Parliament's votes against action by the European Commission."
"As a left-wing Greek MEP, I should like to invite you to the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Athens."
"My group is organising a meeting for people with disabilities on the 24 September."
"We shall expect you there so that you can tell us what you intend to do and if you will be applying a Community directive."
"You will be perfectly safe, because thousands of cameras will be watching you, as will ΝΑΤΟ."
"Mr Barroso, we are voting against you and we shall be waiting for you in Athens."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-designate of the Commission, Dr Durão Barroso, I wish you good luck."
"A success for you will be a success for Europe and we need and want every success for the Europe to which we belong."
"Graham Watson put it very well yesterday when he used an aviation metaphor and said that when we look into the cockpit we do not want to see that there is no pilot, or that the pilot is confused, weak or disoriented."
"We are looking to you, we have heard you request this House's endorsement and we have every confidence that this pilot will have a firm hand on the controls."
"You told us that you want an independent Commission."
"That is the kind of partner this Parliament needs."
"You told us that you want a Europe based on solidarity."
"Those of us who subscribe to the European project know that is a sine qua non."
"There is no future for the European project if we cannot strengthen its identity as a common project, without emphasising the sense of ownership and without a clear and effective policy of economic and social cohesion."
"You told us that you want a Europe that is more than an internal market, one that is a Europe of citizens."
"That is the same Europe that we want to help to build, a Europe that is not limited to its economic dimension, but a Europe of citizens – a people's Europe."
"We appreciated what you said in your address yesterday about unemployment and job creation, about combating inequality and about security."
"I know you and can bear witness to your humanist approach and to your support for the values of the rule of law, but it is important to emphasise that we live in uncertain times, in times when there are quite rightly calls for increased security."
"Nevertheless, we must avoid exaggeration or fanaticism when it comes to security."
"Yes, we want greater security, but we cannot accept that it should suffocate freedom."
"When security stops being an instrument for defending and maintaining our freedom, it turns into tyranny."
"When it comes to implementing SIS II – the second generation of the Schengen Information System – as regards border controls and in the areas of asylum and migration, but also as regards judicial and police cooperation, a great deal still remains to be done despite the enormous progress made over the last five years in creating an area of freedom, security and justice."
"Mr President-designate, I was pleased to hear you calling for a close positive relationship with this House."
"The history of our Community records that progress was always made when this relationship was at its most focused."
"It is a fact that in the history of Portuguese democracy you have been the Prime Minister who has made the most important contribution to parliamentary debate."
"I would also like to see you become the President of the Commission closest to the European Parliament, Europe's democratic assembly, in the history of our institutions."
"Let me say one last word about the recent elections: the increasingly low turnout is a symptom of a distance between the public in general and the European project, a distance that we must fight."
"There is also a great deal to be done in this respect in terms of combining the forces of the Commission and Parliament."
"There is an urgent need to change the way we communicate, inform and educate."
"I was pleased to hear you saying yesterday that Portugal may be on the edge of Europe geographically speaking, but that it is nevertheless at the heart of Europe."
"It will therefore be for us to ensure that our citizens take Europe and this common project to heart."
"– Mr President-designate, I should like to put two issues to you, to which I would be grateful for a reply, or a less vague reply at least."
"The first concerns information."
"As you know, the Constitutional Treaty, which is to be signed in Rome on 29 October, clearly states the value of pluralism of information."
"In addition, on 22 April this year, the European Parliament adopted an important resolution on the risks of violating freedom of expression and information in the European Union."
"Paragraph 77 of this resolution calls on the Commission to submit a proposal for a directive to safeguard pluralism and the media in Europe, and paragraph 78 invites the Commission to submit proposals to ensure that members of national governments cannot use their own holdings in broadcasting companies for political ends."
"I would be very grateful if, in your reply, you could specify first of all whether you agree with the content of this resolution and, if you do, how soon you intend to make a start on the measures requested by this Parliament."
"The second issue concerns Iraq, a country that I have known well since the Gulf War in 1991."
"I would like to point out that the split in Europe over the Iraqi question was a serious weakness for the supporters of multilateralism and peace, two words that you used in your speech yesterday."
"I believe great energy and determination are needed once more from all the European institutions so that this weakness can be overcome as quickly as possible."
"Since this matter was not dealt with clearly enough in your address, I should like you to explain what concrete initiatives you intend to adopt in order to achieve a common European position in favour of peace and to ensure that Europe plays an important role and maintains an active presence in the process of reconstructing civil society and democracy in Iraq."
"I came back from Iraq two weeks ago and I can tell you that the Iraqis have just one message to give: we want Europe more and we do not want to be left alone just with the Americans."
"Madam President, firstly, I should like to wish Mr Barroso good luck in the forthcoming vote and with the work on creating an agenda for the reform of Europe."
"I believe it may be said that we now have a better Europe than ever, thanks to the European Union."
"That development towards freedom, democracy and states governed by the rule of law that we have been able to see in so many countries in recent decades could not have happened without the European Union."
"I think it important to say that today, because there are many who have maintained the opposite when it comes to Europe’s ability to contribute to freedom and peace."
"The challenge now is also to make the European Union better."
"It is about creating a momentum for competition and growth and creating a clear political will."
"One of the first and most important tasks for the President of the Commission is to ensure that no one experiences the economic growth in the new Member States as a threat to the old Member States."
"On the contrary, the development of the former is an asset for us all and will help bring vitality to the European economy."
"This emphasises both the need for, and the possibility of, an agenda of reform in which, I believe, the President of the Commission, together with other political leaders, must be courageous enough to dare to confront the political, economic and structural problems we have in Europe."
"The task is not to prevent change through regulations but to create an openness to the new that will give us new strength and new ideas in Europe."
"In that respect, it is important for the Lisbon process to enter a new phase because, not having led to the required changes, it has not worked."
"Both the Member States and the European Union must now do something that will take Europe forwards."
"I want to address another matter: that of the Middle East and the European Union’s foreign policy."
"If the EU cannot contribute to freedom and democracy in the dictatorships of the Arab world, then we are also undermining the chances for freedom and peace of both Palestinians and Israelis."
"The Palestinian Authority’s collapse into terrorism, lawlessness and corruption, which we have been able to follow in recent days, is an expression of the fact that the surrounding world has not been sufficiently vocal in asserting the Palestinian people’s right to representatives who respect the rules of democracy and of societies based on law, – rules relating, for example, to the lives and worth of other people."
"This must be an important task for the European Union."
"Finally, I want to state that we are today seeing genocide taking place in the Darfur region of Sudan."
"A crucial test for the European Union will be that of creating sufficient political capability and will to do something about this."
"Too many times have we said that such things must not happen again."
"Now, they are, in fact, happening again."
"Let us now make sure we acquire the power to arrest this trend."
"– Mr Barroso, you have not convinced us."
"On Iraq, for example, you say that you want to turn the page and look to the future."
"That is easy to say; in that case, why have you not withdrawn your troops from Iraq?"
"Why is it that we do not, today, have a clear plan put forward by you?"
"We know perfectly well that it was your commitment to this war and your close links across the Atlantic that gave you the edge over other centrist candidates such as Mr Verhofstadt, for example."
"How are you going to change your image?"
"Mr Poettering supported you by telling us, yesterday: ‘Mr Barroso does not change; he was the same when he was leader of the opposition, the same when he was a minister’."
"So, no doubt, you will not change if you become President of the Commission, and that is what frightens us."
"You are a clever man who can rise to an occasion, but you are not –unfortunately – a man of convictions, although it is convictions, along with actions, that are needed if the citizens of Europe are to regain trust in Europe and in its institutions."
"Today, your actions do not speak in your favour."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Barroso, allow me to highlight three matters: respect for national cultural treasures, gender equality and the fight against poverty."
"I am absolutely delighted that you have pointed out the importance of the multifaceted and rich national, regional, cultural, linguistic and political traditions of the Member States."
"The democratic structure of the new Europe requires the trust of its citizens and respect for the principle of subsidiarity."
"We all know that the citizens of the Member States currently view with apprehension the European project as a process of centralisation being driven by the Community institutions."
"I call upon you, Mr President-designate, to work for the decentralisation of these institutions."
"A declaration of the Slovak parliament, adopted as early as January 2002, emphasises in this respect the sovereignty of the Member States of the European Union in cultural and ethical matters."
"One thing that has so far failed to become established in the European structure is gender equality."
"I note with pride that women are performing important jobs in a responsible manner and are bringing to life an inter-generational network of solidarity."
"When women are fully able to utilise their abilities, they will be able to influence in a positive way both the organisation and the understanding of a society of all citizens."
"Women give priority to the basic values of the actual human being – truth, justice, love and freedom."
"They must be encouraged to promote these irreplaceable values in their family and professional lives."
"I should also mention the role of women in childcare, in looking after people with disabilities and the elderly, and women refugees, who, despite their own suffering and problems in hopeless situations, get involved in helping people who are suffering even more than they are."
"Protecting women from every new form of poverty is an essential condition for the real accomplishment of gender equality."
"Mr Barroso, even though you did not mention it in your address, you are surely aware of the importance of the fight against poverty, which is a key problem for the Member States."
"Poverty is a violation of human rights and destroys families."
"I call upon you to take part actively in celebrating the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty on 17 October."
"The slogan of this international day, “Where people are condemned to live in poverty, human rights are violated”, has often been quoted in the European Parliament."
"So joining forces in order to ensure that these rights are respected is our sacred duty."
"Mr President-designate, you have proposed a positive alliance between the Commission and Parliament, so please come and meet those Members who are members of the “Comité Quart Monde Européen”, the oldest cross-party group in the European Parliament and one which has given voice to the hopes of the poorest families in Europe since 1979."
"Mr Barroso, on behalf of the Members from the Slovak Republic I wish you every success in your work at the head of the European Commission."
"Thank you."
"Mr Barroso, our group chairman, Mr Schulz, stated here yesterday that we have asked a few questions in the group, that we have received a response from you to some, but that a whole host of questions remain unanswered."
"One of those questions is certainly that in connection with the Stability and Growth Pact."
"What do you intend to do to achieve more growth in Europe?"
"We are lagging behind in terms of growth, and if there is no growth, then there are also insufficient jobs."
"We do, of course, have the Stability Pact, which is an important instrument for the Union’s economic policy, but this Stability Pact should also become a real growth pact, and must be complemented by one."
"It is not simply by telling us that you will interpret this Stability Pact with the future in mind that we can develop towards a real growth pact."
"Are you thus prepared, in the assessment of the Member States’ expenditure, to give specific consideration to expenses in the areas of growth and employment promotion ?"
"– Madam President, Mr President-designate of the Commission, it was a joy to listen to your inaugural speech: we could hardly have found a more expert and competent candidate."
"Mrs De Keyser observed that you are a skilful exploiter of situations."
"That is just the sort of President of the Commission we need: someone who can take advantage of any situation and exploit windows of opportunity when they are open."
"We need an independent, autonomous and dynamic President of the Commission."
"I believe that you are just that person."
"I am pleased that you come from a small Member State."
"I would like to reassure my fellow Members that in Mr Barroso we will have a strong President of the Commission, someone who will also be capable of listening to Parliament."
"There has already been evidence of that, during last week’s hearings, when you assured us that you would be a President for all Europeans."
"It is important that the result of the European elections is reflected in the choice of President of the Commission, just as we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have called for."
"Ours are not just empty words: we talk openly about our aims, and we realise them, as we have now also done in this case."
"I am convinced that the Council’s unanimously chosen candidate has excellent potential for playing a strong role as President of the Commission."
"The independently-made choices of Commissioners are a good start in that respect."
"I also believe that during your term of office you will develop transatlantic relations further, which are so important for us Europeans."
"Another of Europe’s major challenges is the speedy ratification of the Constitutional Treaty in the Member States."
"This must be the joint top priority for all of us Europeans who love Europe and our own countries."
"We must increase our competitiveness, in order to increase employment and improve the economic situation."
"Without that, we cannot ensure a prosperous and secure Europe for all its citizens."
"A viable and effective Internal Market plays a key part in this."
"Since 1993, thanks to the liberalisation of the Internal Market, we have created more than 2.5 million jobs and more than EUR 800 billion in extra reserves for the people of Europe."
"There is no alternative to the liberalisation of the Internal Market."
"For example, the Financial Services Action Plan has created a European financial internal market, which will boost the efficiency of the market and create more growth."
"There has been much talk about a citizens’ Europe, and that is certainly something worth aspiring to."
"How might we achieve that?"
"The credibility of Europe depends on how its citizens feel about the activities of the Union."
"Let us make decisions at European level only in those matters where decisions at European level have clear added value for European citizens."
"Our citizens now appreciate the single European currency and the notion of freedom of movement, both of which provide justification for the whole Union."
"In future, we could even operate on a principle of less regulation and more effort in the implementation and monitoring of action."
"The Commission, which controls this implementation, can of course help the Member States in distinguishing the wood from the trees."
"The Commission needs to use its increased personnel resources to improve the implementation process and bring the recalcitrant Member States into line."
"We have faith in you, President of the Commission."
"– Madam President, Mr President-designate of the Commission, the policies you have pursued in Portugal have startled many of us."
"There are various reasons for that; from the Iraq war to the collapse of the social security system."
"Now, however, you have stated here that you are committed to a very different kind of policy, and it is as a result of this that there is a credibility problem."
"We want a social Europe, otherwise the people will not trust us or follow us."
"Do you want to compete with the United States of America and China, using the methods that operate there, with America using its competitiveness for weapons, sometimes even for wars, and often forgetting its poor, and with China’s competitiveness partly relying on human rights violations?"
"Mr Barroso, my question to you today is: do you wish to dissociate yourself from such methods, and base your approach on a European social market economy, which is our aim and purpose?"
"Our problem in the next vote will be whether credibility can be preserved."
"If you create a new Europe employing a different sort of policy from that pursued in your country, then you might succeed, but if not, then we will often come into conflict with each other here."
"Mr President, analysis of Mr Barroso's suitability has focused on three particular issues."
"The main criticisms levelled against you, Mr Barroso, relate to your attitude to the war in Iraq, the fact that you are a compromise candidate and, as far as your policies are concerned, references to your being on the right although you say that you are in the centre."
"You are being put through this procedure as though you are presumed guilty, not innocent."
"There is a lot of prejudice over the policies you put forward in Portugal and because of your political convictions."
"If we have to vote for a President, we have to vote on certain principles."
"We would like to see four things: respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law; the ability to make Europe a global player while at the same time respecting the different identities of the nations; the ability to create wealth; and the ability to distribute this wealth socially."
"We have to decide on the basis of these points whether or not you are the right candidate."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, in my one-minute contribution, I should like to concentrate on just one aspect, namely social cohesion in the enlarged Europe."
"The elections for the European Parliament in the new Member States and the decidedly low turnout indicated that considerable scepticism prevails in that part of Europe towards the European Union, and often indeed towards the European concept itself."
"This scepticism is born of a certain feeling of inequality, a feeling of second-class membership, which is seen in the long transitional periods towards the free movement of people and agricultural subsidies."
"Mr Barroso, I should like to hear you give a clear reassurance that, when you become President of the European Commission, you will advocate the principle of equal treatment between old and new Member States and you will fight for the gradual removal of all inequalities, including social inequalities, in the enlarged Europe."
"– Mr President, Mr Barroso, I would like to make an appeal to you and as I am the last speaker, I hope that you will remember it."
"On 1 May this year, ten new Member States joined the European Union."
"Our people voted for Europe in the referenda first and foremost because they want security and a better life within a common European framework."
"They expect us to use our collective powers to do away with inequalities in development inherited from the past."
"These differences, both economic and social, are manifest."
"Just look at the problem of unemployment and social exclusion."
"Differences in the rate of development cannot, of course, be eliminated overnight."
"However, they could be resolved with your firm determination to maintain an active policy of solidarity and social commitment."
"If you get support for your Commission today, I expect it to give priority to this task."
"The issue of new and better jobs is fundamental for the whole of Europe and particularly for the new Member States."
"Rest assured that you will have my support for any measure that goes in this direction."
"However, if you are indifferent to this problem which concerns a significant section of the European Union, you will not be able to count on my support."
"All the same, I wish you every success if you are elected."
"I would like to thank you for all the questions you have put to me and I shall try to answer all of them, and I in fact answered some of them yesterday."
"I would firstly like to address the honourable Members from Greece, who played a very active part in the debate."
"In a spirit of fair play, I wish to congratulate them on their victory in the European Football Championship hosted by Portugal."
"I know that organising a championship on that scale is a major task, and I would therefore like to wish our Greek friends every success in hosting the forthcoming Olympic Games."
"I would like to assure those who will not be voting for me that I shall display the same sense of fair play that I have shown about Greece's victory in Euro 2004."
"Turning to your specific questions, I have arranged my replies in clusters, something I am very much in favour of in such cases."
"First then, international issues, on which I shall reply in particular to the questions by Mr Watson, Mrs De Sarnez, Mr Schultz, Mr Ortuondo Larrea and Mr Kristovskis about a strong European presence on the world stage."
"I am in favour of Europe continuing to take the lead on environmental issues, especially climate change issues relating to Kyoto."
"I am in favour of Europe continuing to be in the vanguard on free and fair trade in the context of the Doha negotiations and of Europe promoting a multilateral approach both to political issues and to trade issues."
"I am in favour of Europe playing an active part in development, and in particular combating world poverty."
"Africa is, of course, a priority here."
"But we must also fight epidemics like AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis."
"I believe that in this area Europe has a social duty that it cannot abdicate."
"That is also why we need resources in the new Financial Perspectives to match our ambitions, and we must also endeavour to meet our commitments in relation to the United Nations Millennium Declaration, together with our Monterrey commitments on development aid."
"Turning more specifically to foreign policy, and to security and defence policy, I wish to respond to a number of questions, in particular those from Mr Pinheiro and Mr Wiersma, by saying that I believe that we should develop a European defence identity."
"The new Constitution – the new Constitutional Treaty – will help us to consolidate that security and defence identity."
"I also believe that we can work with the High Representative, the future Minister for Foreign Affairs of the European Union."
"As a matter of fact, I am already preparing this work with Javier Solana, because I believe that there is work to be done here."
"I would now like to move on to the question of Iraq, which I also addressed yesterday, but where I have something to add."
"The fact is that Iraq demonstrated that there is not yet a common European policy."
"It was not my country that caused the breakdown in European unity."
"Various EU Member States, including some that are members of the United Nations Security Council, adopted differing positions."
"That is the reality."
"It is not the Commission that has to define the foreign policy of the European Union."
"Under the current system that is still an intergovernmental matter."
"What I can tell you is that as President of the Commission, I shall try to work, particularly with the new EU Minister for Foreign Affairs provided for in the new treaty, towards progressively achieving a coherent EU policy and ensuring that the European Union speaks with a single voice."
"At present, the truth of the matter is that Iraq has demonstrated that this is not the case yet, and that is why I do not think it is helpful today to discuss who was in the right here."
"We now need to find ways of bringing our positions closer together, and the most recent resolution unanimously approved by the UN Security Council provides some of the ingredients for such a convergence of views."
"It is in our interest to work together on Iraq, and to attempt to reach a common vision, particularly on stabilising Iraq and the surrounding region, a vision of an independent and sovereign Iraq, an Iraq at peace with itself and with its neighbours."
"I shall accordingly try to respond to the questions put to me by Mr Wurtz, Mr Swoboda, Mr António Costa, Mrs Napoletano, Mr Wiersma, Mrs Frassoni, Mrs Gruber, Mr Paasilina, and all the others, by saying that in future, as President of the Commission – if I receive your endorsement – I shall attempt, as far as I possibly can, and working together with the Member States, to ensure that there is a common vision, something of which there has not been any sign amongst the Member States nor even, if we are honest, within our respective political families."
"This has been a painful issue and one that we need to move on from now."
"But as regards Iraq, and also our relations with the United States in particular, I wish to repeat what I said yesterday."
"I am very proud to be a European."
"If you confirm me as President of the Commission, it will fall to me to defend Europe's general interests and common good, and not country A or country B's foreign policy stance."
"I will not be bound by the foreign policy of one government or another, but I shall be engaged in seeking a common foreign policy for the European Union as a whole."
"As regards relations with the United States, a question raised by various honourable Members, including Mr Swoboda, Mrs Mussolini, Mr Schultz and Mr Evans, I believe that it is important that the European Union should not define itself in terms of its opposition to any given country or region."
"We have our own identity."
"We do not need to define ourselves as being in opposition to the United States, to China, to Russia or to any other global power."
"I believe that it is in our interest to ensure that the United States is constructively engaged in major global issues such as the environment, the battle against underdevelopment and the major epidemics."
"That is what I shall try to achieve if I am elected President of the Commission."
"Another issue mentioned here was Turkey, one of the most difficult issues we face."
"Mrs Grossetête, Mrs De Sarnez, Mr Martinez, Mr Mulder and Mr Belder in particular referred to Turkey."
"This will be a key decision for the European Union."
"Before any decision is taken in December, both the Commission and the Council should listen to Parliament's opinion on this issue."
"It is not possible for me at this stage to assume or presume what the final outcome of this process will be."
"Nor do I know yet what the Commission's position will be on the report still being prepared by the Prodi Commission, but I can tell you that I agree with you when you say that this is an important issue for debate, and that any decision that may be taken must be made known in the clearest terms to everyone, starting with the Members of this House."
"Nor is this a decision that can be made on religious grounds: referring to the comments made by certain honourable Members, I would say that it is my conviction that our Union, our Community, is based on law and on human rights; it can never be a Union based on any form of religious bias."
"That is vital as far as I am concerned."
"I also wish to say, regardless of the Turkish issue, that we need to have a special policy towards our neighbours, that is to say our neighbours to the east, in the Balkans and in the Mediterranean region."
"That is why I spoke about this as being a priority yesterday."
"It is my belief that the European Union's foreign policy cannot do everything at the same time – not everything can be a priority."
"If you simultaneously treat everything as a priority, then you end up with nothing being a priority."
"What we need is a constructive policy in order to spread prosperity and stability to our immediate neighbours, to the east, in the Balkans and in the Mediterranean region, in addition to our active contribution through multilateral world organisations, and above all through the United Nations."
"We must therefore strengthen our relations with our immediate neighbours, because our own security and stability also depend to a large extent on our doing so."
"Turning to the institutional issues you addressed, and in particular the process of my own nomination, that question was raised by Mr Schultz, Mr Swoboda, Mr Martin, Mr Cohn-Bendit, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, and also by Mr Dehaene."
"I understand the reservations that exist about the present method for choosing the President of the Commission, but the Treaties have been complied with."
"In any case, in order to demonstrate my own concerns about this, I made myself available to appear before all the political groups in the European Parliament, so that I went well beyond my obligations under the Treaty to show my respect for Parliament."
"The new European Constitution, the new Constitutional Treaty, adds a political dimension to the selection of the President of the Commission."
"It is now largely up to you, the European Parliament, in conjunction with the Council, to find a more concrete way for the Council to justify its choice or the political criteria it applies in selecting the President of the Commission in the future, or to be precise in 2009."
"Let me make myself clear and say that I do not just wish to be the Council's candidate, although I am of course very honoured to have received the unanimous support of the Council, but if I am elected I will be the candidate elected by the Council and by this House."
"That is why I am here presenting my views and replying to your questions, and that is what I shall do."
"I would like to reiterate that if I am elected, I shall defend Europe's common interest by endeavouring, if necessary, to stand up to the vested interests of the Member States, by seeking to strike a balance between all the Member States, large, medium-sized and small alike, as they are all important."
"Their dignity is exactly the same, regardless of their size."
"With regard to the question put to me by Mr Swoboda, that is the issue of my having submitted my resignation as Prime Minister, that decision was a sign of respect for this Parliament."
"It would not be correct under our system, under the Portuguese system that is, where the President of the Republic has certain powers, for Portugal to have spent a month waiting to know if its Prime Minister had or had not been elected President of the Commission."
"That is why I do not stand before you here today as a Head of Government: I am simply a Member of the Portuguese Parliament."
"I stand before you as one of you, presenting my ideas and submitting myself to your approval."
"I regard that as a sign of respect for this House."
"Another question put to me by many honourable Members, notably Mr de Villiers, Mrs Bonino and Mr Carlos Coelho, was the issue of relations between the Commission and Parliament, and I would like to use the expression that I used in my address, ‘a close positive relationship’."
"The European Union makes progress when these two institutions, the Commission and the European Parliament, work hand in hand, respecting each other's powers of course, so that the Commission does not try to usurp Parliament, nor, of course, does Parliament trespass on the Commission's territory."
"But when these two institutions work hand in hand, Europe moves forward, and that is the way I want to go."
"As regards the debate about the future of Europe and about ratification – an issue raised by Mr Schultz, Mrs Grossetête and Mr Dehaene in particular – I would like to say that this is a debate that we have to win at national level, and all politicians, be they Members of the European Parliament, members of national parliaments or others, can take part in this debate."
"As an institution, it falls to the Commission to provide credible and serious information about what is happening."
"For that reason, the job of communication will be a vital one, but I think that this task is one that requires us to have the political courage to combat the apathy that I mentioned to Mrs Bonino and other Members of this House."
"I personally will make myself available to participate in this debate, wherever and whenever you want me to, but I repeat that it is a debate that has to be won at national level."
"Another question also put to me related to the selection of Commissioners, and in particular as to whether or not there should be super-Commissioners."
"This question was put to me by several honourable Members, notably by Mrs Ludford."
"I do not want to have just one super-Commissioner in my Commission – I would like to have 24 super-Commissioners, because I believe that there is a vital principle at stake here: the principle of collegiality."
"The Commission needs to maintain that principle."
"I have not yet taken a final decision – I can only take it once I have received your endorsement – about the structure of the Commission, but this is one of the responsibilities of the President of the Commission, it is not the responsibility of the European Council, and I shall therefore exercise my responsibility as regards allocating the various Commission portfolios."
"The principle of collegiality also applies here; we will not trespass on the territory of other institutions, but equally the Council may not trespass on that of the Commission."
"It is my responsibility and I shall exercise that responsibility."
"The issue of transparency and openness was raised with me by a number of Members, including Mr Evans, Mr Bonde, Mr Lundgren and Mrs Martens."
"I am committed to the Commission being open, effective and accountable."
"I believe that the European Parliament has a very important role to play in monitoring the work of the Commission."
"In order carry out this monitoring role, the Members of the European Parliament need information, and I am prepared to give you that information."
"Furthermore, the positive work already initiated by President Prodi in this area must be acknowledged."
"Mr Bonde asked me a number of specific questions and I would like to reply to them."
"I already know that you have informally been provided with information on the whole list of groups of experts and working groups."
"I hope that the Commission will be able to provide Parliament with full information on these groups of experts and working groups on a regular basis."
"I know that the Commission has been working with the Court of Auditors so as to provide this institution with everything it needs."
"I am willing to work with you, and particularly with the Committee on Budgetary Control, as regards financial control of the Commission."
"I have already said that I have not yet taken a final decision as to the structure of the Commission, but there is one decision that I have taken, and that is that the Commissioner responsible for the budget will not be the same as the Commissioner responsible for audit and control."
"As I see it, that is the best guarantee of the control function."
"As regards your wider questions about documentation and information, I am willing to provide Parliament with that information."
"I would like to consider with you how we can improve on the current situation."
"As to the issue of ‘whistleblowers’, the Commission has already reviewed its staff regulations, and Commission staff are accordingly now clearly responsible for reporting all irregularities, and the Commission is obliged to protect the rights of officials who report such irregularities."
"Turning to the issue of gender and to the number of women Commissioners, a question raised yesterday by Mr Maaten and again today by Mrs Ludford, Mrs Segelström and Mrs Záborská, as well as by a number of other Members of both sexes."
"I am in favour of equal opportunities."
"I am in favour of equal rights for men and women."
"I regard that as axiomatic in our culture, and I believe it to be a human rights issue where there is no room for compromise."
"Yesterday I said that I am determined to have a greater proportion of women Commissioners than has been the case up to now, but a number of women Members have asked me today exactly what my objective is."
"I shall tell you what my objective is, but I cannot assume sole responsibility for it, because it also depends on national governments."
"That is where you can help me with some of your governments, particularly those that have not yet taken a decision about the name of the Commissioner they wish to propose to me."
"My objective is that one third of the Commissioners working with me should be women."
"That is my objective, and I shall fight to achieve it, I shall do my utmost to realise it."
"I cannot guarantee that I shall succeed, but I can assure you that I am committed to achieving that outcome."
"Some of the most frequently asked questions were about economic and social issues, and in particular the issue of social cohesion and the Lisbon agenda."
"Members who asked me questions on these issues included Mr Schultz, Mr Poignon, Mr António Costa, Mr Itälä, Mrs Figueiredo, Mr Titley, Mr Rasmussen, Mr Rosati, Mr Paasilina and Mr Hökmark."
"Let me repeat, ladies and gentlemen, that you should not believe the caricatures of my political profile that you sometimes come across."
"I believe that it is possible to combine a social vision with a reforming agenda in relation to markets that would make Europe one of the most competitive areas in the world, if not the most competitive."
"I do not deny that it is very difficult, but we need to work in that direction."
"We cannot cast aside the European social model for the sake of competitiveness."
"That is why I see the Lisbon agenda as an economic agenda, an agenda for competitiveness, but also a social agenda and an agenda for environmental protection."
"We need to do more to increase competition and the internal market, and to make a technological leap forward and increase productivity, we need to invest in education and human resources and to seek clean technologies."
"Yet at the same time we have to choose one priority and that priority must be growth and employment."
"That must clearly be our priority and we will have an opportunity to define it in the mid-term review of the Lisbon agenda that is being prepared by former Prime Minister Wim Kok."
"I hope that we will try to make growth and job creation our priorities, because those are the factors that can genuinely guarantee the social agenda."
"But we can only create jobs if we have economic growth, that is the issue, and we therefore need to step up Europe's productivity and competitiveness in order to create jobs, because that is what our fellow citizens are most concerned about."
"That is also why, when it comes to the Stability and Growth Pact, an issue already raised with me today by Mr Rasmussen, Mr Rossati, Mrs De Vits and many others, I said and can repeat this: it does not seem sensible to me to consider revising the Treaty that created the Stability and Growth Pact, we really are not going to do that."
"What we can do, and there are already some ideas floating around about this, is to look for flexible interpretations without undermining the essential principles of the Stability and Growth Pact, so that it does not interfere with our assumptions about growth."
"That is the direction I wish to go in."
"As regards the Financial Perspectives, particularly in relation to the new Member States, I would like to reply to the questions asked by Members including Mrs Vaidere, Mrs Kósáné Kovács, Mr Rouček and Mr Pahor."
"Especially for the new Member States, I regard this as a priority, as the new Member States need the cohesion and solidarity of the European Union just as some of us, including my own country, have benefited from that solidarity."
"It is not a zero sum game, a game in which what some gain others lose."
"The help we can give to the new Member States is good for Europe, and what is good for Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, the Baltic states, for Slovakia or Slovenia is good for Europe as a whole."
"I am convinced that growth in these countries will make an important contribution to the overall growth of the European Union and for that reason I intend to advocate ambitious Financial Perspectives."
"Building on the foundations laid by the Prodi Commission, I will advocate such Financial Perspectives, and this is another area where I need your help in winning over those members of the Council who have not yet been convinced of the importance of the solidarity and cohesion policy."
"Turning to the question of media pluralism, an issue which Mrs Napoletano raised yesterday and Mrs Gruber today, this is a very important subject which goes to the heart of our democracy and the issue of Europe's cultural diversity."
"The Commission has already considered this subject, notably in its Green Paper in the mid-nineties."
"Media pluralism is a principle that is clearly recognised in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and which is now enshrined in the Constitution itself."
"Your questions relate to a Commission initiative."
"We need to be sure that there is an EU legal basis for the Commission to legislate in this area."
"There are questions that still need to be clarified."
"We should not underestimate the difficulties associated with this subject, although I would like to make it absolutely clear that I personally am in favour of respect across the board for the principles of pluralism of information."
"I also understand the sensitivity and concerns surrounding the subject of GMOs – genetically modified organisms."
"Precisely because this is such a sensitive subject, the Union has established a comprehensive regulatory framework for GMOs so as to ensure a scientifically based system suitable for dealing with all these issues."
"I am convinced that this system should now be applied with firmness and determination, because our credibility is at stake here."
"The time has come to demonstrate to Europe's citizens and to our trading partners that the European authorisation system is working as it was intended to."
"The truth is that this system is the most advanced in the world, and we cannot therefore afford to sacrifice our credibility here."
"I of course want this system to be implemented and I wish to assure this House that if I am at its helm, the Commission will attach the greatest importance to this matter, which warrants the efforts being made in connection with it."
"In conclusion, I would like to deal with the questions about the very concept of the European Union that so many Members have put to me."
"I cannot of course support those who would like to abolish the Commission and to do away with the European Union altogether."
"But I would ask for the support of all those who wish to carry the European project forward, and I shall take the liberty at this point of taking issue with those Members who said that as my views fall into one particular part of the political spectrum and theirs into another, they intend to vote against me."
"Frankly, I do not consider that to be reasonable, because if you behave that way there would never be a stable majority in this House, and it would always be impossible to choose a President of the Commission."
"By the same token, I cannot agree with those Members who say they are not voting against me personally, but against me as the Council's candidate."
"Fine, then you might as well say that there would never be a President of the Commission under the current rules."
"We are a Union of states and of citizens."
"I do not regard the two as incompatible, and this is my reply to Mrs Ludford and also to the honourable Member who spoke just now about my convictions: there is no incompatibility between having a grand vision and strong convictions on the one hand, and on the other hand acting pragmatically as to how they should be implemented, and that is my position."
"I have strong non-negotiable convictions, particularly when it comes to freedom and the rule of law."
"I believe that the war against terrorism should be waged without infringing our fundamental freedoms."
"Security yes, but not an obsession with security."
"I am in favour of freedom, which I see as essential."
"I have clearly stated my values: freedom, respect for human rights, the rule of law, equal opportunities and solidarity."
"I regard those values as non-negotiable and my position is absolutely unambiguous."
"But as President of the Commission, I shall certainly seek compromises, because I am not here just as a representative of one political family, and I am convinced that the President of the Commission should work with the PPE family, with the Liberals and Democrats, with the Socialists and with other Members in various groups who essentially agree on making progress with the European project."
"Without compromise, Europe will not move forward, ladies and gentlemen."
"This does not betoken a lack of conviction, it means that I am convinced of the virtues of pluralism, of compromise and of the Community method."
"We have a grand vision for Europe, let there be no doubt."
"We have deeply-rooted convictions but we intend to realise them in a pragmatic way."
"That is why, returning to the image Mr Watson used yesterday, and which I have already used myself, the image of an aircraft with no one in the cockpit, I believe that the European Union cannot function on automatic pilot."
"There is no modern aviation system that holds the secret to doing that."
"In order to function, the European Union needs political leadership."
"It functions on the basis of political courage and I can promise you that I shall endeavour to exercise that political leadership not in a party political way, but by seeking a dynamic consensus, because I believe that the Commission can indeed be the pilot of the European Union, which is in a decisive phase of its history with the conclusion of the enlargement of the EU, thus demonstrating our solidarity and looking forward to peace, prosperity, security and solidarity, not just within our own continent but also beyond it."
"To conclude, that is why I am asking you for your support, because if I receive your endorsement I shall, as President of the Commission, be seeking to unite all of Europe, from the Mediterranean to the Baltic, from the founding members of the European Union to those who have just joined, from the richest countries to the poorest, from the largest countries to the smallest, and I shall try not just to be the honest broker that is needed between the institutions, but also to be a unifying force to advance our European project."
"I know that many people are pessimistic about Europe, but, ladies and gentlemen, we need to have a sense of time."
"What was Europe like 50 years ago?"
"What has it become today?"
"What was Europe like just a few years ago when it was divided by the Berlin Wall and the Baltic countries were occupied by another power, when freedom did not exist across a large part of our continent, and what is it like now?"
"We are better placed today than we were 50 years ago."
"My desire is that in another 50 years' time we will be in a far better position than we are today."
"That is what I propose to achieve, with your help and your solidarity."
"Thank you very much, Mr Barroso."
"The sitting is suspended so that the political groups can meet."
". – The unanimous nomination of the conservative prime minister of Portugal, Mr Barroso, both by the conservative and the 'socialist' leaders of the Member States of the European Union, for the office of President of the European Commission, did not come out of nowhere, nor did it surprise the Communist Party of Greece."
"It marks:"
"reconciliation between the EU and the US, the closure of any differences which they had about the spoils from the intervention in Iraq, the restoration in the eyes of the people of the dirty imperialist war and more intensive participation of the part of the EU in the plans and interventions required by the 'new order';"
"the speedier application of the anti-grass roots measures ordered by the unifying monopolies (sweeping privatisations, the destruction of any remaining pay, pension, health, education, welfare, employment rights and so on); and"
"the imposition on the peoples of the ΕU of the misleadingly named European Constitution, which will also safeguard the militaristic, autocratic and anti-labour character of the ΕU institutionally."
"The Communist Party of Greece will throw all its weight behind the struggles of both the Greek and the other peoples of the ΕU, in order to overturn the anti-grass roots policies which the election of the new President of the European Commission marks."
"Thousands of workers in Greece are being made redundant with the go-ahead of the ΕU and the governments which support it."
"That is why the Communist Party of Greece voted against Mr José Manuel Barroso."
"(2)"
"– Mr President, I should like to table a motion on a point of order."
"The European Parliament has a Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality."
"A well-known Italian daily and the British newspapers today are reporting a statement by our fellow Member Godfrey Bloom according to which we women can cook but we do not clean behind the refrigerator."
"I must point out that there are women who fight and are killed for their rights, women who are hidden under burkas, and women in the European Union who still do not get equal treatment in the economy."
"I know the British have a sense of humour about themselves, but I am from Naples and I can say that we women do know how to cook and clean the refrigerator and even be politicians, while perhaps Godfrey Bloom does not know either how to clean the refrigerator or how to be a politician."
"I thank Mrs Mussolini for her defence of women’s rights, but I would like to point out that that was not a point of order."
"Mr President, I wish to make a short statement."
"My comments have been misrepresented in the press."
"I would particularly like to say that it is my first visit here and it is disgraceful that something so undemocratic can take place: somebody has misquoted from the press with no prior engagement with me and no prior notice."
"Mrs Mussolini has not even had the courtesy to come to see me about what was purportedly written in the English press."
"The next item is the vote on the Conference of Presidents’ proposals – Appointments to committees."
"The Conference of Presidents’ proposals are approved."
"My remarks do not relate to the Rules of Procedure as such, but to the situation that arose yesterday evening."
"I have been asked by the leader of the Czech delegation within the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats (PPE/DE) to point out that three members of this group, including two women, my colleagues in the Czech delegation, were not appointed to any committees."
"The three people concerned are: Mrs Jana Hybášková, Mrs Nina Škottová and Mr Rihards Piks."
"I find the whole matter scandalous and I should like to ask the leaders of all factions to rectify this situation as quickly as possible, so that we do not have to wait until September or even longer."
"All Members have the right to join a committee."
"This right must be strictly respected."
"It falls to the political groups to make proposals to guarantee this right."
"If the situation is as you describe and there are Members of this Parliament who have not been included in any committee, I would ask the leaders of the political groups – and in particular the President of the Group of the European Peoples’ Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to which these Members belong – to produce a proposal as soon as possible to re-allocate posts guaranteeing that all Members can join a committee."
"We shall resolve this problem as soon as possible."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we have the great responsibility of deciding who is to be the President of the European Commission."
"Our group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, welcomes the unanimous proposal by the Council that José Manuel Durão Barroso be appointed President of the European Commission."
"Our group also welcomes the Council’s decision, also unanimous, to re-appoint Javier Solana to the position of High Representative, in which position he has done good work, and, in two and a half years, by which time it is to be hoped that the Constitution will have entered into force, to make him the European Union’s Minister for Foreign Affairs."
"He will then need our support and our trust, and we welcome this decision too."
"Those of us who have had the privilege of working with José Manuel Durão Barroso in the past – and I am one of them – can say unequivocally that he possesses the qualifications for the task of President of the European Commission."
"Even if you have not yet come to this conclusion, I have to tell you for my own part that that way he presented himself to the groups – all of them – yesterday and this morning here in the European Parliament, very definitely convinced me that Mr Barroso is the right person and suited to the office of President of the European Commission."
"Nor have I ever heard anyone in this Chamber question his suitability as a person."
"He knows what he is talking about, he is competent, and he can also communicate his convictions, something that is important to the European Union."
"I have also been impressed by his desire for close cooperation with Parliament, and what our expression of confidence in him today signifies is that, once he has taken up office we will follow him critically – but, of course, in a positive way – but we in this House will exercise control over the Commission."
"The candidate has presented himself as a bridge-builder and as an honest broker, thus demonstrating his desire to help achieve consensus."
"This European continent is so complex that neither one side nor the other can take decisions alone, rule alone, or cause its will to prevail."
"Europe has a future only if we, together, take the road of consensus and compromise."
"That is what José Manuel Durão Barroso is willing to do, and that is another reason why we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are of one mind in believing that we should entrust him with the task and the responsibility that go with the office of President of the European Commission."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to preface my remarks by saying this to Mr Barroso: we have had extensive discussions with you and have come to know you as someone whose personal integrity is beyond question."
"I am here to present a decision, and it is one with which we have had difficulty. Our group has listened to you; yesterday and this morning we have put to you further questions in which we have set out our thinking about Europe’s future and the President of the Commission’s role in it."
"We listened to your answers and have discussed them, and the answers you gave today, in our group meeting this morning."
"In the hearings, in my speech yesterday, and this morning too, we have put four crucial questions, to which we expect answers."
"Now we have to provide our own answers to them."
"Is José Durão Barroso the candidate who will strengthen the Commission, as an institution, in its relations with the Council, with the Heads of State or Government, with the other institutions?"
"Secondly, is he the candidate to pursue a sustainable environmental policy, a sustainable economic policy, on the basis of fairness in world trade?"
"Is he – and this was the third question – the candidate for whom we Social Democrats will be able to vote, because he, as President of the Commission, will contend for social cohesion as primary need for our society, something that is a crucial element in Socialist policy in Europe?"
"We have asked ourselves these three questions, and I will say something about the fourth at the end of my speech."
"To these three questions, our group has answered, ‘No’."
"The fourth question was..."
"... whether José Manuel Durão Barroso is a candidate who can cause Europe’s values, first of all the values of multilateralism, in the face of a unilateralism motivated by self-interest."
"Mr Barroso, what I want to say to you on a personal level is this: if I had heard from your lips, even if only as an indication: ‘If the information I possess today had been available to me a year ago, I would perhaps have taken a different decision with regard to the war in Iraq.’"
"Even if you had only alluded to this ..."
"... and only once, my decision would have been easier, but on this point you have been intransigent."
"So, we return to the question of whether you are the man to, for example, make the EU the equal of other great powers, whether they be economic or political, and you have yet to provide us with evidence that you are."
"For most of us, you are still one of those who organised the Azores summit."
"Today, a number of Members belonging to my group will, for the most diverse reasons, express their confidence in you."
"Let me make it quite clear, Mr Barroso, that the way in which these people have politicised your election has done you more harm than good."
"Those members of our group who will express their confidence in you enjoy the group’s solidarity and respect, but the Socialist Group in the European Parliament cannot, today, give you a vote of confidence."
"I am sorry to have to say that but, should you win, you may well gain our confidence in the future."
"– Mr President, as our new House has taken on a Teutonic style, I will offer a few words in the language of Goethe."
"Let me put a question. For God’s sake, Mr Poettering, what have you done now?"
"The European People’s Party members have cast their votes for Mr Borrell, and now the Social Democrats are voting against your candidate for the Commission."
"Unreliable partner!"
"You know, Hans-Gert, it would not have been so bad while Enrique Barón Crespo was there."
"The trouble is that, in those days of lovely warm weather after 13 June, when Enrique went down to the beach he found Martin Schulz's towel on his deck chair!"
"If my group votes for Mr Barroso today, it is not to bail you out of your misery."
"You have made your bed – now you have to lie in it."
"When my group decides – whether for Mr Geremek or for Mr Barroso – we vote for Europe."
"Mr President-designate of the Commission, in today's vote for your nomination as next President of the Commission you will receive the support of the overwhelming majority of Liberals and Democrats in this House."
"Your performance in yesterday's debate was assured."
"You heard this House out."
"You stood there."
"You answered our questions."
"I believe that you understand that, as President of the Commission, your most important partner will be the European Parliament and I cannot understate the importance of your continued respect for our prerogatives, your candour in the face of our questions, and your presence on the floor of this House."
"You have started, I trust, as you intend to go on."
"Liberals and Democrats asked for clear assurances in three areas: super-Commissioners, gender balance and transparency."
"Yesterday you delivered these."
"Should you be given the opportunity today to assemble a Commission, we will be standing ready to hold you to those commitments in November and throughout your term."
"I say that not as a threat, but as a challenge."
"You have chosen an ambitious path and the right path."
"Hold to it and you will have our backing."
"Having earned our support you can now expect a critical friend in the alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"You have won our backing with your vision for an ambitious and independent European executive."
"You understand that the Union is not a club of nation states with a few curious federal habits, but a genuine political union and that the Commission's role is to speak for that Union."
"A strong and independent Commission needs a strong mandate and a strong and productive relationship with the European Parliament."
"By giving you our support constructively and clearly today, Liberals and Democrats are sending a clear signal that this is the Europe we want."
"– Today, Mr Barroso, let me adopt a different tone to yesterday’s."
"The past we share, the time – thirty years ago – that we sang together, oblige me to be frank and perfectly straightforward with you."
"In this Parliament, the Left has a problem: it is characterised by ideological decay, a problem as acute among the Greens as it is among the rest."
"The Right has a problem: it is characterised by authoritarianism, a moralistic approach, and neo-liberalism."
"At the end of the day, life is complicated and love means telling the truth."
"I love you."
"Mr Barroso, you declare yourself to be a man of the centre and a reformist."
"Now the problem with the centre is that they are opportunists."
"That, Mr Barroso, is why my group cannot have any confidence in your appointment."
"The fact is that, when you are with some, you are in favour of sustainable development, with others, you are in favour of the market, with others still, you favour the social dimension; when you meet God, you are in favour of God, and when you meet with secularists, you are against God being mentioned in the European Constitution."
"Mr Barroso, I am sure you are capable of being a good President of the Commission."
"The problem is precisely as described by Mr Schulz, who was, for once, speaking with great clarity."
"If, for one moment during all your speeches, you had found it in you to show us some small change of heart; if you had said: ‘Yes, it is true that I took that decision, but it was a difficult one."
"In view of what is going on in Iraq, I feel rather ashamed, two years further on, of having been in the Azores, arm in arm with George Bush’; if, at any time, you had told us that, in view of what is currently going on in your own country’s society following your reforms, you were questioning the way in which you had carried out those reforms; and if, at any time, we had been able to feel that you could see what our problems were, we would have been able to say: ‘He knows how to communicate and how to change; we have to give him a chance’."
"As, however, you have at no time been capable of such doubt, which is itself the most intelligent form of European philosophy, Mr Barroso, the Group of the Greens, acting in a frank, honest and clear manner, will not be voting for you today."
"If you are elected, I will cheer you, and if you are not, I will advise you to make Socrates your holiday reading."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if I may strike a more serious note, I simply want to confirm that my group, that of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, will not be voting for Mr Barroso as a candidate."
"We are not opposing any one person, but political tendencies, not only Mr Barroso’s and the Council’s, but also those of the Commission and of the majority in this House."
"This is a protest vote by the Left, aimed at the liberal model and also, in our present situation, at what I shall describe as the ‘Azores model’."
"It strikes us as healthy, and indeed vital, that such objections should be openly expressed, which does not exclude the possibility of mutual respect or even, if need be, the expression of convergent views over and above political divisions."
"In any case, this is what we will be doing during this Parliament, as we did during that which preceded it."
"Mr President, I am pleased to be able to speak this morning on behalf of this new Independence and Democracy Group, the fastest growing group in the European Parliament, which I believe reflects public opinion across the European continent."
"Let us remember what we are talking about here."
"We are talking about a European Commission and a President of the European Commission."
"I would suggest that the super-bureaucrat, Jean Monnet, is resting very easily in his grave because the Commission model that he wanted is here."
"If we have the Constitution, it is here to stay."
"You see, Mr Monnet hated parliamentary democracy; he found it inconvenient; it got in the way of an administrator's plan for the next five, ten or fifteen years and he wanted to have a strong European Commission."
"What we have today is a European Union that is effectively ruled by unelected bureaucrats based in Brussels, issuing directives and regulations with which this House can do nothing other than tamper."
"Just look at the Commission!"
"It has become a rest home for failed domestic politicians."
"When people have to resign from cabinet or if, like Chris Patten, they lose their seat in an election, they are packed off for five or ten years at the European Commission – a Commission that has proved itself to be unreformable."
"Do you remember that they all resigned in disgrace in 1999?"
"We were told that it was all going to change, it was all going to be made better."
"Mr Prodi took over for five years, with Mr Kinnock at his side, and what did we see?"
"We saw the Eurostat scandal."
"Have we really seen an increase in transparency?"
"The answer is 'no', and so bureaucratic and bad is it that now we have over 3 000 working groups and committees within this bureaucratic monster."
"Mr Barroso came to meet our group – which was quite brave of him in many ways."
"He is politically skilled, he is a good operator and a good communicator."
"He is certainly much better at all of those things than Mr Prodi was."
"Mark you, that would not be very difficult, would it?"
"But he believes in a political Europe."
"He supports the European Constitution: a constitution that is bad for democracy; a constitution that establishes this place as a new legal entity; a constitution whose withdrawal terms are so unacceptable as to make the EU a prison of nations."
"My group will overwhelmingly vote against Mr Barroso and we urge anybody in this House that wants to stop the European Constitution to use this opportunity today to send a message."
"Mr President, I also wish to join in this debate on the candidature of the President-designate, Mr Barroso."
"When I listen to the speeches in this House I am always amazed at the differences in ideologies and backgrounds."
"However, it is at critical times like these that I recognise how hung up we all are with ideology and sentiments more suited to the 19th and early 20th centuries, rather than the 21st century."
"We have the great privilege in this House to be the representatives of the people of Europe."
"We have a duty to take real decisions on their behalf, not on the altar of any ideology but according to what we believe is in the best interests of the people of Europe. We have a duty to ensure that we cooperate and coordinate with other representatives of the peoples of Europe."
"The closest we can get to that are governments."
"The 25 sovereign governments in their wisdom have given their support to Mr Barroso and, if for no other reason, that is enough for me to give him my support."
"On top of that, there is the fact that Mr Barroso came to us as the directly elected representatives of the people of Europe to put his case in each of our groups."
"Whilst Members may criticise his political skills or his unwillingness to give them the answers to the questions they wanted, at least give him recognition for the courtesy of coming to us."
"He set out a political stall where he could; he did not answer questions he was unable to answer."
"I know that Members in my own group asked questions such as: will this person get this Commission post?"
"He replied that he could not discuss that because he was not yet the President and he did not know who the other nominees were going to be."
"I admire a man who is willing to say that he may have made mistakes in the past but now we are moving forward."
"In his submissions and hearings with our group he spoke about his role as an honest broker."
"We need an honest broker to operate within the European Union because, despite what the ideologists may think, the European Union is not the model of something else."
"Its institutions are not imitations: they are unique institutions reflecting unique arrangements of Member States, intergovernmentalism, cooperation, coordination and – despite what some colleagues may say – democracy."
"I would love to have somebody at the head of that Union who is and was a politician, who was part of different ideologies, who recognised the errors of his ways in his youth, who came forward and changed those ways to reflect what was most needed."
"It is not a left or right divide, it is not that the left is wrong and the right is correct or vice versa, it is about taking what is best from all ideologies to ensure we can deliver for all the people."
"It is not Boston versus Berlin, it is ensuring that we do what is right for all the people in Europe in the 21st century."
"We stand today at a new frontier, the dawn of a new era, when the old visions of Europe have been broken down, when countries that were denied the opportunities to have democracy and representation are being given that opportunity now."
"It does not bode well that we take the opportunity to play politics at this juncture."
"My group, the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, and I will be giving our full support to Mr Barroso's nomination and we hope other Members will do so well."
"– Mr President, Mr Barroso, on behalf of the non-attached Members who are on the European Right, let me say that I do not reproach you for the revolutionary past that you share with Mr Cohn-Bendit, for his example shows that one can have a revolutionary past of this sort and nonetheless be, today, an outstanding supporter of the system."
"I will limit myself to considering whether you are the right person, in the right place, at the right moment."
"As the European system gives it considerable power to initiate legislation and implement policies, the Commission in Brussels has acquired, by means of the Treaties, the right to govern an ever greater part of the lives of 400 million Europeans, and it is to this development that we object."
"The problem we have is that of knowing whether you should be a means by which we express that objection."
"Your actions as Prime Minister, and hence also as a member of the EU’s Council, have also shown us that, in economic and monetary matters, you have been so convinced a European that you kept very strictly to the Stability Pact and its principles."
"I might add that you also praised it at a time when Mr Prodi himself – and that is saying something – admitted that it was stupid."
"In the answers you gave just now, you were very evasive on the question of whether we should have a position independent of the United States of America, and we well recall the disastrous initiative you took in organising the notorious Azores summit on the eve of the war of aggression against Iraq."
"Finally, although you have been very careful and diplomatic in taking the precaution of not saying anything on the subject, you are a forthright advocate of the early commencement of negotiations on the accession of Turkey, which is an honourable country, but not a European one, whether in a geographical, cultural or historical sense."
"All this ought to prompt us to vote against you as a candidate."
"Being aware, though, of what a courteous and highly cultured man you are and of the well-known presumption of innocence, which is applicable even to the worst of criminals – and you are not one of those yet – some of us prefer to abstain."
"If you want me to go further than that, I will make use of the words of your great poet Fernando Pessoa:"
"""The day after tomorrow, yes, but only the day after tomorrow… I will get up tomorrow and think about the day after tomorrow, and then it will be possible; but today, no… No, nothing today; today I cannot do anything."""
"Before communicating the result of the election of the President-designate of the Commission, we will wait a few minutes for Mr Barroso to arrive."
"– Mr President, we all know that Mr Barroso has long been familiar with the institutions and their rules."
"We also know that he is not arrogant."
"It follows that there must be a certain degree of trust here."
"As there cannot be a lack of courtesy at work here, there must be a misunderstanding."
"Even though I think we can still have confidence in him, it strikes me as impossible that we cannot find out within three minutes where he is in order to dispel the misunderstanding."
"That is all."
"The results of the vote are as follows:"
"711 votes expressed, 3 void papers, 44 abstentions and blank votes, 664 votes cast, 413 votes in favour and 251 against."
"In view of these results, the European Parliament has elected the candidate for President of the Commission proposed by the Council."
"I congratulate Mr Barroso and, in accordance with Rule 98(3) of the Rules of Procedure, I shall inform the Council and invite it to propose the candidates for the various posts and members of the Commission in joint agreement with its President-elect."
"I know that the majority of the Portuguese are very proud today that the next President of the Commission is to be Portuguese."
"I would like to say to all my compatriots that I certainly take great pride in being Portuguese."
"Mr President, I would like to tell you that I am very honoured to be able now to serve the European Union as President of the Commission."
"I am delighted, honoured and proud that the European Parliament has confirmed my appointment."
"As I have told you, I see myself as someone who can build bridges."
"Left and right is only one dimension in politics."
"There are others."
"On the left and the right there are those who are modernisers and those who are less so."
"On the left and the right there are pro-Europeans and those who are against the European Union."
"We should build a dynamic coalition for Europe."
"I will work with all of you."
"I am especially grateful to those of you who supported me from the beginning, but I will try to build bridges with all those who did not vote for me this time."
"We need this kind of dynamic coalition to push forward our European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity to express to you again my profound European convictions."
"I am particularly honoured by your support."
"I undertake to work for Europe, to respect our heritage and build Europe upon the ideas of prosperity, solidarity and security."
"I hope that, both in the Commission and in Parliament, we will be able to maintain the kind of relationship I have called a close, positive relationship – which is important for Europe – while respecting our differences and endeavouring to set above all else our shared vision for Europe."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.(1)"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 22 July 2004."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have the immensely sad duty – a duty my predecessors have had to carry out on previous occasions – to open our September session by mentioning the terrorist attacks suffered by the world."
"Tomorrow, at noon, this Parliament will hold a minute’s silence as a tribute to the child victims of the horror in Beslan."
"In order to give this symbolic gesture a collective dimension, I have, moreover, asked the 25 Heads of State or Government of the countries of the Union to involve all the schools of Europe in our act of commemoration of these victims."
"I can inform you that I have already been notified by several governments that they will do so."
"Furthermore, at 9 a.m. tomorrow morning when I speak briefly to introduce our work for this term of office, I wish to analyse the scourge of terrorism from a political standpoint, pointing out the insecurity it causes amongst our fellow citizens and how we should respond to it. We cannot, however, begin our work on 13 September without paying tribute, through the minute’s silence we will hold tomorrow, to all the victims of all the terrorist attacks that have brought bloodshed to many parts of the world, as well as to all the victims of 11 September 2001 in New York and 11 March 2004 in Madrid, to name just the most recent and spectacular cases."
"In Iraq, in Russia, in the Middle East, in Indonesia and in Afghanistan, many human beings have fallen victim to the insanity of those people who wish to impose their vision of the world through terror."
"I have responded to each of these events on your behalf, ladies and gentlemen, expressing our solidarity with the victims and their families."
"I cannot end without once again calling on the kidnappers of the two NGO workers kidnapped in Iraq, two Italian women who as a result of their humanitarian commitment, working to care for Iraqi children, have fallen victim to a kidnap, as have the two French journalists who were working to carry out their duty, which is to inform all of us of what is happening there."
"Finally, to add to this sad list of painful events, I would like us, moreover, also to commemorate somebody who has been the victim not of a terrorist attack, but of a tragic accident: the Orthodox Patriarch Petros VII who, as you are aware, has been killed along with 16 other people in a tragic helicopter accident."
"Our thoughts and our tributes are also for him."
"Mr President, on a point of order, while the House will very much agree with the words you have just spoken and while we are all utterly appalled at the events which took place in Beslan, I must draw the attention of the House to another matter."
"Last month the regime in Iran hanged a 16-year-old girl."
"Mr Stevenson, you will have the opportunity to speak at the appropriate time, when you are given the floor, during the appropriate debate, when all Members may speak for one minute."
"Now is not the moment to do so.(1)"
"Mr President, I must now touch upon an issue which affects thousands of Poles, Slovaks, Czechs, Hungarians and citizens of the other new Member States who have recently worked legally in Northern Ireland."
"Whereas on the one hand they have met with the hospitality of the citizens of that country, on the other they have experienced ruthless exploitation by the large German and international retail chain Lidl."
"This company has deliberately not paid its employees the money owing to them, either in full – I have statements that this has occurred – or in part."
"The payment of wages to these foreign workers has frequently been delayed, and there have been problems with cashing cheques issued by the company."
"The retail chain Lidl does this deliberately, as these people, who are mainly young, have to return to their own countries after the holidays, and will not be in a position to claim the money owing to them."
"This smacks of nineteenth century capitalism."
"I therefore ask you, Mr President, and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, to take action in this matter to ensure that this company does not become another example of the division of Europe into a superior West and an inferior East, and to ensure that Europe does not become associated with exploitation."
"Mr President, I wish to draw your attention to what I term a silent invasion of Europe by an alien species, , otherwise known as the American grey squirrel."
"In the UK and Ireland this little creature has been responsible for devastating woodlands as well as driving out the indigenous European red squirrel – – from many areas."
"This is not just an Irish or a British problem: the grey squirrel has established a firm foothold in Italy and is spreading rapidly northwards across our continent towards France, Germany and Austria, and it is bringing devastation in its wake."
"I jest not."
"I know in the major scheme of things this might seem like a detail, but we have a responsibility."
"The red squirrel – our European native squirrel – is now under threat through competition from a larger, more robust rival and through the destruction of its natural habitat, our deciduous woodland environment."
"In spite of the rapid advance of the grey squirrel, our Commission has not carried out comprehensive research to map or to control the spread of this species."
"The Commission is meant to be putting together a policy on invasive alien species, but so far we have seen no sign of it."
"When can we in Parliament expect to receive its draft proposals for a legislative framework?"
"Immediate concerted action at a European level is needed to reclaim our natural woodlands for the red squirrel before it is too late."
"– Mr President, following the perfectly successful organisation of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games, my country, Greece, will host the greatest sporting event in the world for people with disabilities, the Paralympic Games, from 17 to 28 September, to be attended by 145 countries, 4 000 athletes, 2 000 assistants and 3 000 members of the press are to attend."
"For the first time in history, we have the same organising committee for both the Olympic and the Paralympic Games, resulting in accurate planning and savings."
"Similarly, for the first time in the history of the Paralympic Games, the Greek Government decided some time ago to contribute the sum of EUR 55.8 million, thereby exempting every country, rich and poor alike, from the need to pay the fee required in order for their athletes to participate."
"Even before the first Paralympic Games were held in 1960, they were distinguished ..."
"I am sorry, Mrs Tzampazi, but I must restrict your speaking time despite your interesting comments."
"– Mr President, I certainly do not often speak on behalf of farmers, but my region in the northeast of England has suffered the worst weather and the worst harvest in 40 years."
"At a meeting there last week, farmers merely asked that the arable area payments that they are entitled to be made somewhat earlier."
"Contrary to some popular conception in the UK, farmers in Yorkshire are certainly not whingers."
"They just want a reasonable payment, made more quickly and on a regional basis."
"It is a restrained request."
"I hope that this Parliament will push the Commission to be sympathetic when the British Government requests it in due course."
"– Mr President, when you took up the role of President of this Parliament in July, you named an open and visible European Parliament as one of your key issues, and the Dutch Labour Party delegation wholeheartedly supports you in this."
"In fact, we have a practical suggestion to make as to how this first step may be taken."
"For a number of years now, members of the European public have not been able to simply stroll into the meetings that are public."
"Since security measures have been stepped up, understandably so, Parliament is no longer freely accessible."
"This has, of course, meant that the gap between the public and the politicians has become problematic and wider."
"One of the solutions would be to transmit the meetings via Parliament’s website."
"This already happens with the plenary meetings, and this could simply be extended to include the meetings of the different parliamentary committees."
"It would enable the citizens in all Member States to follow our work in the committees in an effective, inexpensive and democratic manner."
"Today, our delegation will be submitting a proposal to you for making this openness a priority for your Presidential term."
"Mrs Corbey, in particular, in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, has passed you something you can pick up and run with; today, we, on behalf of all our fellow MEPs, are counting on your support for this proposal, and that is how, via the website, we can bring the European citizen closer to our work in the committees."
"– Mr President, I would like to raise the issue of the situation in the Caribbean and Florida with regard to the terrible destruction being wrought by Hurricane Ivan and indeed by the two previous hurricanes, Charlie and Francis."
"Firstly I want us to express our condolences to and solidarity with all those who have suffered bereavement, injury and loss."
"As MEP for London, I am conscious that many of my constituents originating from places like Grenada, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands have families there who have been affected."
"Secondly, I want to urge a generous response from the EU and Member States for humanitarian aid to the countries and communities that have been devastated."
"I hope that the rapid response mechanism of ECHO can be invoked."
"Lastly, conscious that we next have on the agenda a Commission statement on recent environmental disasters in southern Europe, I want to insist on the likely connection between this terrible season for Caribbean hurricanes, typhoons in the South China Sea and indeed the wettest summer in Britain for 40 years, and the effects of climate change and global warming."
"One could also mention the devastating floods in Bangladesh in July."
"We must all make this a top priority, including the new US Administration."
"We in the West must curb our profligate use of energy because it is the poor in the south and east and even hard-pressed European farmers who suffer if we do not."
"Mr President, on the Northern Ireland Peace II agreement, as you are probably aware, the Council has asked the Commission to come forward with proposals for an extension of this programme for a further two years from 2004 to 2006."
"This has been one of the most important EU supports for the peace process in Northern Ireland."
"It has had to bed down the peace process and make it worthwhile for people to abandon their support for paramilitary organisations and to engage in constructive and proactive work, both north and south, across the border and in border areas."
"I would ask you to urge the Commission to come forward as a matter of urgency with those proposals because they need to be brought forward before the end of this year."
"I do this also at a time when a renegotiation process of the Northern Ireland Peace Agreement gets under way this week in Britain, sponsored by the Irish and British Governments, which involves all of the parties there in an attempt to get this process back on its feet."
"As you know, the Assembly has been shut down for some time, so it is even more important that a clear signal is given that this programme will continue."
"– Mr President, I should like us to take this opportunity in plenary to express our deepest regret and mourning at the loss of Petros, Patriarch of Alexandria and All Africa who, together with the seventeen members of his mission and the crew, died in a tragic aviation accident last Saturday, the accident which you too referred to, for which I thank you."
"We should mention that the late Patriarch was indeed a young and inspired Patriarch and his loss will be keenly felt."
"Mr President, I wish to flag up a serious threat to civil liberties, the environment and animal welfare in the United Kingdom."
"Next Wednesday the British Government proposes to introduce a new law on hunting which will aim to criminalise some of the most decent, law-abiding and responsible people in the UK."
"In order to pass its law, the Government will be forced to use a constitutional sledgehammer called the Parliament Act, which was not designed for this sort of purpose and, in the view of many constitutional lawyers, will be improperly used in this way."
"We in this House respect human rights and cultural diversity."
"The proposed new law is a serious assault on both."
"All who value civil liberties, rural values and animal welfare should speak out against this unjust and oppressive measure."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to return to the points with which the sitting opened. The Italian delegation of the Union for the Europe of Nations Group suggests that the Members of this Parliament make a one-off contribution corresponding to a day’s allowance as a donation to the International Red Cross, symbolically set aside for reconstruction of the school in Beslan."
"I also think it right that this Parliament, sitting in plenary session, in addition to the resolute condemnation of all terrorist acts and the words spoken at the start of the sitting, send a message of solidarity and fellow-feeling to the families of the civilian hostages held in Iraq, in particular the two French journalists and the two young Italian women, Simona Pari and Simona Torretta, in the hope that all those taken hostage can return home safe and sound."
"– I should like, at this point, to bring to the attention of the Members of this House and to your attention, Mr President, the reality of relocations by multinationals."
"Last year, following the relocation of the multinational C[amp]J Clark, in Portugal, which had laid off hundreds and hundreds of workers in Castelo de Paiva and previously in Arouca, Parliament passed a resolution on companies that received financial support, as in this case, and then relocated."
"They and the Commission are thus responsible for a range of measures that must be taken to put an end to this practice and defend the rights of the workers and regions affected. Moreover, where companies fail to meet their obligations they can be asked to return any Community funds awarded."
"What is, in fact, happening is that right now the very same multinational, C[amp]J Clark, a British firm, is relocating its last factory in Portugal – , in Vila Nova de Gaia – laying off several hundred more workers."
"I should like to ask you, Mr President, to urge the Commission to comply with Parliament’s resolution."
"Mr President, I should like to return to the issue of hostages taken in Iraq."
"Needless to say, I join in the condemnations that you expressed, but is there nothing else we could do?"
"More than 300 people in this House have signed a petition for the release, which is indeed a very good thing, and this international pressure, including this petition – for there have, of course, been other initiatives – has already resulted in an internal debate among the radical movements in Iraq."
"This is, in actual fact, an unexpected result and quite something."
"There are now guilty innocents and innocent innocents."
"I should like to go one step further: it goes without saying that hostage taking as a method should simply be done away with."
"Could this Parliament not send a letter to all national parliaments of our 25 Member States and urge them to submit a similar petition, a similar appeal as democratically elected bodies, symbols of respect for the individual, to call for the immediate release of all hostages in Iraq?"
"– Mr President, at the start of today's sitting, the European Parliament adopted your proposal that plenary observe one minute's silence tomorrow for the victims of Beslan."
"The fact that we have not heard a word about the children of Palestine or the children of Iraq is truly surprising."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the same time, the government of Arial Sharon is stepping up its murderous assaults, with the Israeli army making incursions into the Gaza Strip on land and from the air, killing and injuring dozens of Palestinians."
"They are destroying homes and infrastructure."
"The expressions by the international community in response to these murderous attacks by the Israeli army are hypocritical and are completely futile, in that they are not accompanied by measures to make Israel stop the genocide of the Palestinian people and tear down the wall of shame."
"On the contrary, likening the perpetrator to the victims and calling murder the right of defence both exonerates and encourages the Israeli Government."
"We consider that practical political and other measures should be taken immediately in order to force the Israeli Government to stop the slaughter of the Palestinians and create the preconditions to an independent Palestine."
"Thank you very much, Mr Toussas, you may rest assured that when we hold a minute’s silence tomorrow we will be thinking of all the child victims of terrorism from anywhere in the world."
"– Mr President, last month in the city of Neka in Iran a 16 year-old girl accused of offences against chastity was publicly hanged from a crane."
"After sentencing her to death, the judge said that she had undressed in the court because she took her veil off."
"He insisted upon placing the rope around her neck himself."
"There are three more children aged 16 currently under sentence of death in Iran."
"The regime is waiting until they are 18 to carry out public executions."
"This is the utmost act of barbarism by a mullah regime that is taking the cultured and civilised people of Iran back to the stone ages."
"It has executed 120 000 people since it came to power."
"I hope that on behalf of all the Members of this House, Mr President, you will express our outrage to the Iranian ambassador to the EU."
"The execution of children, and indeed the death penalty, is something that we will not tolerate."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday and the day before yesterday, around a thousand illegal immigrants landed on the isle of Lampedusa, in just two nights."
"Mr President, thinking also of the hygiene and health situation and the humanitarian conditions of these journeys, I ask you if it would not be appropriate for a European Parliament delegation – perhaps even with your own distinguished presence – to visit Lampedusa to see this situation, which is now a distressing emergency from a humanitarian point of view as well."
"Italy is taking action which is producing some initial results, but the European Union must put great pressure on the countries of origin and transit, because Europe cannot tolerate this depraved traffic in human beings."
"I ask that the European Parliament be present at an international colloquium to be held by a non-governmental organisation in Lampedusa."
"– Mr President, I would like to draw the attention of this House to the disturbing news coming from the southeast border of the European Union, from the region of Serbia commonly known as Vojvodina."
"In recent weeks and months this summer, there has been news of growing ethnic tensions and attacks on and harassment of Hungarian nationals, including attacks on cemeteries, anti-Hungarian inscriptions and the burning of the Hungarian national flag."
"I would like to draw the attention of this House to how important it is to stabilize the situation in the Balkans."
"Europe has been doing a great deal to stop violence and ethnic cleansing in this region."
"The Serbian authorities are not reacting quickly enough to this situation and showing themselves to be ignorant or negligent in many ways."
"It is the responsibility of all democrats who care about the security of our common Europe, and also those who care about minority rights and human rights, to bring pressure to bear on the Serbian authorities in regard to this very important and highly dangerous situation."
"– Mr President, of course everything we have heard is extremely important."
"The events which took place a few days ago as the curtain came down on the Olympic Games in Athens are also important, events which were crowned with huge success."
"Today I revert to a matter which concerns all of us, the matter of doping, that scourge of athleticism which, of course, concerns young people the world over."
"That is why I would propose that a resolution against doping be passed on the basis of the amendment we intend to table, setting out the measures which the European Union and all of us need to take in order to combat this scourge."
"Mr President, shortly before the summer break the Supreme Court of Indonesia finally acquitted all those military officers indicted for the unlawful killing of civilians in the former Portuguese colony of East Timor during the run-up to Timorese independence when there were attempts to derail the UN-led independence process."
"I deeply regret this and, as this House followed East Timor's independence struggle closely, many will join me in protest at the fact that nobody is going to be punished for these massacres."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to respond to the first speaker, who indicated that he had difficulties in respect of the exploitation of young seasonal workers in Northern Ireland, the constituency that I represent."
"I very much regret that and I have already assured him that I will use my offices to try to resolve that difficulty."
"I now want to congratulate the Greek authorities on the excellent Olympic Games and to express my disgust at the suggestion of the outgoing President of the Commission that in future games the European Union flag should be flown alongside the national flag."
"I do not think it is at all anti-European to make the point that the Olympic Games give great national pride to the nation states that participate in them."
"This suggestion is an indication of the obsession of the europhile leaders of Europe, an obsession that knows no bounds."
"Even now they want to garner for themselves the glory that flows to each nation state from the medals won there."
"I suggest it is a step too far and one that nation states should rightly resist."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on leaving Milan airport I unfortunately lost my spectacles for the hundredth time, so I cannot see things close up but I can see things clearly from a distance and, looking from a distance, I see perils for our Parliament."
"I would therefore ask you for greater security in the European Parliament buildings in Strasbourg and Brussels."
"I feel that the Members of the European Parliament would be a choice morsel for terrorist sharks and, if you ask me, I will be able to tell you what, in my opinion, is lacking in terms of security for us Members."
"I do not think that it is appropriate to state my concerns publicly on such an important matter."
"The debate on matters of political importance is closed."
"I would like to thank all the honourable Members for your cooperation."
"Mr Evans has the floor for a point of order."
"– Mr President, I have a point of order with regard to the agenda."
"A number of Members have tabled questions in good time for this week – in particular to the Council – but received rather confusing e-mails to the effect that the questions could not be translated and would be held over until the next part-session."
"Can you clarify the position with regard to Council Question Time this week and say what Members with genuine questions for the Council should do?"
"As I will explain tomorrow in more depth, we still have unresolved problems in relation to translations, and not all the questions put will be able to be translated into all the languages."
"Nevertheless, the Secretariat-General informs me that they appear on the list of questions to be put to the Commission, although it has not been possible to translate them into all the languages, but they do appear on the list of questions to be put to the Commission and the Council."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to put the following proposal to you."
"The European Parliament should honour the victims of the Second World War, which broke out 65 years ago, on 1 September 1939."
"It began when Nazi Germany attacked Poland, with the Soviet Union providing its support on 17 September 1939, thus fulfilling the terms of the German—Soviet Pact, known as the Ribbentrop –Molotov Pact."
"The memory of this, the most tragic and bloody of wars, in which more civilians than soldiers were killed, should never be allowed to die."
"I suggest Parliament supports this proposal by commemorating the victims of that war with a minute’s silence."
"Mr President, I ask for a minute’s silence to be observed today to commemorate the victims of German Nazism."
"The next item is the debate on the Commission Statement on recent environmental disasters (fires in southern Europe)."
". Mr President, we are seeing an increasing frequency in natural disasters here in Europe and around the world."
"As we have seen recently, floods and forest fires wreak havoc, causing human and economic problems and also serious damage to our environment."
"Of course we are trying to combat these problems."
"With regard to forest fires, a series of common measures in the field of prevention, protection and restoration have now been put in place."
"Our rural development programmes provide support for a wide range of forest activities, providing funds for prevention of fires and restoration of forests damaged by fires, according to priorities decided by the Member States."
"In Portugal approximately EUR 149 m from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund is available for prevention and restoration for 2000-2006."
"In Spain the total budget allocated for forestry measures for the same period amounts to EUR 820 million."
"The recently created EU Solidarity Fund was established to respond to major disasters which caused direct damage of more than EUR 3 bn or exceeded 0.6% of the affected country's gross national income."
"Only in very exceptional circumstances can the Solidarity Fund be mobilised for disasters that remain below this high threshold."
"It has already been mobilised following the huge fires last year in Portugal and Spain and, at their request, it provided EUR 48.5 m for Portugal and EUR 1.3 m for Spain."
"The Commission has not yet received any requests for 2004."
"As you know, the Forest Focus regulation is our most recent instrument to monitor and to implement prevention measures in the field of forest fires, as well as to detect the reasons for their frequency."
"The financial framework for the implementation of the Forest Focus scheme for 2003-2006 is fixed at EUR 65 m, of which EUR 9 m can be used for fire prevention measures."
"Our civil protection assistance mechanism is also proving its worth."
"In 2003 and 2004 Portugal sent requests for assistance to the EU Monitoring and Information Centre, which then coordinated support offers from other participating countries."
"Thanks to the mechanism, it was possible to ensure the rapid despatch of aerial forest fire-fighting means to Portugal."
"In 2003 Portugal accepted the assistance of two aircraft from Italy and three aircraft from Germany."
"In 2004 Spain supplied three aircraft, France two, Germany two, Greece two and Italy one."
"Additional assistance was offered by the UK and Norway but was not taken up by Portugal."
"Four years ago I expressed my concerns about the increasing number of forest fires and the damage they cause, stating that the risk for forest fires and the vulnerability of our forests have now reached a level beyond which further fires would seriously endanger the ecosystems and their sustainable management."
"Sadly we saw this happen during last year's heatwave, which hit southern Europe in particular and which culminated in the destruction of large parts of the Portuguese Natura areas."
"I wish to conclude by saying that the Commission has taken your resolution of 4 September 2003 on the effects of the summer heatwave into account, and it serves as a very useful compendium for actions and measures on which to base future initiatives."
"Mr President, I must agree with the Commissioner’s view that the problem of fires in the European Union is having dramatic effects from an environmental point of view."
"There are 45 000 fires per year in the European Union and they are going to become increasingly frequent, because drought, a structural problem in the European Union, is going to cause increasingly serious environmental problems, and not just in the south of Europe, but in the north as well."
"Furthermore, the United Nations’ experts tell us that, as a result of climate change, this problem is going to continue to worsen, and we are faced with a situation in which we have no genuine common policy for combating fires aimed at tackling these 45 000 fires per year in the European Union."
"We lack measures, resources and money."
"I would remind you of Regulation 2158/92, the expiry of which led the European Commission to show that it wanted to put an end to the lines of aid for fighting fires."
"When this Parliament debated Forest Focus, it managed to obtain the ridiculous figure of EUR 9 million until 2006 from the European Commission."
"On the other hand, we have the forestry chapter of the Rural Development Regulation."
"That Regulation has not worked."
"I agree with the Commissioner when she talks about EUR 820 million, but this sum is under-utilised."
"It is badly used because there is no coordination at either inter-regional or inter-State level."
"The Member States act as they wish and improvise."
"It is true that the French have sent two aircraft to help fight the fire in Portugal, but in no way was it done in a coordinated fashion."
"And neither is there any inter-regional coordination."
"An example of this is what has happened this year in Spain."
"There is a region in the north of Spain – Galicia – which contains the greatest area of forest."
"Ninety-nine per cent of the fires that break out in that autonomous region are brought under control within 24 hours."
"Forest fires are fought effectively in Galicia, and progress is being made through forest activation plans which are increasing all the time."
"Its rate of fires is five times less than the average for the Spanish State."
"Nevertheless, in Andalusia we have seen 42 131 hectares burn because the resources available have not been used."
"This is a dramatic situation and this should be a good opportunity to put it right."
"How?"
"By applying a bit of common sense to all this, because, since the European Commission has to present the European forest strategy over the coming months, this must be the opportunity to consider this problem in depth and to implement a forestry policy in the European Union that takes measures for protecting forests from fire seriously and, above all, that helps to coordinate administrations so that, as a minimum and if resources are not increased, the scant instruments available at the moment are used properly and so that the experiences of the Junta de Andalusia and the European Union as a whole this summer never happen again."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the fact that we in this Parliament are once again debating fires demonstrates that there is something we are not doing entirely right."
"The figure relating to the area burnt suggests a genuine ecological disaster."
"In my region alone – as has already been pointed out – in Andalusia, so far this year more than 40 000 hectares of forest have burnt down in a total of 753 fires."
"In view of the consequences of this summer’s fires, we should ask ourselves frankly whether the Commission’s opposition to increasing the budgetary contributions stemming from the Forest Focus Regulation was justified."
"The Commission should also ask itself seriously whether it was right to shift the burden of fire prevention to regional and rural development funds without establishing suitable control mechanisms to ensure that they are actually used for prevention, reforestation and the regeneration of these areas."
"The reality at the moment is that there is an urgent need for help in our countries."
"I would therefore like to ask the Commission to clarify whether it is studying the possibility of allocating any additional funds in order to restore the funds in question."
"The Union should not take a single step backwards in terms of its policy on climate change."
"The question is very clear: does the Commission believe that the European Union is acting appropriately to protect its forest heritage?"
"Does the Commission believe it would be possible to allocate extraordinary funds from the Solidarity Fund or employ some other much quicker mechanism to alleviate the effects of these fires, which are destroying a natural heritage that the whole of Europe benefits from?"
"Mr President, we Greens are very worried about the fact that there is no pre-emptive war against fires."
"We Greens call for a pre-emptive war against fires."
"The current abandonment of rural areas, depopulation, demographic movement away from the countryside, is having horrendous results."
"The European funds do not reach the people responsible for managing the forests."
"The people who have lived from forest resources such as cork, or holm oak acorns, for example, in Andalusia, have lost their source of income."
"This is no accident, but the obvious result of a policy that puts the rural areas last, which does not provide the resources and which is aimed at planting species such as eucalyptus and pine – something which some Members of this House are now criticising but previously advocated – leaving behind a legacy of ignorance which then leads to fires."
"This situation requires investment in civil and rural society, both in programmes like Leader, the abandonment of which is now being considered, and in other rural programmes, which reflect some of the social fabric of Europe."
"We are once again discussing here the issue of forest fires, just as we did last year, when, at our instigation, we discussed the consequences of the devastating summer fires, which, in Portugal alone, were responsible for the deaths of over 20 people and for burning 400 000 hectares of forest, covering almost 5% of Portuguese territory and causing more than EUR 100 million worth of damage."
"Sadly, little has been learnt and this year forest fires have tragically hit my country again, with more than 100 000 hectares of forest burnt. Worst hit has been the Serra Algarvia region, where many families, whose incomes depended on forest products, have been plunged into serious poverty."
"Given the importance of preserving forest heritage, due to its environmental, economic, social and cultural importance, and given the extent of this disaster, what is essential is not only European solidarity and assistance, but also significant investment, Community investment, in reforestation, in research, in coordination, in the area of civil protection, and in funding aerial means of combating forest fires."
"We therefore urge, once again, that our proposals and Parliament’s proposals be complied with, thereby strengthening the element of fire prevention and the relevant funding within the scope of the ‘Forest Focus’ programme, in accordance with the previous Regulation 2158/92."
"We are aware, however, that if we are to solve this problem, we must change the common agricultural policy in order to combat human and economic abandonment of rural areas, since it is the main cause of an agriculture and forestry policy that encourages people to abandon the countryside and prevents these forest areas from surviving economically."
"– Commissioner, I am grateful for the statement you have made to Parliament."
"Whilst it is true that this year’s fires were not as devastating as last year’s, they ought still to be a concern for everyone."
"In my country, Portugal, this is partly because last year, around 11% of Portuguese forest territory was destroyed. In other words, what is already burnt cannot be burnt again."
"The emergency aid approved by Parliament last year, which helped to bolster the resources made available by the government, made a difference. It was a genuine expression of European solidarity with Portugal at a time of suffering for so many Portuguese people."
"A significant part of Europe’s forest heritage cannot be destroyed year upon year with total impunity."
"Quite apart from its relevance for the whole of Europe, the Mediterranean forest is essential to the regional and local economy, to job creation, to the safeguarding of a territory and to the quality of life."
"We are aware that there are environmental reasons, related to climate change and to global warming."
"It is a fact that average temperatures are rising and that the number of days with high temperatures and low humidity is also on the increase."
"We are also aware that criminal acts are often the cause of these disasters. In many cases, however, the disasters are the result of a lack of prevention and an absence of adequate resources to fight the flames."
"As has already been mentioned by, among others, Mrs Herranz Garcia, Parliament set an example when it debated ‘Forest Focus’, which laid down the need to provide the resources to prevent forest fires."
"Better resources are required, both in prevention and in European civil protection assistance and cooperation in the use of major resources, to which you so aptly referred in your speech, Commissioner."
"Lastly, Mr President, I should like to mention something to which we alluded last year and to which we shall probably always allude whenever such circumstances arise: the dedication of the fire-fighters, the dedication of the people who, through their acts of courage, generosity and even heroism, proved what we already know – that in times of tragedy that demonstrate the worst in human nature, there are also many people who demonstrate the best in human nature."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am grateful for your speech and for the solidarity that you have shown."
"This summer’s fires, in the case of Portugal, devastated more than 100 000 hectares, in addition to last year’s disaster. The Algarve was the worst hit area, with 40% of its total area burnt."
"What we are witnessing is a veritable environmental, economic and human tragedy that has become a public catastrophe."
"It is therefore a matter of urgency that we hold a debate on fire prevention measures, backed by real investment. Otherwise, in a few generations’ time, there may be no forests."
"The Mediterranean forest is part of the common heritage of the people of Europe and must therefore be preserved."
"Some of the cork trees burnt were over two hundred years old and most were between one hundred and two hundred years old."
"Some EUR 80 million of damage was caused and replacing these trees would take approximately one hundred years."
"The tendency these days is to channel more funds into addressing the consequences of natural disasters than into preventing them."
"We do not have an unlimited capacity to repair damage and prevention requires political courage and coherent regional development."
"I ask the Commission to show that courage in the face of this tragedy and to table here a restructuring and reorganisation of the Structural Funds, so that these people can see on the horizon at least the possibility of rebuilding their livelihoods to pass on to their grandchildren."
"Mr President, I am well aware that Mrs Wallström knows she has given us a political reply with data and statistics, and she is perfectly aware that, today, European Union aid in the field of forest fires simply consists of money allocated in an arbitrary manner."
"There is no complex strategy, though it is a complex interdisciplinary problem requiring cooperation amongst institutions. It is the job, moreover, of us politicians to solve complex and difficult problems."
"To this end, I believe we must create a model for the management of risks, for management and cooperation, because we are faced with issues ranging from judicial procedures, because there is a lot of terrorism, to the issues of policing, the civil population and the local authorities."
"We must create models, as was done for Agenda 21."
"The European Union is capable of doing this."
"Above all, I am concerned, however, about the need for shared effective technological development, because, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the European Commission must do what the countries or the regions cannot do."
"The problem of technological development is extremely important, in terms, for example, of the transfer of military technology, the development of the GIS and many other things that are being applied in some regions very successfully and which require technology shared amongst the 25 countries, amongst all the regions and amongst all the local authorities, because it is clear that, without that technological progress, all we can hope for is human effort and a lot of good will, but little success."
"Mr President, there is no question that the people mainly responsible for forest fires are the people who cause them."
"In 96% of cases, the causes are attributable to man, and that is why the Spanish Government has announced a series of measures, including stiffer penalties for this crime and a ban on building in the areas in question."
"Neither must we forget other causes, as has already been pointed out."
"The change in the socio-economic structures of rural areas seems to be the most fundamental one, but also the lack of success of European forest and rural development policy."
"The majority of fires start in forests which are uncared-for, as a result of the abandonment of traditional agricultural activity, the ageing of the population and the demographic crisis."
"The EAGGF funds or the rural development policy cannot, however, carry the whole burden of this serious problem, Mrs Wallström."
"The serious environmental consequences of forest fires make European action necessary."
"The difficulties you are aware of in the application of the Solidarity Fund should be alleviated through the creation of a specific rapid intervention mechanism in the event of these disasters of a smaller scale and involving lesser sums than those provided for by the Solidarity Fund."
"Furthermore, and at the same time, European forest policy should be reoriented, recognising the special nature of southern forests and creating a specific plan for their protection and for the complete environmental recovery of the burnt areas."
"I will end by saying something – and I hope it is not taken the wrong way: I believe that party politics should be left out of this debate and that we should seek consensus amongst all of us."
"Otherwise – in Galicia it rains and in Andalusia it does not – certain Members should perhaps start to ask themselves what the EUR 820 million Commissioner Wallström has mentioned has been spent on."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, every year around this time, as we have just seen, another debate is held on the subject of forest fires."
"Fortunately, and even though the effects of fires continue to be too serious and disastrous, the fires which have affected, in particular, the southern Member States of the EU this year have been less fierce, and there has been no summer heatwave causing thousands of deaths."
"In 2002, the European Union set up a Solidarity Fund intended to deal with natural disasters of this kind and their consequences for our peoples."
"Last year, this Fund helped to deal with the aftermath of the fires in southern Europe."
"In late 2003, the Forest Focus Regulation was adopted, but it was allocated only EUR 9 million of funding for the 2003-2006 period, which is not enough to prevent fires."
"In the long run, there are plans for cofinancing via the common agricultural policy and the rural development fund, which means a partial withdrawal from the EU’s forestry policy."
"What image of solidarity do we wish to present to our fellow citizens, especially those from the South?"
"A further problem facing us is the role of forests in the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol."
"Not only do forest fires contribute to climate change as a result of massive CO2 emissions, they also gradually reduce the size of our forests and the Union’s carbon sink capacities."
"We continue, and rightly so, to express our dismay at the fires and other natural disasters which have affected all of Europe over the past few years."
"We cannot, however, show our solidarity with words alone."
"Words are never enough."
"Action is necessary and must be taken to greatly reduce the scale of forest fires and of other natural disasters."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a matter of urgency: we must reduce these disasters and show our solidarity."
". Mr President, this debate has illustrated the complexity of this issue, which affects us at all levels."
"We know that climate change will probably increase these types of extreme weather events and it is quite probable that we will see more of these problems occurring, as the International Panel of Climate Change has told us. That underlines the responsibility that is shared between the different levels."
"The European Union, the Commission and the institutions will have to act in a coordinated way to ensure that we have the necessary capacity."
"Member States will also have to be sure that they have done everything for prevention and that we have a higher level of preparedness to deal with these forest fires, extreme weather events and catastrophes."
"It is a matter of resources – such as fire brigades – and being able to mobilise them quickly."
"It is also a matter of having resources for prevention activities."
"So there is a whole spectrum of activities and responsibilities."
"We are addressing that."
"You know as well as the Commission does that Member States in general are very reluctant to engage in a debate on a common forest policy for Europe, so we are also touching upon very sensitive political issues and responsibilities."
"Even if we set aside more money, it is not always true that this would help immediately, unless there is better coordination of activities, unless there is better planning for prevention and preparedness on the part also of Member States."
"I just want to underline that as welcome as more money is, it is not always a matter of only having more money; there also has to be better planning and coordination in Member States."
"Thank you for this valuable debate on an issue that we risk having to raise again in the near future."
"I appreciate the interest you show in finding common solutions to prevent forest fires, to fight them and also to mitigate the damage they cause – because the funding has often been a matter of mitigating and trying to come in after the damage has been done – as well as to help Member States restore their potential for forestry production."
"I have noted several suggestions that I will also take into due consideration after this plenary part-session and there will be a follow-up."
"I believe we could further increase transparency concerning the application of existing instruments."
"We will also examine the need for additional prevention measures when implementing the Forest Focus regulation as we will do when considering the proposal for the Council's Rural Development regulation."
"As a first modest step, next November the Commission will hold a conference entitled 'Citizen participation from restoration to prevention – good governance for the restoration campaign to follow forest fires in France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Slovenia and Cyprus'."
"So it will also take into account the experience that we have gathered."
"It will focus on restoration and involvement of civil society because, as you said, the causes can be anything from climate change to the human factor."
"We must seek to identify the lessons learned from last year's events, raise awareness among citizens and local and regional authorities, and collect suggestions for the future."
"So there is also work to do to improve our activities in this field."
"I am happy that we have found today a common view on possible actions that we should focus on for the future."
"I once again thank you for this debate."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the next item on the agenda and take the oral question on the International Civil Aviation Organisation."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the reason why I, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, put this oral question to the Commission and the Council, which I hope can in some way consider it, arises from a fundamental concern."
"During these years of attempts to reduce air pollution and its effects on climate change, the greenhouse effect and the effects mentioned a few minutes ago, the International Civil Aviation Organisation has been one of the bodies involved in drafting a policy to combat aircraft pollution."
"This policy also laid down the use of economic instruments – the so-called market instruments – and voluntary measures, as well as the possibility of emissions trading and of introducing taxes and fiscal instruments to reduce that kind of pollution."
"Unfortunately, it seems that recently the policy of the International Civil Aviation Organisation has been leaning towards a different position."
"Decisions taken some time ago basically assigned to this Organisation a task very similar to that of implementing the Kyoto agreements, which involved drafting Organisation guidelines aimed at ensuring that the various countries or organisations such as the European Union could then implement the same standards. Now, however, we are faced with the possibility that at the Organisation’s next meeting, which will take place between 28 September and 8 October in Montreal, an amendment will be tabled which would remove the option to use market instruments to combat pollution from aircraft engines, thus making the whole policy take a step backwards."
"This is already serious in itself."
"While we debate, while we are ever more convinced of the problems we face, while evidence mounts for the link between aircraft emissions and the effects on air quality, this step backwards would be particularly serious."
"In spite of the progress made in drawing up the Organisation’s guidelines, aimed at allowing countries to adopt, operate or create an emissions trading market and possibly to use fiscal instruments, we are confronted with an amendment, backed by the United States as well as other countries, which would not only put an end to this policy of the Organisation, but even prevent the European Union, for example, from taking steps in this direction as well."
"I therefore ask the Commission and the Council if they are aware of this danger, if they share this concern and, consequently, what they intend to do so that we do not take this step backwards."
"Secondly, I ask them what measures they intend to take to maintain the European Union’s right to apply measures of this type, to create an emissions trading market or to be able to introduce fiscal measures aimed at discouraging the use of highly polluting fuels within the European Union or elsewhere."
"In summary, I ask what they think they can do so that the International Civil Aviation Organisation may continue its policy or, at least, so that the European Union may have the right to be able to follow it through to the end."
". Mr President, for many years the International Civil Aviation Organisation has been looking at market-based options designed to limit aviation emissions and introduce the aircraft and operating practices that are best environmentally."
"The ICAO has been looking at three options: taxes on fuel or emissions, emission charges and emissions trading."
"Unfortunately, under pressure from the United States, the Council has decided to propose a resolution which recommends that the ICAO only pursue emissions trading and, therefore, disregard the other options."
"This is clearly contrary to our objectives."
"The Commission shares the view that the European Union must make the most appropriate use of all economic instruments for achieving sustainability in the aviation sector, as it does in other sectors."
"This means pressing to keep all options – taxation, emissions charging and emissions trading – open."
"This view was unanimously supported by all Member States in the Council, in COREPER, when it was discussed in July."
"It is important that we keep all options open, not favouring any particular option at this stage, so that Europe can decide on the best way forward, after further analysis, on the basis of realistic policy alternatives."
"Since there is no certainty at present that any one measure will suffice, disregarding any option that might help limit the impact of aviation on climate change at this stage is not desirable."
"Therefore, even though this will be difficult, the Commission will work during the Assembly to try to achieve a resolution that keeps options open."
"Support from third countries is likely to be limited."
"The situation once again illustrates the isolation of the European Union's position because it is not a full member of the ICAO and does not have the capability to influence the ICAO process from an early stage."
"It also calls for the closest possible cooperation between EU Member States during the Assembly if an acceptable outcome is to be achieved."
"Ultimately, it may be necessary to maintain a European reserve, in order not to be politically committed to implementing such a resolution if it is unsatisfactory."
"This would not be unprecedented; it has been done in the past, notably for the Hushkit Dossier."
"The European position will, at times, be coordinated following normal procedures involving COREPER."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats takes the view that the oral question put by the Group of the Greens and the debate on the forthcoming meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organisation are neither timely nor relevant in content, for the question presupposes that the USA will be presenting the ICAO with a resolution when it meets on 28 September."
"That the debate on emissions trading and state subsidies to the world’s civil aviation industry is happening at all is attributable to a proposal from the ICAO Council."
"Moreover, the debate is taking place at the worst possible time, as neither the Committee on Transport and Tourism nor the plenary are in a position to consider in detail the ICAO’s position paper."
"The internal discussions within the Commission, and, in particular, among the competent Member States, have not yet been concluded either."
"Not only that, but the issue of emissions trading and state subsidies to the air transport sector is far too complicated for this House to be able to comment on it without careful preparation."
"It is also in the passengers’ interests that European airlines should answer questions about the possible effects on air transport and on how they compete with the airlines of third countries – all the more so in view of the extremely heavy economic burdens already placed on European airlines by the consequences of what happened on 11 September 2001 and by the increase in the price of oil."
"There is no disputing the European Union’s right to come to its own autonomous decisions in these matters, and so, for the reasons I have stated, we regard the motions for a resolution tabled by the other groups as ill-considered and premature and will vote against them accordingly."
"– Mr President, I think that the time before the ICAO meeting at the end of September is the perfect moment for the European Parliament to speak its mind on the subject and for us – my dear Mr Schmitt – to discuss it."
"That the issue of air travel and the environment is a sensitive one is something we have noticed from the reactions of some airlines, but what is it all about?"
"We know that air travel and global warming are connected; there is no argument about that."
"We are now talking in terms of the possibility of emissions trading, and the studies carried out to date have got us no further."
"That makes it absolutely necessary to keep all the options open when it comes to reducing emissions, and to do so using instruments that are both environmental and based on the market."
"What matters, then, is that neither the USA nor anyone else, at the meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organisation in Montreal at the end of this month, should slam any doors shut."
"After all, we are not talking about introducing emissions trading today or in the next couple of weeks, but about the future possibility of the EU opting to facilitate this in air transport, using market-based emissions trading instruments; it is this position that the EU should keep open for itself."
"That, Commissioner, is why most of us in this House wholeheartedly support the Commission’s view that, as you have said, the EU should present as united a front as possible within the framework of the ICAO."
"I see it as both right and necessary that this House should underline this once again, so that no doors are slammed shut in the ICAO at the end of this month."
"The USA, too, must come to understand that the EU takes something of a different approach to the environment and air transport."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to say that I am disappointed not to see any Council representatives, for naturally, the Council will also have an important input in this chapter, and it will be the members of the Council who will be voting at the ICAO Meeting."
"I therefore hope, Commissioner, that you will report to the Council representatives on what has been discussed here in this House, because it is, of course, also on them that we will be leaning, for we know that we cannot lean on the Commission."
"We also know that the Commission is not a member of the ICAO, even though we have asked them on many occasions to become a member, not only for aviation, but also for shipping, so that at those international meetings, we as a Union can finally speak with one voice and not only with the voices of the Member States."
"We are not debating a Commission proposal, but the fact that the Commission should keep its hands free to be able to put forward a proposal if it sees the need to do so."
"Essentially, then, we should not be looking for a solution at this precise moment. We only need to ensure that our hands are not tied before we can start the debate."
"In fact, we encountered the same problem when the subject of shipping was being discussed."
"Is it the International Maritime Organisation that decides on its own or can decisions also be taken regionally within the Union?"
"We are now facing the same problem."
"Why could we not do the same for the environment as we did in shipping when, for example, the issue of double-hulled tankers came up?"
"With regard to aviation, can the Union not take the lead as regards measures to make aviation more sustainable?"
"There is absolutely no doubt that we should maintain a sense of balance in this, but as Mr Piecyk stated, neither we, nor the Commissioner for that matter, want our hands to be tied beforehand at global level."
"You have stated, Commissioner, that the Council agreed unanimously with the Commission’s opinion."
"What I would like to know from you is whether this will still be the case at the meeting at the end of the month."
"Are you certain that all 25 members of the Council will be adopting a common position and will thus settle for a reserve, if necessary?"
"Secondly, you stated that our position is receiving very little support from third countries."
"It appears that most of those third countries are following the line of the United States."
"Why is that so?"
"Is there anything else the European Union can do to ensure that we receive support for our position and that, consequently, we can bring about better sustainability?"
"I understand Mr Schmitt’s concerns, but sustainability means that a balance must be maintained socially, ecologically and economically."
"Let there be no misunderstanding: I do not want to overlook the economic aspect in aviation, but it must be possible for us as a Union to adopt a policy without anybody tying our hands beforehand."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful to the Commissioner for pointing out that every instrument is needed in order to guarantee climate protection, and for describing the ICAO goals as contrary to all the goals that we in the EU have set."
"Let me thank you again for that."
"I see this debate as happening at the right time and in the right place, for we must do everything possible to prevent the resolution that the United States of America and other countries are strenuously backing from gaining majority support at the conference in Montreal."
"Let me make three points in relation to this."
"In the first place, this is about the EU’s autonomy in matters concerning Europe."
"What Europe does is Europe’s business, and the European Union, the Commission and the Council, have to decide what that is and determine what this continent’s future requires."
"That is not something that other states out there may do; the decision, then, is for us to take, and, as regards your decision, I wish you the great success for which you have been striving. I also hope that you will win the day."
"My second point is that the EU has always attached a very high value to climate protection and seen it as very important."
"It is for that reason that the European Union signed the Kyoto Protocol."
"That, as you know, was an ambitious thing to do, and we must do all we can to fulfil it."
"That being so, it is quite intolerable that the air transport industry, a threat to the climate and to climate protection, should be exempted from the measures; that really is making a gamekeeper out of a poacher, and we want none of it."
"We know that air travel is a danger, just as we know that railways are a relatively environmentally-friendly system of transport."
"We cannot have rail transport laden down with taxes, including levies on emissions, while air transport, of all things, is not, and hence we want the same law for both."
"Priority must be given to the mode of transport that does not harm the environment, rather than to the one that does."
"Mr President, it looks like the 35th ICAO Meeting will be a memorable one."
"Twenty-one delegations have tabled proposals that are likely to do aviation no good as regards emission levels."
"They are proposing the abolition of the individual initiative of countries or regions to take measures to restrict emissions and its replacement by a more legislative initiative from the ICAO."
"This is a contradiction in terms, because we will never manage to agree on issues such as these in the ICAO."
"The Community is striving towards sustainable development both ecologically and economically, something of which I have for years been wholeheartedly in favour."
"In that light, we should have the courage to face up to reality."
"Aviation and the environment are not compatible."
"In this House, we are making every effort to change this on all kinds of fronts, and we must, above all, continue to do this, in principle with our partners in other parts of the world, but if this proves impossible, without them."
"At present, aviation enjoys improper benefits compared to other transport modes, and this should change."
"Maintaining tax benefits and leaving certain social costs uncovered does nothing to help our cause."
"However, we must make sure that we do not act against our own interests."
"Our measures should not result in European companies having to give up the fight."
"Rules are fine, provided that they apply to all players."
"This is, however, not a licence for stagnation."
"That is why I am also of the opinion that the proposed changes to ICAO resolution A33-7 must be taken off the agenda."
"Sustainable policy requires courage and foresight, and these proposals are lacking in both."
"It is up to the European Community to demonstrate that transport and the environment are less incompatible than the amendments would suggest."
"Mr President, needless to say, as climate spokesperson for the Socialist Group, I gladly support all my fellow Members who have expressed their concern about the present ICAO resolution."
"This would really be a step back, and we need to move forward."
"Our group advocates a very vigorous climate policy and we will not be avoiding difficult decisions in the process – certainly not when a sector is already enjoying tax exemptions and preferential treatment in this way."
"It is aviation itself, then, that we need to tackle."
"We think that the international emission trade for airline companies can be an extra incentive for the development of new and efficient aircraft, thus moving towards sustainable aviation."
"I would urge all my fellow Members, particularly those belonging to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to support the resolution that is before this House, and thus send a clear signal to the United States."
"I would also call on the Commission and the Dutch Presidency, when they next put in an appearance, on no account to support an American proposal for a resolution on this subject during the ICAO Meeting."
"Instead, the European Union, with its partners, should focus on the ICAO making a constructive contribution to the forthcoming conference of the parties in Buenos Aires on the subject of the Kyoto Protocol."
". The emissions from aviation are increasingly significant."
"According to the sector's own analysis, the world passenger aircraft fleet could double by 2020."
"That means an increase from 12 000 aircraft to roughly 25 000 aircraft by 2020."
"This has a significant impact and, therefore, what we do is important."
"The Commission was aware of these problems months ago."
"There have been discussions with Coreper since July and there is definitely a common position between all 25 Member States and the Commission to keep all options open."
"We believe that this is the only way forward."
"The next discussion in Coreper on the future strategy will take place next Friday."
"The Commission and Member States, with the UK taking the lead, are now working on alternative texts, as it is important to do the practical work."
"The Commission will also study the technical feasibility of introducing aviation emissions trading schemes into a general scheme and will look at different solutions in this area."
"The conclusions are expected in nine months, on the basis of which the Commission intends to propose measures."
"Our position is clearly to keep all options open in order to be effective."
"We are grateful for the support of the European Parliament."
"The debate is closed."
"The corresponding vote will take place on Thursday."
"We shall proceed to the next item on the agenda: the debate on the Commission Statement on the consequences of the shipwreck, off the Turkish coast, of a ship containing toxic ash."
". Mr President, according to the information currently available to us, the ship that sank recently in Turkey had originally sailed from Spain in the year 2000 with a cargo of ash from a coal power plant in Spain."
"In May 2000 the Turkish authorities informed the Spanish Ministry of the Environment that they had received 2 200 tonnes of ash that had been exported without authorisation."
"The Turkish authorities classified the waste as hazardous due to its chromium content."
"The Secretariat of the Basel Convention was also informed."
"According to the Spanish authorities, they immediately began to investigate the case."
"The information from the port of Avilés showed that the documents that the ship was carrying were forged, hiding the fact that the waste was originally destined for Algeria but had been rejected there because it was wet and therefore unusable."
"The company exporting the cargo stated that it had not intended to send the waste to Turkey, but to Algeria, and that the captain of the ship had acted without its consent."
"The Spanish authorities took action against the company and required it to take the waste back to Spain for treatment."
"The company appealed against the decision and administrative proceedings went on until the end of 2002."
"In 2003 and 2004 discussions continued as to how to return the ash to Spain."
"In July 2004 the Turkish authorities informed the Spanish authorities that they could proceed with a plan drawn up by the company to transfer the ash to another vessel and return it to Spain."
"However, before this could be done, the vessel sank on 6 September."
"We have strict rules in place that regulate the movement of waste within and outside the European Union."
"Exports of waste for disposal are prohibited."
"Exports of hazardous waste for recovery to OECD countries, including Turkey, have to be notified to the competent authority in the country of export and need the consent of the authorities concerned."
"If an EU Member State discovers that a shipment has taken place without notification, it has to ensure either that the waste is taken back within 30 days or that it is taken care of in an environmentally sound manner."
"According to the information available, Spain was willing to take back the waste and fulfil its legal obligations."
"Unfortunately, legal and administrative problems delayed a solution until it was too late."
"This problem should have been prevented at source."
"Therefore it is one of our priorities to work further towards improving implementation of Community legislation."
"We are holding regular meetings with national authorities to discuss problems of implementation and possible solutions."
"A key issue in this respect is increased cooperation between port authorities in order to tackle, among other things, the problem of port hopping."
"Furthermore, may I remind you that the role of non-EU countries in cases such as this is defined in the Basel Convention on Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Waste and their Disposal."
"Mr President, thank you for your statement, Mrs Wallström."
"We are dealing with another accident at sea, this time in the Mediterranean, which demonstrates the current fragility of the common network we are creating with a view to guaranteeing the greatest possible level of safety at sea."
"The and accidents in Community waters taught us a hard lesson about the European Union’s urgent needs in terms of legislation and maritime traffic control, and the result of this painful process has been a range of very advanced legislative measures whose transposition, entry into force and rigorous application are helping us to make progress towards increasing maritime safety and preventing marine pollution within the Union."
"On the one hand, the need for coordination between the authorities of a Member State of the Union, which at all times has complied with international and Community legislation, and the authorities of an associated State which aspires to membership of the Union and should therefore be making every effort, as it already does in other areas, to comply with what we call the Community acquis in the field of environmental protection. On the other, we need to deal with the contradiction between the two factors which come into play in this type of accident: urgent practical decisions and measures for dealing with the environmental emergency which has taken place and the much more time-consuming issue of the legal requirements relating to disputes, together with the problems of identifying the people ultimately responsible, resulting from the tangle of interests in the field of maritime traffic, something which this House has repeatedly condemned."
"In this case, we can affirm that from the outset the Spanish authorities have fulfilled the requirements of the Basel Convention, opening proceedings against the company and obliging it to return the ash and also ensuring all the necessary coordination with the Turkish authorities and providing all the help and technical assistance necessary for the ash to be returned to Spain."
"Unfortunately, the time periods, particularly those stemming from the embargo imposed on the ship by the Turkish authorities, have meant that, recently, since 7 July, the Turkish authorities have finally had free access to the ship."
"On that date, the embargo was finally lifted and therefore the company, owing to pressure from the Spanish authorities, acknowledged the need and their obligation to return the ashes."
"It is too short a time period and the ship, which was already in a pretty horrendous condition, as demonstrated by the number of occasions it has been detained in the past, has finally sunk in circumstances which have yet to be clarified."
"I must point out that, from the outset, the Spanish authorities have considered that assistance to be necessary, that there is now a technical assistance mission heading for Turkey and that, in relation to this case, we will once again have to consider whether the players operating in this tangle of legislation and maritime traffic have or have not met their obligations: the company, the authorities, the captain, etc."
"Mr President, I believe we are looking at the tip of the iceberg."
"This is not a chance happening, it is not an isolated case, we are talking about the number-one company in the construction materials sector: ."
"We are talking about a time period of four years, when the time limit for returning the waste should be 30 days."
"What has happened over these three and a half years or more?"
"What has the European Commission done?"
"We are asking the Commission for a policy of zero tolerance."
"As I speak, I am sure there are dozens and dozens of ships in the same situation."
"What is that company doing exporting vast quantities of the same material to Algeria, having been fined 18 times, without any public transfer and without the Commission finding out?"
"We believe that the European Commission should step in through the adoption of clear penalties in the event of infringements."
"Infringement proceedings should be opened to ascertain the causes and the people responsible for the disaster."
"We cannot wait around for fine words in relation to this disaster; we cannot accept a quarrel which goes on and on forever."
"– Mr President, the Commissioner has recounted a scandalous story to us."
"For four years, a ghost ship with forged documents has been breaking every rule, every directive, every international convention, and there is no way of applying legislation and the law."
"It is driven out of Algeria and goes to Turkey."
"Turkey does not want it, but no one can impose what, for the rest, we all want to vote through."
"We face a huge ecological disaster and a huge failure on the part of the European Commission to practise what it quite rightly preaches."
"It is therefore time to stop merely talking and to start acting."
"I call, on behalf of my political group and as a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safetyfor the Commission to apply the 'polluter pays' principle at long last, not only to those who owned the vessel but also to those who owned the product, the cargo, and to everyone else involved in this saga."
"The basic political conclusion, if we are honest, is that rich industry in the north must stop using poorer countries in the south as one big illegal dumping ground for toxic waste."
"We are talking about 2 200 tonnes of waste, containing carcinogenic chromium, contaminating the waters of the Mediterranean and we know full well that contamination has cross-border repercussions."
"Commissioner, it is time for action, not just the right words."
"Mr President, it is self-evident that things went badly wrong for the waste ship in south-western Turkey."
"It is also clear that this disaster could have been avoided."
"Now, more than 300 million litres of water have been polluted, and the clearing operation will require huge investments."
"It is much more important, however, to look for ways to avoid situations like this in future."
"This particularly applies to the implementation and enforcement of the Basel Convention and the European Regulation for the movement of waste, on the review of which I have, as rapporteur, been working hard for more than a year now."
"The current Regulation clearly stipulates that Member States need to take back their cargo if it is refused for good reason."
"In November last year, the European Parliament proposed to extend the grounds for refusal."
"I would take this opportunity of calling on the Commission to adopt these proposals by this House."
"The carried hazardous waste, and, as it is extremely unusual for a ship to set sail without authorisation from the receiving country, it appears that Spain acted in contravention of the rules."
"I would therefore like to ask the Commission to take additional enforcement measures, and, if need be, legal action."
"Mr President, in this debate about the environmental disaster involving the , I hope that you will allow me to make a few observations that I see as being of fundamental importance."
"Firstly, the environmental disaster that we potentially face has to do with toxic waste from thermal power stations, so maybe the time has come to stop pointing to nuclear energy as the only scapegoat."
"In my country, for example, the government has committed itself to phasing out nuclear energy completely within the foreseeable future."
"It is very questionable whether the environment will eventually derive benefits from this, since there are no real alternatives at present and this is once again an illustration of the fact that the very real and serious problem of toxic waste is not only the result of nuclear energy."
"Secondly, I am a Euro-sceptic."
"I am very critical of European interference and of excessive intervention at European level in the politics and culture of our Member States, with the exception of environmental protection, which requires the closest possible cooperation."
"Indeed, this is one of the few areas – and one in which progress has been minimal – in which this very close cooperation is an absolute necessity and can also be democratically legitimised by public approval."
"Thirdly, we are once again establishing that we must strive towards the best possible relations with our neighbouring country, Turkey."
"I fear for the future if a blind Europeanism in this neighbouring country were to create the impression that it could, in time, really become a member of our European Union."
"Neither geographically, culturally, nor historically is Turkey a European country, and we must now have the courage to say so, and only on the basis of this candid stance can we, both now and in the future, maintain the best and closest friendly relations with our Turkish neighbour."
"– Mr President, although I do not want to drag matters out, there is something remarkable about a ship being held somewhere for four years, a ship that has already been the subject of 18 proceedings for transporting prohibited materials, and one that is over 35 years old."
"The effect of the over recent years, has been some small progress in lawmaking, and if the Member States were to be more prompt in processing the Commission’s proposals, we might well make some progress as regards pollution of the environment and criminal law."
"It is not the Commission that is dragging its feet, but the Member States."
"Even though we are seeing a changeover to a new Commission and will not be able to sort this out this evening, let me ask, Commissioner, that the Commission should respond to this calamity by producing a proper report with good analysis of both the environmental and transport aspects; then it might put forward some proposals for legislation, perhaps as part of the package."
"Then we will be able to use European law to close the loopholes whose presence this calamity has made so obvious, or, where there is negligence or a lack of vigilance, we will know who is responsible."
"It will enable the imposition of sanctions for sloppy work."
"I think it would be possible to do this over the next few months, so that we not merely learn from this catastrophe, but also make our seas rather safer in future than they have been in the past."
"– Mr President, the shipwreck of the , carrying toxic waste without a consignee between Spain, Algeria and Turkey, and another ecological disaster, which will even have repercussions on the food chain, via fish, confirm what we too have been saying in the European Parliament for years now: that toxic waste management and pollution of the marine environment cannot be addressed solely as crimes, because everything still takes second place to safeguarding and increasing the profits of big business, which controls the sources of energy and production, and of shipowners, who control the means of transport."
"Who, after this accident, which has been waiting to happen for years, given that the ship was moored in the port of Iskenderun for four years, would now dare to claim, as crowing reports and expert opinions have claimed from time to time, that 80% of accidents are due to human error?"
"We have always denounced such claims as mistaken, unscientific and suspicious, because they endeavour to conceal the fact that toxic and nuclear waste are transported unchecked from large, monopoly-owned factories with the backing of governments, state authorities and shipping companies, while at the same time revealing the adverse consequences of an old fleet and poor surveys."
"The sole purpose of initiatives to date, including those of the European Union, has been to prevent a public outcry by concealing who is responsible and promoting the interests of big business."
"I think that the baton for action needs to be passed to the grass-roots movement, so that it can overturn this policy, introduce strict measures governing the transportation of toxic and nuclear waste and, on a more general note, protect human life, the sea, public health and the environment."
". Mr President, honourable Members, we have a common interest in keeping our seas safe and preventing environmental catastrophes of this kind."
"I would, of course, never contradict the Commission's statement – probably supported by all institutions – that we should learn from accidents of this kind."
"We should also do everything to prevent this continuing to be only the tip of the iceberg."
"We also know that there is a lot of money involved in wasted shipments; but I do not accept that the Commission should take the blame for everything that has happened in this particular case."
"It is not the responsibility of the Commission alone."
"We have a responsibility, we will accept that to the full; but in this case, I repeat, the problem should have been prevented at source."
"It is not entirely a legal problem or to do with something missing in the legislation, but it is a combination of illegal actions and legal and administrative problems, which delayed a solution until it was too late."
"We have to concentrate on implementing environmental legislation to the full, thus avoiding problems of this kind."
"Of course, we will see if there is anything to be learned from this."
"Can we act in a better way, can we prevent this happening in the future?"
"It is also very clear from the existing legislation where the responsibility lies."
"It is not that this case opens up enormous gaps in the existing legislation, but rather how the legislation is being interpreted, implemented and enforced in different Member States."
"The issue was raised about the ‘polluter pays’ principle, which is one of the fundamental principles in EU legislation and in EU environmental policy."
"But in this case the pollution has taken place outside the EU where, of course, the Commission has no competence to apply EU law."
"We have to get the facts right."
"I hope this discussion will prove fruitful for the future, because it is in our common interest to make sure that this does not happen again and that we learn lessons and can keep our seas safe."
"It is very important that enforcement is also carried out, to make sure that the signal goes out to all actors in cases like this."
"Thank you for a good debate."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"(1)"
"Please note that yesterday evening the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs unanimously adopted the report by Mr Bourlanges."
". Mr President, please excuse me, but the time it took to find the rapporteur, to get him seated, and to find him a microphone that works, means that his speaking time is pretty well used up."
"I simply wanted to say that we are in fact requesting urgent procedure for the measures relating to the freezing of the assets of war criminals in the former Yugoslavia."
"Our committee had already debated this before being asked to do so, which we were in fact doing only yesterday."
"The Council has asked us for urgent procedure, and we regard that request as justified for the very simple reason that, as my grandmother used to say fifty years ago, you do not want to wait until the cows have gone before shutting the gate to the enclosure."
"What that means is that, if we want to act effectively in freezing the assets of war criminals, the procedure for doing so must be adopted as soon as possible."
"I therefore endorse the Council’s request for urgent procedure, as does the committee of which I am chairman."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my Committee, I ask that the request for urgent procedure be refused."
"The funding to be allocated to the new financial instrument for the Turkish Cypriot community – amounting to EUR 259 million – relates to the period from 2004 to 2006."
"Only EUR 6 million was provided this year for feasibility studies, so this should not be a problem."
"I would add that the legal basis – Article 308, in consequence of which Parliament is still consulted – is not uncontentious, and I am being cautious in my use of language when I say that."
"I can also tell you, however, that, although we have no difficulties of any substance as regards the content of the Commission proposal, the political significance of this issue means that we do need more time to examine it more closely."
"What I would propose to you is that we should make a prompt start on the work and come to a decision on this point at this House’s second October part-session."
"I think that this delay should not give rise to any problems when it comes to playing our part in improving relations between the two ethnic communities."
"I would ask you to support the proposal."
"– Mr President, I just wanted to say, on behalf of my group, that we endorse the view expressed by the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, that this is not a vote on the content, but about our shared view that this matter needs prompt and thorough discussion."
"The message we should be sending to the world out there is that we are ready to discuss this, but not as a matter of urgent and topical importance."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should now like to address you as President of the House."
"I will begin by saying how honoured I am that you have decided to place your trust in me and choose me as President of Parliament."
"At the time you elected me, I said I would wait until this plenary sitting to outline my strategic vision of the first half of this legislature to you."
"Obviously, this does not entail presenting a political programme or putting forward my own ideas on the building of Europe."
"As President, my aim is simply to describe the priorities on our agenda and place them in context."
"As I do so, I should like to share with you my pride in belonging to this, the greatest of all multinational parliamentary institutions."
"It stands for peace and democracy whilst respecting diversity."
"Although many Europeans are not sufficiently aware of the fact, this House is a forum for debates and decisions affecting our daily lives and the future of the world we are to live in."
"Our shared pride must go hand in hand with a sense of responsibility."
"It is incumbent on us to be responsible as we exercise our powers, determine our stance on international affairs, and ensure the smooth operation of this enlarged Parliament."
"The Union’s legitimacy springs from two sources."
"One is to be found in this House and flows from the citizens of Europe it represents."
"There is no reason why it should always be in line with the other, which flows from the Member States."
"This Parliament now brings together 25 parliamentary traditions."
"It expresses itself in 20 official and working languages, with the consequent expense and complexity."
"Even this large number of languages does not reflect the whole of Europe’s linguistic diversity, as I am often reminded."
"I have had occasion to discharge the aforementioned responsibility during the last few days of the summer break."
"It has been my sad duty to issue a series of statements on behalf of the House, condemning unequivocally those terrorist attacks and actions inflicted on different parts of the world in a most cruel and savage manner."
"The European Parliament is therefore at one with all democrats in expressing its sadness and solidarity with all of those families so unfairly cast into mourning by that brutal scourge that unfortunately no country is now free from."
"I approached the 25 Heads of State or Government of the Member States of the Union with a view to expressing this feeling in the most solemn and collective manner possible."
"I suggested all schools across the Union should join us, the representatives of the citizens of Europe, in a minute’s silence today in memory of the child victims of the Beslan school killings and more generally, in memory of all other child victims of terrorism."
"I am happy to say that several countries have already agreed to participate, thus allowing European citizens to express their feelings on these terrible events."
"This House condemns and rejects all terrorist acts because, regardless of its affiliation or the country where it takes place, terrorism negates the very values on which the European Union is based."
"The people hope a united Europe will be better able to combat this threat, which is one of the main causes of concern and insecurity in the region."
"I am bound to say that expressing the horror we feel is not enough."
"When condemnations follow each other in quick succession, our words of anguish come to reflect frustration and impotence."
"There can be no excuse or reason for events as ghastly as those we witnessed towards the end of the summer or for what took place on 11 September in New York, or on 11 March in Madrid."
"Terrorism of all kinds is to be condemned."
"The debate currently taking place at world level, however, especially in our western and developed world, concerns how to combat terrorism in all its forms, rather than condemning it."
"Obviously, suicidal fanaticism will not be brought to an end by reasonable arguments put forward by cultured and intelligent individuals."
"On the other hand, one cannot expect to eliminate all its causes through the simple and indiscriminate use of force, taking revenge on other children for the harm inflicted on our own and triggering an unbearable spiral of violence."
"The war on terrorism will not be won if terrorism is perceived as a conventional war."
"This House should develop the area of freedom and security."
"It must actively promote an anti-terrorist strategy based on international cooperation involving the police, the judiciary and the intelligence services."
"International cooperation is also needed to tackle the underlying causes breeding murderous and suicidal fanaticism."
"No analysis equates to justification."
"Parliament’s debates and resolutions should never be interpreted as justification for terrorist violence."
"The fight against terrorism requires us to consider its causes in order to combat it more effectively."
"Parliament must continue to debate with full freedom of conscience, as it has done to date."
"In particular, it must consider the situation in Chechnya, in Iraq and in Palestine, regardless of the angry reactions that may follow."
"Ladies and gentlemen, a further source of concern and insecurity in Europe has featured in the news this summer."
"I refer to the increasingly common decision to transfer companies’ economic activity within an integrated economic area, in order to benefit from a more favourable fiscal and labour situation."
"This has become known as relocation."
"You will have noted that this phenomenon produces a defensive reaction in certain Member States that can impact on the Union’s solidarity policies."
"It certainly makes very clear the conflict of interest between economic competitiveness and social cohesion."
"These two aims ought to be complementary for us."
"Both are vital to the building of Europe and to the Lisbon Strategy in particular."
"This is all more complicated than it appears."
"A simple numerical comparison of labour costs is probably not the only explanation of the phenomenon."
"The debate is bound to be of particular interest to those Europeans hoping Europe will prove to be a solution, not a problem."
"It should therefore feature prominently in Parliament’s work, and mainstreamed in the many issues filling our agenda."
"I shall refer to these later."
"I venture to remind you first that the primary duty of the House is to contribute to the optimum performance of the enlarged Parliament."
"Romania and Bulgaria will soon be represented here too."
"It is important for Parliament to bear in mind that it is an institution in receipt of public funds facing new challenges of size and efficiency."
"I shall myself chair a working group tasked with ensuring that the size of the House does not detract from its effectiveness."
"Two issues are particularly significant in this connection, namely the Statute for Members and the language regime."
"I stated earlier that the Statute would be a priority issue."
"Accordingly, on 8 September, I met with Mr Balkenende, President-in-Office of the Council, who assured me that he would make contact as appropriate with representatives of the governments that were unable to endorse the draft Statute, and establish what alternative measures they had in mind."
"I should remind you that Parliament was never informed of the reasons why certain countries were unable to agree to the draft."
"I do not believe that the consensus reached in the House should be jeopardised until this information is received."
"I would like to reiterate, however, that we remain fully prepared to enter into dialogue and open to any suggestions made by the Council or the Member States best placed to promote an agreement."
"Concerning the language regime, I must remind the House that its implementation is governed by provisions laid down by the Bureau of the previous Parliament, through a Code of Conduct on Multilingualism."
"I appeal to all Members, especially to the committee bureaux and coordinators, to make every effort to ensure correct application of the Code, bearing in mind the scant interpreting and translation resources available. It will be some time before the situation improves."
"I urge you all to make a sustained effort to adjust the language cover for working meetings to the resources available."
"In the previous plenary certain Members argued for the right to express themselves in their mother tongue, even when it is not yet an official Union language."
"In this regard, I must point out to them that the language regime is authorised by Council agreements."
"A unanimous decision in Council is required."
"Until the relevant decisions are taken, the Presidency must insist on compliance with the Rules of Procedure, regardless of its personal views on the matter."
"I should also like to emphasise that if and when the Constitutional Treaty is ratified, the European Parliament will come of age. It will then have a framework in which its roles and responsibilities are defined once and for all."
"Nonetheless, if it is eventually ratified, the Constitution will not come into force until 1 November 2006."
"In the meantime, one of the main tasks before the House is to stimulate a wide-ranging debate on ratification of the Constitutional Treaty."
"Between 29 October, the date when the Constitutional Treaty is to be signed in Rome, and 1 November 2006, when it is due to come into force, my Presidency will be dominated by the ratification of the European Constitution in the 25 Member States."
"Ratifications are set to take place at the rate of roughly one a month. In most cases, the procedure will involve a referendum."
"My home country, Spain, will be the first to hold its referendum, in February 2005."
"This two-year period will be an excellent opportunity for Europeans to learn about the Europe they wish to create, as it is defined in the text."
"It will be a chance for the citizens to assess what such a Europe could mean for them and why it is important for them."
"Members of this House are called upon to be at the service of the citizens."
"Creative ways of communicating with the latter and establishing helpful positions for them must be found."
"A report drafted by Mr Corbett and Mr Mendez de Vigo and debated in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is to be adopted before the end of the year."
"Parliament must strive to become a genuine European assembly."
"It must become a model of open, plural and democratic debate."
"It must not be dismissive, hypocritical or claim a monopoly over European spirit or logic."
"Nobody can claim ownership of the one true idea of Europe."
"The debate is bound to be complex due to the range of identities and ideologies, and the different ways in which the various parties understand the notion of Europe we want to achieve."
"This is why the key issues in the draft Constitution must be dealt with in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, in major debates."
"I have asked the Chairman of this committee to forward me specific proposals on which to base the parliamentary debate."
"The debate itself is not as important as the way it is perceived by the citizens, however."
"The latter need to be informed on the nature of the Constitution, on what it does and does not actually contain."
"It is crucial for them to vote on the text of the Constitutional Treaty itself, and not in response to the political situation in each of their countries."
"Once Parliament has formed its opinion, it must ensure that its view is known and taken into account in the ratification process."
"It is most regrettable that the latter will not be more genuinely pan-European, close to the people, and that it will not take place in all countries!"
"Our main challenge must be to Europeanise the debate and ensure internal political issues do not impinge on it, as was the case in the recent European elections."
"The House will liaise with the national parliaments. It already worked closely with the latter during the Convention."
"In addition, I shall personally chair a working group tasked with promoting the Constitution as a political project that will be the subject of the most significant debate Europeans have engaged in since they set out together to journey into the future, leaving behind the devastation of war."
"I invite you all to play your part."
"Parliament needs to deal with some more pressing issues beforehand."
"The first of these is the investiture of the Commission."
"Certain press reports have alleged that this is merely a formality."
"There are those who believe that the outcome is a foregone conclusion, and that the House will simply go through the motions, and not provide any added political value."
"You know that is not the case, ladies and gentlemen. The House must prove it to the world."
"Members are entitled to their views on the Barroso Commission."
"Nonetheless, its investiture presents a splendid opportunity to make the main guidelines of its programme known."
"It is also an opportunity to become acquainted with the personal and political talents of the men and women who make up the incoming Commission, and to become aware of what Parliament’s political groups are demanding of it."
"The Commission is, of course, the engine of the Community’s government."
"At the start of my address I referred to two major issues currently causing insecurity in Europe, namely terror and the social factors affecting employment."
"The new Commission’s statements and proposals on these two subjects are eagerly anticipated, as are its views on reform of the Stability Pact."
"The Prodi Commission’s initial response is already known, and it is also known that the Commissioner concerned will remain in office."
"There will also be an opportunity to continue debating the proposed reform of this Pact, which has such considerable bearing on the Lisbon Strategy."
"Mr Barroso has placed it at the top of his agenda."
"Questions must be asked concerning how the Commission intends to make Europe a model where environmental issues, sustainable development and development aid are concerned. The Commission’s views on the concentration of the media in Europe, and on how it might react to this problem, also need to be ascertained."
"It is important to establish the Commission’s approach to the relationship between Europe and other continents and with the Islamic world, and also its approach to the development of the Euro-Mediterranean relationship and reinvigorating the flagging Barcelona process."
"We are eager to learn what kind of relationship the Commission intends to forge with this House, and how it envisages its relationship with the Council’s High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy during this transitional stage."
"All these issues will be raised. An effort will also be made to ensure that hearings are livelier, more spontaneous and less rigid than in the past."
"Once the Commission has been invested, in my capacity as President of this House, I shall call on it to increase its presence in the European Parliament."
"I shall ask the President of the Commission to hold regular meetings with the presidents of the political groups. I shall ask the Council to do likewise, particularly Mr Solana, the European Union High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"The House must continue its usual legislative work, in which the Reach Directive on chemical products stands out."
"In addition, however, there are three important matters to be discussed before the end of the year."
"Given its strategic importance, I shall mention Turkey first."
"The Conference of Presidents is due to receive the Prime Minister of Turkey, Mr Erdogan, on 23 September, as we hoped."
"Mr Erdogan will therefore visit Parliament prior to the Commission tabling its report, as was our wish."
"In theory, Parliament has no say in the decision on whether or not to open accession negotiations in December. Consequently, the House is not required to express its view on the matter."
"It would, however, be inconceivable for us not to make our voice heard at the start of this long journey because at the end of it, whenever that might be, the agreement of the House will be required."
"It should be borne in mind that the important thing about journeys is not their length, but where they lead."
"In my view, the House should prepare a report on the accession of Turkey before the December European Council, so that we can make our views known to the latter."
"Ladies and gentlemen, issues such as Turkish accession serve to justify Parliament’s existence."
"They are an opportunity for the House to become involved, and cease to be a mere spectator."
"Decisions of this nature could be times when the two sources of legitimacy do not coincide."
"Governments may come to a different conclusion from the people."
"It is certainly an excellent opportunity to debate the nature of the Europe we hope to create, and the consequences of going about it in one way rather than another."
"It is very much to be hoped, therefore, that the Commission will produce an objective report. This would enable the House and the Council to form a political judgment in full awareness of the consequences of a decision one way or the other."
"I refer to the implications of Turkey’s accession for the Union, and the implications its rejection could have for our relations with the Islamic world. The same applies to acceptance or rejection of the Constitution."
"Parliament needs to free itself from all preconceived ideas and unfounded reactions as it engages in this debate."
"The debate should be seen as part of the strategic perspective, with a view to the medium term."
"This is because the House needs to be aware, as I am sure it is, that the most important challenge facing the Europe of the future is its relationship with the Islamic world. That relationship involves Iraq, Afghanistan and Palestine."
"It is also a relationship underpinned by a new neighbourhood policy, the Euro-Mediterranean partnership and the integration of immigrants into our cities."
"There are 10 million Muslims in Europe and 1 000 million in the world."
"Regardless of the decision taken, it is incumbent on us to prove to the Islamic world that we do not set our borders according to the clash of civilisations some are determined to bring about."
"By way of contribution to our debate, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to inform you that I have received a report drawn up for the Commission by an expert group including three distinguished Members of this House. The report has kindly been made available to the European Parliament."
"Allow me to suggest that it is well worth reading."
"The House will also need to take a decision on the financial perspectives before the end of the year. The Commission has completed its initial draft and we are due to receive it shortly."
"Clearly, the Union’s financial resources need to be in line with our ambitions and allow the expectations enlargement has raised in many citizens to be met, whilst taking account of the concerns it has raised amongst others."
"The 2007-2013 financial package contains more than budgetary proposals."
"It is much more than a budget."
"It is a reference framework for a whole range of legislative proposals on financing the common agricultural policy, the Structural Funds, youth programmes, Trans-European networks and so on. The final shape of the reference framework approved will determine almost all of our legislative tasks."
"The House will have a vital role to play in the adoption of a legislative package."
"Its role in the adoption of this package composed of over 50 proposals will be essential, as it will have to be adopted by the codecision or assent procedures."
"This will be another excellent opportunity to show Parliament is not simply a talking shop, but a body that actually takes decisions on specific issues with far-reaching consequences."
"It will in fact be a unique opportunity for the House to promote its political priorities."
"The citizens of Europe cannot fail to take this on board if we contrive to translate our jargon into their everyday language."
"To this end, I have suggested to the Conference of Presidents that a temporary committee be set up to launch the debate, bringing together all the points of view from which it should be approached."
"The plenary is to decide on this today."
"The budget is the hub where all the spokes of the European wheel come together."
"All its details need careful consideration."
"That is why I believe that an committee, possibly chaired by the President of Parliament, would send out a clear message on the importance we attach to this task."
"It is essential to keep in mind that the financial perspective links in with other aspects of our policies the citizens are constantly hearing about, though I suspect they fail to grasp their full implications."
"I have in mind the Lisbon Strategy and the Stability Pact."
"One might well wonder what is supposed to be stabilised, and if it is prices, why only them."
"By 2005, five years will have elapsed since the Union decided to set itself the aim of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth, with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion."
"Does the House not think all this is beginning to ring rather hollow, and that the significant political implications involved were not accompanied by the democratic debate needed to generate the spark required for growth?"
"It has to be recognised that the Lisbon objectives are not being met, and that it seems unlikely that they will be between now and 2010."
"It is incumbent on Parliament to sound a note of concern regarding this vital objective for the future of the Union."
"It keeps being restated, like a mantra, whilst insufficient thought has probably been given to how best to attain it."
"Mr Kok will be invited to present the report he is charged with drawing up, concerning the shortcomings of the process and its prospects for the future."
"I believe debate in the House should centre on this report."
"The objectives set out at Lisbon were extremely ambitious, and were established against the background of the economic prosperity enjoyed in 2000, shortly before the start of the crisis that was later intensified by terrorism."
"This must be admitted, as should the fact that the objectives were the subject of an intergovernmental process relying on the good will of the Member States for their implementation, through a coordination procedure in need of strengthening."
"It is well known that throughout this period investment in technology has been low in comparison with the United States, and that the latter is still draining off our best brains."
"This probably calls for a focused debate."
"Human capital is not being developed as was decided at Lisbon."
"The Lisbon Process goes hand in hand with the increased prominence given to environmental policies. Like the Maastricht criteria, Kyoto will put pressure on Europe."
"Our society will be forced to change its methods of production and consumption in a way that the citizens may not yet be sufficiently aware of."
"We are in favour of this, but will have to consider what it means and fulfil the ensuing obligations."
"Turning to the proposed reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, I believe Parliament should make an effort of political imagination to make it work for the Lisbon Strategy, even though the House only has limited competence in this area."
"More generally, I feel Parliament should endeavour to bring more democratic debate to bear on the main guidelines of European economic policy."
"The debate must take place in this House, with the involvement of national parliaments, so that they feel part of European decisions with consequences for budgetary debates in each country."
"In this connection, I welcome the arrival of Mr Juncker, known as Mr Euro."
"It is certainly true that we did have a problem in Europe regarding the call for greater coordination of economic policy."
"It will of course be necessary to study the role played by the European Union at world level. Special attention must be paid to transatlantic relations."
"I think the time has come for the House to demonstrate the maturity and responsibility of its parliamentary diplomacy by working more closely with the Commission and the Council on the international scene."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is a role model for the rest of the world."
"The founding fathers had a vision of a united and reconciled continent."
"That so-called European dream has now come true. Unfortunately, it has lost its democratic magic in the process."
"It no longer has the power to stir wills and engender active consensus."
"Allow me to set you a challenge, ladies and gentlemen."
"Dare one dream a different European dream, a dream of a more pluralistic Europe?"
"Dare one dream of a Europe that differs from the one the founding fathers and the six founding Member States had in mind?"
"Is it possible to fashion an ideal for a civilisation based on inclusiveness, which would help combat intolerance, the rejection of immigrants, ethnic conflict and religious intolerance?"
"I believe Parliament must engage in this endeavour."
"After all, most of the citizens it represents realise, at least intuitively, that none of their countries will be able to cope with globalisation on their own."
"No single country will be able to deal with environmental imbalances either, or with the emergence of so-called Continent States, terrorist threats, poverty or the resulting immigration."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the time has come for the citizens of Europe to make their voice heard."
"I want to work shoulder to shoulder with you, and hope we can succeed in mobilising the peoples of our continent and in breathing new life into its societies, so that this new European dream can come true."
"Good luck and thank you very much for your attention."
"– Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, let me, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, thank the President for his speech."
"It is, I think, clear that this House as a whole can endorse the broad outlines that you have sketched out, and we will support you in your effort to strengthen the hand of the European Parliament, in so far as we are able to do so."
"You spoke as the representative of what is one of the most important institutions in the European Union, if not the most important."
"Let me say, in the presence of the Vice-President of the Commission, that I very much regret – and this is not a criticism of the Dutch Presidency, but of the Council’s General Secretariat – that the Council is not present on this important day."
"That is something that will have to change."
"In the past, too, we have heard Presidents of the Commission outline their strategic programmes, which are about making laws, and that is what Parliament and the Council of Ministers exist to do, yet even then the Council was not present!"
"I call upon the General Secretariat of the Council to ensure in future that the Presidency of the Council is represented in this House, for that is the General Secretariat’s function – to ensure that the most important institutions are present."
"You take up office, Mr President, at a time when we have Members from the twenty-five countries of the European Union here, and you were right to address the language issue."
"What distinguishes us is our commitment to Europe’s unity in diversity, and that is why we have all the languages of the European Union here in the European Parliament."
"I see the main task facing us – facing you as President and us in the groups – as being to have respect and high regard for each other and for all our national and personal backgrounds, whilst nonetheless being aware that, at the end of the day, we are, men and women, Europeans together, seeking to work together to make this Parliament stronger."
"You spoke about our relationship with the Commission."
"Everyone here in this House knows that our group did, of course, support José Manuel Durão Barroso as President-designate of the Commission; that does not mean, however, that the healthy tension that exists between the Commission and Parliament has thereby been dissolved."
"Instead, even before the whole Commission gets our vote of confidence, we must get the President-designate of the Commission to make important concessions to us in this House as to how the European Parliament can be given greater powers in relation to the European Commission."
"For that reason, our group has submitted a list of ten points that we want to see put into practice before we give the Commission as a whole our votes and put our trust in it."
"We want the Commission to consult with Parliament when considering how to formulate its strategic policy programme, we want the Commission to take the subsidiarity principle into account when proposing legislation, and we want this to result in a reduction in bureaucracy in Europe, with the Commission giving us prognoses in this regard when submitting its proposals for legislation."
"We also want to know what it is all going to cost."
"You referred to REACH, which is not just about reshaping chemicals policy."
"That is something we will have to argue about."
"In essence, it is about us maintaining jobs in the European Union and creating new ones, and the European Union must not, through its own legislation, contribute to the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs, for example as a result of chemicals policy."
"That is why we must join together with the Council – which is why I find its absence regrettable – in getting the relationship between the environment and the economy right."
"Let me tell you what our main task is. When we talk about Europe’s ability to compete, this is not something abstract to do with businesses; it has to do with workers in the European Union being in jobs and with businesses not taking themselves off to America or other parts of the world and the jobs being lost to Europe."
"One of the core points our President addressed – and this is something I welcome – was terrorism."
"Terrorism can never be justified, and we must fight it with all the strength and determination at our disposal."
"Likewise, though, the need to fight terrorism must not mean that we jettison human rights."
"We have to value the life and dignity of a European as much as the life of a Palestinian; we have to affirm that the life of an American is worth as much as that of a Chechen and that of a Muslim as much as that of a Christian or a Jew."
"That is why, necessary though it is to combat terrorism, we in this House – without regard to the ‘reasons of state’ that governments invoke – must always speak up for human rights throughout the world."
"Whether it is convenient for us or not, whether the regimes we are dealing with are left-wing or right-wing or of any other description, we must always defend human rights in the world without deferring to reasons of state."
"I hope you will not mind if I conclude by saying something about the Members’ Statute."
"We want one, but the ball is now in the Council’s court."
"We have done our work; now it is the Council’s turn, and if the Council of Ministers does not want the matter to go any further, then it has only to say so."
"We have done our work, and we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wish you, Mr President, every success in yours."
"If you stand up for Europe as a community – and I have no doubt that you will – then we will always be by your side."
"The best of luck to you!"
"– Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly thank you, Mr President, for your speech."
"You addressed the points that we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament regard as fundamental to the future that we face, and so we are glad that you have spoken about them."
"I am not able to follow up all the points you raised, nor would I wish to do so, but I would like to revisit a number of the keywords that you used, because they determine the direction in which this House must develop."
"In your speech, you made frequent reference to the two sources from which the European Union derives legitimacy, the Council being one and Parliament the other."
"The Constitution speaks of a Union of states and peoples; the states are represented by the Council, and the peoples by this Parliament, and that is why it is right that this House should represent the diversity of Europe’s peoples."
"For our group, that also means, for example, that this House’s language arrangements are not some sort of burdensome and necessary evil, but that they must guarantee the diversity of Europe’s peoples and enable it to be – in the truest sense of the word – articulated."
"For that reason, I am grateful to you for referring to your establishment of a working party to arrange matters efficiently, which should also, however, continue to make it possible for any man or woman in the European Union, irrespective of their school or university education, to have the opportunity of being elected to this House and working in it."
"That involves ensuring that they are understood, which I see as an important aspect of stabilising European democracy."
"You also spoke on behalf of this House in repudiating all those who believe that the only way to combat terrorism is with the language of force, and for that I am very grateful."
"Those who go to war claiming to be the bringers of freedom, democracy and human rights and sow the seeds of chaos, disorder and imported torturers cannot be surprised if their actions help to foster terrorism."
"Those who seek to respond to terrorism by reintroducing the death penalty are countering violence with violence."
"Undermining democracy in order, allegedly, to make a better job of combating terrorism is not the right way to go about matters."
"Terrorists understand their own language; that is why, wherever they themselves use force, force – legitimate force on the part of the state – is the response that is needed to restore order."
"What society needs, though, is open dialogue and the unconditional and fearless acceptance of whoever is the ‘other’ in that situation."
"It is the clash of civilisations that gives rise to continued terrorism; dialogue, of the kind you have described, could be a way out of the terrorism trap, and so I thank you for addressing this point in such clear terms."
"You spoke about the accession of Turkey and about the decisions that now have to be taken."
"This morning, I read in one of the major German daily papers that the debate on this cuts right across group lines in this House, and that all the groups in this House present a diverse picture."
"That comes as a surprise to me, as I had always had the impression that only one group was united on this and that the picture in all the others was a varied one."
"As of this morning, we know that there is a diversity of views in every group in this House."
"At the end of the day, every individual Member will have to weigh up for himself and herself the benefits involved in seizing a short-term political and economic opportunity as against taking long-term, indeed geostrategic considerations into account, in particular as to how different cultures are to be integrated into this Union, but you were right to point out that it is we who have to take that decision, and that taking it without the European Parliament is unthinkable."
"On this issue, then, this House will have to take up a position, and we in the Socialist Group will make our contribution to this debate, a contribution that – as is perfectly clear – will not be uniform, for there are quite different views in our ranks too."
"It is in any case true that one thing we must not lose sight of when discussing our policy on Turkey is the need for Europe’s actions to be underpinned by reliable statements and promises made on the international stage."
"I can scarcely imagine that one can, over a period of forty years, make repeated promises to a country and impose more and more new requirements on it, which it then meets, and end up telling it that the entire process had been of no avail and that all their efforts had been in vain."
"Whatever criticisms one might – and must – make of Turkey’s domestic situation, it is a self-evident fact that, over the past three years, the prospect of accession has made possible more reforms in that country than the forty years of discussions that preceded it."
"That, too, is something we must not lose sight of."
"As regards the Members’ Statute and increased efficiency, you said what had to be said."
"You have our backing for the strategy you described, and, if you take it further, you can count on our absolute support."
"I would like to conclude by saying something about your comments on the audition of Commissioners."
"We in the Socialist Group will use this occasion to make it clear that the incoming Commission must take seriously your statement that ‘competition and social cohesion are two sides of the same coin.’"
"Those who believe that all Europe needs is competition and that social cohesion is not that important destroy Europe’s basis, for it has been the social model that has made Europe stronger."
"It is for this social model that we in the Socialist Group will contend; we will defend it, even against those elements in the Commission who tend to highlight competition to the exclusion of all else."
"That is why, when examining every single Commissioner, we will emphasise the project of the social Europe."
"Let me conclude by saying that, no matter who it is that turns up and presents himself, we will judge him by his policy statements, and not by his political past."
"The fact is, Mr Poettering, that if Lazlo Kovac had not been Secretary of State to Gyla Horn, then Germany would not have been reunited."
"It was the Hungarian Government, in which Lazlo Kovac served, that made German unity possible."
"I welcome Lazlo Kovac as a European – let me say that right at the outset – and so let it be understood by those who seek to make the Commissioners’ hearings into a battle of ideological principles that they have not seen anything yet."
"Mr President, Liberals and Democrats in this House welcome your Presidency Programme and we offer you our support in your work."
"When you speak impartially for this House, when you are a credit to its standing and a defender of its prerogatives, you can count on our backing."
"The stature of this Parliament is growing, and the stature of its Presidency must grow with it."
"You have inherited a House larger by some eight dozen MEPs and richer by nine new official languages."
"It is a machine of four and a half thousand parts, speaking twenty languages, a million words a week."
"The parts must move in time, the machine must stay in motion."
"You must make sure that it does."
"Benjamin Franklin once said of the Vice-Presidency of the United States - before the days of Dick Cheney - that it was a position so lacking in influence and stature that its holder should be addressed as 'your superfluous excellency'."
"The European Parliament cannot afford a superfluous excellency, because you will be our voice; you will speak for us in the Council; you will be the will of this House: you will be our resolution."
"Every one of us carries the burden of building the legitimacy of this House and thus European democracy and the work that it does - but none more than you."
"In your opening remarks you spoke of two sources of legitimacy."
"This House indeed has a particular duty to stand up for the rights of European Union citizens."
"Sometimes that means defending their rights from encroachment by the Union's Member States."
"I think, for example, of the nine million stateless Roma or the citizens of Cyprus and also of the people of Gibraltar, now represented in this House for the first time, thanks to a judgment in the European Court of Justice."
"I am proud to be one of Gibraltar's representatives here, because only in Europe can Gibraltar look across the line at La Linea, or at the British battleship in the Bay of Algeciras and finally see no contradiction."
"This House is the manifestation of the belief that we are better than our histories and more than our nationalities and it must be manifest in its President."
"In two areas of your mandate you can expect aggressive backing from Liberals and Democrats."
"The first is in reform of this House."
"An enlarged Parliament means a reformed Parliament."
"We welcome your emphasis today on reform of the Members' Statute."
"The package agreed at the end of the last session is not an end but a point of departure."
"We cannot hide behind it."
"We must call the bluff of European governments and go straight back to work, because for our voters the price of legitimacy is open and ambitious reform, nothing less."
"The second area is the defence of the European Constitution."
"Here we expect you to lead a concerted campaign across the continent."
"So renew your frequent flyer package: Europe has never had a more important product to sell."
"Mr President, Liberals and Democrats in this House urge imagination and we expect ambition."
"Political institutions rise and fall by the respect that they command."
"For a quarter of a century this Chamber has gathered powers and asked European citizens for respect, for trust."
"We must wake and work and sleep as if that trust must be won anew every day."
"In wishing you well in your term of office, Mr President, I would say that we expect nothing less from you."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we support the open, positive approach of your speech and the long list of priorities you have outlined."
"There will certainly be plenty for both us and you to do over the coming years, but we believe that the most important challenge for this Parliament is to overcome Euroscepticism and, as Mr Watson said as well, to show that we are not superfluous."
"If we want not 40% but 80 or 90% of our citizens to take part in the elections in 2009, there are three things that we have to do better than we have done in the past, and to do them we must go beyond our political differences and try to resist the trend that can already be seen here in Parliament today, which makes it a kind of Council appendage in which the parliamentary groups are increasingly an expression of the power relations among the various national delegations rather than independent and truly European political bodies."
"Mr President, this Parliament has to produce better laws; it has to demonstrate in practice that it is possible to make democracy work at a supranational level and to let the people see that it works; and it has to act as the eyes of the international community on matters where there is no place for hypocrisy or double standards, such as the protection of human rights and decisions on peace and war."
"With regard to our role as co-legislators, we must not forget that for years the European Parliament has had to fight hard to gain the Council’s and the Commission’s respect for its powers."
"Even now there are still at least four unresolved issues, which we call on you to place on the agenda for the trialogue with the other Institutions as soon as possible."
"First, there is the ever-present temptation to somehow bend the rules to prevent Parliament from being able to fully exercise its powers."
"Examples of this are the PNR case – the agreement with the United States on passenger details – and the comitology procedure on GM organisms, but I could mention others."
"This is a real political issue that you, personally, must raise."
"Secondly, there is the review of access to sensitive documents."
"Here, too, the Commission and the Council make our life difficult as representatives of the people."
"One example out of many is that of the infringement procedures."
"The Commission has stated quite clearly that it wants to reduce its influence on this matter and we have no access to these procedures, which very often prevents justice from being done."
"We think that your role as President of this Institution is absolutely crucial with regard to this matter as well."
"Thirdly, we must set up an interinstitutional agreement on trade, seeking in part to bring forward the rules to be determined by the Constitutional Treaty."
"The other speakers have already mentioned the Members’ Statute, and therefore I do not need to expand on it too much."
"We certainly have to make great improvements in-house."
"We are against hurried legislation pushed through at first reading and deals on legislation struck only between major groups, as often happened during the last part of the parliamentary term, while we are in favour of the more systematic, more political and more effective use of our power to initiate legislation – a power that we ourselves forget we have."
"I have spoken of this Parliament as a laboratory for supranational democracy."
"We are convinced that we must be involved in the Constitutional Treaty ratification debate, but we must, however, avoid making the mistake of campaigning too one-sidedly and shutting the door on those who do not think that this Treaty is the best solution for tomorrow’s Europe."
"I believe we have to win them over as well, by trying to convince them."
"I reiterate that Parliament must also act as the eyes of the international community."
"Mr President, we are genuinely convinced that the re-establishment of the Subcommittee on Human Rights may enable this Parliament once again to be a place where we can fight realistically and get results in the area of human and personal rights, rather than the declamatory forum for wishful thinking that it has become in recent years."
"We hope we can count on your support to ensure that the subcommittee can work completely independently to rebuild its vast network of contacts and collaboration with those who uphold human rights around the world, giving them a voice and legitimacy and maybe, in the long term, becoming a full committee in its own right."
"Mr President, I am in broad sympathy both with most of the main themes of your address and with the approach that underpins them, and, on behalf of my group, I thank you for what you have said."
"It reinforces our conviction that we can build up a very constructive and cooperative relationship with you."
"You mentioned company relocations, and, likewise, as regards the work of lawmaking that awaits us, I do not want to conceal from you our group’s profound disquiet at the Commission’s draft directive on the deregulation of services, the so-called ‘Bolkestein directive’, which, in effect, proposes to replace the current law of the host country with that of the country of origin."
"To put it another way, it aims to allow businesses providing services to apply in all countries the social security regulations of their countries of origin."
"Such an arrangement could be, as one can well imagine, a recipe for social dumping."
"We would also welcome, in due time, the measures envisaged under Tampere II."
"As for the mid-term review of the Lisbon Agenda, to which you also referred, and which, in the year 2000, promised us that by 2010 we would have full employment and the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, we should not wait until March 2005 before getting down to it."
"Right now is the time for us to make our contribution to the debate in the form of thoughts derived from the last four years, which have been an enlightening experience."
"Quite apart from our legislative work, there are certain great issues concerning civilisation with which we have to get to grips in order to raise at the European Council the issue of what sort of role the European Union should be playing on the global stage."
"You mentioned some of them in your speech: our approach to the fight against terrorism and to defending global security, for instance; or the issue of our relations with the countries of the South, and, in particular, those on the southern shore of the Mediterranean."
"I am also thinking of the ever more worrying problem of global warming, and of that of media concentration, which is a very live issue in many countries of the EU."
"All these things featured in your speech."
"Obviously, there are still other issues, such as the need to take action to combat such scourges as Aids, tuberculosis and malaria, from which, last year, six million people died across the world."
"Anyone here could add to the list of subjects that absolutely must have a place on our agenda."
"You are right to say that discussion of these issues is among our responsibilities."
"Finally, if you will permit me, I would like to address a transversal subject that you also mentioned: the European Constitution."
"I am glad that you said, as you did, that the European Parliament will have to transform itself, by organising an open and pluralistic debate, into a great ."
"I do not actually think that this House should limit itself to telling our fellow-citizens, when the time has come – if I may use an expression of which Mr Giscard d'Estaing, the former President, is fond – what is the right choice to make, particularly given that such an injunction would probably have little effect on those who wonder what direction European integration is taking, and who, in one way or another, represent the majority of the EU’s citizens."
"Contrariwise, far from fleeing problems or opposition, we will in fact have to initiate a real democratic, pluralist and open debate on civil society, without relying solely on quasi-institutional partners in dialogue at summits, a debate on the nodal points of this treaty, which has ambitions to be a constitution, and more particularly on those by which the EU’s citizens actually judge it, that is to say on its policies and its functioning as derived from the Single European Act and from the Maastricht Treaty, which the draft Constitution is intended to put on a permanent footing."
"In itself, political courage of this kind would be, perhaps not the new European dream to which you, Mr President, have aspired, but at least an encouraging innovation, a positive message addressed to our fellow-citizens and a good start not only for this new legislature, but also – with more personal reference to you, Mr President – for your own term of office."
"Mr President, dear Josep Borrell, my group would also like to congratulate you on your election as President, and we hope you will be a good President for us all, irrespective of where we come from and irrespective of what we think of the draft Constitution."
"It is not difficult to foresee the European Parliament approving the Constitution by a large majority."
"It will give more power and influence to us here in this House."
"The EU will be able to make decisions in 15 new areas."
"We shall be given majority decision-making in 40 new areas in which it will be possible for the national parliaments to be voted down."
"It will be much easier to achieve qualified majorities with the new rules, and the European Parliament will be entitled to table many more amendments to the laws that are to apply in our countries."
"The democratic problem is, however, that the national parliaments will lose much more power than the European Parliament will gain."
"Most of the power will pass from the electorate to 300 working groups in the Council of Ministers and 3 000 in the Commission, none of which operate transparently or are subject to the influence of citizens."
"Democracy is being restricted in our countries, and the electorate will end up losing out the most."
"What is reassuring is that we are now to have referendums in ten countries. Would that this development could also extend to the majority of other countries, the outcome being referendums everywhere."
"How can power be taken from the electorate without asking them whether they are in favour of shifting influence to officials and ministers with very little feeling for a very distant European Parliament?"
"We are now debating whether the EU institutions should adopt a special communications strategy to convince the electorate of the Constitution’s merits."
"The EU institutions have one single task prior to the referendums, and that is to make the draft Constitution available in different languages and reader-friendly editions."
"This is not something they have been able to do."
"It is, in actual fact, my office that has published reader-friendly editions on the website www.euabc.com."
"The Council has only managed to print a number of unreadable versions containing neither indices nor the minority opinion that we in the Convention were expressly promised would be included. The European Parliament could take over the task that the Council and the Commission have not carried out, in spite of their wealth of resources."
"The various groups’ opinions could be appended to the official texts so that the voters might be provided with different recommendations and the opportunity to adopt positions themselves."
"Referendums and constitutions belong neither to governments nor to parliaments, but to the electorate."
"The voters in our Member States must be given a guarantee that free and fair referendums will be arranged everywhere so that, once the decisions – whether in favour or otherwise - have been made, everyone can say that things were done fairly."
"The voters have spoken."
"We respect their decisions."
"Mr President, I too would like to join my colleagues in congratulating you on your election and in thanking you for your address earlier this morning."
"Rather than lay out a wish list of every new policy or new idea, I want to touch very briefly on some of the points you raised and try to re-emphasise those within our role and work here in Parliament."
"First and most importantly of all, you mentioned the massacre at Beslan and in particular the slaughter of innocents that took place."
"It is incumbent on us, because of the institution that we are part of, because of the moral authority which we have in this Parliament as the democratically–elected voice of the people, we should stand up and resist all violence against people."
"We should be a beacon of hope and tranquillity for those who wish to have their viewpoint heard."
"You mentioned in your speech that you do not see the issue as a clash of civilisations."
"Some years ago, the Chief Rabbi in Britain, Jonathan Sachs, wrote a book called ."
"If there is one thing that the European Parliament and the European Union have achieved, it is that ideal of respecting the dignity of difference."
"There are things that make us different, but they need not divide us if we can show tolerance, respect and understanding for them."
"Over the next five years of the mandate of this Parliament, we should be striving to ensure that, in every aspect of our working life, we can give that respect and tolerance to differing viewpoints."
"We may not agree with them and may not ascribe to them ourselves, but we should respect the right of Members of this House and other elected representatives to hold those opinions and try to bring them forward."
"We will be faced with this even more now because of our recent enlargement and the reunification of Europe."
"There are now people in this Parliament who know what it is like not to have freedom to speak, not to have the freedom to use their own language and not to have the right to teach their own history and culture to their children."
"They want to make sure that those rights are never taken away again."
"Some in this Parliament and other places may use Members' passion for and belief in protecting the cultures and diversity of languages within the European Union as a way of attacking such Members."
"We should understand the reasoning behind this approach."
"Mr President, you rightly say that the question of language should be dealt with by the Council with regard to what is and is not appropriate."
"We should also have a bit of leeway within Parliament: for opening remarks in a Member's maiden speech or for other important occasions during the Presidency, people should be allowed to use their own language, even though it may not be an official working language, on condition that they give a translation to the services before they make their speech."
"My last point is that this House must be seen around Europe as a House to be treated with respect and honour, because we have a mandate and we bring the voice of the people as close as possible to the heart of what the European Union is."
"There must also be respect for the Members of this House in their work and for the style in which they work."
"If we are not willing to give respect to ourselves within this Chamber, if we are not willing to work within the rules and the laws as set down by our own Rules of Procedure, invoking our rights and powers under the various treaties and under the new constitution – if it is adopted – then no one outside this House will have respect for us."
"I am looking to you, in the light of our previous conversations and the work you have already done in this regard since taking office, to give leadership in ensuring that the respect and dignity of this House is protected at all times."
"The rights of individual Members are foremost within that protection."
"To conclude, here is a short quote, which could best be described as an ancient Irish poem."
"I will not use the original Gaelic: 'Who shall speak for the lonely and the oppressed?"
"If not you, then who?"
"Who shall speak for the downtrodden and the unjust?"
"If not you, then who?"
"Who shall speak for you?"
"If not you, then who?'"
"We are given the authority to speak on behalf of those who do not have a voice and to give leadership to those who should be shown what the true way is."
"Thank you Mr President."
"I too should like to congratulate you on your election, both on my own behalf and on behalf of my colleagues in the Non-attached Group."
"Just as the spectrum of colours adds to the beauty of a painting, I believe that the spectrum of political parties in the European Parliament guarantees that the decisions taken by this House will not serve just a certain part of Europe."
"I should now like to return to the speech made by Commission President Barrosso in this Chamber, in which he clearly stated that the Union must have a strong and independent Commission."
"I also believe that Europe needs to have a strong and accountable Parliament."
"We must respond to the will and expectations of our voters."
"In order for us to be able to uphold their interests, we must have the appropriate conditions for our work here."
"Mr President, please allow me, at the very beginning of our term of office, to remind you of our requests for the removal of the discrimination which we are experiencing in the Non-attached Group."
"First of all, the other political groups have better staffed secretariats, for example the Union for Europe of the Nations Group has 27 members and 34 officials."
"We have 29 members but only 11 employees to take care of our work in the secretariat."
"Our meetings are not interpreted into our mother tongues despite the fact that many nationalities are represented here."
"The financial support allocated for the political groups is not audited until after it has been used, whereas we have to apply for resources and explain in advance why we are asking for them."
"Mr President, all of us here today have been elected in democratic elections to represent our voters."
"The European Union safeguards its prosperity through agreements and compromises and we must do everything to ensure that discrimination is eliminated in this Chamber."
"I am therefore asking you to resolve these problems and not just put them to one side."
"I have a feeling that the economic pressure on the Non-attached Group of members may be the reason why we have become politically integrated."
"In your statement, you made mention of the problems with interpreting."
"We are now looking at further discrimination being perpetrated by the European Parliament."
"In the past, during the period when our status was that of observers, interpreters from the candidate countries did not enjoy a position of equality."
"In particular, they suffered discrimination in the area of social security, with respect to their rights and benefits."
"Since the accession of the ten Member States, that is, since 1 May 2004, their status has changed somewhat, but they are still suffering discrimination in comparison with their colleagues from the old Member States."
"In the past, interpreters have never been recruited at A8 level owing to the demanding nature of their job."
"The difference between old and new interpreters is more than EUR 1 000."
"Mr President, I apologise for talking about economic and financial problems from the very beginning. But in Slovakia we believe in clearing the air."
"The EP needs to resolve all financial matters for all members so that status is not an issue, so that there is no virtual frontier between the old and the new."
"I therefore beg for the justice which lies in your hands."
"In return, I can offer you honest hard work."
"Members in the Non-attached Group will draw attention to injustice but we shall always strive to seek compromise and to resolve the important problems raised."
"You are faced with trying times. So I wish you well in coping with your difficult job and I also wish you strength in succeeding in it."
"Not every politician is given the opportunity you have been given."
"Prove that you are worthy of this historically very important job and that you are President for all of us."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Belohorská."
"The Presidency takes note of all your comments and they will be analysed by the working group responsible for ensuring that this Parliament operates in a correct and fair manner."
"The next item is the Commission Statement on the situation in Belarus."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is sad to see how little the various debates held here in this Parliament over recent years on the state of democracy in Belarus have changed."
"I would, however, like to take this opportunity to assess the situation in terms of our relations and to consider the prospects for improving them in the future, within the framework of a European neighbourhood policy."
"I would like to point out briefly that, following its independence in 1991, bilateral relations with Belarus began to move forward satisfactorily towards the adoption of an association and cooperation agreement and a provisional commercial agreement."
"Nevertheless, all these negotiations became paralysed as a result of the deterioration of the internal political situation in Belarus in 1996, and regrettably they have not improved since then."
"Nevertheless, since 2002, the European Union has been trying hard to bring the issue back to the fore, to try to overcome the situation of deadlock, taking a points-of-reference approach with a view simply to improving our political relations with that country gradually."
"So far, however, the continuous efforts of the Union, the talks, have not yielded any tangible results."
"Nevertheless, the Union is still prepared to continue making progress provided that there is some movement on the part of the authorities of that country."
"We must also remember that, following the latest enlargement, Belarus has become a direct neighbour – we have shared borders – and, in this regard, it is all the more important to us that it becomes a democratic, stable and prosperous country."
"We believe that our proximity can and must manifest itself in the long term through close cooperation and exchange in fields of mutual interest, such as trade, justice, home affairs, transport, energy and the environment."
"All of this requires fundamental political reforms in that country, however."
"I would like to say once again that the European Union is deeply concerned about recent developments in Belarus, where all indications are that the situation is deteriorating in terms of respect for the Rule of Law, democracy and human rights, and where we are still seeing how policies relating to independent media – some of which have been closed down – the actions of the government and the forces supporting it with regard to political opposition forces and the situation of independent social organisations and higher education establishments are becoming increasingly difficult."
"In this regard, I must point out that we are also following the debate taking place in the Council of Europe, here in Strasbourg, on the people who have disappeared in Belarus, with the greatest of interest."
"In accordance with the information presented by the European trade union confederations, the Commission has also begun an investigation into alleged violations of freedom of association and of the right to collective negotiation within the framework of the Regulation on the system of generalised preferences."
"Depending on the conclusions of this investigation, the Union will have to reconsider Belarus’s future access to the benefits of the system of generalised preferences."
"A key element of our policy with regard to that country is support for civil society and for the process of democratisation."
"In recent years, however, the authorities of that country have refused to apply tax exemption to European Union debt, which undoubtedly hinders the entry of that aid and, therefore, its use and access to it by Belarusian society."
"The authorities of that country are currently registering all the free external aid projects, and in practice this is allowing them to reject any international assistance that they believe goes against their partisan interests."
"So how can we improve our relations with that country in these circumstances?"
"We have developed a European neighbourhood policy in order to continue strengthening our relations with our neighbours, including Belarus."
"By means of this policy we believe we will be able to consolidate our efforts to support democratic development in Belarus."
"I would like to make it clear that if fundamental political and economic reforms are carried out, and as soon as they are carried out, Belarus will be able to participate fully in the European neighbourhood policy, with all the advantages that would come with it."
"Nevertheless, under current circumstances, the minimum conditions required are not in place and we cannot therefore go ahead with this policy in relation to Belarus."
"The first important milestone for Belarus will be the parliamentary elections and the referendum scheduled for October."
"The Union has committed itself to supporting democratic parliamentary elections in the autumn, in coordination with the Office for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and with the Council of Europe."
"We wish, however, to place the emphasis on the legal framework for the elections, as well as freedom for the media and the conditions under which the campaigns of the different political parties must be carried out."
"The Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the OSCE has established a mission of electoral observers for the parliamentary elections."
"The Union will participate by supporting the election observers and at the same time we will remain in contact with the democratic forces."
"I must, however, point out that we are very concerned about the referendum called on the modification of the constitution and the repeal of the current limit on presidential mandates."
"We have informed the authorities of that country on several occasions of the consequences that referendum would have in terms of our relations if circumstances do not change."
"The conclusions of the General Affairs and External Relations Council approved yesterday are crystal-clear on this issue."
"In this regard, the Commission once again wishes to send a clear message to the people of Belarus, letting them know that the Union is not forgetting them."
"The important thing is that people – in particular those who are fighting for democratic change – do not feel they have no support."
"Now more than ever it is essential that we continue our work supporting civil society and the democratic forces in that country."
"Moreover, we have committed ourselves to doing so."
"I believe that Parliament’s resolution expresses similar causes for concern in Belarus and I am naturally interested in hearing the honourable Members’ opinions about the current evolution of our relations and in particular in considering how we can improve our support, our backing for the democratisation of the country, and therefore our support and backing for Belarusian democratic forces in such a difficult situation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am very glad that the Commission understands the significance of the situation in Belarus, and in particular the significance of the electoral campaign currently under way in the country and the forthcoming parliamentary elections."
"These elections acquired added significance last week with the announcement of a referendum to be held at the same time."
"This is of course an attempt to maintain the authoritarian rule currently in place, but it is also a tremendous chance for the Belarussian nation; a chance for the Belarussian people to be mobilised and to express their own opinions on the state of human rights and democratic standards in Belarus."
"It is also a challenge for our common foreign policy."
"There appears to be a need for a more courageous approach in the EU’s foreign policy, and for certain tasks and strategic goals to be reformulated."
"Not only is it very much in the EU’s interest to keep Belarus an independent state, but Belarus’ independence will remain under threat if it is governed in an undemocratic manner."
"What is more, it will only seemingly be a stable country, and stability in Eastern Europe will only seemingly be guaranteed."
"Dictatorships generally fall with a bang rather than by means of velvet revolutions."
"If the EU’s new eastern border is to be safe, it cannot be an iron curtain, let alone a screen behind which the rich and free cower."
"Our foreign policy on Belarus must be much more active, which means it must differ from our foreign policy to date."
"It was of course right to freeze all programmes under the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement after 1996, and it is right to break off contacts with high-ranking officials of the Lukashenko regime, but our policy lacks political will towards Belarussians themselves."
"I am very pleased that the Commissioner has acknowledged that the aim of the EU’s policy is to support civil society, but together we must develop procedures which prove to be effective."
"Democracy in Belarus will not come about of its own accord, and Belarussians must build it themselves, but our task is to help them, and to do so much more energetically than to date."
"This help should be targeted at specific social and political groups, as well as at local authorities, non-governmental organisations, schools and young people."
"Its aim should be to support those who are currently planting the seeds of a civil society and democratic politics."
"Help should also be given to the democratic opposition, which deserves praise for its recent integration into the 5+ coalition."
"These are our friends."
"They speak the same language, they have the same values, they think in the same categories and they believe in Europe."
"I hope that the future belongs to them and that one day they will sit in this very House."
"In short, a more active and subtle approach is required, which makes it possible to isolate an undemocratic government without isolating society."
"The government should be isolated in order to provide positive support to the Belarussian people."
"As far as short-term strategy is concerned, there is a need for energetic measures, or in other words the short-term measures to which the Commissioner referred."
"Firstly, the current electoral campaign should be observed very carefully, and there should be a rapid reaction to any irregularities, such as the banning of the Labour Party, an event which has already occurred, as well as to the fact that many candidates are refused registration and opposition representatives are not allowed to sit on electoral committees."
"This election and referendum are so important that our political group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, is calling in its resolution for an observers’ mission to be sent to Belarus and for a report to be drawn up."
"We would like this post-election report to also act as an opportunity for a serious discussion on the future shape of the EU’s foreign policy on Belarus."
"Mr President, first and foremost, I should like to say that I am in complete agreement with the analysis which the Commissioner gave a moment ago."
"Although they may be new neighbours, we are talking about an old problem, one that has been around since 1996, when we, the European Union, first got into an argument with President Lukashenko, the key figure in Belarus."
"The parliamentary elections of 17 October are around the corner and it is important for us now to turn our attention to the situation in that country."
"A referendum has also been announced about a possible third term in office for the President."
"I was fortunate enough to act as chairman of this Parliament’s delegation in Belarus for five years and we have had bad experiences with elections in that country in the past."
"On two occasions, a parliamentary troika of this Parliament, the Council of Europe and the OSCE, had to declare the country’s elections unlawful, and I fear that this will now happen again."
"It appears once again from all the reports I have received about the run-up to the elections that the opposition is being sabotaged, the opposition candidates are being thwarted and the media are being influenced in an improper manner."
"That is why it is also important that now, with the elections more than a month away, we in this Parliament should send a message about what we expect, in the hope that we do not need to declare the elections unlawful again."
"Earlier this year, we made an attempt to breathe new life into the troika of the three parliamentary institutions in order to get it up and running in time for the elections in Belarus, and this House, in particular, was hindered from playing its part, and I personally was declared more or less in that country."
"It follows that this problem should be solved before this House can send a delegation to act as observers in the elections at all."
"We want the opposition to be given the chance to conduct a campaign in a proper manner."
"In addition, we want the candidates to be given the freedom to do what they want."
"The use of government resources to sabotage the opposition and civil society must stop."
"This change must go hand in hand with an improvement in the climate, which also entails more freedom for trade unions and academics."
"There are countless examples of how trade unions are being manipulated and infiltrated."
"Academic institutions trying to work independently are being closed down either temporarily or outright."
"The flow of subsidies intended to promote freedom in that country is being cut off."
"Only when all the above changes have happened will we perhaps be able to say, after 17 October, that improvements have finally been made, and that there is at last room for the European Union again to make relations, which have been frozen since 1996, somewhat more open, and to develop more contacts with that country."
"As I already said, this is possible only if the referendum is cancelled."
"I regard what President Lukashenko is now trying to achieve via a referendum, one in which the population will undoubtedly again be manipulated in all kinds of ways, as some kind of constitutional ."
"To guarantee a third term in office would be a step in the direction of a system which cannot be described as other than authoritarian, as is already the case."
"We must endeavour to ensure that Europe’s last dictatorship, which is what we generally tend to call these, is brought to an end, and that on that basis, we can actually establish a new neighbourliness policy with that country."
"I hope that the elections will be a step in the direction of Europe, but I fear that they will rather be a step in the direction of a yet more authoritarian system."
"I share the Commissioner’s pessimism about this development."
"Mr President, Commissioner, often referred to as Europe’s last dictatorship, Belarus seems to have been completely unaffected by the tumultuous events of the last decade, with the fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the democratisation of Eastern and Central Europe and the unification of Europe."
"The dictator Lukashenko is clinging desperately to power, and he has now announced a referendum in order to extend his term of office for an unlimited period."
"Mr Wiersma talked of a constitutional , and that is precisely what this is."
"He appears to want to follow in the footsteps of another dictator, Fidel Castro, who is equally past his sell-by date."
"With the systematic and hardly sophisticated system of electoral fraud devised by Lukashenko’s regime, there is unfortunately not very much to suggest that either the referendum or the election on 17 October will in any way be fair."
"This means that Lukashenko can remain where he is, while his people become ever poorer and ever more isolated."
"It is of course shameful that we in Europe have a Communist dictatorship as our closest neighbour."
"In spite of countless attempts to influence the regime using the carrot and stick method, we have failed, and failed totally."
"Trying to cooperate with the regime has been a pointless and fruitless exercise, and the country is thus miles away from embracing the values we defend."
"Freedom of expression is minimal. Human rights campaigners and opponents of the regime are oppressed and persecuted."
"Peaceful demonstrators are arrested, tortured and given prison sentences following trials that smack of nothing more than farce."
"Belarus is the only country in Europe that executes its prisoners."
"There is extensive trafficking in women."
"We find thousands of Belorussian women on many of the streets of Europe."
"Many people who have called the regime into question have disappeared in mysterious circumstances."
"Belarus is our neighbour, however, and we cannot abandon the Belorussian people to their fate."
"Just like everyone else, they are entitled to freedom and democracy."
"Just as the Commissioner says, we in Parliament, the Council and the Commission must therefore try to find ways of giving economic, political and, especially, moral support to the courageous people and organisations that, in spite of everything, exist and fight for democracy, human dignity and the principles of the constitutional state."
"The official pressure must be intensified."
"We must demand that observers also be allowed to monitor this illegitimate referendum."
"My group would like to see Parliament send observers on 17 October."
"Our new Member States have not only afforded us geographical proximity to Belarus, but also knowledge of that country and of its history."
"It is important to use this knowledge and to be creative in finding ways of supporting the forces of democracy in Belarus."
"Many people see Europe in terms of hope for a better future and of the opportunity for, and possibility of, a new life."
"We must of course preserve the dream that, one day, a democratic and open Belarus, operating a market economy, might also become a member of the European Union."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on Belarus has, yet again, been characterised more by despair than by hope."
"As Mr Wiersma said, it has been like that for years."
"Although we have been keeping our eye on Belarus for years, it is one of the reunited Europe’s failures that we have not been able to prevent a dictatorship of dark and Stalinist stamp on its own doorstep."
"Contrary to what the President of Belarus says on his country’s television networks, which all toe the party line, his power brings the people no security, but rather fear and terror."
"He rules through state-sponsored contract-killers and by using strong-arm tactics such as those of silencing all opposition, criminalising commitment to civil society, and banning the free expression of opinion."
"The list could be made much longer, as you know."
"It will be very difficult for Belarus to find its way back to democracy, and it is in that light that the referendum should be seen."
"In order to keep his hands on his personal power, he chose the day of the parliamentary elections, the day when democracy could have returned to the country, to demand a vote of confidence in him, as a distraction from the real issues, the real questions that the people are asking, as to why things are getting worse and worse while the situation in the neighbouring countries is improving, why it is that they cannot share in the neighbouring states’ prosperity, why the consequences of Chernobyl are denied, why aid projects are banned, why health care is being cut back and why experts collecting data to enable help to be given are put behind bars."
"Even eighteen years after the event, Chernobyl’s consequences have not been dealt with and many of the people are exposed to radioactive contamination."
"I now turn to the dictator Lukashenko’s latest action, the shutting-down of the humanist university in Minsk."
"It was the last university to maintain and teach liberal and European values, and it was closed down in the teeth of opposition from the students and the people."
"For that reason, we must not be silent; we must protest, for this is yet another course of action driving the genuinely pro-European elite out of the country."
"I have to say, Commissioner – and this is where I agree with the first speaker – that the European Union is open to the accusation of not having done enough to drag Belarus out of the black hole of self-isolation, and we know why; our instruments are inadequate."
"Even the new instruments that you are proposing as part of the Neighbourhood Policy are nothing like enough to deal with this special problem."
"You have ignored Parliament’s proposals for setting up special programmes for this with other options and financed in other ways, enabling us at last to take the action that is urgently needed, such as, for example, the development of civil society and the strengthening of a free press."
"Last of all, let me mention my friend – my best friend in Belarus – Viktor Gonchar, who, as you all know, was one of the victims of the contract killers."
"While I believe that we should do more to get the murderers punished and his death fearlessly investigated, we should also carry forward his vision of a democratic Belarus, one that allows its people to share in Europe’s progress and prosperity."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her report, even if there are many points upon which I do not agree with her."
"This is the second time I have taken part in a debate on Belarus, the first having been as a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, and I must confess that I have never lost hope."
"The EU institutions have the right to express their opinions on remarkable or even exceptional events and situations, and it is therefore natural for them to also pay particular attention to Belarus."
"Belarus is a state in an exceptional situation."
"It is one of Europe’s youngest states, with a political elite inexperienced in statehood."
"It is a country where administrative borders have changed into state borders, thus dividing families, an economy and a culture."
"Such a state merits not only particular attention, but also exceptional help."
"In my opinion, one of the worst possible ways of providing help in such a situation would be excessive criticism of the government and unreserved support for the opposition."
"After all, the aim should not be to topple the government, but to help the people of Belarus."
"What do we know about the opposition, which some of our colleagues, in all respect, are endeavouring to bring to power?"
"Will it not be worse at governing the country than the current government?"
"What do we know of the real wishes of the Belarussian people?"
"Maybe they want a nationalist government, or anti-Russian policies, or merely more democracy and prosperity in their own country and the closest possible cooperation with their large and rapidly developing neighbour?"
"I do not believe that we know the answers to these questions."
"In its present composition, this House is only just starting to grow accustomed to its duties and responsibilities."
"The worst possible start would be to succumb to ideological prejudice and to pass judgment on the basis of the way in which our emotions are guided by the mass media."
"We were not elected to this House in order to pass judgments without allowing the other side the right to defend itself."
"We were not elected to make a fuss merely because we do not like someone or because television reports and newspaper editorials have painted a negative picture of them."
"We were not elected to set Europe against itself."
"We are in this House in order to put in place the conditions for mutual understanding, or in other words not to isolate people, but to conduct dialogue."
"On this point I agree with my friend and colleague Bogdan Klich."
"I support the proposal for Parliament to send a delegation to Belarus made up of representatives from all political groups, and I hope it will be able to establish the opinions of politicians, the public and experts."
"Then we will be able to say what the situation in Belarus is like without using double standards."
"Mr President, Belarus’ current President has called a constitutional referendum to be held at the same time as the parliamentary elections."
"The Belarussian people will elect their parliamentary representatives and decide on the form which the Constitution should take."
"Voices have been heard from all over the world questioning the integrity of the Belarussian state authorities and the results of the elections in advance, although we will only know the results after 17 October."
"It is taken as read that democratic principles will be violated."
"I believe that questioning the integrity of elections and referendums before voting has taken place is also incompatible with the spirit of democracy."
"We are entitled to observe the situation and must do so, but must not pass judgments ahead of time."
"In addition, I doubt whether a structure which is as undemocratic as we believe the European Union and its bureaucratic institutions to be has the moral right to judge the level of democracy and decisions of a sovereign nation to be undemocratic."
"Is the European Union competent to reprimand independent states?"
"There is an ancient maxim which says , that means physician, heal thyself."
"The European Union wishes to impose the Constitutional Treaty on free nations, even though in such instances the mandatory national referendums approving the Treaty are not required."
"Where is the democracy in such cases?"
"Parliament should first guarantee democracy and independence in European countries, and only then issue condemnations and reprimands to others."
"‘You see the mote in your brother’s eye, but you do not see the beam in your own eye’."
"Pharisees and hypocrites!"
"This is not to say that we should not react to violations of human rights wherever they may occur in the world, but that is not Parliament’s job."
"It would be like the Congress of the United States of America passing a resolution on democracy in France or Germany, or the Polish Parliament reprimanding the European Parliament."
"It is not Parliament’s job."
"Parliament should therefore not overstep its competences."
"Democracy is based on respect for the sovereign decisions of nations, irrespective of whether we like them or not."
"Let us await the results of the elections in Belarus, and then every Member will individually be able to make a judgment."
"The European Parliament as such does not have the right to do so."
"We are therefore opposed to Parliament sending any diplomatic missions to Belarus or to it drawing up joint reports."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since 1 May 2004 Belarus has been a direct neighbour of the European Union."
"Despite this close proximity, it is a country in which universities and the remaining independent media are being closed down."
"It is a country where political parties, such as the Labour Party and the Belarussian National Front, are made illegal merely for being in the opposition, regardless of whether they are left or right-wing."
"Despite all this and despite this proximity we have no guarantee, contrary to what we have heard, that the referendum process and the forthcoming elections will be democratic."
"This is not prejudice, these are facts."
"People who hold views that differ to those of the official authorities in Belarus are being killed."
"Media outlets in Belarus are being closed down."
"Democratic candidates find it difficult to register with electoral committees in Belarus."
"This is not prejudice."
"Anyone who can see no difference between the Belarussian opposition and the Government should take note of the fact that it is not the Belarussian opposition which is responsible for the disappearance of individuals or the closure of independent newspapers."
"Anyone who cannot see this difference should go to Belarus and take a closer look."
"All these things are happening right under the nose of the EU, and the EU therefore bears responsibility for this aspect of its eastern policy."
"If the EU today is to seek a distinct identity in the field of foreign policy, it must do so whilst not avoiding conflict with its closest allies across the Atlantic."
"If the EU’s foreign policy is to be based on respect for fundamental rights, Belarus is one of its most crucial responsibilities today."
"If we do not take action on this issue, our credibility in the debate on the shape of foreign policy will be weakened."
"It is for this reason that the Belarussian opposition today must be certain that we have not forgotten it and must be entirely certain that we support it."
"It is for this reason that President Lukashenko must be certain that his actions will not remain unpunished, and that the Belarussian nation must be certain that its European ambitions will some day receive a genuine answer from our side."
"Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, unfortunately the European Union has abandoned the concept of ‘Wider Europe’ in the context of Eastern Europe."
"Today this concept refers to North Africa, and the EU’s priorities lie with the Maghreb and Mashreq, rather than Belarus or Ukraine."
"This is bad news, and it means that the gulf between the democratic and wealthy Europe and Eastern Europe can and will deepen."
"This is not only bad news for them, it is also bad news for the European Union."
"It is obvious that the situation in Belarus is deteriorating."
"Newspapers and political parties are being closed down and people imprisoned."
"Should the EU’s reaction be to turn our back?"
"Are we to be like Pontius Pilate, who washed his hands?"
"Let us not forget the disastrous results which this had 2 000 years ago."
"Contacts with Minsk should therefore now be stepped up, Mrs De Palacio, not scaled down."
"Human rights and democratic freedoms must be constantly emphasised."
"The situation in Belarus is becoming ever more grave."
"President Lukashenko has announced the possibility of restrictions on presidential terms of office being abolished."
"He may be hoping to become president for life."
"This is an even more pressing reason not to create a new Berlin Wall on the EU’s new eastern borders, on Poland’s borders with Belarus and with Ukraine."
"Belarus is not on Mars, it has common borders with the EU."
"Let us therefore not ask for whom the bell tolls, let us repeat after Ernest Hemingway that it ‘tolls for thee’, for Europe."
"The EU must take action on the issue of Belarus, we must not remain mere newspaper readers."
"The proposal to send a special delegation of observers to Belarus, to observe the outcome of the election, should therefore be supported."
"I also believe that the representatives of the Belarussian democratic opposition should be invited to the European Parliament."
"Passivity on this issue, and pretence that the problem will solve itself is, in the words of Talleyrand, worse than a crime, it is a blunder."
"The European Union should not act like a certain tribe in Africa which believes that if it does not talk about a problem or a disease, and does not mention its name, the problem will cease to exist."
"On the contrary, the EU must talk about Belarus and talk details, Mrs de Palacio."
"Mr President, Belarus is in focus now, not only for sharing over one thousand kilometres of border with the EU, but also as the last surviving major European bastion of neo-soviet ideology."
"One could say in its favour that unlike some of its neighbours it remains free of inter-ethnic strife."
"It has also unilaterally renounced its nuclear arsenal, as well as much of its conventional weaponry."
"Organised crime is low."
"Rather surprisingly, Belarus is also enjoying a 4% growth rate economically."
"However, the country is an increasing worry to the EU, having deteriorated into authoritarianism and repression of human and linguistic rights, while opposition political parties are now suffering harassment ahead of the referendum and parliamentary elections on 17 October."
"Sadly, the Belarus House of Assembly is barely recognisable in western terms as a freely-elected Parliament."
"The election of President Lukashenko in 1994 led initially to the hope that authority would be upheld, corruption rooted out and the economy put back on track."
"Yet this has not happened, because the Soviet-style approach resulted in the re-introduction of the economic model of central control leading to clientelism and interventionism in all aspects of public life."
"He now seeks the right, through the referendum, to become President for life."
"Private enterprise in Belarus functions poorly and the bulk of financial investment comes from Russia after a promising but short-lived start, particularly in the SME sector."
"The effects of the Chernobyl disaster are still of grave consequence and something like a quarter of the country is still contaminated by radioactive fall-out."
"In 2001 Lukashenko won 75% support, although the OSCE declared that the election had failed to comply with its minimum standards."
"Nevertheless, no one actually disputes his victory."
"Leading opposition figures have been arrested and beaten, and a few have disappeared, although – mysteriously – some have reappeared."
"Two years ago three journalists were sentenced to three years of hard labour for slandering the President."
"Many Belarussians support eventual EU membership for their country, although if asked they also claim to support union with Russia."
"Lukashenko would ideally like to build an eastern pan-Slavic bloc hostile to the West."
"However, especially since President Putin came to office, Russia has responded by seeking to partly distance itself from Belarus."
"A Russia-Belarus state union treaty was ratified in 1999, but in practice it has been largely ignored, while the single rouble currency union has been deferred to 2006."
"The municipal elections in March 2003 showed that some favourable political developments have taken in Belarus."
"They showed that the democratic opposition parties have been afforded greater freedom and fairer treatment."
"The EU should respond to Belarus accordingly by stepping up western contacts with pro-democracy parliamentarians who are willing to challenge the regime and are dedicated to making the country a fully-fledged member of the international community, and as such eventually entitled to a partnership and cooperation agreement with the EU."
"Experience from Spain, Greece and Portugal suggests that given time and economic growth the transition from dictatorship to free market democracy is achievable everywhere in Europe."
"Our role as representatives of the people in our country and in Europe cannot and must not end at the frontiers of the European Union."
"We must look beyond and must not consider ourselves to be like some fortress with its bastions keeping away all outsiders, but more like a turret that guides us towards values that unite us, especially those of solidarity and democracy."
"It is in this spirit that we must treat the situation in other neighbouring countries such as Belarus."
"This is done without assuming that we know everything or that we are definitely more knowledgeable than others."
"However one can say that in all the countries that we come from, at some time or another, we experienced moments that did not reflect well on our democracy."
"It is in this manner, as people hardened by such experiences, that I think we can make this appeal an appeal to the authorities of the country to show respect towards the rights of association and the basic principles of democracy."
"We show our greatest solidarity towards the Labour Party of Belarus and towards the National Front."
"The way the government is treating them is not acceptable in today’s society."
"Our appeal must be one of goodwill."
"I am convinced, as I think many of you are, that in every organisation in every country there are people of goodwill who know how to distinguish good from evil."
"I appeal to such persons, especially within the authorities of Belarus and its government to work and do so with all means at their disposal to see that democracy rules."
"We must be aware that the present situation in Belarus is also our responsibility, due to what we did or what we did not do."
"We must ensure that the policy that we adopt from now on will not be a reactive one, not one of embargos which, experience shows us, is hardly effective, but one that is pro-active."
"It must not be a sporadic one but one taken in the framework of a neighbourhood policy, the need for which is felt more now than ever before."
"Mr President, with Belarus, we are confronted with the same problem as a number of other countries on different continents which appear rather indifferent to the means that can be deployed in order to persuade their regimes to adopt a more humane policy."
"Neither the carrot nor the stick appears to have any impact whatsoever on regimes such as that in Belarus, and that is unfortunately also true of certain countries in Asia, Africa and America. This shows that double standards do not apply here."
"On the one hand, the impression is created that this debate is rather pessimistic, since many speakers have been forced to recognise our powerlessness to bring about constructive changes in Belarus."
"This does not mean, however, that we need to give up."
"Various speakers have indicated the way forward."
"We need to join forces with civil society, and the population of Belarus must be able to elect their representatives in a free, transparent and honest manner."
"In addition, NGOs trying to uphold values such as democracy and human rights in the face of adversity must be supported."
"The object of the whole exercise is to give the people a chance to share in Europe’s wealth and prosperity."
"The Commission and Council can count on our unqualified support in further efforts to bring about changes for the good."
"– Mr President, since 1 May of this year, Belarus shares its borders with the European Union."
"It is a well-known fact that this geographical closeness does not exactly run parallel to political like-mindedness."
"A week ago to the day, the Belarusian President Lukashenko highlighted this chasm by issuing a decree to legitimise and consolidate his authoritarian presidency via the ballot box even after 2006."
"In just over one month, on 17 October, this constitutional change could be a ."
"This predictable development does nothing to simplify relations between Brussels and Minsk."
"Since Belarus constitutes an important passage for energy and other supplies of goods from Russia to EU Member States, Lukashenko and his repressive regime are in a strong position."
"Incidentally, over the years, it has appeared immune to direct international efforts towards gradual democratisation and reform."
"Lukashenko's undeniable ambition to stay in power will, if anything, reinforce this trend in time to come."
"What impact can the European institutions have in Belarus?"
"Indeed, is not the present leaders’ self-imposed political isolation from the West complete?"
"Despite this, we do not need to leave Belarusian society at the mercy of Lukashenko’s unbridled thirst for power."
"This undoubtedly difficult path is pointed out in a German study published this summer."
"Change in Belarus can only be successful in the medium term by promoting that country’s own initiatives from the bottom up."
"There is indeed a glimmer of light here, because despite the grave circumstances of the past few years, to date, some 2 500 registered civil organisations have managed to hold their own."
"This was definitely made easier by long-term contact with foreign partners."
"With hundreds of initiatives, Germany is in the lead here."
"How does the Commission view this way out of the political impasse between the European Union and Belarus?"
"It is certainly a long-term effort involving many risks."
"What is inspiring, though, is the honourable object, the general well-being of the Belarussian population, with the active involvement of civil society and, if possible, both local and regional authorities."
"I would like to ask the Commission once again whether it considers this a viable option and if so, what practical action it intends to initiate."
"–Mr President, today I, a parliament member from Lithuania, have the opportunity and pleasure to address you in my native language, Lithuanian."
"However, such an opportunity – to speak one's own language freely – is denied to Lithuania's closest neighbours, now neighbours of the European Union – 10 million Belorussians."
"There is a nation quite close to the geographical centre of Europe, which is not allowed to speak its native language in either schools or universities."
"Even more – it is denied freedom of speech and liberty of conscience."
"I speak of an imprisoned nation at the centre of Europe, in a country which is ruled by Europe's last dictator, who on 17 October by means of a fictitious referendum plans to extend his dictatorship for life, and who sees Hitler's regime as one of the best in Europe."
"We believe that the European Union's continued policy with regard to eastern neighbours has to be expressed not only in the condemnation of this regime, with general declarations, which do not have more concrete consequences, but also in concrete support for those democratic opposition forces, which are spreading the ideas of democracy and pluralism by non-violent means, so that the Belorussian nation might live in a country which recognises human rights and freedom."
"This is why my colleague Mr Szymañski and I move to endorse a draft resolution submitted in the name of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group and in this context call for the Sacharov Prize to be awarded to those who will decide the future of Belarus - the opposition youth movement ‘Zubr’, as a symbol of all forces disobeying the regime and determining the future of a free Belarus."
"Thank you for your attention."
"–Belarus is a neighbour of Lithuania and the European Union and what happens in that country is important to us."
"As we know, the President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko, politically isolated by western states because of human rights violations and restrictions on media freedom, is using all means to attain a third presidential term in the elections for a head of state to be held in 2006."
"The question, which is to be presented in a referendum scheduled for 17 October, is formulated in very simple and clear terms for the citizens of Belarus: 'Will you allow the first President of the Republic, Alexander Lukashenko, to participate as a presidential candidate in the elections for a head of state?'"
"Unquote."
"Lukashenko explains this to the people of Belarus in equally simple and understandable language."
"Quote: 'As I promised you before, if I decide to participate in the 2006 presidential elections, I will definitely consult you and ask for your permission - this is what I am doing now,' he said on Belorussian state television."
"Today, as previously in the European Parliament, many cases of human rights violations have been mentioned, along with evidence of restrictions on press freedom, and the banning of university and non-government organisations."
"However, the people of Belarus know little of our concern for their situation, their life."
"If they manage to reach Belarus, statements on this subject by leaders of the European Parliament and other institutions in the democratic world are distorted, they are presented to the citizens of Belarus as the will of global capitalism, as attempts to dictate to Belorussians how they should live."
"Information which Belorussians find on the internet, to which they do have access, is less censored, however the level of computerisation in that country is poor, and so a large part of society is fed state propaganda."
"We must see that objective information reaches the citizens of Belarus via channels which they are accustomed to."
"I propose: that in approving the European Union's budget for 2005, we must find funds to broadcast radio, perhaps also television programmes in Belorussian and Russian, which could be compiled with the help of Belorussian journalists [...] and could be broadcast from the neighbouring states - Lithuania and Poland - as was done until 2001."
"A few million Litai each year from the European Union's budget certainly will not bankrupt the European Union, but in my opinion, would be a more effective means of strengthening civil, democratic initiatives and traditions than sending a delegation from the European Parliament to observe the elections, carry out monitoring and record the de facto situation."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am interested in discussing what can be done, and not what cannot be done."
"Up until now we have mainly talked about what cannot be done."
"I would therefore ask the Commissioner to make a note of three things that can be done."
"Firstly, diplomats from the EU Member States can be instructed to monitor the pre-election situation in Belarus and to inform the EU institutions, including the European Parliament, on a weekly basis."
"Secondly, Commission officials can be ordered to conduct urgent political consultations with states with which the EU maintains contacts, in particular with the United States and Russia, with regard to the development of the pre-election situation in Belarus and to defining the scope of joint appraisals."
"As an MEP I would also like to be kept informed on this issue."
"Thirdly, financial assistance can be provided for young people in Belarus who wish to study abroad, for example in Poland, and for small businesses that wish to develop outside the Lukashenko administration’s sphere of influence."
"This third point requires only a small amount of money, but it requires a great deal of courage, and I hope that the Commission will not lack this courage."
"Finally, I have something to say to the speaker who could see no difference between Cuba and Belarus."
"Here is a difference that is worth remembering: Cubans escape at night on boats to the United States and die ."
"Belarussians travel by car to Poland, that is, to the European Union, in order to find jobs and return to Belarus."
"That difference is certainly worth remembering."
"Mr President, I would like to add my voice to those calling for the European Union and our Parliament to play a more active and committed role with regard to Belarus, and in particular to those calling for observers to be sent."
"To tell the truth, I am not particularly optimistic about the success of this mission, because as Josef Stalin once said, ‘it’s not who votes that counts, it’s who counts the votes’, and a decision has already been taken on how the votes will be counted."
"Nevertheless, the situation requires our constant attention, as it is becoming worse and worse."
"There is no rule of law in Belarus, only the rule of those who simply exploit the law."
"One result of this, amongst others, is the abolition of independent education, and the European Humanities University has already been mentioned."
"I would also like to mention the closure of the Kolas Lyceum, the only secondary school in Minsk in which lessons are held exclusively in Belarussian."
"Generally speaking, what we are witnessing in Belarus is quite simply a regression to a quasi-Soviet state."
"Official ideology rules in the country."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there is such a thing as an official Belarussian ideology, and there are high commissioners in each of the institutions and high-ranking executives responsible for ideology."
"This has resulted in the return of practices which are completely incomprehensible to us, in the light of recent developments in Europe."
"It is absolutely essential that the European Union take more active measures in this matter."
"It is also extremely important to involve our neighbours, both near and far, in these measures, and I would like to return to a comment made by Mr Siwiec, namely that we should take advantage of all existing opportunities to exert influence jointly on Belarus."
"These opportunities include Russia, and in particular the democratic Russia which is unfortunately in retreat, but still exists."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as is well known, the cold war is over and the Soviet Union no longer exists, and yet, as the report of the Commission and the debates in Parliament incontrovertibly show, the Belarusian people still find themselves behind an ‘iron curtain’."
"This is a paradox!"
"Belarus is left as a remnant of the Soviet empire, a hangover from it in its image."
"Now the whole democratic world has received a provocation from Mr Lukashenko."
"A referendum is under way to allow him to prolong his dictatorship."
"We can predict that the dictatorship will succeed, as the democratic opposition has been deprived of its rights and silenced behind prison walls."
"Let us not forget that the President of Belarus was a prominent partner of the Iraqi regime and of Saddam Hussein."
"And this is all happening on the borders of democratic Europe."
"As a result, it poses a threat not just to the people of Belarus but also to the neighbouring democracies."
"Why is Belarus’s partner, Russia, not concerned about this?"
"Was this a problem discussed with Mr Putin by Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schröder in Sochi?"
"In this situation, the only hope of Belarusian democrats is to place their trust in the parliamentarians of free Europe and in our readiness to give both moral and financial support to the Belarusians and, of course, to the Commission."
"It is our duty."
"Mr President, Commissioner, throughout history, Belarus has belonged to both Eastern and Western Europe, and relations between the EU and Belarus are strained."
"The isolation of Belarus has become more obvious and, at the same time, less sustainable."
"With EU enlargement, Belarus has become a neighbouring country of the EU, giving cause for increased contacts in those areas where such contacts are possible."
"Right now, it is, however, unlikely that contacts will be improved as long as there is no decisive turnaround in the policy conducted in Belarus."
"This applies above all to the distribution of power, the constitution, increased opportunities for the opposition to operate freely and the protection of human rights."
"So far, there have been few indications of such a change."
"That distribution of power that is central to a democracy is at present absent from Belarus."
"Changes to the election process before the autumn parliamentary election on 17 October are thus necessary."
"Not only, however, is Belarus to elect a new parliament on 17 October, but President Lukashenko has also announced that a special referendum on a change to the constitution is to take place."
"The referendum is about changing the constitution to extend his own period of office."
"That is unacceptable from a democratic point of view."
"Ever since Lukashenko took office as president in 1994, he has been dictatorial in strengthening his position in that role."
"If there is a majority in favour of this latest attempt to remove the limit on the number of terms of office a president is allowed to serve, this means that, in all likelihood, Lukashenko will serve for at least another five years."
"If I have calculated correctly, that will make for an uninterrupted period of 17 years."
"Together, we must act to bring about increased support for democratic development in Belarus and must combat that isolation of Belorussian society and of the Belorussian people that many have talked about."
"The EU must continue to support human rights and the development of a pluralistic society, to oppose trafficking in, and violence against, women and to further civil, democratic society."
"It is also of the utmost importance that the whole of the international community be alert and supportive prior to the presidential election in order to show that this is something of significance, that we are concerned that Belarus develop in a democratic direction and that, as a number of people have said, we support the people of Belarus."
"We must not turn our backs on the Belorussian people."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we do not believe the situation in Belarus to be satisfactory and the results of the efforts to assist civil society and support the democratisation process are extremely frustrating."
"We must try to improve the functioning and capacity of our support and therefore improve the capacity of any political measures we adopt with a view to applying pressure in order to promote the democratisation of Belarus."
"It is regrettable that parts of the Berlin Wall, which has come down right across Europe, should remain on a border with the European Union."
"There remain certain fragments, in Belarus for example, and if one of the objectives of European Union action and presence at world level is to support democratisation and defend human rights, that objective and concern clearly become all the more important in the case of an immediate neighbour, in other words, on our own border."
"I would like to say that we in the Commission cannot accept Mr Czarnecki’s assertion that we are only concerned about the Mediterranean and not about Eastern Europe."
"How can you say we have not worried about Eastern European when, amongst other things, we have carried out an enlargement involving eight Eastern European countries, and within three years two more Eastern European countries will join."
"When you see Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and other Mediterranean countries becoming members of the European Union, then I will accept that we are more concerned about the Mediterranean, but that is not the case now."
"All we are offering the Mediterranean is a neighbourhood policy – it is our southern flank – and if you consider the demographic figures, you will see that, although you may be in Poland, what happens in the Mediterranean affects you considerably."
"If, moreover, you are in Poland – that is to say, in the European Union – the Mediterranean is your problem, not just a problem for the Italians, the Maltese, the Cypriots, the Spanish, the Portuguese or the French."
"The Mediterranean is your problem as a Pole and as a Member of the European Union."
"Let us not confuse our values nor our objectives and priorities."
"Eastern Europe, Europe – there is a reason why we call ourselves the European Union – is also our priority."
"So much so that we have been able to enlarge, to grow – and we are continuing to do so now – and there has not yet been any talk of closing those borders."
"So let us see things as they really are."
"With regard to the various suggestions, I will refer firstly to the possibility of participating as observers in the forthcoming referendum and elections in Belarus."
"I would like firstly to point out that the Belarusian Government has only invited the OSCE to participate as an observer – specifically its Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights – and that this Parliament has not been invited officially."
"The European Union is prepared to work together with the OSCE, which has been invited to attend as an observer solely at the parliamentary elections, not the referendum, which we believe it should also be invited to."
"We believe it to be important that that monitoring be extended to the referendum."
"Furthermore, we are going to continue working to ensure that the number of observers is increased and, possibly, that Members of this European Parliament can also participate."
"We must remember that this is not currently the case and that we need to be invited in order to participate in this type of activity."
"The next issue raised by certain speakers relates to the idea that our actions until now have not been sufficiently effective, that they are not producing results and that we should be much more active."
"We in the Commission are prepared to promote that activity, but we must appreciate that there are limits."
"Furthermore, some of you have said that spiritual assistance is not enough and that what is needed is financial assistance."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to point out that there is currently assistance for Belarus for promoting democratisation, as well as shaping and strengthening civil society, but we wish to increase that assistance."
"The European Union will maintain its aid in support of civil society and democratisation, regional and humanitarian cooperation, neighbourhood programmes and measures for facilitating movement in border areas."
"Specifically, the European Union’s TACIS programme provides for EUR 10 million for 2005-2006 and will focus on supporting that civil society, cooperating in the field of higher education and alleviating the consequences of the Chernobyl accident which unfortunately was not so much an accident as a disaster."
"I must also point out that the European initiative for democracy and human rights will play a very active role in Belarus in the coming years."
"Specifically, in 2005-2006 the candidates in Belarus will be able to request aid within the framework of two campaigns we are going to launch, aimed at promoting the culture of human rights and promoting democratic processes."
"I would, however, emphasise – and I said this at the beginning of my speech in this debate – that the authorities of Belarus are placing administrative obstacles in the way of all the programmes for this type of assistance we are proposing, and we must be able to overcome this resistance."
"Turning to certain more specific issues, is it possible to collaborate with regional or even local governments?"
"Yes, provided that the national authorities of Belarus do not prevent us from ensuring that current funds reach their destination."
"Are there any funds?"
"Yes, and furthermore the ceiling available is not being used because of the problems I am referring to, caused by the Belarusian authorities."
"We are worried about the closure of newspapers, the restriction of freedom of expression, persecution – in some cases of opposition elements – and the outlawing of political parties – we have naturally protested and are continuing to protest."
"In this regard, the Council of General Affairs Ministers – that is to say the Foreign Affairs Ministers of the 25 States of the Union – yesterday issued a protest at the development of the situation in Belarus."
"We protested at the closure of universities – specifically the University of Minsk– and we will continue to do so, but we must be aware of how far we can go, and that limit is largely set by the authorities of Belarus, which is clearly not a democracy but rather a dictatorship."
"I also believe, ladies and gentlemen, that we must make use of the family relations between Belarusian citizens and citizens of European Union countries to promote the European Union’s ideology, which is the ideology of freedom, of human dignity."
"I also believe that we must promote political cooperation between political parties as much as possible and, to this end – as I have said – there are funds, there are possibilities, and this Parliament and its Members have a role to play."
"We must be aware that things are not easy, that it does not appear that the latest measures taken by the Lukashenko regime are going to improve the situation, but we must nevertheless have faith in the citizens of Belarus."
"It is not, moreover, a question of telling its citizens they are going to become members of the European Union, as I heard some honourable Members say a moment ago."
"It will be they who decide in the future whether to go ahead with their strategic alliance or reunification with their neighbour Russia."
"We cannot get into that kind of argument, which could create more tension."
"The main objective is the full democratisation of Belarus, economic support to promote that democratisation, and then, once that democratisation is achieved through our neighbourhood policy, support for development and economic recovery and the improvement of living conditions in that country, which is a European country and a neighbour of the European Union."
"I should like to thank you, Commissioner, and all the speakers in that important debate."
"I have received six motions for resolutions(1) tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"The next item is the stocktaking of the follow-up to the Commission's annual policy strategy for 2005.(1)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are meeting here in this House to debate the political priorities proposed by the Commission for 2005 and to assess the results of our structured dialogue: a which has now been operating for three years and which has had some positive results, which has made our actions more coherent and effective and interinstitutional cooperation more positive and which has ensured that the European Commission’s right to initiative, which is one of its prerogatives, is not inconsistent with listening to the demands and sensitivities of this Parliament."
"I would like to remind you that on 25 February last we presented a document in plenary on the political strategy for 2005 which had been approved that same day by the College of Commissioners."
"Naturally, we approached the broad political priorities for next year with a view to ensuring the proper functioning of the enlarged Europe, relaunching growth and improving competitiveness, in other words, the Lisbon strategy as a whole, promoting and protecting European citizenship and creating a circle of prosperity and stability together with our neighbour countries."
"We must remember that 2004 is a special year, with a new Parliament, and the current Commission will shortly be replaced with a new one."
"Our over recent years for establishing and promoting this structured dialogue between Parliament and the Commission has been modified and simplified in certain respects."
"In this regard, there was a meeting between the Commission and the Conference of Committee Chairmen on 20 April in which we held a very positive exchange of views and which replaced the debates with the different committees."
"Subsequently, we have followed very closely the work of those parliamentary committees and the various resolutions approved by this House over recent months, in particular in relation to the budgets for 2005 and the Commission’s annual political strategy."
"At the same time, we have held debates with the Council, the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee on our proposals and they have all contributed their point of view."
"What we have to do today is assess the results of this dialogue and point out that, in principle, this Parliament has reacted favourably to our broad proposals from an outgoing Commission which – I would emphasise – is passing the baton on to a new Commission."
"The first of our priorities for 2005 are competitiveness and cohesion in an enlarged Europe."
"In this regard, we would like to thank Parliament for its support for our intention to move towards genuine application of the Lisbon strategy by concentrating efforts on achieving fundamental objectives and supporting common policies, including the common agricultural policy."
"The consolidation of the European economy will continue to rest on a healthy macroeconomic policy geared towards stability and based on sustainable public finances, particularly in view of our demographic forecasts."
"The basic factors will be an integrated strategy aimed at improving competitiveness and structural reforms, promoting the knowledge-based economy and ensuring that the economic, employment, social, environmental and structural policies of the European Union and the Member States operate efficiently and coherently while maintaining the competitiveness of our economy."
"The Commission has also pointed out the need decisively to support initiatives aimed at sustainable development and to increase coherence between industrial policy and other Community policies."
"Specifically, I am also delighted to tell the European Parliament that, in various areas of my responsibility, we have made progress in this direction of openness and competitiveness."
"Hence, since 1 July 2004, the electricity market has been a reality for non-domestic consumers and in March 2004 the Commission adopted an extremely important liberalisation package in relation to the railways."
"The latter constitutes a decisive step towards creating a completely integrated European railways market by 2010, which is essential to the competitiveness and sustainability of our transport system and all of this by means of the gradual opening up of the passenger rail market."
"I do not wish to go into issues which you have already supported and approved during 2004, such as the networks, the implementation of the single sky or the measures to be adopted on GALILEO before the end of the year relating to the decision on the group chosen for constructing and managing GALILEO."
"The second great priority is security and European citizenship."
"The Commission has noted the increasing interest on the part of this Parliament and the Council in enhancing European action in the field of security, particularly through strengthening controls on the external borders of the enlarged European Union, through better management of migratory flows, and Parliament has also expressed its concern – of course – to increase the effectiveness of the fight against terrorism at European level."
"These are extremely sensitive issues for the citizens and relate to the creation of the area of common justice and security."
"In June, the Commission made an assessment of the progress made since the Tampere European Council in 1999, and following the reactions of all the institutions, in particular the European Parliament, the Commission will carry on with its work in the field of justice and home affairs."
"In 2005, the new multi-annual justice and home affairs programme will be launched – which we hope will be supported by the European Council of 5 November – as well as new support measures within the context of the next financial perspectives."
"The terrorist attacks in Madrid were a dramatic reminder of the threat of international terrorism facing the European Union and have made the essential need to combat it more obvious than ever."
"All the institutions, and the European Parliament in particular, have emphasised their desire to move ahead with this fight."
"Just this morning, President Borrell spoke about this key issue; and all of this, as Mr Poettering said in his speech, without prejudice to human rights, to individual rights and to the objective and will to support the victims of terrorism, an essential element in this fight."
"The Commission intends to continue working in this direction."
"The third element is our external responsibilities and, in particular, the policy of association and neighbourhood."
"We have just held a debate on Belarus, but it should be pointed out that the Commission has noted broad support for an ambitious policy of neighbourhood and has expressed its opinions in that regard in the Communication of 12 May 2004 which was approved by the European Council in June."
"With regard to the enlargement process, the Commission can confirm that it is working towards the accession of Romania and Bulgaria in January 2007."
"On the basis of the European Council’s decision in June, the Commission will begin an active phase of negotiations with Croatia at the beginning of 2005 and will produce a pre-accession strategy."
"In October, the Commission will publish its recommendation on Turkey and will have to adjust its activities in 2005 in accordance with the decision of the European Council scheduled for the end of this year."
"As the Council and Parliament have stressed, Europe’s international commitments must be maintained during 2005 and Europe must show greater responsibility in order to promote effective multilateralism."
"The multilateral trade negotiations within the context of the Doha programme for development remain the European Union’s main commercial priority, and at the same time we shall continue with the regional and bilateral negotiations under way."
"Please allow me to comment briefly on two issues which are particularly important for next year."
"Firstly, the future financial perspectives, whose priorities largely coincide with the priorities proposed for 2005."
"The Commission is aware of the importance of doing whatever is necessary to ensure that everything is ready on 1 January 2007 and to this end the current Commission has presented proposals this year, in particular in February and July, and intends to present a new package of measures which will be adopted on 29 September with regard to the aspects of JHA, RELEX and the environment which remain outstanding."
"2005 will be fundamental and essential in terms of moving forward with preparing for close interinstitutional cooperation, but, furthermore, it is essential that these financial perspectives can be adopted as soon as possible during 2005 or very early 2006 if we really want them to be effective in 2007."
"I would like to point out that the Commission's proposal in this field takes account, on the one hand, of the austerity required, for example, by the Stability and Growth Pact in all public finances, but also realism with regard to the political ambitions repeatedly expressed not just by the Council but also by this Parliament."
"Increasing our capacities with regard to protecting external borders means more European Union investment in this sector, which will perhaps allow for greater facilities in certain States."
"If we truly wish to promote a competitive and dynamic society, we must increase investments in the research and development sector in order to support European research and capacity for innovation, and that requires more funds for that sector."
"Furthermore, we cannot forget that one of the objectives of European policy is the cohesion policy."
"We cannot call for this policy if we do not provide the necessary funds."
"We believe that what has been proposed, which is to keep 1.24 as the ceiling for commitments and establish 1.14 as the ceiling for spending, represents an appropriate balance between austerity and realism."
"Any additional cut would be extremely negative and would mean giving up many of the policies being called for."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the second point I wish to stress is that of the impact assessments relating to the Commission’s proposals."
"The Commission is implementing and generalising the use of these assessments in order to better define and justify its proposals."
"In 2004, the Commission’s services gradually increased the use of impact assessments with the aim of making them common practice by 2005, applied to all main documents – political definitions, legislative documents – as well as all proposals with significant economic, social or environmental impact, points which are included in the working programme and the legislative programme of the Commission and which are of great importance to this Parliament."
"In February, at the time of the presentation, I emphasised that it was a complex proposal and a complex procedure, because this Commission is passing the baton on to the next one."
"When the Prodi Commission established the cycle of strategic planning and programming, he wanted to involve the other institutions."
"Today, at the end of his mandate, I am delighted to note, as the Commissioner responsible for relations with the European Parliament, that the results are very positive."
"The interinstitutional dialogue has contributed to promoting greater mutual understanding and developing a shared vision which allows us to direct our policies more effectively."
"I hope that the future Commission will draw what it considers to be the appropriate conclusions and that, where necessary, it will propose revisions of the current procedures which make the methods approved during this time even more efficient."
"The debate is now suspended and will resume immediately after the vote."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, yesterday and this morning we have had the opportunity to deal with the issue of terrorism, its murderous insanity and the concern it brings to the whole civilised world."
"We are now going to pay tribute to the child victims of the latest terrorist massacre at the school in Beslan."
"Please be aware that, at the same time as us, tens of millions of children in the European Union are joining us in our tribute."
"In addition to the reactions of governments, of political leaders, of parliaments, let us hope that this mobilisation contributes to finding the path to peace."
"Let us dedicate a minute’s silence to the victims."
"Mr Pannella has the floor for a point of order."
"– Mr President, I take the floor pursuant to Rules 166 and 150 to say that, in my view, we are about to commit a very serious and inexplicable act."
"As Members of the new Parliament, we are being asked to decide upon our times, places and methods of work for 2005."
"Obviously, to decide on all that, we would need a draft proposal and the opportunity to discuss it and to table amendments."
"Now, however, without any debate or discussion, without mentioning Strasbourg or our places of work, we find ourselves having to ratify a timetable drawn up by the last Parliament back in April, when there were different majorities and different historical situations in Europe, and which in fact excludes the ten new Member States and their Members. I therefore believe, Mr President, that the Rules of Procedure have not been observed."
"The Presidency does not believe it appropriate to open a debate on this subject."
"A decision has already been made on this issue."
"There has never been a debate in this Parliament on the calendar of part-sessions."
"It has been dealt with by the Bureau and consequently the Presidency does not believe it appropriate to accept the point of order tabled by Mr Pannella."
"We shall now proceed to the vote on the calendar of part-sessions for 2005, to which no amendments have been tabled."
"Mr President, I wish to know whether I am allowed to make an explanation of vote."
"I am sorry, Mr Dover, but it has been a vote without debate and in this case explanations of vote should have been presented in writing in accordance with the Rules of Procedure. I would ask you to respect them."
"We will try to ensure that you can do so next time."
". I voted in favour, although I remain opposed to not holding plenary sessions on Fridays of Strasbourg weeks."
"Everyone has now realised that removing Friday mornings, halfway through the last legislature, tied in perfectly with both a strategy of trouble making and with the proposals of Members who are, as a rule, anti-Strasbourg."
"This move – three years’ experience is ample proof of this – has adversely affected our work and has led to an even greater overload of schedules that are already very crowded."
"Accordingly, I hope that this matter will be looked at again in the future and that, for the benefit of the running of Parliament, the Friday morning sessions will be reinstated."
". I voted in favour of the Economic and Social Committee’s request for consultation, as I feel that, quite apart from its purely procedural aspect, this committee’s stance is crucial on the important legal instrument that may dominate the future of the Union in the coming years."
"Indeed, in a European Union based on a common market and a single currency, and which claims common citizenship, it is crucial that we listen to the assembly, as it gives a voice to the interests of the various economic and social groups."
"The social fabric of our lives is made up of employers, workers and representatives of specific activities such as agriculture, craftsmen, SMEs and industries, the liberal professions, representatives of consumers, of the scientific and teaching community, of the social economy and of families."
"It is therefore essential that we become aware of how they see the issues that affect them directly."
"I also hope that this consultation will serve to encourage the crucial wider debate on the new Constitution – hopefully reflected in democratic referendums – at the grassroots, among the citizens, through various economic and social groups, in conjunction with the local authorities and, of course, with the political forces."
". I voted in favour of the request for consultation on the part of the Committee of the Regions, as I feel that quite apart from its purely procedural aspect, this committee’s stance is crucial on the important legal instrument that may dominate the future of the Union in the coming years."
"Indeed, in a European Union that favours decision-making as close as possible to the citizens and respects the principle of subsidiarity, it is essential that we listen to the political assembly, which gives a voice to local and regional power."
"I am aware of the declaration by the Committee of the Regions on 19 March of this year, in which the committee stated that it would join the project and the constitutional process."
"What I would like to know in greater detail, however, is its position as regards issues that concern it directly."
"I also hope that this consultation will serve to encourage the crucial wider debate on the new Constitution – hopefully reflected in democratic referendums – at the grassroots, among the citizens, through various economic and social groups, in conjunction with the local authorities and, of course, with the political forces."
". The aim of Draft amending budget No 7/2004 is to enter in the 2004 budget the surplus from 2003, amounting to EUR 5 470 million, which mainly consisted of the under-spending in the Structural Funds."
"It should be noted that the surplus would be EUR 10.5 million in 2003, had EUR 5 000 million not been reduced by Amending Budget No 6/2003."
"Budget surpluses have been consistent since 2000 – EUR 12 000 million in 2000, EUR 15 000 million in 2001 and EUR 7 000 million in 2002 – due to under-spending in the Structural Funds."
"If the funds for economic and social cohesion are the target of spending and are vital for economic and social cohesion, we must ask the following questions: Why is this not being done?"
"Is it because of the Stability Pact?"
"Is it due to a lack of political will?"
"Against this backdrop, it would appear to make sense, for those who say that there is extra money because money is not being spent, with the budget having to remain below 1%, to reduce the Structural Funds and even to renationalise the cohesion policy, which is not acceptable."
"It is no coincidence that the main net contributors are among the worst performers. ..."
". Draft amending budget No 8/2004 relates to the revenue side of the budget and comprises a number of elements affecting the level of contributions by Member States to the Community’s own resources, the correction of budgetary imbalances granted to the United Kingdom from 2000 and 2003 – the so-called ‘British cheque’."
"Although the rapporteur’s intentions have not appeared in the report – the approval of Commission decisions to create a general mechanism for correcting imbalances in the Community’s own resources – we must, however, restate our strong opposition to the Commission’s intentions and those of the main financial contributors; after all, you cannot remedy one injustice by committing another."
"In practice, the aim of the proposals on the table is to implement a new kind of ‘British cheque’ for other financial contributors, given that it is not possible to cancel a ‘British cheque’. Indeed, the remaining Member States cover the shortfall."
"The correction of imbalances would entail a harmonisation of effort per inhabitant, depending on the relative wealth of each country."
"National contributions based on GNP would be the fairest way, albeit subject to improvement, of solving the evident imbalances in budgetary contributions."
"I am abstaining from voting on this report."
"I do not regret the fact that there is a surplus in the EU budget, since this means smaller contributions for the individual Member States."
"The Member States’ contributions should be reduced permanently with a view to limiting the way in which money is shunted around and, in the longer term, even the EU’s administration."
"I wish to see a general review of the way in which the EU’s budget is funded, leading to a uniform system of payments."
". As the United Kingdom Conservatives spokesman on the Budgets Committee I wish to explain why we voted against the two Draft Amending Budget Reports Nos 7/2004 and 8/2004 today."
"The United Kingdom Conservative Members of the European Parliament are totally opposed to any suggestion, or proposal, that the British rebate should be reduced."
"Why should Britain suffer for its economic success over the last 20 years?"
"We are abstaining from voting on this report."
"We do not regret the fact that there is a surplus in the EU budget, but welcome the fact that this will lead to reduced membership fees for the EU Member States."
"In order to limit the way in which money is shunted around and, in the longer term, EU administration too, the membership fees should be reduced permanently."
"We wish to see a general review of the way in which the EU budget is funded, leading to a uniform system of payments."
". Having voted for Mr Mulder’s report, I wish to congratulate him on his excellent work."
"Yet again, the Community Budget has recorded a surplus, amounting in total to EUR 5 469 843 705.65 for 2003."
"Much of this final amount is accounted for by the under-spending of payment appropriations."
"As in previous financial years, this situation is largely caused by the poor implementation of Structural Fund programmes (representing EUR 3.134 billion or 66% of the under-spend) and this gives considerable cause for concern."
"I therefore want to express my dissatisfaction with this additional surplus, in view of the fact that, quite apart from this amount, the Sixth Amending Budget of 2003 had already reduced the 2003 budget by EUR 5 billion due to a significant overestimation of payments under the Structural Funds."
"As a result, I find it very much to be regretted that this figure marks an end to the favourable development recorded over recent financial years, which saw a reduction in the surplus from EUR 15 billion in 2001 to EUR 7 billion in 2002."
"As the British rebate for any given year must be funded during the following financial year, meaning that the twenty-five Member States will share in funding the 2003 rebate, I am in favour of the adjustment to the rebate proposed for 2003, which should be incorporated into this draft amending budget."
"I am sure that members of this Parliament and of the Council will continue to be guided by wisdom in taking future decisions relating to the financial perspectives."
"We shall now continue with the debate on the stocktaking of the follow–up to the Commission's Annual Policy Strategy for 2005."
"– Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, as Chairman of the Conference of Presidents, I would like to start by expressing sincere thanks to Mrs de Palacio for her excellent cooperation and for her constant availability throughout her term of office."
"Over the past few years, we have covered a lot of mileage together, and have made a success of it."
"Let us recall that, at the beginning of the last Parliament, there was no structured dialogue between our two institutions as regards the preparation of the Commission’s legislative and working programme."
"Today, and to a large degree thanks to your efforts, we have a real dialogue between the institutions, which has made it possible for the Commission’s legislative programme, from now on, to better reflect Parliament’s priorities, so the results of this ongoing dialogue are thoroughly encouraging."
"I would like, however, against the background of our experiences over the last few years – and this is what I understand by stocktaking to offer some lines of thought on the main areas of concern for the future."
"First and foremost, it strikes me that interinstitutional dialogue should focus even more on the main legislative priorities, some current examples of which you have already mentioned, such as future Financial Perspectives or the proposals for REACH."
"We must aim to identify, as early as possible, the most urgent proposals, in order to be able to better organise our work when the time comes."
"The package of proposals on future Financial Perspectives is an excellent example."
"This week, this House will be taking the decision to set up a temporary committee within which work on these proposals will be coordinated."
"Defining priorities also involves identifying what is no longer relevant to present-day concerns."
"With this in mind, I welcome the Commission’s recent decision to withdraw a whole series of proposals."
"Having said that, despite this cleaning-up operation, a number of proposals remain on the table with little hope of being brought to fruition."
"Let me take this opportunity to ask my fellow Members to closely scrutinise the list of work in progress and then ask the new Commission to withdraw or replace any supplementary dossier that is no longer relevant."
"The second major area that concerns me has to do with improving the way in which the legislative programme relates to what is provided in the Budget, and this is where it strikes me as opportune that we should think about better coordination within this House between the debates on the Budget and those on policy priorities."
"To talk in practical terms, one might in future organise a large-scale budget debate in the presence of the whole Commission, thereby making the debate as specific as possible and making it possible to set out the actual directions in which the legislative programme should go."
"Such a debate should be held at a point when the legislative programme has reached an advanced stage, and the November part-session strikes me – for the present – as the ideal time for this."
"Such considerations prompt me to make a third, and essential, point concerning the schedule for presenting the legislative programme."
"I see it as imperative that everything possible be done to ensure that this should be available, in good time, to all the actors involved, including the national parliaments, European consultative bodies, and, ultimately, the public themselves."
"Finally, it is essential that we build up still further coordination between our work and that of the Council."
"We have the tools we need to do this, by which I mean the Council’s multinational programme and the annual programme as prepared by two successive presidencies."
"Recently, too, I would also add, we have concluded an interinstitutional agreement laying the foundations for ‘better law-making’ in the European Union."
"At present, our role is to implement these new instruments for the benefit of the public, and I wonder whether this might not be the right time for our institution to take a look at whether those priorities that take the form of a legislative programme have a future."
"Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, we have made enormous progress over the past few years in identifying shared priorities and in planning our legislative work together."
"There are three things that I see as being important if we are to gain our fellow-citizens’ confidence in our shared project."
"In future, we will need to communicate the major priorities and issues of our legislative activity."
"We will have to strengthen participatory democracy, and for that to happen it will be essential that all the interested parties be allowed as much time as they want to identify the priorities for the year ahead."
"Last of all, we will have to demonstrate the efficiency of our institutions, both in terms of their internal functioning and of their relations with one another."
"I trust that these thoughts will help us to achieve our goals."
"Thank you, Mr Daul, for the work you do."
"– Mr President, Madam Vice-President, thank you for the report you presented today."
"I want to discuss just a few points in it."
"The first is certainly the preparation for the next stages of enlargement and of the Neighbourhood Policy, for it is not perhaps apparent to everyone that enlargement is not over, and you rightly referred to the historic significance of the enlargement project."
"We have heard from Commissioner Verheugen that, even if discussions with them, and ratification, are completed, there are grave concerns as to whether Romania and Bulgaria will develop in the way they should over the two years remaining before their accession."
"This means that we need to monitor very closely the actual processes involved and the actual implementation."
"That would, of course, be particularly true in the case of Turkey, and also of Croatia, if we want to make rapid progress with Croatia, which – or so I believe – is what not only the Commission, but also the Council and this Parliament definitely want to do."
"It will then also be necessary to monitor what goes on with appropriate care, although the same can also be said of the Neighbourhood Policy as a whole."
"I am thinking, for example, of the Balkans, where we may well have established peace, but it is very precarious, and where we still have much to do to secure it, along with economic and social development."
"You drew our attention to security policy, and I see it as, in principle, the right approach, that the Commission is already – as I hope the incoming Commission will do even more intensively and to a wider extent – joining with our neighbours in attempting to shape immigration and security policy and to avoid in future the unwelcome developments that we have seen over recent weeks, months, and indeed years, in particular in the Mediterranean, where many have tried to reach Europe, only to die in the attempt."
"The aspects mentioned so far, however, also need financial support."
"I do not believe that enlargement and the Neighbourhood Policy are exclusively financial in character, but without appropriate financial measures we will not get anywhere with them."
"A second point, one that Mr Schulz has already mentioned, is the issue of competition, the social Europe and sustainable development."
"As I see it, the social Europe and sustainable development need even more support, without detracting from the importance of competition, but, Madam Vice-President, I am sure you are familiar with the report produced mainly on behalf of Commissioners Almunia and Bolkestein, on the evaluation of the performance of network industries providing services of general interest It is a very interesting report; it shows that our competition policy is achieving very real successes in some areas for the benefit of consumers, for that is what lower prices and better supply are all about."
"This report, though – it comes from within the Commission and is very competition-oriented – shows that a number of problems remain to be resolved, for example in transport."
"Let me take two examples from an area that just happens to be of great interest to you, that of transport; you may well have worked on them yourself."
"Many consumers think that, in connection with transport and, in particular, local passenger transport, a number of problems are arising, or remaining unresolved, that cannot be solved through competition alone; they believe that they also call for investment."
"Today, Madam Vice-President, you yourself referred to the trans-European networks, where we took a common approach;"
"I am also grateful for the Commission’s cooperation."
"On the other hand, there is also a need for more funding to enable these investments to be made, and consumers have – as this report shows – very long wish-lists in the field of energy, with aspirations towards alternative or renewable energies, which are proving very difficult to promote in some countries."
"Some countries have done more than was envisaged in the objectives, but others have done too little."
"Here, too, there is a need for more investment if this sustainable development is to be promoted."
"Let me just say something about Budget policy, with which I believe we will be very occupied over the coming months."
"What matters is not that we stipulate in an abstract way that we need 1% or 1.14% of the national product; rather, we need to ask where the deficits are, by which I mean deficits in the sense of investments that need to be increased."
"It will be necessary to invest more in the trans-European networks, to which you referred, and, of course, also in education and training."
"This was something I discussed with the Dutch Presidency in the relevant committee."
"Despite the Lisbon process, budgeting problems mean ever more cutbacks in training and continuing education at universities, but Europe will get no nearer to the goals of the Lisbon process if we fail to invest more in education and training and if we cannot reverse the brain drain, which continues to flow towards the USA."
"We must bring the best brains back to Europe or find a way of keeping them here; that is the investment I see as being particularly important in our own countries, but also, of course, in the countries adjoining us, so that we might invest more in education and training in those of the countries adjoining us that are drawing closer to Europe."
"Let me make a final point on information activities, in which – as the elections showed – we still need to invest more."
"While I welcome the new Commissioner’s plans for this area, which will have a Commissioner to handle it, there is a need for improvement in the financial and staff resources for the Commission’s and Parliament’s Representations in the various countries, for information activities have to be highly decentralised."
"They will have to be handled differently in the UK to how they are handled in Austria, and the way they are carried out in France will have to be different from the way they are carried out in Poland, because the problems they address are local ones."
"I hope that there will be stronger support for them."
"Let me conclude, Madam Vice-President, with something I have said before."
"We have clashed on various occasions, and we have had quite a few arguments, some of them more serious, but I would like, both for myself personally and for my group, to thank you most warmly for your work."
"I think it has always ended up bearing good fruit, and whether these be Spanish oranges or something else is irrelevant; what matters is success."
"Thank you for your cooperation."
"Mr President, one of the three policy priorities for 2005 in the Commission's annual policy strategy is security and European citizenship."
"The Parliament and certainly the ALDE Group can only agree, but let us look at whether the rhetoric is being translated into reality in the relevant policy areas, in terms of both proposed budgetary resources and democratic accountability to our citizens."
"Some of my comments are directed at the Council and I am very sorry to see that they are not in their place."
"Taking first the area of asylum and immigration and external borders, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs – when adopting the report of our Rapporteur, Mr Deprez, last night – insisted that the funding for the programme on return management in the area of migration proposed by the Commission be put into the reserve until, firstly, the Council move to codecision, which is required by the treaties but which they have done nothing about, and secondly, there is a proper legislative act."
"We fully support this programme, but are disappointed that we are being asked to approve something which is lacking in legislative and democratic certainty."
"We are aware that there is good work going on in the area of integration and reception of asylum seekers, but we think there should be more money in areas like the European Refugee Fund."
"The European Agency for the Management of the External Borders still does not have a permanent seat."
"There has been a lot of talk about external borders, but the Council cannot even decide on where the seat should be."
"In the area of crime and terrorism, next year only a modest increase is proposed by the Commission in the budget for Eurojust, which is a key player in the fight against serious crime."
"The Committee on Civil Liberties wants to increase the funding by two-thirds if we are going to be serious about cross-border efforts to tackle crime."
"As to the area dealing with reinforcing respect for human rights and the rule of law, let me give you one example: the Commission is proposing to cut the funding for the research and evaluation programme on respect for fundamental rights, which includes funding for the network of experts on fundamental rights."
"These examples perhaps show the gap between rhetoric and reality."
"We need to put our money where our mouth is to be credible and not create disillusionment among the citizens of Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, now that a new Commission is taking office, it would be appropriate to wish it every success."
"Unfortunately, President Barroso’s Commission has not even made a start and there are already evident signs of disharmony in its ranks."
"Various Commissioners have put all their differences of opinion on display in the media."
"Accordingly, the new Italian Commissioner for Justice was immediately met with disapproving comments when he mooted, with regard to asylum policy, the idea that the time had come to take the bull by the horns and set up reception camps for refugees on the Union’s external borders."
"Anyone who is aware of the harrowing asylum issues in Italy, with the constant stream of boat refugees on the island of Lampedusa, realises that the Commissioner did not float these proposals light-heartedly."
"Nevertheless, the new Belgian Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, Louis Michel, who already has some experience when it comes to insulting the Italians, considered it necessary to dissociate himself from his colleague straightaway."
"In fact, it is this self-same Louis Michel who openly declared in the Belgian media that he intends to continue to combine his job as European Commissioner with active political membership of his own party in Belgium, where he claims he would like to return to active campaigning as an ordinary member."
"In this, he does not exactly show a great deal of respect for his new office."
"Turkey’s accession seems to be another contentious issue."
"Depending on the political sensitivities of the Member States from which they come, some Commissioners are in favour, and others against."
"There is no hope of unanimity in this area either."
"However, with regard to this tricky issue, I should like to urge the new Commission at this point in time to take into consideration the reluctance on the part of the majority of the European population to allow an Islamic and non-European country to join the European Union."
"If not, this Commission is at risk of losing its democratic legitimacy before it has properly started."
"Mr President, I would like to start by telling Commissioner de Palacio how much we have appreciated the experience of working with her for the past five years."
"We have valued her energy, her willingness, and the courage with which she expressed certain views and took up positions."
"Mrs de Palacio, you have been an example to us and we will miss you."
"I also, quite simply, want to express my regret at the absence of any connection between the timetable of the European elections on the one hand and, on the other, the appointment of the new Commission and its taking up of office."
"Certain delays are particularly regrettable and hold up the work of lawmaking."
"It strikes us that 2004 is turning out to be something of a lost year."
"There have of course been positive results, some of them very positive indeed."
"There have been positive results as regards the euro; it is a strong and stable currency, but it does not address the public concern about possible company relocations, and so we see this as a very high priority."
"There have been positive results, too, in relation to enlargement: the Commission has made a success of enlargement, but it has not been able to conduct a debate on Europe’s future borders, so it is that sort of debate for which we are still waiting, along with the debate on Turkey, which will, without doubt, be beset with perils for all of us."
"As for our work on the legislative front, it has made it possible to deal with certain issues relating to safety, specifically at sea – something for which I will take this opportunity to thank the Commissioner – to food safety and to the fight against terrorism, but there are many still to be resolved as regards migration flows."
"There is much else that we should be doing."
"Admittedly, there has been an increase in the research budget, but it is important that we should follow that up in view of our serious concerns about the brain drain."
"While on that subject, let me stress the need to give much more thought to our young people, about whom too little is said in this Chamber."
"We must discuss their mobility, their education, not to mention equivalence for diplomas, an area in which the situation is not changing quickly enough, where there are still too many difficulties and where there is a need for us to exert pressure on the Council."
"All this depends on financial perspectives, the debate on which must not be solely budgetary in character."
"There has to be a real policy debate on our aspirations, on what we want for this Europe of ours, and we must be able to equip the Europe we envisage for the years ahead with the funding it needs."
"Let me conclude by congratulating each and every Commissioner."
"We did indeed value their competence and their efforts as individuals, whilst regretting this Commission’s lack of sufficient vision in certain areas, as well as the lack of punch and effectiveness of its President, Mr Prodi, and his inability to make something of his role."
"Is that, though, what he wanted?"
"I will end, Mr President, by saying that, for a year, we have found President Prodi’s ongoing absence regrettable."
"It testifies to his lack of interest in our institution, and I hope that the next President of the Commission will have a different attitude towards us."
"Mr President, I would like to comment on the issue of competitiveness because it is very important in Europe today."
"Most people have little trust in the EU and that often arises because we do not show the right kind of qualities to the people in terms of our deregulatory attitude."
"We do not have sufficient fiscal discipline in our countries."
"We do not look at taxes which encourage people rather than discourage them, and although the currency has been debated elsewhere this week, the issue of discipline within currencies is of critical importance in a very competitive world."
"We in the UK are not members of the single currency."
"I see no reason for us to be members but we still have an interest in the success of the single currency in Europe."
"We also need to be concerned in our own country with sterling, and indeed with all the other major currencies of the world."
"We cannot simply sit back and allow these matters to develop in a random way."
"To set a good example to new Member States aspiring to join the single currency, it is important that the Member States which are already members of the single currency demonstrate the necessary disciplines and controls."
"I wish the currency well, but it is essential that we remember that we are now dealing with a world that is full of other countries with developing economies, in Asia and in China, countries that are not going to wait, countries that are very disciplined indeed when it comes to their fiscal arrangements and the currencies in which they operate."
"There is no alternative."
"A policy of that kind best serves the citizens of all the countries of Europe who look to their governments to provide them with continued good quality of life."
"My message is that fiscal responsibility is the key component in meeting those needs."
"Mr President, I too wish to thank the Vice-President of the European Commission, Mrs de Palacio."
"I can certainly subscribe to everything she has said here, especially with regard to priorities."
"2005 will also be an important year, and we need to find a way to give our citizens confidence in this area of decision-making."
"This confidence will be brought about by focusing on priorities, on important issues, and as a consequence of this, results too will be achieved."
"The top priority is security, a subject that has been raised here during our discussions on solutions and decision-making with regard to the border guard force and the fight against terrorism."
"We must also, however, focus on local security: the security of every person’s immediate surroundings."
"That is something our citizens will certainly want to see."
"All these matters, of course, are interconnected."
"Secondly, sustainable development is an important issue."
"We have to solve the problem of how to preserve the viability of industry and at the same time take environmental protection into account."
"In the future, conjoining the two will be very important in maintaining competition and conserving the environment."
"The Lisbon Agenda is an important issue, but it requires concrete action."
"We need results in employment policy in terms of competitiveness, but the main factors in this regard are economic policy and budgetary discipline, on which subject we have heard an excellent speech just now."
"We must set an example here to national parliaments and national governments in maintaining budgetary discipline."
"We each have our own priorities and would like to see increases in the budget, but this way the budget will grow ever larger, and economic policy will slip through our fingers."
"Discipline must be preserved, and that will come about as a result of these same priorities."
"We are bound by a policy where certain matters are dealt with and others take second place, as we only have a limited number of resources at our disposal."
"A healthy and sustainable economy: I was pleased to hear this point being made."
"In my opinion, however, if we are to have a healthy and sustainable economy in Europe, the Stability and Growth Pact must be kept as it is."
"It should not be toned down, nor should it be downgraded; instead, it should at least be kept as it is, and we need to ensure that it is complied with in each country in the same way."
"This is what will inspire confidence, not the idea that, little by little, we are beginning to downgrade the agreements we made together earlier on."
"Next year will be an important year, as it is the first complete year of the functioning of a whole new Parliament and an enlarged Europe."
"It is with these priorities that we can show our citizens that things are progressing well, and that is a prerequisite for us to be able to continue our work."
"– Mr President, policy priorities are only convincing if resources are available to fund them."
"That is true both of longer–term ambitions – the financial perspectives to which the Commissioner made reference are a case in point – and of the short-term, namely for the coming year."
"It is good that a schedule is being drawn up and even better that Parliament is closely involved in it."
"The latter is necessary from a democratic point of view, and because Parliament is a budgetary authority."
"This can be perfectly fitted in within Community methods, as the Commission has also understood and applied, for which thanks."
"In my view, the annual policy strategy which the Commission communicated to us in February, and which we discussed in April, has lost none of its topicality."
"The three priorities should therefore definitely be maintained, and, without denying the importance of the other priorities, I should like to ask you to pay special attention to those concerning competitiveness and cohesion."
"If we really want to create more jobs and achieve sustainable development and real social cohesion, we must create a mechanism in 2005 which not only ensures that the Lisbon objectives are put into practice, but should be accompanied by real incentives and big sticks in order to actually achieve those objectives within a framework that does not jeopardise stability."
"Let us hope that the Kok report offers us a sound basis for having a debate in the near future, which we should guide towards the taking of decisions that allow us to make a kind of quantum leap."
"We must make room for this in 2005."
"In my view, only in that way can we demonstrably ensure the policy’s continuity, show that we are delivering on our promises and offering people what they can expect from us, and that we can clear the path for the policy priorities that Mr Barroso, the new President of the Commission, has announced and which our group generally supports."
"Finally, I should like to say a word of thanks to the Vice-President of the Commission and also all those of her colleagues who have always given priority to the maintenance of sound democratic relations with this House."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the various speakers for their kind words referring to my cooperation with this Parliament."
"I shall begin by mentioning Mr Daul, with whom we have cooperated in his capacity as President of the Conference of Committee Chairmen throughout all this time in order to facilitate cooperation between Parliament and the Commission."
"I would like to remind you that when this Commission began its work our relations were very difficult."
"The outgoing Commission had been obliged to resign precisely because of the pressure and debates and confrontation with this Parliament."
"We needed to put that situation right and create an entirely different basis on which to rebuild a form of cooperation between the two institutions which is essential to building Europe, and it is through these two institutions, in one way or another, that the interests of the European Union are represented."
"In this regard, I would like to thank this Parliament, the honourable Members and also the officials of this House, as well as the officials of the European Commission who have worked on the various documents and agreements, for making it possible amongst all of us to create a framework agreement and then this for structured dialogue between Parliament and the Commission."
"Furthermore, these two documents, which have now been supplemented with the interinstitutional agreement – which the Council also participates in for the sake of better regulation – have resulted from discussions and negotiations which have not been easy but in connection with which we have all had the greatest possible interest in ensuring that things go well and work properly in order to build Europe more effectively."
"I would like to express my gratitude for the active participation of all the honourable Members who had direct responsibilities and for the cooperation of everybody who has participated in this work."
"Mr Daul has referred to the progress and the fruits of this structured dialogue and has said that it must be improved in the future."
"I also believe that we can make it work better, but that that will be negotiated with the new Commission and I wish you luck in those talks and improvements."
"He spoke finally about better communication, about more participatory democracy and increasing efficiency."
"We are all in agreement on this."
"He has talked about presenting legislative programmes in good time and introducing new concepts which until now have hardly been taken into account, such as the possibilities national Parliaments will have in the future with regard to certain texts."
"I would like to say that all of this will undoubtedly have to be incorporated, but at the same time there are limits if we do not want to paralyse the machinery entirely."
"In any event, coordination with the Council is something which must be improved and something which we are working on, as well as coherence between legislative programmes and budgets."
"Key to seeing if this is true will be the adoption of the future financial perspectives and whether these financial perspectives are genuinely going to reflect the political priorities of the European Union today, outside of specific agreements which exist on certain specific aspects."
"We will have to wait and see."
"The honourable Members will be very active here."
"I will be somewhere else, but naturally I will be following the debates in question extremely closely."
"It has been pointed out that certain issues remain outstanding, naturally, as well as issues that have been mentioned which are even more ambitious."
"Well, this is possible."
"Although it is not my job to say so and President Prodi will say it to this House, I believe that the overall achievement of this Commission has been really positive."
"There naturally remains work to be done during next year, and that is just as well because otherwise our successors would be out of work and that is in nobody’s interest."
"And anyway things can always be improved."
"I believe that the new enlargement brings great challenges, that we must continue to make progress on the neighbourhood policy and the Balkans Stability Pact, ensuring that they are accompanied by very concrete actions."
"For example, the creation of the electricity and gas markets throughout the Balkans are very concrete actions relating to the Balkans Stability Pact which can and must be continued by the new Commission and, throughout 2005, must be vigorously promoted."
"I believe there must be a balance between competitiveness, social Europe and the environment, but we must be aware that if we do not have competitiveness, if we do not generate wealth in a globalised world, it will be difficult for us to respond to the requirements of a social Europe or to environmental concerns."
"That is something we cannot forget."
"Competitiveness must provide the framework for everything, and without competitiveness, without creating wealth and jobs, we will achieve nothing more than frustration, because we would have promised and agreed things which cannot be realised."
"They can only be realised on the basis of economic development and job creation which unquestionably require concrete action on aspects such as technological development and research."
"With regard to the issue of suburban transport, public transport, Mr Swoboda has made a number of observations."
"On the subject of investments, I would like to point out that there are very important aspects relating to public transport which are affected by the Altmark judgment, a key judgment which will have to be taken into account not only in relation to the transport sector but in relation to all public services in the European Union and in relation to the introduction of competition and the possibility of public support in order to guarantee a certain level of service, but in a transparent and competitive way."
"I would like to thank Mrs Grossetête for her kind words and this brings me straight to an issue I believe to be essential: a series of aspects relating to the problem of competitiveness."
"Relocation in certain fields is going to take place and it is reasonable that it should take place, because the only opportunity for new countries at global level is offered by certain types of less technological production, which do not present problems in terms of building, or production in outlying areas, which do not have to be close to the consumer."
"Relocation sometimes takes place, however, because we do not consider our objectives properly, but rather the instruments for achieving them."
"I would, moreover, like to make an appeal in relation to the Kyoto Protocol and the Directive on emissions trading."
"We have approved a Directive and we must comply with it, but I would also like to make an observation which I have made publicly within the Commission."
"We must not simply state casually whether we are for or against the Kyoto Protocol."
"No."
"I am in favour of the Protocol."
"I support the reduction of greenhouse gases."
"What is more, I believe it to be one of the most important challenges not just for the European Union but for the whole of humanity."
"It is a challenge that truly endangers the future of humanity if not dealt with properly."
"In this regard, in terms of energy efficiency, I support renewable energy, and a true, honourable and courageous discussion of nuclear energy."
"This is absolutely necessary – and I am naturally saying this on my own behalf, I would like to make that clear – and I believe that the next Commission and this Parliament must confront this issue over the coming years."
"Time is passing and the urgency is clear."
"This summer and last summer we have begun to see the first manifestations of the increase of less than one degree in the planet’s average temperature."
"If that is the case, we cannot resort to solutions which sound good but are false."
"Let me explain what I mean: the system of emissions trading may be a good one if implemented within the framework of a worldwide agreement, which is the only way emissions trading can have real effects."
"If that system operates within a context in which only the European Union fulfils those responsibilities, in which Kyoto is not ratified by Russia or the United States – the only two countries able to provide the critical mass to allow it to enter into force – we may find that we lose our steel, cement, tile, ceramics and other industries consuming energy, which would not mean pollution would be stopped, because the pollution would be created in third countries whose conditions are much less demanding."
"Steel, cement and ceramics would still be produced and we would have to import them into Europe, adding the cost and the emissions of the transport involved, while we would theoretically still be complying with that emissions reduction."
"Is reduction in emissions a reality at an overall global level?"
"No, it is not."
"This must be taken into account because we are endangering some of our industry without ultimately producing any real results in terms of the essential aim, which is to reduce emissions at global level."
"That cannot be done unless we have the courage to confront the problems of nuclear energy, to confront them, and we must provide the citizens with transparency and information and hence the Commission’s proposals."
"We must, moreover, understand that Europe must increase its nuclear energy potential and capacities and we must not put forward flippant arguments in relation to it, if we want to maintain growth and a degree of competitiveness and at the same time combat climate change."
"We must, furthermore, do this at global level."
"Europe alone is not enough."
"If we make all the efforts I have referred to, we will reduce CO2 emissions by 400 million tonnes a year, more or less."
"China alone is going to increase its emissions over the next fifteen years by 4 000 million tonnes of CO2."
"These are the great challenges which need to be confronted urgently over the coming years and I hope that Parliament will do so and, naturally, I am sure that the next Commission will do so."
"The question of nuclear energy is a personal position, but I believe that if we do not confront this problem we will clearly be failing to fulfil our responsibilities properly."
"We must act responsibly, because we all know that there are great problems in terms of popularity and public acceptance."
"And we must therefore provide explanations, information, transparency, security and guarantees."
"The brain drain."
"It is not just that our best minds are leaving, but that it is to the United States, which is our ally, friend and partner, that not just our brains, but the best brains from the whole world, are going."
"And Europe is not receiving the best minds from third countries."
"We have stopped attracting intelligence, innovation and research."
"That is the key for the future."
"Europe must face this and it is one of the priorities we have included in the next financial perspectives and we hope this will be understood."
"I would like to point out that, with regard to the aspects raised by Mr Kirkhope concerning competitiveness, he has referred essentially to fiscal responsibility and to the coherence of the broad economic policies, and I can only agree with him."
"I believe that the debate currently taking place in Europe on improving the functioning of the Stability Pact is extremely important and this is the approach we must take."
"And that means providing certainty and securities, that is to say, we cannot increase discretionality in our assessment of certain types of circumstance."
"Discretionality must be avoided, so that we do not act in an arbitrary manner."
"It must be avoided so that there is certainty, clarity and guarantees for the markets."
"With regard to security, Mr Itälä has spoken about security, the environment, competitiveness, the Stability Pact;"
"I agree entirely with what he has said, and I also agree with everything Mrs Thyssen said beforehand with regard to the problems of promoting competition and cohesion;"
"I believe that the Kok report is a wonderful basis for work in this direction, and to Mrs Ludford, who talked about rhetoric and reality, I would like to say that I cannot agree with her, although there are times in politics when we all know that the reality is not exactly as we say it is."
"Those are, however, the concrete realities of budgetary efforts, the JHA is one of the items which, on the proposal of the Commission, is increased most in the draft financial perspectives for 2007-2013 according to the Commission’s proposal."
"It will be the Council that will adopt the final decisions."
"This Parliament also has to give its opinion."
"With regard to the divisions or lack of divisions mentioned by Mr Dillen, I am not going to get into that."
"Clearly not everybody agrees all the time, but in the end an agreement is reached – and that is democracy – in accordance with the majority opinion, which is the opinion of the institution."
"Over all these years we in the Commission have not always held the same views, but we have had to reach agreements and we have all supported that position."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it has been an honour for me to represent the Commission in terms of relations with the European Parliament, to have been elected, and in this respect I would like to thank President Prodi for having put his trust in me and for having proposed me as Vice-President for Relations with the European Parliament."
"I must say that I did not merely accept it, but rather I asked for it and I was delighted, because I consider myself first and foremost to be a parliamentarian."
"I have tried to cooperate faithfully with this House throughout these years and I believe I have done so."
"Furthermore, what I would like to say in particular is that I thank you for the work you have done in codecision, where generally speaking you have made improvements – sometimes we create some pretty extraordinary things in order to reach a consensus – but the overall result is hugely positive, since this Parliament reflects the sensitivities of the citizens of the European Union, complemented by those of the governments of the European Union."
"Within this interactive dialogue, in which the Commission makes a proposal and then acts as mediator, I believe we have made the proposals approved in recent times more realistic."
"I believe that the reforms incorporated into the new Constitutional Treaty, which we all hope will be duly ratified as soon as possible, supplement, generalise and extend these parliamentary functions, ensuring simply that the functions of the European Parliament, which already has practically all the functions of any Parliament of the world, are extended to all areas of legislative responsibility."
"I would like to point out that the task of control has been enormously effective, at times uncomfortable, but has been carried out extremely effectively by the honourable Members and your predecessors in a responsible, intelligent, professional and honest way."
"I am sure that this new Parliament together with the new Commission will continue this work."
"Those are the essential elements of the European Parliament, which is one of the three great institutions which allows everybody to participate in this extraordinary and unique project of building Europe."
"Mrs de Palacio, I am not sure whether you will be seen in this Chamber again, so I would like to take this opportunity to thank you very much indeed for the outstanding way in which you have cooperated with the European Parliament."
"I should also like to thank you and your staff for the commitment and seriousness – and charm – that you brought to your other work in the Commission."
"I wish you every possible success in the future."
"The debate is closed."
"(1)"
"The next item is the Council’s presentation of the draft General Budget for 2005."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour for me, on behalf of the Council, to be able to present to you the draft Budget as we have decided it for 2005 in the Council in July."
"As European Affairs Minister, I will be making regular visits in the next few months, and that is why I should like to take this opportunity of congratulating you once again, partly officially, on your election as Members of the European Parliament. In particular, I should like to mention the chairmen of the two committees, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"As the two branches of the budgetary authority, you in the European Parliament and we in the Council, we have enjoyed excellent cooperation in the past few years, and I am convinced that we can continue in the same fashion."
"In my view, the conciliation meeting we had in July last sets the right tone for this."
"During that conciliation meeting, we came to a number of sound agreements, and I should like to mention one here, namely the provision of information on the part of the Council to you in the European Parliament in the light of the forthcoming financial perspectives."
"I think that that is a good starting point for our, that is the EU presidency’s communications and dealings with you, the European Parliament, including where the financial perspectives are concerned."
"I should like to make a few general observations about this Budget’s guiding principles and follow this up by making a few specific explanatory comments about the different headings."
"The Council has, of course, in deciding on the draft budget, taken into consideration the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 with which you are familiar."
"This Agreement pertains to, , the importance of ceilings and compliance with them, and of discussion on adequate margins, on unforeseen circumstances and flexibility."
"The Council has emphasised that sufficient payment appropriations must become available without losing touch with reality in the process."
"We must avoid overestimating the level of payment appropriations."
"The excessive surpluses that have materialised over the past few years do not reflect the best financial management."
"Moreover, I am certain that you in the European Parliament will also agree that, as all Member States and all national parliaments have to observe strict discipline, we should do the same at European level."
"As you have been able to see, we in the Council have listed with great care our priorities and posteriorities in the different headings of the financial perspectives."
"One priority I should like to highlight is the importance of providing the new Member States with sufficient leeway, in line with the agreements we have made in this respect previously, including in Copenhagen."
"Finally, in the bracket of general explanatory comments, I should like to mention the importance of what we call activity statements."
"I think that that is a good new way that improves quality and the provision of information, and that is an improvement on the way in which we deal with the Budget."
"Consequently, the Commission has been asked to continue the efforts in this area."
"I should like to run through the different categories, starting with the general remark that, as you know, the draft Budget provides for an amount of EUR 116 billion for commitments, which is 4.1% more than in the 2004 Budget."
"As for payment appropriations, that is to say, the cash that the European Union will be required to pay out during 2005, a total of EUR 105 billion has been set aside for this purpose."
"That represents an increase of 5.4% compared to the appropriations for the current year, and corresponds to 0.99% of the Union’s gross national income."
"With regard to Heading 1, agriculture, I should like to comment as follows."
"In previous years, the estimates were often too high."
"The Council has therefore decided to reduce by a total of EUR 1 billion the amounts proposed by the Commission in its preliminary draft budget for common agricultural policy."
"We have done this by a general reduction of all items on the preliminary draft budget amounting to more than EUR 800 million."
"However, the Council has taken account of the fact that the ultimate level of appropriations will be determined in the autumn, when the Commission presents its letter of amendment as agreed in the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"Concerning Heading 2, the structural measures, the Council has adopted the commitment appropriations proposed in the Commission’s preliminary draft budget for this heading."
"Nevertheless, and in the light of the substantial under-use of the resources for structural measures, the Council has decided to lower the level of payment appropriations."
"Accordingly, the payment appropriations proposed by the Commission in its preliminary draft budget have, by means of a general reduction, been cut by EUR 3 billion."
"The resulting appropriation corresponds to the expected implementation level."
"This reduction also impacts on Community initiatives and the completion of programmes dating from before 2000."
"In this connection, however, I should like to emphasise that the payment appropriations which the Council determined in its draft budget, even after this discount, are still significantly higher than the implementation level in the previous years."
"As for Heading 3, internal policy, the Council has decided to adopt the amounts in the draft budget that were proposed in line with the codecision procedure for multi-annual programmes, as agreed following enlargement."
"This also applies to specific amounts related to the Copenhagen conclusions."
"The Council, however, has restricted the appropriations for a few budget lines that are not based on multi-annual programmes."
"This applies to press and communication and to the preparatory measures in the area of security research."
"The Council takes the view that the amounts that the Commission had allocated to a few specific agencies were in excess of what can be regarded as realistic in view of their recent inception."
"As a result of the choices within Heading 3 to which I have just referred, the Council provides for a margin of EUR 108 million under the ceiling for Heading 3 of the financial perspectives."
"On the basis of this margin, the European Parliament will also need to be able to set its own priorities for internal policy."
"In respect of Heading 4, external actions, the Council has deviated from the approach for which the Commission had opted in its preliminary draft budget."
"The Council was of the opinion that more detailed choices needed to be made in the list of priorities, so as not to exceed the ceiling of Heading 4 of the financial perspectives."
"Indeed, the deployment of the flexibility instrument is not at issue."
"The Council has, however, adopted the amounts proposed by the Commission for reconstruction in Iraq."
"Bearing in mind the resources required for the common foreign and security policy, the Council has maintained the level that was determined for this in the final budget for 2004."
"In order to fund these priorities under the existing ceiling of Heading 4 of the financial perspectives, however, the Council has applied a small, proportionate reduction to the amounts proposed by the Commission for the principal budget lines; the appropriations for international fisheries agreements have been given proportionate consideration."
"As such, the amounts have been reduced to the level of the financial resources for the current year, with a small margin in Heading 4 for unforeseen circumstances."
"I hope and expect that, at the second reading of the Budget for 2005, we can reach agreement as provided for in the Interinstitutional Agreement, with regard to the final budget for the CFSP and international fisheries agreements."
"As for the presidency’s efforts in the area of information on foreign policy, I should like to report what has been agreed with Parliament."
"As you know, on 21 September, the next meeting will take place within the framework of the special agreement we reached in this respect with your House under the Italian Presidency."
"We will try to inform you in good time of the developments during that meeting."
"I would also refer to the speech which Mr Bot, the Foreign Affairs Minister, recently delivered to your Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"The situation with regard to Heading 5, administrative expenditure, is rather complicated."
"The institutions’ collective estimates have led to the ceiling being exceeded."
"I would, however, remind you that our institutions had already decided beforehand against the deployment of the flexibility instrument for administrative expenditure for 2005."
"A controlled development of administrative expenditure goes hand in hand with healthy financial management."
"I am convinced that you as Members of this House, the other wing of the budgetary authority, share the Council’s view of healthy financial management."
"The Council has therefore decided that a margin of around EUR 50 million will be sufficient, taking into consideration the cutbacks that have been made further to the development of information technologies and interinstitutional cooperation, as well as specific recruitment programmes for personnel."
"Finally, I come to Heading 7, the pre-accession strategy, for which the Council has adopted the commitment appropriations proposed by the Commission."
"Given the expected implementation level of these measures, however, the Council has slightly reduced the payment appropriations as proposed by the Commission, and has brought them into line with real needs."
"Madam President, I should like to thank your Parliament for its attention thus far, and to wish you every success with the debates on this draft Budget."
"I hope and trust that we will be able to present, on time, a balanced Budget for 2005."
"I hope that this can be done on the basis of the proposals as they are now before us."
"I assume that they are a sound basis."
"I know we do not see eye to eye on every issue, and that is why we are looking forward to the debate."
"I am convinced that, as in the past, we will reach a mutually agreeable resolution in the end."
". Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Lewandowski, Mr Garriga, ladies and gentlemen, budgets always involve a tight and busy work schedule, and it is therefore entirely typical that an important budget debate should take place at the first normal plenary session of the new Parliament."
"It is the debate on the budget for 2005, or what will be the enlarged Union’s first full budget year, and above all the first budget to be debated and adopted by 25 Member States, and adopted by MEPs from 25 Member States."
"The priorities for this budget are clear to the Commission."
"Firstly, the integration of the new Member States must be promoted."
"Secondly, the forces of growth within the Community and cohesion in the enlarged Union must be strengthened."
"We should live up to our heightened responsibility in the world, and unfortunately we have no choice but to place the fight against terrorism at the very top of the agenda."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have presented the key elements of the Council’s draft budget and the outcome of the Council’s first reading."
"I would like to go over the key figures of the Commission’s preliminary draft budget once again."
"We had proposed a budget volume for 2005 of EUR 109.5 billion, which would correspond to 1.03% of the gross national product of the enlarged Union."
"Agenda 2000, which is the current Financial Perspective, provides for a much higher figure for the 2005 budget year, namely 1.08% of combined economic output. If you also take into account the fact that the European Development Fund is currently outside the budget and must be funded in addition, an actual figure of 1.11% is reached for financial programming for 2005."
"I mention this now because a decision must be taken on whether the Commission’s proposals for the next period are really such a dramatic increase."
"The figure of 1.11% in financial programming should therefore be compared with our proposal of 1.14% for 2007 and following years."
"Today we are not talking about financial programming for the immediate future, but about the 2005 Budget, which is the first to include direct aid to farmers in the new Member States."
"This is a result of the time lag which exists in the field of agriculture, whereby expenditure takes place one year later."
"This is therefore the first time that direct aid to farmers in the new Member States is contained in the Budget."
"There is a very sharp rise in overall expenditure on agriculture for 2005, of a total of EUR 4 - 4.5 billion according to the Commission’s preliminary draft budget, and EUR 3.5 billion even according to the Council’s draft budget."
"This is mainly due to enlargement, but I must point out that EUR 240 million of the increase is entirely attributable to changes in the euro/dollar exchange rate. Most importantly, the effect of the decisions made by the Council of Agriculture Ministers on agricultural reform will not be to reduce expenditure on agriculture next year, but to increase it."
"We must therefore also take the Council’s decisions into account, and of course I am emphasising this in the context of the comments that are often made to the effect that it is only the Commission and Parliament that propose increases in this area."
"We are often forced to incorporate the Council’s decisions into the Budget."
"The Council is now proposing a EUR 1 billion reduction in spending on agriculture, although it remains to be seen whether this can be put into practice."
"As always, we will present updated estimates for agricultural expenditure in October, and it is then usually agreed that the new estimates should be used."
"I must now go into a little more detail with regard to the Structural Funds."
"The Commission has proposed a considerable increase in payment appropriations for 2005, as well as an increase in commitment appropriations."
"The Council has not made any cuts to commitment appropriations, and indeed it cannot do so, as everything in this area has been laid down, on the one hand by Agenda 2000 and on the other by the accession treaties."
"No changes can therefore be made to commitment appropriations."
"With regard to the issue of how many payment appropriations we will need next year, the Council believes that we can make do with EUR 3 billion less than the figure proposed by the Commission."
"I must however point out that in 2005 we will be in the sixth year of the new programme, and we need more payment appropriations because the implementation of Structural Funds programmes is finally in full swing."
"Over the past few years there have indeed been repeated instances where Member States themselves have overestimated their capacities to use structural funds."
"This year, however, it appears that they have underestimated their own capacities, and at any rate we currently have a significantly higher implementation rate for structural funds than last year."
"By late August we had already spent 67% of funds, whereas last year the figure was only 44%, and this has meant that my fellow-Commissioner Mr Barrot has already asked for additional funds."
"Over the coming weeks we will examine whether reallocations are possible within the Budget, but at least one thing is clear, and I must make this perfectly plain to the Council: either we need additional funding before the end of 2004, or we must make sure that sufficient funds are provided in 2005."
"It is simply out of the question for cuts to be made in this field."
"The n+2 rule, of which you are also aware, means that we must make sure that the Budget contains sufficient funds to cover requests for payment as they are made."
"In view of this development, I can only agree with Parliament’s rapporteur, Mr Garriga, who has also stated clearly in his report that we must use the figures of the preliminary draft budget."
"At this point I would like to comment very briefly on the debate that was recently opened on whether structural funds should be cut for new Member States which lower their company tax rates considerably."
"In response to this, I can only stress that this proposal is unacceptable, and really quite unjustified."
"Firstly, with the exception of advance payments, no structural funds have been received by the new Member States."
"Secondly, each new Member State will have to contribute cofinancing in order to claim any structural funds at all."
"In principle, this means that the need for national public funds has increased rather than been reduced."
"This is something that we must also take into account."
"Thirdly, it is in any case impossible to simply compare tax rates without taking into account the width of the tax base used in calculations. Many reforms in the new Member States have in fact been aimed at removing exemptions from the tax base, or rather at closing tax loopholes."
"All these issues must be taken into consideration."
"Fourthly, the new Member States need help to enable them to bridge the large economic gap."
"We should not start to question the spirit of solidarity, which has always been a cornerstone of the European Union and must continue to be one, only a few months after enlargement, which was such a wonderful historical event."
"Turning to internal policies, I would particularly like to emphasise a point which is always important for Parliament with regard to the pilot projects and preparatory actions."
"I can assure Parliament that we are in the process of improving dialogue between the Commission and Parliament on this issue, and we will shortly provide you with an update on their implementation."
"As far as foreign policy is concerned, the available budget is currently undergoing a reduction in real terms as a result of the provisions of Agenda 2000."
"Not only, though, is there the political will to jointly take on more responsibility in the world, but we are also, in fact, constantly faced with new challenges."
"In the past few years we have always, in our budgets, managed to find the right responses to challenges, and I am optimistic and confident that we will also succeed in doing so in 2005."
"In the past few years we have had to make use of the flexibility instrument on several occasions, and I believe that this will continue to be the case in 2005."
"Since the Commission submitted the preliminary draft budget, the Council, and in particular the European Council, has taken further political decisions with implications for the Budget."
"These include, firstly, the political decision to open accession negotiations with Croatia, which will affect the Budget, and, secondly, the quite justified political decision to provide financial assistance to the Turkish Cypriot community."
"That, too, of course, will affect the Budget."
"According to the Commission proposal, both decisions will have implications for heading 7, pre-accession aid, but also for heading 4, where more funds will also need to be released."
"We will, in the next few weeks, submit letters of amendment on the 2005 preliminary draft budget to Parliament and the Council regarding this issue, and I hope that this will enable us to reach a positive decision both on heading 7 and on heading 4, external policy expenditure."
"I am also optimistic with regard to administrative expenditure."
"This still has to be negotiated, but in recent years it has been possible to achieve compromise, and this will also be the case for next year."
"I agree with you entirely, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that use of the flexibility instrument for administrative expenditure should be out of the question."
"We must therefore make every effort to find the necessary funds."
"I was of course pleased on behalf of the Commission at the Council’s proposal to allow the Commission 680 extra posts next year for enlargement."
"Yet at the same time you have not granted the funds necessary to pay the new staff, which means that we would be forced to introduce a new European Volunteer Service in the Commission."
"I am not sure the trade unions and others would agree to this, and we must therefore continue to strive towards the provision of appropriate funding."
"To return to the key figures: the Council is proposing a budget of EUR 116 billion for commitment appropriations and of EUR 105 billion for payment appropriations, which means a discrepancy of EUR 11 billion."
"I refer to this again because a number of Members have said in the debate on the next Financial Perspective that the Commission was allowing for too large a discrepancy, whereas the one we have proposed is in fact smaller than that in the Council’s preliminary draft budget."
"Further debate will be necessary on this issue."
"I also hope that the President-in-Office of the Council will not conduct the 2005 budget debate along ideological lines with regard to the 1.0% issue."
"The Dutch are well known, and rightly so, for acting in a very pragmatic and realistic manner, and I hope we will draw up a Budget which makes the necessary funding available for Community policies."
"Parliament’s first reading will take place in late October, and I am glad that the debate on the reading will be one of my last official duties."
"In the meantime, we will of course devote a great deal of energy to achieving another firm basis for a good compromise on the 2005 budget."
". Madam President, in my first speech in plenary as Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, I would like to draw attention to the fact that as well as the new faces among us, there will be another new aspect to the 2005 budget, to which Mrs Schreyer has already referred."
"Not only is this the first full annual budget for an EU of 25 Member States and a new European Commission, as well as for basic European institutions whose composition has been changed or adjusted as a result of enlargement, from the Court of Justice to the Ombudsman, it is also the first year of implementation of the new Staff Regulations."
"Despite this, our work will continue to be characterised by continuity, on the basis of the formal and informal rules of negotiation introduced by our predecessors."
"This is therefore the right time and place to pay tribute to our predecessors’ achievements, as the last parliamentary term was extremely productive."
"Parliament established its position as an equal arm of the EU’s budgetary power and as an equal participant in the EU’s budgetary procedure, and the credit for this should go to our predecessors, in particular to Terence Wynn, Chairman of the Committee on Budgets."
"At the same time as continuing our work on the 2005 budget this year, we must heed the message from the European elections."
"Many voters gave us a clear message by not voting in these elections."
"There is an increasing need for an easy—to-understand added value obtained with taxpayers’ money, as well as for transparency and rationality in budget expenditure and for an appropriate channelling of funds to tasks which will bring visible benefits both to local communities and to the environment."
"I say this in the context of one of the votes that took place earlier today, on an amendment transferring the 2003 budgetary surplus of around EUR 5.5 billion into the 2004 budget."
"In real terms, however, and taking into account the previous amendments to the budget, the surplus amounted to over EUR 10 billion, which is equivalent to one tenth of the EU’s 2003 budget."
"This also means that financial programming, in the sense of well-defined financial resources for legislative tasks and initiatives, remains an important task for the coming years of this parliamentary term."
"It should come as no surprise that as someone from behind the former Iron Curtain I will be sensitive to the budgetary situation of the new Member States, and of course these Member States can already speak up for themselves."
"The aspirations of around 80 million people should not be limited and reduced to monetary transfers."
"I am however aware of the thoroughness with which Council and Commission proposals are examined in Warsaw, Prague, Tallinn and other cities, for example the proposal to make savings of around 3 billion zloty under the Structural Funds, or to reduce the funding for agricultural subsidies."
"These proposals are being examined in the context of the provisions of the accession treaties."
"In this connection, I note with satisfaction that among the various savings there was no change to the funding allocated for enlargement of the EU to include Bulgaria and Romania."
"In budgetary terms this confirms the political will to see accession in 2007."
"Parliament’s view on the 2005 budget will emerge from the amendments currently being tabled, although of course it will not merely be the sum of these amendments."
"The deadline for the committees is tomorrow and that for the political groups is next week, in order to prepare for a first reading on 28 October of this year."
"If one aspect were to be highlighted as characterising this debate, both in plenary and in the Committee on Budgets, it is a tone of aversion to the horizontal cuts carried out mechanically by the Council in various areas, above all in Headings 3, 4 and 5."
"This is due to concern over whether there will be sufficient funding for Parliament’s traditional priorities, as well as concern that the justifiable funding needs of the common foreign and security policy, for example, do not become an automatic problem, but a problem to be solved in the framework of all the financial commitments under Heading 4."
"In our opinion all these issues deserve a more individualised approach."
"Madam President, in view of the short initiation I have had into the EU’s budgetary matters, it is appropriate today for my comments to be restrained and economical, just like the EU’s budget."
"I would like to leave all remaining matters to the rapporteurs."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for Parliament, I would like to welcome the Council’s draft general Budget for 2005."
"Like any political agreement reached following long talks amongst the governments of the 25 Member States, the result of its first reading is worthy of praise and consideration, but in our view entirely insufficient."
"The Council has taken a strictly accounting approach at first reading."
"If Parliament were to accept – and it is not going to accept – this view on the part of the Council in its current form, it would be a triumph of national accounting over European policy, and I do not believe this would be good either for the Union or for its Member States."
"We European Members of Parliament are well aware of national budgetary difficulties resulting from insufficient economic growth, and we know that the Stability Pact imposes very clear rules with regard to controlling budgetary deficits."
"The figures are, however, clear: in recent years, national budgets have increased by 22% while over the same period the Community budget has increased by 9%."
"That is to say, the European Parliament is much more fertile ground for budgetary austerity and rigour than national parliaments themselves at times."
"The Members of the European Parliament – including myself – know that Community policies have great added value in terms of growth and employment, in relation to Structural Funds, research and external cooperation, for example."
"We fear that the Council’s approach at first reading is simply to create artificial margins in categories which do not correspond either to the real needs of the Union or commitments to third parties, not even with the political will expressed each year in the budgetary vote in December."
"In general, in order to issue a more reasoned opinion in relation to the European Parliament’s reaction to this draft from the Council, I would prefer to wait to receive the amendments approved in the competent committees and in the political groups."
"Nevertheless, I would like to make a few further points."
"Firstly, as general rapporteur, I believe that the reduction of the ceilings in the categories must determine the Union’s budget."
"The European Commission had already incorporated this reduction into its draft preliminary budget and in general terms – though not in every respect – we agree with the Commission’s analysis."
"The margins created by the Commission in categories 3, 4 and 5 are politically much more realistic than the margins created by the Council, which is something of a paradox."
"Secondly, the situation of the agencies."
"It is time for the Council to accept an undeniable fact: the decentralised agencies need sufficient funds if they are to be implemented and to function properly."
"If the political decision is taken to create agencies, the political decision must be taken to maintain them."
"The Council’s position is inconsistent here, and I am prepared to propose innovative solutions for resolving once and for all this double political language between commitments and compliances."
"Thirdly, the issue of payment appropriations."
"In order to keep below the 1% of the Union’s gross national product – so dear to certain Member States – the Council has cut EUR 4 300 million."
"Commitments still to be paid as of 31 July stand at EUR 122 000 million."
"In relative terms, the categories with the most RALs are, in this order, 7, 4 and 2, the latter being the largest in terms of volume."
"Any responsible institution would want to put an end to this situation."
"The N+2 rule that the Commission mentioned was created to improve execution and to speed up the completion of projects."
"In order to absorb these RALs, payments should be increased rather than decreased, unless the aim is simply to make savings for national treasuries."
"From the 2000 budget EUR 44 500 million has been returned to the Member States in unexecuted appropriations – more than the whole of the Structural Funds budget for 2005 – and that return must not be seen as a saving for anybody."
"Returning appropriations to the Member States because they have not been able to spend them means squandering the added value of spending on Community policies which have been approved in order to contribute to growth and employment in the Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the first real budget with 25 Member States."
"The Union has more challenges to meet and more needs to cover than in previous years."
"Managing to do more with the money available than in other years is the responsibility of the three institutions and, naturally, my responsibility."
"I wish the dialogue between the three institutions every success and I would like to acknowledge the ability demonstrated so far by the Dutch Presidency."
"– Madam President, Mr Nicolaï, Commissioner, as has been said on a number of occasions, 2005 is the first budget year in which enlargement is fully reflected in the figures, and that also applies to the administrative expenditure."
"Moreover, it is a budgetary year in which reform of staffing and the reform of the financial management are making their mark on developments in all the EU institutions."
"Last but not least, it is a year in which there is a tight framework for administrative expenditure in accordance with the multiannual programming upon which the EU countries agreed in the financial perspectives, and you in fact said yourself, Mr Nicolaï, that expenditure area 5 is complicated."
"The provisional draft budget showed that there was no margin at all remaining. The framework had, in fact, been overstepped and, in its handling of the matter, the Council has implemented cutbacks that provide a margin."
"The savings have hit what we call the other institutions particularly hard, and that is something at which we want to look in detail in Parliament."
"Parliament’s budget has not been touched by the Council because of what is termed the gentleman’s agreement."
"We each look after our own budget."
"The Council cut back a little on its own budget."
"I think it is transparently obvious, however, that the Council’s administrative budget has increased at a rate of almost 5% in relation to the budget for 2004, in which the overall increase for all the institutions is one of 3%."
"If, now, the Council thinks that savings should be made and a margin exist – and that is something with which I, in a way, agree – it would have been a nice touch if the Council had taken the lead and kept more back from its own budget."
"Let us set that aside for the moment, however."
"The Council has made an overall cut of 1.5% to take account of the fact that we must be able to save because new technology has been introduced and because the institutions cooperate."
"I can, moreover, only agree that some money can be saved through cooperation between the institutions on the personnel side and in connection with the languages."
"It may at times, however, be easier for the large institutions than for the small ones to make savings."
"I think that is something we must look at, and we must, of course, also check carefully that interinstitutional cooperation pays dividends."
"I wish to commend the Council for having this time been a little less rigid than it often appears and for having argued more strongly for the cut-backs that have been made."
"The Council has thus accepted the desired positions on enlargement and on new tasks but has, in return, cut back the amounts by 5%, as Mrs Schreyer pointed out."
"I do not know whether it is because people are supposed to work for free."
"I now also think that it is to take account of the fact that a number of the appointments are not progressing as quickly as expected."
"Regarding Parliament’s budget for 2005, I can point out that it is also influenced by enlargement and by the reforms of staffing policy and of financial management, and we should also have liked to have seen a number of improvements to MEPs’ conditions."
"Parliament plans to conduct an information campaign concerning the draft Constitution, and account has been taken of this in the budget."
"We still do not know whether there will be a new Members’ Statute in 2005 but, on the basis of the signals we are getting, I think it right that we take account of it in the budget."
"In common with all the other institutions, Parliament must ensure as cheap and efficient administration as possible but, as has emerged in the first round, Parliament’s budget will constitute 20% of the administrative expenditure in 2005."
"I think that, regarding the administrative expenditure, the Council and Parliament ought together to find a solution that ensures both a suitable margin and sensible conditions for the Commission and the other institutions."
"Even a minor reduction in the rate of increase of the budget may be quite damaging to some of the small institutions, especially those that are at the development stage."
"I am thinking, for example, of the European Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Supervisor."
"As part of a solution to the problem in expenditure area 5, I think we should consider whether we might transfer unused funds in the administration budgets to 2005 and if we might make payments in advance, so introducing some room for manoeuvre into the administrative budgets in 2005 and thus creating a margin; or, in other words, that we engage in what, in budgeting jargon, is called the frontloading of unused funds."
"That is a factor I think we should consider including in the negotiations."
"There are major problems in expenditure area 5, but I do not think they are so great that the Council and Parliament should not together be able to find a reasonable solution."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I find myself today in a very curious position, as after five years I am forced to agree with the Commissioner on nearly all counts."
"I am pleased that at the end of your term of office we have reached this stage of cooperation, and I believe this also says something positive about our cooperation during the past five years."
"We will, however, have a suitable opportunity to pay tribute to this in October."
"Today I would particularly like to address the President-in-Office of the Council, as the draft Budget submitted by the Council raises a number of questions to which serious answers must be given by both arms of the budgetary authority, and not, as I would like to make perfectly clear, by Parliament alone."
"The problems demand a joint solution, and the Council cannot evade its responsibility."
"Matters relating to agricultural policy have been touched upon, and the agricultural reform we have drawn up will be implemented as of 1 January 2005."
"This gives rise to corresponding obligations, and we need to fulfil the terms of the Treaty concluded with the new Member States in Copenhagen."
"It is no longer possible to act as though agricultural policy were a piggy bank under the sole control of the Council."
"All legal obligations which have been entered into must be fulfilled."
"As you well know, responsibility for this is yours and yours alone, and I would ask you to shoulder it."
"The same is true for structural policy."
"It is of course a fine thing for us to be discussing a new Financial Perspective now, when requests are being sent in by all the Member States for all these things to be funded."
"With specific regard to budget implementation, however, which the Commissioner is right to say has now improved, cuts to payments, meaning a current reduction in real terms, are not a policy that we can support."
"You should therefore also shoulder your responsibility in this respect, and not merely look at the figures, but also at whether the policies are correct, which, in the field of structural policy, they are."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you said that you have supported all agreements relating to the multiannual programmes and made no cuts to any of them."
"We will examine this very carefully, as we have our doubts with regard to certain matters, and you can be sure that we will take a very close look at these issues."
"It is particularly necessary to give new impetus to the agreements relating to enlargement negotiated by our rapporteur, Mr Böge, and I believe that it is also in our own interests that funding be provided for programmes for which we have legislated, such as youth exchanges and education, without going into too many details."
"I would now like to turn to the subject of the agencies, and to ask whether you are shouldering your responsibility in this respect."
"It is my opinion that the Heads of State or Government played Santa Claus with each other and spread a large number of agencies throughout the continent, and now they must all be funded."
"I would ask you to take a moment to consider whether it is practical in the long term for all this to be done under heading 3."
"Wherever it is created, administration should be funded under the heading of administration."
"It is not sufficient for the Heads of State or Government to brag about the fantastic agencies they have obtained for their Member States; they must also ensure that appropriate funding is available so that we can do justice to this duty."
"I only wish to say a few words on the issue of information policy; here, too, we will have serious things to say to the Commission, as it has refused to make the outcome of the Convention known to the general public."
"We must cooperate a little more closely on this issue if we genuinely wish to overcome the deficiencies which became obvious during the European elections."
"As far as foreign policy is concerned, I am starting to wonder what is going on."
"Since 1999, or the 2000 budget, we have been faced with the problem that we cannot fund the commitments which the foreign ministers enter into in their never-ending donation frenzy."
"Once again – and I have lost count of the number of times it has done so already – the Commission is putting forward proposals relating to use of the flexibility instrument under heading 4, foreign policy."
"Your foreign minister policy is currently running on empty, and I would like to make it perfectly clear that this cannot be tolerated."
"We will be sure to keep an eye on this."
"I could also say something on the subject of Cyprus, but I will refrain from doing so, as I am running out of time and the President is already giving me a stern look."
"With regard to administrative expenditure, I will merely say that you cannot make cuts everywhere else and increase your own budget."
"That is unfair and shows a lack of solidarity, and we will not tolerate this either."
"I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur and to everyone else; much remains to be done, and we must save money, but we must save in the right places so that Europe remains visible."
"– Madam President, Mr Nicolaï, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have now reached the traditional debate on the Budget."
"Traditional it certainly is, and so, alas, are the Council’s proposals."
"Yet again, the Council has made very substantial cuts in the Commission’s preliminary draft Budget."
"Many times over, alas, we have had occasion to denounce such practices in your hearing, but today, at the outset of the debates on the financial perspectives, I think we have cause to be even more perturbed by this practice, for the Budget for the EU that the Council has put forward is an extremely restrictive one."
"In the preliminary draft Budget, we noted that there were significant increases in payments and commitments, which were necessary to the success of enlargement, and, now that we see these increases drastically curtailed, we know that the funding will not be there to enable the European Union to back up its promises."
"We find the restrictions proposed by the Council quite unacceptable, and, as previous speakers have said, that is the case under all the headings."
"Let me just dwell on a few points; to take one example, on the incoherence involved in reducing payments to the Structural Funds: as they have been used up, we need money in order to be able to do what we have promised."
"Turning to heading 3, that of internal affairs, everyone rehearsed the role of the agencies and the problems inherent in communicating with the public."
"I will also consider the role of micro-businesses and small and medium-sized enterprises in creating employment and will have something to say about the inconsistency of the Council’s approach to twinning."
"If we want to build the European Union, the citizens have to meet each other, yet, over the six years that I have been here to debate the Budget, we have seen twinning links cut back, which amounts to denying the citizens any involvement and to implying that twinning itself is not important."
"We will again have to amend the drafts, terrible though that is as a way of going about things, because we are the ones who will have to do it and we will all be wasting time introducing this sort of amendment at a time when we should be pooling our resources."
"I would also like to say something about the external actions."
"The Council’s draft Budget represents a tentative attempt at making economies in order to fund expenditure on Iraq, rather than on a truly ongoing vision of Europe’s external action."
"Less EUR 15 million for TACIS, less EUR 25 million for MEDA, less EUR 16 million for CARDS, less EUR 9 million for Latin America."
"Has poverty died out?"
"Are there no more problems?"
"Far from it, to be sure; what has changed is that the Commission is far better – and yes, it really is – at implementing its budgets."
"We, in fact, are keen that the Council should find other means of funding Iraq, and also that the EU should keep the promises it made to all the peoples concerned, as it does those it makes to its own citizens."
"Yet again, the Council has opted for an actuarial approach by seeking, as a matter of priority, to make savings on the revenue needed to balance the Budget."
"When preparing the preliminary draft budget, the Commission had asked for 1.03% of GNP and, as if by chance, the draft budget has 0.99%, less, you see, than the symbolic figure of 1% on which some rely in order to be able to cut back their national budget."
"It is perfectly clear what is going on: the figures have been adopted in an attempt to get a pseudo-draft accepted."
"Well, we, in this House, will go ahead and do the precise opposite."
"We want to start from the draft and from the promises made to the public, and, on that basis, produce a budget that is well funded and of use to all."
"It follows that we have to clarify what our plans for today’s Europe are, and set ourselves goals, rather than decide on an arbitrary figure."
"As we see it, Europe’s ambition must reflect that of the Heads of State at their summits."
"There is a marked contradiction between what is said by Europe’s advocates and what is said by the Council."
"From the point of view of the Budget, it is impossible to achieve the goals that the EU has set itself with such paltry funding."
"We want growth in Europe, solidarity in Europe; we want more competitiveness and more of the Lisbon spirit; we want to make Europe homogeneous and prosperous, to see it consolidating its social model and its potential for growth, for land redistribution, for investment in research, for development, for funding great political and development projects."
"We will see to it that Parliament will honour its promises and the undertakings that the Council has been unable to include in its draft Budgets."
"Madam President, as Mrs Guy-Quint stated a moment ago, there is always something predictable about debates such as today’s."
"The Commission decides on a preliminary draft budget, the Council compiles a draft budget and without knowing the figures, it can be taken as read that the Council will be making cutbacks in agricultural spending, and in all other budget categories, for that matter."
"A large proportion of agricultural spending is laid down by law."
"I have always taken the view that the Commission is better equipped to determine precise spending than the Council, and that is why I think it is a good tradition on the part of Parliament to take the Commission more seriously than the Council in this area."
"In any event, we need to wait and see what, exactly, the letter of amendment at the end of October will contain."
"We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe hope – and Parliament’s position on the 2005 Budget already partly reflects this – that two trial projects will be maintained."
"The first one concerns the possibility, in future, of reaching assurances against infectious animal diseases which can break out at some point in the future and will impact heavily on the agricultural budget."
"The second one must culminate in a system of quality assessment for European agricultural products."
"After all, it is difficult to justify farmers in Europe being increasingly obliged to compete with farmers elsewhere in the world, while farmers elsewhere in the world need not observe the same standards."
"A great deal can be said about the many budget categories."
"With regard to the structural funds, it is, in my view, of essential importance for the effect of the n+2 rule to be analysed very carefully and to be checked in relation to the estimates."
"If it transpires at this point that there are still large surpluses, it can be checked whether or not it is possible to make cutbacks."
"Without observing the order of the chapters of the budget, I should also like to say something about Category 5."
"In my view, by apportioning the highest rise to the Council itself, the Council has indeed been a little too generous where its own interests are concerned."
"It is, however, a good tradition for the Council and Parliament not to criticise each other’s budgets and to leave them intact."
"I do think, though, that for a few years now, a new element has crept into the Council’s budget, namely spending for the common foreign and security policy."
"I wonder whether that is actually an administrative item of expenditure on the part of the Council."
"I do not think so."
"In my view, it is clearly a political activity which should be assessed as such, and Parliament should have more say in this, rather than merely receiving information, as it does at present."
"One final point: Parliament has initiated many trial projects on which the Commission should have reported at the beginning of September."
"That has not yet happened."
"Commissioner Schreyer could perhaps state the exact date when the list with the results of the trial projects and the preparatory actions will be produced."
"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I hope you will allow me to spend a few seconds enjoying what is a special occasion for me."
"This will be the first time that these proceedings have been held in my mother tongue, Czech."
"Now let us move on to the next speaker."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Nicolaï, you have noticed that as far as your restrictive draft budget is concerned, you are dealing with a European Parliament which has a great deal of self-confidence."
"As we have heard, there is a consensus across all groups that we cannot accept the Council’s draft budget in its present form, and I would like to start by echoing Mr Lewandowski and the Budget Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, in saying that we must give pride of place to the concept of solidarity and the spirit of solidarity in Europe."
"As we have heard, the 2005 Budget is the first for 25 Member States, and budgetary allocations must therefore do justice to the new historical context, in which the division of our continent is finally being overcome."
"In our opinion the draft Budget as it stands does not measure up to this great European challenge, and I would like to go on to give a number of examples to make this clear."
"The results of the European elections showed us that together we face a serious acceptance problem, and that we do not really get across to the public."
"It is therefore a mistake to make savings on information policy; on the contrary, this is an area in which we must be able to be pro-active in addressing our electorate."
"The same is true for the cuts you have proposed for the European agencies, including those for food safety, environmental protection and maritime safety."
"Who exactly should pursue truly ecological policies in Europe, if not us?"
"We therefore also consider these proposals for cuts to be inappropriate."
"I would also like to comment on the budget for culture."
"I very recently became the second Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Culture and Education, and after finding out that the entire budget for culture amounts to 1%, the equivalent of that for tobacco subsidies, I cannot believe that this does justice to our continent, which aspires, after all, to be the continent of culture and the arts."
"Exactly the same is true with regard to the opportunities available to us to further reduce the traditional role of farming subsidies."
"If we really want to make a success of the Lisbon strategy, or in other words the economic reconstruction and renewal of Europe, we must increase our margins for manoeuvre."
"Investments in youth and intelligence are the real resources of the future, and we must work on these tasks together."
"I would therefore also like to make it clear that, in our opinion, the letter from the six Heads of Government who wish to fix the budget at 1% in the Financial Perspective is a mistake."
"This would not allow us to meet new challenges."
"Corrections must be made, and we will also push for this in our Member States."
"Mr President, today the European Parliament, in accordance with established practice, has approved the supplementary budget, which is refunding EUR 5.5 billion of the EU contributions paid in 2003 to the Member States."
"This amount has been available to the Commission; it has not spent it in the manner intended for the budgetary authorities."
"The Commission did not come up to expectations in 2003."
"The Commission did not come up to expectations in the years prior to that."
"The Commission will not come up to expectations next year either."
"We know that not all of the budget funds will be spent next year either and that next autumn the contributions paid into the EU’s coffers will once again be refunded to the Member States."
"Who is to blame when the budget, which has been approved by the Council and the European Parliament, is not fully implemented?"
"Not just the Commission, but also the Member States are to blame for the outstanding commitments that have resulted from underutilisation of the Structural Funds."
"Not all Member States draft their programmes in the proper way or in accordance with the proper timetable."
"With regard to the other sections of the budget, the accusing finger must be pointed at the Commission in the first instance."
"The Commission neither wishes, for political reasons, nor is able, due to organisational shortcomings, to fully implement the budget."
"Consequently, the preparation of the Union’s budget for next year will in many respects be a form of shadow boxing involving three parties."
"The Commission will put on a show of proposing appropriations, which it neither wishes, nor will be able, to spend."
"The Council will pretend to be satisfied with the savings made, if they are not connected with its priorities."
"The European Parliament will make a show of struggling against the maximum amounts, or ceilings, for each section recorded in the financial framework."
"Everyone, however, will know that there is more money actually available than is needed and that it will once again be refunded to the Member States at a later date."
"Our group takes a critical view of the cuts that are being made in other appropriations under the section headed external action in favour of the Council’s priority, the reconstruction of Iraq."
"This means that the other priorities that Parliament considers important will not be addressed."
"Iraq is the new pretext for failing to fully implement next year’s budget, to be approved in Parliament."
"As a result, we are fulfilling certain countries’ objective of implementing a ceiling of 1% of GNP in the budget."
"This budget is a step in that direction."
"I am a new MEP, representing the June List – the new party in Sweden that polled 15% of the votes in the last European Parliament elections."
"I wish, in this House today, to take the opportunity to state what we consider should be the main trends forming the basis of EU strategy on financial policy."
"The overarching principle should first of all be that the EU’s total budget expenditure should not exceed one per cent of the EU countries’ combined GDP."
"We thus support the position adopted by the governments of a number of countries, including Sweden’s."
"The ceiling on expenditure should apply not only to the forthcoming budget year, 2005, but also apply in the long term."
"With a credible, restrictive ceiling on expenditure, it will be possible to counter the views of critics who fear that the EU is developing into an all too dominant superstate."
"We do not believe that the EU should commit itself to far-reaching transfers between countries and regions."
"Experience shows that such transfer systems have a bad effect on long-term growth."
"My second point concerns the fact that a number of countries now pay significantly more than what they get back in the form of subsidies."
"The net contribution should not, therefore, exceed roughly 0.4% of a country’s GDP."
"Each country should thus be able to refrain from receiving subsidies and so be able to reduce its total gross contribution to the EU."
"Such a system would make things significantly easier from an administrative point of view."
"The work involved in applying for subsidies at present uses up a lot of resources that could be used more productively."
"The third point is that we reject the idea that the EU should procure its own resources by imposing taxes or duties upon us."
"It is only for national parliaments to deduct taxes and duties."
"Nor, with a strict ceiling on expenditure, would the EU’s own resources afford scope for increased expenditure."
"The fourth point is that all the Member States should pay the same gross charge as a percentage of GDP."
"The special exemptions that exist must be removed."
"My last point is that the EU must have a budgeting margin within the framework of the ceiling on expenditure so that the EU can act quickly in crisis situations."
"Finally, I wish to emphasise that the EU must not promise subsidies for which there is no scope in terms of the ceiling on expenditure."
"Discussions of EU enlargement must be based upon realistic analyses of the economic consequences of enlargement."
"New commitments, programmes and promises of subsidies may only be honoured within the framework of the reallocation of old appropriations."
"A review of agricultural aid may, in the longer term, create scope for aid to countries with the weakest economies."
"We shall vote on the forthcoming draft budget in accordance with these intentions."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, most of the members of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group are concerned at the proposals to permanently cut payments to the EU in relation to the Member States’ gross national products."
"Although this complies with the Financial Perspective for 2000-2006, it is not in line with the EU’s general philosophy."
"It means the enlarging European Union is limiting the extent to which its funds can be redistributed, in relative terms."
"In so doing, it is limiting its opportunities for development, assuming funds are still used with the same efficiency."
"Yet at the same time, by making reference to the Lisbon Strategy, for example, the EU continues to aspire to a growing role in the global economic race."
"In our opinion this is not a coherent policy, as it effectively consists of stepping on the accelerator and the brake at the same time."
"In view of our Danish colleague’s reservations, the entire UEN Group rejects the Council’s proposed payment cuts, and calls for an increase, not a decrease, in payments as a percentage of GDP in the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013."
"The reduction in payments proposed by the Council under Heading 2 is greater than that under Heading 1."
"In general this demonstrates the Council’s pessimism, or even distrust, concerning the Member States’ ability to make use of funds, especially the new Member States."
"This also means a change in terms of ratios, to the disadvantage of development funds."
"The reductions in payments proposed by the Council under Headings 1 and 2 are of a plainly mechanical nature, and the fact that they are all round figures is worthy of attention."
"In this connection, the UEN Group supports the inclusion of the figures proposed by the Commission."
"Turning to a third and more minor point, with regard to the growing importance of the EU’s neighbours, and with this morning’s debate on Belarus very much in mind, the UEN Group is opposed to limiting expenditure on the TACIS and MEDA programmes, while at the same time insisting that the way in which these funds are spent must be monitored closely."
"In order to promote both the values upon which the EU is based and our own safety, we should support trends conducive to building the rule of law in neighbouring countries."
"Little will be achieved by cutting funding for these aims."
"Mr President, esteemed Parliament, in its 15-member form, the European Union had already begun to benefit from its relationship with the new Member States."
"Whereas the advanced countries of the European Union had a deficit of USD 10 billion in foreign trade with the eastern European countries in 1990, there is now a surplus of about USD 40 billion."
"The European Fifteen have now not only invaded the markets to a considerable extent but also taken over companies in the less advanced countries, thus producing not inconsiderable amounts of revenue."
"The new Member States of the European Union therefore now justifiably expect a welcoming hand and not the construction of barriers to the movement of labour, nor administrative barriers to the provision of post-accession aid and certainly not a reduction in budgetary resources in the field of structural operations and equalisation of regional disparities."
"– Mr President, I join in your celebratory mood."
"It is the first time that you lead in Czech and I, for the first time in this House, can speak in Hungarian, my mother tongue."
"It was not easy to create the opportunity for this but it is also not easy to create the harmony between the requirements and the possibilities in the budget."
"I see that this harmony can be better realised in the budget previously submitted by the Commission than in the one submitted to us by the Council."
"It is particularly important in two areas that Parliament should accept the opinion of the European Commission."
"One is the issue of the agricultural support where, according to Council, next year’s available sums would be decreased by EUR 1 billion."
"This reduction also applies to sums they committed themselves to previously."
"The other problem has already been mentioned by several speakers: it is the issue of the EUR 3 billion reduction in the annual payment of the structural funds in 2005."
"The initial proposal of the European Commission was well-founded."
"It took into consideration the framework of the previous financial plan and also the fact that the absorption capacity of the Member States is continuously growing."
"It is therefore justified that Parliament should stand by the Commission’s proposal the Council."
"We should, however, make our repayments from the EUR 3 billion in such a way that each Member State receives a share of the surplus."
"It is reasonable that the new Member States should not receive empty words only from solidarity, nor be restricted in their movement to the narrow confines of the Copenhagen framework."
"This proposal is based on the same principles upon which this House based last year’s 12% payment increase for the year 2004 for the ten new Member States."
"Let us show solidarity with those Member States who have a harder task of joining up than others."
"– Mr President, the European Union’s draft budget for 2005 is the first one applying to a Union of 25 Member States for a complete year."
"We might say that the enlarged EU is starting to work to an established routine."
"The budget is also the first of this Parliament and the newly appointed Commission, and so it reflects the essence of an entirely new EU."
"The total payment appropriations in the budget come to EUR 105 billion; that is, 0.99% of GNP, or approximately EUR 9 billion below the financial perspective ceiling."
"The proposal is therefore very stringent."
"This has been achieved by cutting agricultural expenditure by EUR 1 billion and structural financing by EUR 3 billion, which should be regarded as questionable."
"The budget has now once again been drafted on an activity-based structure, increasing its transparency."
"At the same time, it clarifies personal accountability for administration and facilitates comparison of the efficiency of different administrative branches."
"This is a first-rate, liberalising improvement and it shows that the EU too is capable of major reforms."
"Outstanding commitments remain the biggest problem with the EU budget."
"These will rise to EUR 112 billion by the end of this year."
"Most of it has to do with the Structural Funds."
"For example, last year EUR 8 134 000 000 in budgeted payment appropriations in the Structural Funds went unused."
"The result of this will be that, over the coming years, an ever larger proportion of the Structural Funds will be used to meet old commitments."
"Finally, I would like to say that this draft budget drawn up by the Council will require some substantial revision by Parliament."
"Mr President, sixty seconds does not allow me time to go through the budget item by item, so I will concentrate on the total, of which the Council is so proud: 0.99% of GNP."
"Has there ever been a great human endeavour that took such a wretched figure as its basis?"
"To what ambition do these long speeches testify, when there are reductions here, cutbacks there, and restrictions somewhere else?"
"Like everyone else in this House, I am of course in favour of budgetary rigour, but that rigour is already subject to the ceilings imposed by the financial perspectives and we are falling short of the current ceilings by some EUR 5 billion."
"Five billion!"
"Can the Council even begin to imagine what that means?"
"Social needs are beginning to make themselves felt."
"Could we not alleviate the effects of rapid enlargement on environmental standards?"
"Could a start not be made on transposing the dozens and dozens of directives?"
"Where democracy is concerned – and I am the rapporteur for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs – the Prince programme has been cut into three."
"There is more."
"As previous rapporteurs have said, the Council has evidently not heard of such terms as ‘added value’, ‘economy of scale’ or ‘financial synergy’."
"The Constitution is supposed to be the motor of the EU, but I think it needs some fuel before we tackle this Budget."
"If the budget is, without doubt, an accounting exercise, it is equally certain that it is also a political one."
"I do not get the impression that the Council has grasped that."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the budget for 2005 expresses the authoritarian, anti-grass roots policy of the European Union, the objective of which is to safeguard and increase the profits of big business."
"It strengthens the reactionary character and militarisation of the European Union."
"This is being achieved by further drastic cutbacks in social benefits and by transferring appropriations in order to strengthen the military arm of the European Union."
"It is anti-grass roots, because it is predicated on promoting the Lisbon strategy and stepping up the attack on workers' employment and social rights."
"Money is being taken from small and medium-sized farmers, with the result that they are being exterminated and entire areas are being abandoned and deserted."
"It does not take account of the needs generated by enlargement in ten countries and it calls on workers, women, young people, small- and medium-sized farmers, trades and handicrafts, the working classes in the less developed areas in all twenty-five Member States, to foot the bill for the creation of an attractive business environment for big business."
"The package of social appropriations which many are promising is proving to be a myth for the workers."
"The social budget is dynamic, but it supports the financially strongest, big business, and the means and mechanisms for repressing the fight of the financial weak, the grass-roots, working classes."
"Unfortunately, however many amendments are made, they will not change the reactionary character of the budget, which is why we shall be voting against it."
"Mr President, we all know that one of the clearest challenges facing the European Union at this time is the implementation of further measures to improve the operation of the European economy."
"The budget and restrictions that have been proposed – by the Council in particular – are not going in that direction."
"This is a setback in my view."
"If we are to fulfil our objectives, especially at this time when we want to work as an enlarged Europe, a restrictive budget would set that objective back."
"I am surprised that the Council has come up with those proposals."
"I agree with my colleague, Mr Roszkowski, that any reduction in that order would send a signal that we are not in earnest about the goal we have set ourselves in an enlarged and cohesive Europe of solidarity."
"I hope that there will be changes and amendments to those proposals."
"I, like other speakers, would like to see more imagination and optimism for the budgetary proposals that are being put forward."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the European Budget stands at EUR 105 billion, which is less than the EUR 117 billion of Spain’s, less than half Germany’s, and one-twentieth of the USA’s."
"How, then, are you going to manage after Turkey’s accession, and what are you going to do about funding for the countries of the East?"
"There are two solutions available to you: the first is to dismantle the CAP after 2013 in order to recover the best part of 44% of agricultural funds, a development that has been in the pipeline ever since the CAP was refashioned."
"The second, given that it is inevitable that the budget will double, is to create a European tax to fund it."
"It will be the European Constitution that will make these two solutions possible."
"With codecision, we will be able to calmly do away with the CAP, and, in due course, with our small farmers."
"In any case, simple majority means we could end up with a European budget of double the size and the imposition of a European business tax, or even a European income tax."
"As I expect to have to pay it, I would like to savour these last moments of not being pestered by the taxman."
"Mr President, Dr Brüner, the Director General of OLAF, which is responsible for investigating European Union fraud and corruption, told the Committee on Budgetary Control at its last meeting that it was not his job to snoop."
"His annual report said not a word about the EU's own accounting system, which has been shown to be structurally fraudulent and lacks financial cohesion."
"It can never comply with even the minimum standards required by the EU itself of companies all over Europe."
"Dr Brüner failed to address any of the critically important issues of institutionalised malpractice identified in this organisation by experienced accountants."
"Basic financial records are not being kept; double-entry bookkeeping is still not the norm; cash and bank balances are still not being reconciled, nor are budgets and expenses; advances are recorded as expenditure, which is fraudulent; loans which disappear are written off, which is both a loss of public funds and tax fraud; and records of assets and liabilities in past years are changed retrospectively, which is also fraudulent."
"I put it to Dr Brüner at that meeting: 'If you are not investigating this disgraceful situation, then who is?' and I got no answer."
"I now put that question to this Parliament and to the Commission: who is responsible for what is being done to end the European Union's structural and institutional fraud and corruption?"
"Mr President, may I start by extending warm congratulations to you, Mr Ouzký, on your first appearance here as Vice-President of the European Parliament."
"I am very indebted to you and your Members for the many interesting remarks as well as remarks concerning content that have been made."
"I have also heard many critical and anxious comments from you."
"I think that that is the start of an interesting debate which we will be continuing later on in the year."
"I should like to give a first reaction to a number of important remarks, although I will have to keep it brief."
"I think that Mr Lewandowski may well have started off with one of the most fundamental remarks when he made reference to what the citizens of Europe expect from us and from this budget – just look at the latest European parliamentary elections – and he mentioned the, to my mind, central concept of ‘added value’."
"This is the very thing which the Council is trying to achieve: by means of this budget, to give substance to the added value which Europe can have, the added value compared to what is happening elsewhere, to what is happening nationally, in the best possible way."
"Nevertheless, judging from his comments, he and the Council do not agree on every score on the question as to how this added value should be viewed."
"I do not think that added value is primary for European citizens, or that the highest possible level of funding is brought into Europe and subsequently returned to those citizens for good causes."
"I think that the greatest concern, though, where the added value of citizens in Europe is concerned, is the fact that this is being handled at European level, rather than it being organised at a lower level nationally or otherwise."
"That is in any event a guideline for us, the Council, with regard to this budget, and it also says something about what is not on the agenda now but has been mentioned by a few of your Members, namely the new financial perspectives."
"I do not agree with Mr Lewandowski when he suggests that we, in our proposals – the Council’s draft proposal compared to the Commission’s proposals – would have mainly used the ‘cheese slicer method’, as we put it in the Netherlands, that we would have made use of generic cutbacks across the line."
"I think that, chiefly, we have made choices in this budget, in respect of which you can beg to differ, but they are at least choices, and they have by no means been easy choices for the Council."
"Mr Garriga made an interesting observation with his comparison between the increase of national budgets over a number of years and the increase of the European budget."
"His position was that, in that light, the European budget increases had been far lower than the national budget ones over a number of years."
"If you look into this in more detail, I agree that this can also lead to a different insight."
"Indeed, the last few years, particularly since the economic recession from 2000 onwards, give a totally different picture of the national budget."
"Suffice to mention the discussion about the Stability Pact for you to know what I mean."
"Secondly, in response to the – in itself very interesting – comparison that Mr Garriga made, I should like to say that the national governments naturally have responsibilities which the European Union does not have and which are linked to increases, such as social security, health care and education."
"That is a completely different budget from the European budget where agricultural spending still accounts for nearly half of the budget and structural policy spending for nearly 30%."
"I should like to vehemently deny the general criticism levelled by a number of your Members, to the effect that the Council had acted as an accountant."
"I would, in fact, claim the opposite, because we have definitely not acted as accountants, but as politicians, as politically responsible, by making choices that were, as I said before, not easy to make."
"I can obviously only applaud the fact that we in the Council act counter to your views and, as Mrs Trüpel stated, are dealing with a very independent Parliament."
"Nevertheless, I cannot resist saying that in my view, politics is not only about formulating priorities, but also always about having the nerve to formulate posteriorities, and we as politicians know that, in general, that is more difficult than anything else, but it is, in my view, necessary in order to be able to reach financial prioritisation."
"In that sense, I hope that some of your Members have not suggested any kind of opposition here where the responsibility is concerned which we, as legs of the budgetary authority, you as Parliament and we as Council, feel for all citizens of Europe, whereby we as Council give due consideration to the economic situation of a recession, the fact that choices must definitely be made and the fact that we largely view this added value, as stated in a reaction to Mr Lewandowski’s speech, as part of the added value of European efforts compared to national efforts."
"Which brings me to an example that Mrs Trüpel quoted, namely that the enormous importance of culture and of cultural policy does not mean that this should be dealt with at European level."
"It is not the case, in my view, that the more important an area is, the more European it should be."
"What is still at issue is at what level added value can be provided most effectively."
"I should like to flag a few essential points mentioned by speakers on your side."
"Let me start with the remark made by Commissioner Schreyer, and indeed a number of your Members have mentioned this point, namely structural funds, and the communication which Commissioner Schreyer made, that the level of depletion is positively higher than could previously be assumed."
"In fact, she also mentioned the discussion about company tax and her objection to a link being made between that discussion and the structural policy discussion."
"Let me state emphatically that, firstly, we are obviously awaiting the further Commission proposal on this subject and secondly, this Council and this presidency abide by their guiding principle, and will do so in future, namely that we leave expenditure for the new Member States intact and equally, that we leave the agreements that have been struck on this subject in Copenhagen intact."
"With regard to payment appropriations, a number of you have already drawn our attention to them, understandably so, particularly Mr Garriga who was the first to do so."
"He was also the first to level critical remarks with regard to the proposals on the part of the Council concerning those of the Commission, but I gather that he has already had a response in a way, even if unintended, by Mr Seppänen, I hope I pronounce your name correctly, who noted that before 2003, five billion was returned, and I can assure him and you, Mr President and fellow Members, that five billion has been returned before."
"If we talk about returns to the tune of ten billion, then I think that this puts a slightly different complexion on the remark about payment appropriations."
"Many of you were right to mention the importance of new priorities, new countries and solidarity."
"That is why I set such great store by this emphatic statement not to meddle with agreements and the just expectations that are nurtured in this respect."
"A number of you, including Mr Ferber and Mr Mulder, mentioned the subject of agriculture."
"Here again, the same applies, and I should like to hammer my message home once more: it goes without saying that agreements or farmers’ and cultivators’ rights are not tampered with."
"As Mr Mulder said quite rightly, we will be receiving the latest figures in October, but we will always fulfil our obligation in this respect."
"A number of you, including Mr Garriga and Mrs Jensen, have also flagged the agencies as an area of concern."
"For a moment, I was reminded of the fact that earlier last year, the European Parliament was, in fact, concerned about extra spending for those agencies, and Parliament now appears to be anxious, at least for a number of hours, about not having enough funding."
"Certainly where the new agencies are concerned, I think that we have tabled a very solid proposal for the activities of those agencies."
"The flexibility instrument has been mentioned, mainly in connection with the importance of external policy."
"You will agree with me that the core of the flexibility instrument is that it accommodates unexpected and unforeseen circumstances, and does not, therefore, provide for matters that can be planned ahead."
"I think it is crucial, and also in everyone’s interest, if we were to keep this instrument for that purpose and not deploy the flexibility instrument in the way as it was proposed earlier for external policy, being the entire category, the entire external policy in respect of which Mr Lewandowski and others made critical and anxious comments."
"I share their anxieties to a certain degree, because we did not enjoy making cutbacks in this category, even less in this one than in other categories, given the responsibility which we as Europe, and I very much agree with the comments that have been made, increasingly have in the world."
"On the other hand, as you have seen, we have made important exceptions in our proposal to this cutback, the key priority, of course, being ‘Iraq’ and the common foreign and security policy in general."
"I should like to put this into perspective to some degree, because if you consider the development of this budget over the last few years, there is an enormous increase in this very category."
"Finally, some MEPs have made comments, direct or indirect, about the new financial perspectives."
"I will not go into any more detail because fortunately, we have an informal meeting after this session to talk this over with your coordinators of all groups in this Parliament, as we have also agreed in the conciliation to inform you in the correct manner, but let me make one comment in this respect, because a number of your Members have mooted this point, the 1% letter, the approach of this presidency."
"Rest assured, we may be here as Dutch people, but we are not acting on our own behalf but as the Presidency of the European Union, which means that it is our responsibility to make the best possible progress in reaching agreement in the Council, at least where the principles and guidelines for the following multi-annual budget at the end of this year are concerned."
"In this respect, we as presidency have precisely opted for an approach which steers clear of being proven right or wrong about the 1%, and which moves into the direction of the discussion as to where our priorities and, I should like to add, our posteriorities are."
"I should like to take this opportunity to say this in reaction to comments."
"In this way, we hope to establish what is termed a ‘building blocks’ approach, an open discussion on content, just as, in fact, a start has already, in my view, been made with your Parliament today."
". Mr President, I would just like to make a few comments on the debate."
"Firstly, I should like to ask the penultimate speaker to note that our external auditor is not a company, but an independent and autonomous European institution, the European Court of Auditors, which audits accounting methods, the revenue and expenditure account and the statement of financial position annually, and concludes each year that the accounts are reliable."
"It then makes a number of comments, but without altering the overall result, and this makes it particularly clear that the accounts comply with the EU’s rules."
"With regard to implementation of the Budget, which in principle is now also connected with the accounts, I would like to point out once again that Parliament, like the Council, receives implementation figures for the EU Budget every week."
"No other parliament in the Member States is so well informed, and of course one of the reasons I introduced this practice is that you need to be aware, in particular for the budget debate, of the state of implementation of the individual programmes so that a decision can be taken on the correct approach for the coming year."
"It is apparent that the implementation rate for expenditure under the Structural Funds has drastically accelerated this year."
"This is not only because we have been able to make the first advance payments to the new Member States, but in particular because of the continuing payments to the old Member States for the 2000-2006 programmes."
"It follows that further intensive debate on this issue with the Council is needed, as there is absolutely no point in putting too little money in the Budget and having to submit a supplementary Budget later on."
"Mr Mulder specifically asked me when we would forward information on the pilot projects and preparatory actions to the Committee on Budgets."
"We hope to achieve this by 15 September, but we require information from many of the Directorates-General; we will have forwarded the information by 20 September at the latest."
"I believe that this debate on the 2005 Budget was a very lively one."
"I would like to express my thanks for this on behalf of the Commission, and I believe that it is right for us to show such commitment in this debate, as there are undoubtedly many citizens who will be keen to see what the first Budget for the enlarged Union, and adopted by an enlarged Union, will look like."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the legal protection of designs."
". Mr President, it is with considerable pleasure that I can inform you and Parliament that the Commission has today adopted a proposal that modifies national regimes of design protection so as to liberalise the secondary market in spare parts for repair purposes."
"Following the opinion of this Parliament in favour of liberalisation, the Commission attempted to harmonise and liberalise the market before, in 1996."
"Member States, however, were at that time not able to agree with a view shared by the Commission and this Parliament."
"Instead they requested that the Commission revisit the subject at a later date, which is what we have done."
"The proposal, which is of particular importance to the market in automobiles, would remove internal market barriers that have thus far remained."
"It would allow independent parts manufacturers to compete throughout the EU market for visible, 'must-match' replacement parts, such as bonnets, bumpers, doors, lamps, windscreens and wings."
"They must match the spare part produced by the manufacturer: in looks they must be identical."
"Potentially that market is worth billions of euros."
"Opinions differ as to the amount: the manufacturers themselves estimate EUR 2.5 billion per year, others EUR 10 billion."
"Non-visible parts - e.g. engine parts or mechanical parts - are not affected by this proposal, neither are components in new vehicles, i.e. the primary market is not affected."
"We are talking here about the repair market."
"Therefore, at most, only 25% of the entire spare-part market will be affected."
"However, the proposal will give significant benefits to that part of the market."
"Firstly, it would give consumers better choice and value when they buy spare parts."
"The Commission estimates that spare parts are 6-10% more expensive in Member States where they are subject to design protection."
"People are entitled to value for money throughout the life of a vehicle, and this proposal will help them get it."
"Secondly, on employment, liberalisation should have a positive net impact on EU jobs, benefiting small and medium-sized enterprises in particular."
"New jobs ought to be created by the growth of the market, in both the production and distribution of spare parts."
"EU parts manufacturers will be able to produce in the European Union parts for supplying import and export markets."
"Car makers from Japan or any other third country manufacturing or selling in the European Union would no longer be able to keep EU producers out of the market."
"Thirdly, Europe's competitiveness would benefit."
"The lack of harmonised rules is burdensome for companies. Independent parts manufacturers remain squeezed out of the market for visible replacement parts in many Member States."
"Under the proposal, car manufacturers would, moreover, retain full and exclusive rights covering the use of designs for the production and sale of new vehicles."
"That should be sufficient to reward their investment in design and to maintain a strong incentive to innovate."
"Fourthly and finally, a remark on safety."
"The liberalisation of design protection for replacement car parts has no impact on safety."
"Design protection covers only the outward appearance of products."
"The proposal would therefore not affect the safety or quality of spare parts."
"Safety standards, moreover, are governed by other EU and national laws. They set objective minimum standards for all spare parts."
"All producers would continue to have to respect these."
"The Commission, independently of the adoption of the proposal today, will undertake a study to ensure that all safety concerns will be addressed by those directives."
"As Members will be aware, the proposal has been the subject of intense lobbying on the part of car manufacturers, who are about to turn the full focus of their attention on Members of this Parliament."
"Their campaign has been a classic example of the narrow vested interests of the few, namely a handful of large car manufacturers with huge resources trying to undermine the broader interests of the many, namely car owners, throughout Europe."
"I appeal to Members of this Parliament to stand firm as the Commission has done."
"After all, the Commission's proposal strikes the right balance."
"It protects the advantages of design protection where it matters, which is in the primary market for new cars; but it also makes sure that goods can move freely throughout the European Union and that competition is not distorted by indefensible monopolies."
"Mr President, as PPE-DE Group coordinator for the internal market and consumer affairs, I certainly welcome the direction that the Commission is going in to remove a further anomaly in the internal market, one which is clearly most unsatisfactory in partitioning the market at the moment."
"We are waiting with great interest to see the Commission's proposal."
"I was also pleased to have some reassurance from the Commission that it recognises that there are other consumer protection issues, particularly in relation to safety, which need to be looked at."
"Speaking as draftsman of the opinion of our committee on the pedestrian protection requirements on motor vehicles, on which this House has spent a great deal of time, I have to say that since 1996 things have moved on as regards the important contribution that visible parts make to pedestrian protection."
"We need assurances that it will not be possible for independent manufacturers to supply parts, such as bonnets or bumpers, that will not meet the pedestrian protection standards demanded by this House."
"That is a significant issue, considering the overall consumer benefits and harmonisation of this proposal."
"Secondly, I should like to ask the Commissioner to confirm that he will be sending us a full economic and impact appraisal of this proposal."
"I was slightly surprised that he thought there would be a growth market in these components."
"Given that all the targets that we are again looking at in this House suggest that we wish casualties from motor vehicle accidents to decline significantly over the next ten years – by implication that suggests to me that the market in repair parts from accident damage, which is what we are talking about here, is likely to go down, not up – I would like to ask the Commissioner what his justification is for suggesting in this worthwhile proposal that it will be driven by growth markets."
"I regard it as dealing with an anomaly in the marketplace, but I want to make sure that the anomaly is not achieved at the expense of road safety."
"I want to make sure that the complexities of this are justified in terms of real economic benefit, both to the European economy and to consumers."
". It gives me pleasure to reply to Mr Harbour."
"Let me deal first with the question of safety."
"In markets where the repair market has been liberalised, as in the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy or the Netherlands, there have been no incidences of casualties attributable to the fact that third party providers have supplied some spare parts."
"The safety record in liberalised markets is as good – or, if you like, as bad – but no different from the safety record in markets where there is protection of the design."
"Secondly, believe it or not, there are 90 directives, concerned with the safety of pedestrians, which apply to all cars and parts of cars, and therefore also to parts supplied by third party suppliers."
"The third point is that there is a so-called 'extended impact assessment' attached to the proposal, which deals with safety – it runs to 50 pages."
"I can assure Members of this House, particularly Mr Harbour, that it is a very thorough impact assessment."
"He and other Members of Parliament that express an interest will receive it, together with the proposal."
"The extended impact assessment deals with the issue very thoroughly, but in order to still fears and apprehensions which exist, not only here but also at the Commission, I have said that, now that the proposal has been adopted, I shall see to it that a further study is carried out into the safety aspects, so that we all can rest assured that the matter is being looked at."
"The extended impact assessment is a very thorough job and I have held extensive consultations with stakeholders, particularly with the car industry itself."
"Members of this House will be able to read the extended impact assessment and form their own opinions."
"I look forward to a discussion on this proposal in Parliament, even though I personally will not take part, but will be replaced by my successor, Charlie McCreevy from Ireland."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to congratulate the Commission on its initiative, as I believe that it has opted for the right approach on this issue."
"We all know that the principle of mutual recognition through the use of standardisation is an extremely efficient and competitive method, and this is of course particularly true for spare parts."
"In all countries where the CE mark is used or must be used, the consumer is provided with a guarantee that legal requirements have been complied with."
"However, it then becomes crucial that testing agencies, which check whether the necessary requirements have in fact been complied with, are certified."
"Voluntary test marks, such as the GS (‘Safety Tested’) mark in Germany, would be a good idea, although the Commission has expressed widely differing opinions on this issue."
"In such cases a separate market exists where the consumer has an additional test mark, and can therefore see that an authorised testing agency has addressed the issue."
"The test mark allows the consumer to see that he can buy a very safe product."
"I would be interested to hear the Commission’s opinion on this matter."
". Mr President, firstly, who will control or supervise the car market and the spare parts produced by third parties?"
"As I said earlier, there are 90 directives concerned with the safety of automobiles and these directives are policed, if you like, by the Member States."
"The same will therefore apply to spare parts produced by a third party."
"Those motor vehicles and those parts will also be supervised or policed by Member States."
"So we can rest assured on that score."
"Secondly, and this is something I put in the directive only last night, we realise that consumers need to be adequately informed."
"Therefore, if the spare parts are not produced by the original car manufacturer but by third parties, the buyer must be informed accordingly."
"So to that extent the consumer will be advised that what he is buying comes from a different factory, which will enable him to say that he does not want that spare part, he wants the original, even though it may be somewhat more expensive."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, as a preliminary remark, I would like to say that I do not believe it was a good idea for this Commission to have taken a decision on this matter, which is so crucial."
"I think that it would have been preferable to leave this to the incoming Commission, which would perhaps then have placed a slightly different emphasis in terms of content."
"In your explanation of the decision, you mentioned that a new market would be opened up and that this would mean that new jobs could also be created."
"In another context you spoke of impact assessments."
"My question is this: has there also been an impact assessment of this creation of jobs, or is it not rather the case that existing jobs in the industrial sector will be cut, as liberalisation of such matters will now be forced through for ideological reasons, and that by means of this Directive we are moving jobs out of the European Union and into non-European foreign countries?"
". Mr President, on the first question of whether this Commission should have left the issue for the next Commission, I wish to say that this whole issue goes back to 1998, when a directive was adopted on the protection of designs."
"At that time no agreement could be reached on the issue of spare parts for cars and the matter was put on hold."
"However, it was agreed that any change in legislation should go in the direction of liberalisation."
"That is what we have done today."
"Secondly, in 2002 my colleague, Mr Monti, convinced the Commission and others of the need to liberalise the distribution of cars, which is called block exemption."
"This was done, and this proposal is the natural concomitant of his proposal, which was adopted in 2002."
"Therefore, it was of the essence that this Commission should deal with this issue because, as I have said, it goes with his proposal."
"I therefore insisted that this Commission should deal with it."
"Moreover, I think the Member who has just spoken would agree that it would not do for this Commission – even though it is within six weeks of the end of its term of office – to pass on difficult decisions to the next Commission."
"We are paid to take decisions – even though they may be difficult – and we should do that."
"The second point refers to employment."
"At the moment car manufacturers obtain spare parts beyond and outside the European Union."
"They buy bonnets, headlamps and rear windows in countries like Turkey, Brazil and Korea."
"In other words, at the moment car manufacturers have exported jobs to those countries."
"If we open the market for repairs and the secondary market for spare parts, it is more than likely that the jobs created by small and medium-sized enterprises – which, we all agree, are very important for industry in general and in particular for German industry – will more than compensate for the loss of jobs as car manufacturers have been outsourcing their components – their spare parts – to suppliers beyond the confines of the European Union."
"Although it is difficult to point to hard facts, I am confident that the net result will be positive for employment, since I expect these small- and medium-sized enterprises to become very successful in the secondary market for spare parts."
"That concludes the debate."
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0007/2004)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Commission."
"In response to a request from over 100 Members of the European Parliament from all 15 current Member States, the World Health Organisation recently agreed to look into making recommendations for improving the accuracy of national statistics on sudden unexplained death in young people."
"Experts across Europe deplore the fact that these deaths are registered and coded as due to causes which are sometimes vague or incorrect and as a consequence it is difficult to get an accurate picture of the real scale of the problem."
"Can the Commission elaborate on the possibilities which exist for Eurostat to contribute to the work of the World Health Organisation, particularly as regards training for coroners and pathologists, on recording sudden unexplained deaths for statistical purposes?"
"Madam President, forgive me, but this is the first time I have spoken in Parliament and as a Commissioner and I do not know all the procedures."
"In reply to your question, Mrs McAvan, I must tell you that, through its current activities, Eurostat contributes in various ways to the work of the World Health Organisation, within the context of the Community Statistical Programme 2003-2007; and, in particular, in relation to public health statistics, Eurostat collects, confirms and publishes annual data relating to causes of death in the Member States of the European Union, the candidate countries and the countries of the European Free Trade Association, at both national and regional levels."
"Data is collected in coordination with the World Health Organisation and the latter is regularly informed of Eurostat’s work in the field of public health statistics and is invited to the relevant meetings."
"In particular, with regard to statistics on causes of death, important issues have still to be resolved in relation to the quality and comparability of data, for example issues which were very well set out in the report ."
"Notable amongst the issues described in this report are those relating to certification, including the issue of the accuracy of data relating to sudden and unexplained deaths of young people."
"Work has begun with a view to improving the quality of data in close coordination with the Member States and with the World Health Organisation in order to provide the Member States with better training instruments."
"For doctors who certify deaths – and for medical students – the European Union training programme on the certification of causes of death has been developed in conjunction with the Member States."
"In addition to the work to improve the process for certifying deaths, activities aimed at improving quality are being carried out, such as the application of automated codification in the Member States."
"Thank you very much for that reply and for the information about Eurostat's work."
"The collection of information might seem like a very dry subject, but the problem at the moment is that, without such information, no proper research can take place into why people die very suddenly, particularly young people. As a result research is not carried out."
"In the case of cot deaths 20 years ago, we changed the classification and then more research was done."
"My follow-up question is more a request to the Commission - to whoever is responsible for Eurostat - that part of the training for those who certify death should look at the question of sudden unexplained deaths."
"At the moment, people often put down heart failure, for example, and then it is not clear that the death is totally and utterly unexplained."
"It is very important that training should focus on that particular issue."
"I would also ask you to ask Eurostat to keep Members of the European Parliament informed in this area."
"The WHO is going to revise its guidelines at its meeting in October."
"I hope that, through cooperation with WHO, we will be kept informed about what changes are made and that we will see improvements in the kind of classification, which may lead to better research and the prevention of these unexplained deaths."
"The body responsible for determining the exact classification of the items to be included when certifying death and informing the statistical authorities of causes of death is the World Health Organisation, with which we work very closely, as I mentioned in my initial reply."
"Eurostat – the statistical agency which is my responsibility as Commissioner – has the greatest possible interest in the information communicated to it on causes of death being as accurate as possible, but what it cannot do is change the current headings."
"The study I referred to before states that the headings can be improved since some of them lead to confusion."
"This is not, however, the responsibility of Eurostat, it is the responsibility of the World Health Organisation."
"What is the responsibility of Eurostat – and we are doing this – is to provide training for people required to carry out certifications and, to this end, Eurostat has prepared a training package consisting essentially of three elements: a basic certification for European Union-level certification, a website which serves as an on-line training tool for people required to carry out certifications and printed information which is also available on the Internet in the form of a leaflet which provides people required to carry out certifications with details of the requirements and methods for collecting the most accurate information possible, so that that information – for the purposes you have indicated and which we all agree with – can be used as efficiently as possible."
"We are therefore working on it, we are continuing with this training effort, with the cooperation of the World Health Organisation."
"What we cannot do is assume the responsibility for changing these headings which may be creating a degree of confusion."
"The use of anabolic substances by athletes (doping) at the Olympic Games in Athens has proved to be a problem of deeply dismaying proportions."
"The commercialisation of sport, the transformation of the Olympic Games into an arena giving free rein to multinational sponsors and the multinational drug companies which manufacture the substances in question, the fact that the multinationals are left to create Olympic records and the current profile of the super-athlete, together with the alienation of sport from contemporary needs for sport as a popular, inclusive activity are fundamental factors in the spawning and proliferation of this serious problem."
"What practical measures will the Commission take to deal radically with the problem of doping, its causes and the associated racketeers in order to develop and promote sport as a popular and inclusive activity for all?"
". Madam President, I share the honourable Member’s concern; doping is indeed killing sport."
"I have to tell you, though, that the only competences we as a Community can exercise are subsidiary in nature."
"Accordingly, the Commission cannot act except in order to add to and back up the action taken by sporting organisations and by the Member States."
"Nevertheless, we have taken action."
"In 1999, the Commission adopted a Community anti-doping support plan and set out approaches that the campaign against doping might take."
"I have to say that we have had full support from your House, whereas there has been little or no response on the part of the Council; even so, we have embarked on practical action to combat doping, with, for example, analyses of the situation of young people in sports centres – which is disastrous – on socio-economic factors in doping and on the steps to be taken to protect young people."
"At the same time, we have helped the Member States to set up, jointly with the sporting world and with the sports federations, the World Anti-Doping Agency."
"We have made a practical contribution to this agency by training doping inspectors whose task is to carry out inspections on sportsmen and sportswomen."
"As regards health programmes, too, steps have been taken to prompt Member States to act to prevent the use and abuse of drugs by young people."
"Prevention is, of course, also of the utmost importance, and so I would inform you that 2004 has been declared the ‘European Year of Education through Sport’."
"Throughout the year, thousands of projects have been set up in conjunction with schools, sporting associations and local and regional authorities in order to make young people aware of the dangers of doping and to encourage them to adhere to the principle of fair play in their sporting activities."
"Of course, we will be unable to do more for as long as there is no clear and precise legal basis, but we have done some work on producing one."
"Ever since I was, in 1999, appointed Commissioner for Sport, I have organised, on a regular basis, an informal Council of Sports Ministers – we were unable to have a formal one – in order to encourage them to cooperate towards this end."
"Also on a regular basis, I have had meetings with Europe’s sporting association in order to encourage them, too, to join together in fighting the scourge of doping."
"Finally, the Convention has set the seal on this work by giving us its support and by proposing an article for the Constitutional Treaty that would require the EU to aim to protect the physical and moral integrity of the young, and of young sportsmen and sportswomen in particular."
"Once the treaty has been adopted, a real legal basis will be in place; we will be able to have official meetings of sports ministers, and will be able to take practical action."
"We are all looking forward to the new treaty."
"– The situation with the measures referred to have got worse rather than better, because it is precisely the commercialisation of sport which is the real cause of the huge problem of doping."
"When a sports team is a business, the team itself and its sponsors set increasing profits as their objective and, consequently, every sacrifice and every victory won at all costs by the athlete is a means of maximising profits."
"In addition, commercialisation alters the real nature of sport and the existence of the 'professional athlete' poisons and undermines every moral basis for amateur sport."
"Sport is a public and social commodity and cannot enter into the rationale of private profit."
"I should therefore like to ask you if you intend to take measures to make sport a truly social commodity and ensure it remains outside the rationale of profit and sponsorship."
"Are you willing to cut the umbilical cord between sport and professional activity?"
"That is the question."
"Madam President, I shall try to extract a question from a statement, and shall say that I agree with the honourable Member that doping is a scourge."
"I do not agree, however, with two points that he makes."
"Firstly, he suggests that there is a clear difference between amateur sport and professional sport."
"Our studies have, unfortunately, shown that amateur sport has also been affected by the phenomenon."
"We must therefore fight doping among not only professional athletes, but also amateur athletes, and we must focus on public health, given that doping is becoming a genuine public health problem."
"The second point made by the honourable Member with which I take issue is the idea that, despite all the measures in place, not only has the situation failed to improve, it has in fact worsened."
"The answer is very simple: as long as we deny that doping takes place and that there is a need to take action to control it, the offenders will not be worried."
"Now that everyone acknowledges that doping takes place everywhere and now that we have put controls in place in conjunction with the International Olympic Committee and WADA, the World Anti-doping Agency, we are, of course, catching people who take drugs and that is a good thing. The more people we catch, the fewer people there will be who will risk taking drugs and the more we will be sending out the positive message that ‘you cannot get away with doping’ and that an extremely fierce battle is now being organised against this scourge that is killing sport."
"– Madam President, the Commission has done some very creditable work with regard to the European Year of Education through Sport."
"Several projects, connected with the education of young people in particular, have been initiated."
"Now this new legal basis for sport, as proposed by the Convention, has also been placed in the context of policy on sports."
"What tangible contribution would the new Constitutional Treaty make to the fight against drug use in sport?"
"What sort of projects could the Commission propose and advance which under the current Constitutional Treaty are not possible?"
"Could you give any examples?"
"Madam President, as I have just explained, we established the European Year of Education through Sport because we could not establish a European Year of Sport without a legal basis for financing it."
"I therefore had to sidestep the problem by using education as the legal basis, in order to be able to take specific action relating to sport and to protecting young sportsmen and sportswomen."
"What shall we be able to do once the Treaty is in force?"
"We shall be able to take direct action in the field of sport."
"Firstly, there is to be a Council of Sports Ministers, which will be empowered to make joint proposals with the Commission."
"The Commission itself will be able to propose action programmes, funded, of course, by the European Union, to help sports federations, governments, educators and clubs to move in the right direction."
"This will, therefore, change everything."
"For the time being, I feel that all that we have done has been in preparation for this new treaty, yet we really must have a legal basis to be able to produce a more solid and higher profile policy."
"In view of the options, we have so far done the most that we can, and even more than that."
"– Commissioner, I noted with interest that, in your initial response, you noted, despite the steps that have been taken, that there is no adequate legal basis for doing more."
"I therefore specifically ask you: for the last two and a half years, the European Parliament Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has been asking for a directive from the Commission in application of Article 152 of the founding Treaty."
"Does the Commission intend, albeit two and a half years later, to promote such a Community directive?"
"Madam President, unfortunately I cannot say any more about this than I have already said."
"We have no legal basis in this field."
"We are not in a position to undertake any harmonisation action, nor to table a directive in this regard."
"I should, moreover, like to point out that, even if a new Treaty is adopted, we shall only be able to act in support of the Member States in this matter. I should also like to draw the honourable Member’s attention to the fact that we have Court of Justice precedents at our disposal."
"Various Court of Justice rulings in this field underline the European sports federations’ responsibility and autonomy, provided that those federations comply with basic Community legislation."
"I should be very happy if, in the future, more opportunities were made available for us to move forward."
"Moreover, as regards combating crime, for example, I should like to remind Parliament that, in 2002, the Commission and the Spanish Presidency organised a seminar in Spain that brought together for the very first time those responsible for the fight against doping and representatives of the border police and customs authorities."
"This is a highly complex issue; it is a problem that concerns internal security; it is a problem that concerns medicine labelling; it is a problem that concerns sport; it is a problem that concerns the protection of young people; and it is a problem that concerns public health."
"All of these elements must be coordinated so that the outcome is practical action. It is true, however, that apart from in the area of medicine labelling, we have no legal basis at all at our disposal for harmonising and for taking the major steps forward, as we should be doing."
"In reality, what we have attempted to do, by coordinating actions and by making the most of our moral strength in this area, has been even more than we could feasibly do."
"We have exceeded our competences, but I felt that it was right to do so and I feel that I was right to undertake this anti-doping action, which is the only way to protect our young people and to bring fair play back to sport."
"In July 2004, the European Commission agreed to a ten year-period for the import and processing of genetically modified maize (NK 603) into the Union markets as applied for by the American Monsanto Co."
"This maize is, for the moment, intended for animal feed and industrial purposes."
"However, the Commission has already announced that it will also allow its use in food products!"
"This is causing both medical and economic controversy, because it will hit maize producers in the countries of the Union."
"Will the Commission, therefore, maintain its intention to admit NK 603 for use in the food industry?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the new legislation on genetically-modified organisms has been fully applicable since last April."
"This legislation makes it possible for consumers to make free choices by means of clear labelling and a case-by-case risk analysis and also guarantees that genetically-modified organisms authorised in the European Union are harmless to human health and the environment."
"The request for authorisation of foods derived from maize from line NK 603 was presented in April 2001 and has been dealt with and analysed over all this time in accordance with the legislation in force."
"The States of the Union and the European Food Safety Authority studied this request and the opinion published by the EFSA indicates that it has no objections from the point of view of safety."
"There is a validated detection method for this genetically-modified organism which will make it possible to trace and label in accordance with the current rules."
"All the necessary conditions for its authorisation are therefore fulfilled."
"The authorisation of genetically-modified organisms, foods and feedstuffs is essentially based on safety criteria."
"With regard to the possible economic repercussions, I would like to stress that foods and ingredients derived from various lines of genetically-modified maize have been notified or authorised for marketing and, therefore, the authorisation of this new NK 603 line would extend the range of possibilities but would not in any way set a precedent."
"I must point out, however, that the authorisation has not yet taken place and that an application relating to it, presented, I would emphasise, in accordance with the 2001 Directive, is being examined."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"Today I have had the great pleasure of listening to you and debating with you on the issue of Belarus."
"This has already become such a tradition that I would like to raise the subject with you one more time."
"I would like to thank you for your answer, but I would also like to point out that this is a controversial issue."
"It is controversial because the European Council has not taken a decision on the matter, as the required majority for such a decision was not reached."
"It appears to me that this is ample proof that this issue will have further consequences, and that some of these consequences will undoubtedly be the subject of much heated discussion."
"I would now like to turn to the issue of genetically modified rape, as I know that the European Commission is currently working on a proposal to authorise such rape."
"Could the Commissioner please also give her opinion on this matter?"
"I know that my government, the Polish Government, is opposed to any authorisation."
"Madam President, Mr Czarnenecki, it is a pleasure for me to be able to contribute to the debate here in this Parliament."
"The fact that the previous debate on Belarus and this one on genetically-modified organisms have coincided is testament to the fact that you are doing a good job of defending your views, Mr Czarnenecki, and that is your job."
"I would like to say to you that the current Community legislation, which is the result of the negotiations between this Parliament and the Council on a proposal from the Commission, finally granted the Commission the power to authorise a genetically-modified organism by means of a legislative procedure know as the comitology procedure."
"This procedure – as the honourable Member is aware – is used in many areas of Community legislation, and is provided for in the current legislation, and allows the Member States of the Union to play an important role and the European Parliament to participate."
"This procedure does not authorise the Commission to act against a majority in the Council."
"Nevertheless, when there is no sufficient majority in the Council – when there is a majority, but not a sufficient one – in favour of or against the proposed measure, the Commission can and must act."
"In authorising this NK 603 line, therefore, the Commission will simply be fulfilling its obligation to apply Community legislation, and I would like to point out that the companies legitimately trust that their applications will be dealt with fairly and objectively, in accordance with the Community legislation in force approved by this Parliament and by the Council."
"With regard to the new varieties, they will all be analysed in a fair manner, with the two essential objectives: their traceability and the verification that they are harmless to health and to the environment."
"To this end, each new variety proposed will have to be analysed in the context of an individualised approval."
"There will be no generic approvals."
"– Would the Commissioner agree that any GM product that is going to be put into the food chain will be adequately labelled so that consumers can see exactly what they are selecting and that it will have been properly tested and be safe for human consumption?"
"Could she also respond to the original question, in which the questioner says that bringing these products into our market might in some way result in unfair competition with products within the European Union?"
"Is this not essentially a betrayal of the point that our farmers and our industry should take up this new technology and use it if they are going to compete in the future?"
"Madam President, as the honourable Member knows, all the industries and all the elements in the chain are obliged to label and indicate the existence of genetically-modified organisms in the composition of a product."
"Fraud may take place, but it will be the responsibility of the various European Union authorities to ensure that it does not take place."
"So the important thing is that the authorisation of a genetically-modified organism involves its traceability, that is to say, there must be systems for detecting it, if it is used in any product."
"We are all aware, for example, that there is also fraud in the use of hormones."
"As a former Agriculture Minister I can tell you that we must be extremely vigilant in order to prevent this fraud and tackle it if it takes place."
"The important thing is that the consumer can make the choice."
"With regard to the second issue, you have mentioned unfair competition in relation to farmers."
"Unfortunately, we are not talking about unfair competition."
"If there is any unfair competition, the competition will relate to the traditional varieties of the various products."
"Any possible unfair competition from NK 302 will be with the traditional varieties of maize which have been cultivated in Europe and throughout the world."
"Farmers may choose to use them or not."
"They can use any of the varieties."
"Competition, if there is any unfair competition, will, moreover, be between laboratory varieties and natural varieties."
"I believe that citizens and politicians have a responsibility here as well."
"We have the possibility of choosing what we want: traditional varieties or new laboratory varieties."
"Consumers themselves will ultimately be free to choose how this issue develops."
"– Commissioner, at the meeting of Ministers for Agriculture on 19 July about this specific maize, only one Member State in three voted in favour, following which the Commission decided that one in three wanted it."
"Are you perhaps considering reviewing the procedure used to take decisions on this particular European legislation, so that it is more democratic?"
"I have a second question. Measures have already been taken in Denmark and Germany for the benefit of farmers who farm organically and conventionally, in order to protect them from the danger of contamination from modified organisms."
"Are you perhaps considering promoting similar measures at European level?"
"Mr Papadimoulis, I do not know if I made it clear earlier, but I will say it again: my sympathies are with natural products, with traditional varieties."
"I like apples which, though they may sometimes be uglier, have more flavour, more aroma and, in my view, are of a higher quality."
"This is not just true of apples, but of a whole range of foodstuffs."
"That is the reality."
"Furthermore, I defend farmers who opt for traditional agriculture, with selected, traditional and natural products which, furthermore, uses traditional fertilisers which prevent the introduction of chemical substances or genetically-modified organisms."
"This must not prevent the cultivation of these products, which – according to all scientific analyses – do not cause any harm to human health, which may in some cases resolve problems and difficulties – very obviously in certain regions of the world – which improve the performance of agricultural production and which furthermore are completely detectable – traceable, as I said earlier."
"There are problems such as cross-pollination and the contamination of natural products through pollination by genetically-modified products."
"This has also been studied and, in fact, in the cases we have authorised, these risks are absolutely minimal or quite simply non-existent."
"As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 27 and 28 will be taken together."
"At the informal Transport Council on 9 and 10 July in Amsterdam, Commissioner Loyola De Palacio said that she intended to submit a new proposal for a directive on port services before the end of her term of office."
"Can the Commission inform us exactly how this new proposal will take account of the fundamental objections of the European Parliament with regard to self-handling and the liberalisation of pilotage services?"
"What organisations and bodies have been consulted in connection with the drafting of this new proposal?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, access to the port services market is an issue which the Commission as well as this Parliament and the Council have been actively working on over the last seven years, specifically on the basis of the Green Paper on ports and maritime infrastructures of 1997, a document which stimulated the first intense debates on this subject."
"The discussions intensified with the proposed Directive presented by the Commission in 2001, and the in-depth debates which took place in relation to it led the Commission to introduce various modifications to the text, particularly in response to the opinions expressed by Parliament at first and second readings."
"Nevertheless, having adopted a text in conciliation, at the last vote this Parliament rejected it."
"The margin was minimal, but as we know, one vote is enough."
"With the new wording of its proposals on port services, the Commission is trying to reflect the legitimate concerns of all parties."
"Likewise, in the new proposal we are preparing, we are, moreover, trying to respond to the objections raised to self-assistance from the points of view both of safety and of social protection and the environment."
"The new proposal will probably require all port service providers to be subjected to a system of authorisations which guarantees compliance with the applicable safety, employment and environmental rules."
"This approach differs fundamentally to the proposal of 2001 and is intended to respond to the concerns expressed by those who called for greater attention to be paid to these points."
"Bearing in mind that the necessary authorisations will guarantee equal conditions for port services, there will not be any reason to stop companies carrying out self-assistance from using their own land-based staff."
"With regard to pilotage, the proposal being prepared will probably incorporate a specific system, with a view to taking account of maritime safety aspects, and will provide for the application of public service obligations."
"Finally, I would like to stress the importance of developing the role to be played by ports in transferring the growth in goods traffic by road to short-sea shipping."
"In order to guarantee a competitive transport system in the European Union, I believe it is absolutely essential that a significant proportion of the new demand, which we expect to grow by around 40% in ten years for goods, be channelled towards maritime cabotage within an enlarged Europe."
"This will prevent other types of congestion problems which are already beginning to appear in other types of infrastructures, such as roads or railways, which also require significant modernisation and must be made more dynamic."
"Commissioner, I assume that you will agree with me that this is a very sensitive issue that has been the subject of much debate and has caused much upheaval, because it can obviously have grave consequences for a large number of people within the Union."
"These days, there is also a certain level of distrust in port circles with regard to the proposals you will shortly be tabling."
"I would therefore like to ask you quite specifically whether you are planning another thorough consultation with all those involved from the sector – workers and employers – in order to reach a mutually acceptable compromise in the next few weeks, before the issue is presented to the Commission."
"I should like to ask you what timeframe you have in mind."
"Mr El Khadraoui, I am aware that this is a very sensitive issue – those of you who were here will remember the demonstrations and traffic hold-ups which took place at the time of the debate on the previous text."
"Having said that, we must be clear: do we or do we not want to promote maritime traffic and transport?"
"If we want to promote maritime transport, we have to make it more dynamic and more competitive, without reducing the safety aspects or producing any kind of social dumping, naturally. Neither, however, must we make it obligatory – as in some ports of the European Union today, for example – when loading or unloading a lorry onto a roll-on roll-off transport system to employ a specific driver from port staff or pay somebody – although they are not employed – as if they were employed."
"That would clearly mean imposing obstacles and unjustified costs for maritime transport."
"Instead, if we really want to promote maritime cabotage, we need to make it as fluid as possible."
"To this end, we have put forward a series of proposals – some are already operational – relating to administrative simplification, the use of new technologies and the harmonisation of forms, thereby making it possible for the maritime sector to enjoy the same facilities as, for example, TIR road systems."
"That is not enough, however."
"Ports must also be promoted as multimodal hubs and made more dynamic."
"Throughout all this time we have held discussions with the sectors."
"During previous discussions I met on repeated occasions with all the representatives of the piloting, docking and loading sectors."
"I have met all the sectors."
"We have continued to hold meetings with them – myself in some cases, such as the last one I held in Puerto de Amberes, and in other cases the Commission services."
"I am sure that, during the coming discussions, my successor – who will be responsible for promoting them – will continue to hold fluid talks and contacts with all the sectors."
"What is certainly the case is that there are certain types of situations which could perhaps be called privileged – I am not sure whether they are – or which simply involve closed elements, which cannot be maintained."
"We must move towards greater openness, which, I would emphasise, is going to mean more work, more activity, greater possibilities and greater wealth for all the European Union’s port areas."
"Madam President, I still have a few additional questions."
"Commissioner, although I am grateful for your openness and for the candour with which you have spoken, I still wonder what the compelling circumstances are for you to table this proposal in the dying days of your career as a Commissioner, when your mandate has only six weeks left to run?"
"You have told Mr El Khadraoui that you have consulted all those involved and refer in this respect to your visit to the Antwerp port."
"I live in Antwerp and if you ask me, the last time you visited the Antwerp port was when the debate about the previous directive, which was rejected by this Parliament, was in full swing."
"I therefore see no signs of consultation about the new text."
"Like Mr El Khadraoui, I would emphatically ask you what your timeframe is."
"You have failed to give a response to this question so far."
"Finally, Commissioner, surely you must realise that what you stated a moment ago with regard to the statute of the Belgian and Flemish dockworkers is nothing short of a declaration of war, and that you will certainly not solve the issue with this kind of approach."
"Madam President, I am still a fully-fledged Commissioner and I intend to act as such until my last day in the job."
"It does not matter to me that I am only in the job for another month and a half;"
"I am going to present what I believe I must present if it is ready for presentation."
"I do not intend to fail to present anything and leave outstanding issues for my successor just because I am leaving."
"I have been employed, and this Parliament has put its trust in me, until 1 November."
"And I intend to carry out my duties fully until 1 November."
"Secondly, if anybody has declared war, it is certain sectors."
"I am not declaring war on anybody."
"Quite the opposite, what I have been holding over all these years has been a series of debates."
"In fact, there has been a slight mistake: my last meeting was in Rotterdam, in a port city, and I met there with all the representatives of the port unions."
"It is true that in a very civilised and correct manner I was shown certain placards and banners asking me to go away and other less friendly things, I know."
"We were, however, discussing all the issues."
"I am not, moreover, waging a war on anybody whatsoever."
"All I am doing is offering clear support for maritime transport and furthermore I am talking about maritime cabotage."
"Are we able to ensure that the lorry I referred to or the trailer in other types of transport can move around as freely as possible and at the least cost in this form of transport and transfer in ports, with costs that are truly justified and not artificial such as, for example, the one to which I have referred?"
"I could also point to the case of the captain who sails the same route once or twice per week and enters the same port once or twice per week: does he not know the problems involved in bringing the ship – his ship – into that port as well as any pilot who has been doing so for a while?"
"These are the issues we must deal with and if we are to talk about promoting maritime traffic, we must bear in mind that this must be incorporated."
"I am not against anybody, but rather I am in favour of certain things: in favour of port activity, of wealth in ports, of the development of port cities and areas and in favour of the European economy, competitiveness and living conditions."
"Finally, many of the elements of the proposal we will present will be restricted to cabotage."
"It is not a question of a captain of a ship suddenly entering any old port without a pilot."
"That would make no sense from the point of view of safety."
"Rather we are talking about a captain who enters a port each week, who knows the port and who furthermore has authorisation, granted by the port authority itself, guaranteeing that he has the appropriate qualifications, knowledge and skills."
"I am told we can continue to talk."
"We can always carry on talking."
"If I were to suddenly come up with some legislation without having spoken to anybody, then I would understand your concern."
"I have, however, been a Commissioner for five years and I have spent these five years talking to the port sectors on various occasions."
"And not just me, but also the Commission’s services have spent seven years since the Green Paper was approved, and beforehand during its preparation, speaking to the various bosses, players and protagonists in the European ports."
"So there have certainly been consultations and talks."
"I am going to earn my salary up until the last day and respond to the trust which you, this Parliament and the Council, have placed in me, and that means doing my job, which consists amongst other things of presenting this proposal for a Directive, if it is ready."
"– The workers and their trades union have expressed their categorical opposition to the liberalisation of port services."
"Ports are of strategic importance to economic development and national defence."
"Specialist workers in ports are connected with the loading and unloading of ships, the strain on ships and, by extension, the safety and protection of life at sea and environmental protection."
"How does the Commissioner evaluate these criteria with respect to the new initiative for the new arrangements?"
"Is she taking account of the workers' proposals?"
"Mr Toussas, when airports in Europe were liberalised there were very similar arguments to those now being put forward in relation to ports."
"Workers were concerned that it would lead to job losses, a decline in social conditions and lack of safety."
"None of that has happened."
"What has happened?"
"The opposite: unprecedented dynamism in European airports."
"Mr Toussas, what I want is what is best for economic growth and for the jobs and living conditions of workers."
"I have taken account of the concerns of the unions and I have modified some of the initial proposals – as I pointed out a moment ago – and I have introduced generalised authorisations, which means that there is public responsibility for guaranteeing that all aspects relating to safety are respected and that standards are respected."
"It is also a guarantee that employment legislation is respected."
"I therefore believe that these concerns are unfounded."
"I would emphasise that this proposal represents an opening up, but, above all, what it must mean is more activity for the regions you have referred to."
"Questions Nos 29 and 30 will be replied to in writing."
"Madam President, the two other Commissioners each have only one question to answer, which will certainly not take 20 minutes."
"I believe we could therefore follow a different procedure to that which we usually follow, as there is no point in taking 20 minutes for one question."
"Madam President, I have been in this Chamber since before Question Time began."
"I presented my question in July and I have been waiting and listening to every question."
"Members are not to blame if Commissioners exceed their speaking time."
"I would like to put my question and, above all, to hear the Commissioner’s reply."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am very sorry, but we will follow the usual procedure for Question Time."
"We have further questions now for the other Commissioners."
"I am afraid that you are mistaken, Mr Posselt, as we have a great many other questions, especially for Commissioner Dimas."
"All I can do is to inform you that you will receive a written answer to your question."
"I am very sorry that you have waited in the Chamber, but this was unavoidable."
"The EU is a world-leading exporter of textiles and clothing and the textile industry in Europe is undoubtedly the 'industry of the future'."
"On the expiry of the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, quotas are to be abolished as of 1 January 2005, which also entails free access to the EU market."
"What measures will the Commission take to ensure that the European industry will obtain access to third country markets in the same way that the EU provides access for the WTO Member States?"
"What strategy will it adopt to maintain and improve the competitive position of the European textiles industry worldwide?"
"Madam President, the question concerns the conclusions drawn by the Commission in the light of that abolition of international textile quotas that will come into force as of 31 December of this year following a decision taken ten years ago at multilateral level by the World Trade Organisation."
"Ten years ago, we jointly set the date for the abolition of quotas for the end of this year."
"The day is almost upon us, and – understandably, even though we have had all the time we needed to prepare for it by means of progressive liberalisation - it has provoked a certain amount of anxiety, together with fears and difficulties to which the Commission has endeavoured to respond."
"The overall strategy that we have adopted consists of considering the European textiles and clothing sector, as the questioner himself has done, not as an industry of the past – whose gradual disappearance would have to be managed, more or less decently, from a social and political point of view – but, in sharp contrast, as an industry of the future."
"Textiles and clothing in Europe is a competitive, modern, innovative and productive industry."
"Europe is the continent in which there is no more modern and productive sector than that of textiles and clothing."
"Against this backdrop, the fact remains that finally abolishing the quotas presents us with a challenge in terms of competitiveness to which we must be capable of responding, and this is what the Commission did last June by proposing action lines."
"We worked on this matter with a high-level group representing the Commission, the Member States, various actors from the sector, producers, distributors and trades union representatives. I myself also took part personally in the group’s work, and a number of conclusions were reached."
"In essence, what we are proposing is firstly to start monitoring international trade – and in particular our imports – a little more closely."
"We shall therefore put in place at the end of this year a monitoring system in more or less real time, so that the figures – and, in particular, possible sudden rises in imports – can be spotted more easily, and we can draw our own conclusions as necessary, as the WTO entitles us to do."
"We shall also pay increased attention to questions of international competition and, in particular, to illegal practices such as dumping, fraud and the protection of intellectual property, each of which are, of course, cancers that must be monitored extremely closely."
"The second element is conquering foreign markets."
"This, as far as we are concerned, remains the most effective weapon for ensuring the future of the sector, whether the markets concerned are major ones that remain protected, such as the US market in several cases, or potentially significant markets for us, namely a number of markets in some, but not all, developing countries which, in the textiles and clothing sector, are now potential importers of high added value products, including European products."
"This entire discussion, essentially focused on tariff issues and on non-tariff barriers, is the result of the Doha round of trade negotiations."
"We are therefore at the heart of these international negotiations."
"I should like to add a regional perspective to this multilateral work concerning the Euro-Mediterranean zone, on which we have been working with our partners from around the Mediterranean region, namely (and naturally enough) the countries of the Europe of 25, together with the candidate countries or potential candidate countries, such as Turkey."
"The idea is to set up a kind of pan-European integrated ‘textiles and clothing’ zone, with the help, for example, of accumulated benefits of pan-Euro-Mediterranean origin, about which we have been negotiating, up to and including this year."
"Lastly, a brief word about China, which is, of course, the most formidable competitor in this area, in view of that country’s efficiency, productivity and salary levels."
"We have set up a system of bilateral dialogue with the Chinese as regards the textile trade to look into ways of ensuring that trade is not disrupted too significantly as a result of quotas being abolished."
"In addition to this government-level and administration-level dialogue, we have set up a dialogue within European and Chinese business circles, and the first meeting in this connection took place recently."
"All of these measures, which were fostered by the Commission’s initial communication last October and which were approached within the framework of this work done by the high-level working group, will be the subject of a fresh Commission communication, currently scheduled for October."
"We shall therefore approach the end of the year deadline in full knowledge of the facts, but also with a toolbox that has recently undergone significant improvements."
"– Madam President, despite the fact that I am wasting valuable time, I should like publicly to congratulate Commissioner Lamy on the work which he has accomplished on the portfolio which he has managed to date as Commissioner."
"My supplementary question concerns what general measures, reciprocal measures and measures to abolish non-trade barriers the Commission intends to take at both multilateral and bilateral level, as well as within the framework of trans-regional cooperation."
"Reference was made to them, but there needs to be a transition from words to action, which is always difficult. I should therefore be grateful for further clarification from the Commissioner."
"There are, of course, several levels."
"Once the quotas have disappeared, there will still be both the tariff level – which, as I have mentioned, is to be the subject of fresh multilateral negotiations, the principles of which, moreover, were set in Geneva last July – and everything we refer to as non-tariff barriers, in other words technical barriers that are also on the multilateral negotiation agenda."
"I am referring here to a series of technical measures as regards the composition of materials, protection against certain risks and specific characteristics that are imposed from time to time, in particular in the USA or in certain important developing countries, such as Brazil, South Africa, Egypt and India."
"These effectively amount to trade barriers which, under the pretext of protecting some specific local feature or other, have the effect of banning imports and protecting local producers."
"This whole area of ‘non-tariff barriers’, of which I have just mentioned a few examples, falls within the framework of the multilateral negotiations that we have been pursuing in the Doha round, and what is true for textiles similarly applies to other sectors, such as the car and electronics sectors."
"This area of non-tariff barriers is therefore also part of the negotiations that we are pursuing within the World Trade Organisation."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the textile industry is facing major changes."
"The European market is being opened up and trade barriers mean that many markets are not accessible to our exporters."
"I would therefore like to ask what progress has been made on the Singapore issues of competition, government procurement and investment."
"The export strategy we need for the European Union is of course of immense importance, and so I would be interested to hear your opinion on this matter."
"The Commission is aware of Mr Rübig’s interest in issues relating to international trade and in particular to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)."
"It is true that textiles and clothing issues affect SMEs more than multinationals, hence his sensitivity on the issue."
"In my response to him, I shall add to my previous answer to the main questioner’s supplementary question by focusing on the only Singapore issue remaining, given that we had to let go – in any event for this round of negotiations and even if they do not leave the WTO’s table – of Singapore issues such as investment, competition, public procurement and public procurement transparency."
"What remains, Mr Rübig, is a subject that is dear to you and that we decided in Geneva to negotiate formally this time, namely trade facilitation, which entails a complete review of some of the procedures, paperwork, authorisations, licences and administrative decisions that all too often still confront people as they take goods across borders."
"The entire issue of trade facilitation is currently under negotiation and, of all the Singapore issues, this was probably the most important one to the SMEs."
"I am therefore pleased that our schedule and Mr Rübig’s priorities have managed to coincide at this point."
"This was not the case, once again, for investment, competition and public procurement transparency, but what was most important for SMEs, and therefore for textiles – leaving aside tariff negotiation of technical barriers – was trade facilitation and, in this regard, your wishes have been granted."
"– Question No 32 by Mr Brian Crowley, which has been taken over by Mr Seán Ó Neachtain (H-0221/04)."
"In May this year the European Commission played an active role in the major conference organised by the Irish Presidency on 'Families, Change and Social Policy in Europe.'"
"Taking into account the various contributions made during the conference, what priorities does the Commission now intend to pursue to place the family at the heart of Europe’s social agenda, including the Lisbon agenda?"
". I would like to thank the honourable Member for raising the issue of the family in the context of the social agenda."
"One of the conclusions of the Irish Presidency Conference held in Dublin in May 2004 was that family and family life remain among the top sources of individual well-being."
"Therefore, they contribute to the social capital, although the Treaty does not provide legal competence to pursue family policy as such."
"However, given that the issue of family cuts across many different policy areas in which the Commission is active, it has already contributed to an evaluation of the interactions between various employment and social policies and the changing nature of families."
"These interactions are already having an impact on European Union policies and will continue to do so in the future."
"For example, the objectives underpinning the Union's social inclusion process, the open method of coordination on poverty and social exclusion, stress the need to ensure access to housing, healthcare and education for all and to develop policies designed to preserve family solidarity."
"The elimination of poverty amongst children is also emphasised."
"In this context, it is noteworthy that child and family poverty has gained increased prominence within the social inclusion process in recent times."
"For instance, one of the six key priorities agreed by the Commission and the Member States in the 2004 Joint Report on Social Inclusion is to develop a focus on eliminating poverty and social exclusion amongst children."
"Also, in the recent Commission Staff Working Paper on Social Inclusion in the New Member States, one of the key social inclusion challenges identified is to strengthen policies to support families and social networks, and to protect the rights of children."
"Another important policy area in which the Commission gives prominence to the family is in its emphasis on developing family-friendly policies in such areas as employment and childcare."
"More specifically, the European employment strategy, in line with the Presidency Conclusions of the European Council in Barcelona, addresses the problem of reconciling work and family life and provides quantitative objectives for increasing the availability of child-care provision."
"As to the future, the Commission envisages that the family will continue to be an issue of concern in the European employment strategy and in the Union's social inclusion process and thus for the further development of the Union's social policy agenda."
"– I should like to thank the Commissioner for his reply. It is encouraging."
"One of the key issues for the future in the debate on employment is how to balance work and family life."
"What issues has the Commission identified in this important debate and how does it intend to promote discussion on them in the future?"
"Indeed, how does it link this to the Lisbon agenda?"
". Reconciling work and family life is one of the main concerns of social policy."
"Most of our legislative measures or our policies attempt to achieve this."
"As an example, we are shortly to have a revision of the working time directive, the provisions of which are designed to ensure reconciliation between family life and work."
"Flexible working hours is another instance of such a policy."
"We are working hard on this and I hope that we will have a more detailed policy in the coming months."
"Article 11 of Presidential Decree 164/19.07.04, bringing Greek legislation into line with Directive 1999/70/EC(1), stipulates that workers wishing to convert to open-ended contracts must have completed 24 months of previous service, have had their contracts renewed at least once and have an 'active contract' on 19 July 2004 (date of publication) or three months prior to that date."
"This provision is in breach of Directive 1999/70/EC in that it applies only to those workers who complete the requisite period of previous employment midway through 2004."
"Both the extension of the deadline granted to Greece for transposition and the two-year delay in incorporating the directive into national law are, therefore, detrimental to workers' interests."
"In a letter dated 13 February 2004, the Commission itself questioned the measures taken by the Greek Government to 'avoid abuse arising from the use of fixed-term contracts during the intervening period between the expiry of the deadline for transposition into national law and the entry into force of the Presidential Decree (81/2003)."
"Will the Commission therefore say what measures it will take to eliminate the stipulated condition of an 'active contract', which is contrary to Directive 1999/70/EC?"
"– Commissioner, if we assume that Greece, our common homeland, had applied the Community directive which we are discussing on time, even after the extension which it was granted in 2002, thousands of people would have ensured their contracts were converted to open-ended contracts under the provisions of the presidential decree to which you refer."
"My question is this: Why should thousands of workers exposed to abuse by employers, be they public- or private-sector employers, pay for this two-year delay by the Greek authorities?"
". Of course, the question is more an internal question relating to Greece and its various governments and departments but, as Mr Papadimoulis has specifically touched on a provision relating to the question of active contracts, because that is the meaning of the previous phrase, I should like to say that, first, this specific provision in the presidential decree – and I am talking about now, I am not referring to what happened in 2002 – does not infringe the directive, given that no obligation to convert contracts to open-ended contracts derives from it."
"The conversion terms for which provision is made in the presidential decree come within the jurisdiction of the Greek Government and any disputes which arise from the application of these terms may be resolved before the Greek courts."
"The term whereby there must be an active contract for these people to whom you refer, and who were not recruited during the period in which the directive had not been transposed into Greek law, relates to the mechanism for converting contracts to open-ended contracts. The Commission does not therefore have jurisdiction to take measures to abolish this term, in that no such obligation to convert contracts derives from the directive."
"As Mr Papadimoulis correctly observed, the Commission raised questions in the past concerning the measures taken by the Greek Government in order to prevent abuse from the use of fixed-term contracts during the delay in transposing the directive into national law."
"The question to the Commission concerned the previous presidential decree which, on the one hand, was late in transposing the directive and, on the other hand, transposed it incorrectly."
"Had this situation not been corrected in the meantime under the new presidential decree, the Commission would in theory have been able to institute the proceedings for which provision is made in articles 226 and 228, the purpose of which is to proclaim that the Member State has failed to fulfil its obligations under the Treaty and to force it to comply."
"In addition, as Mr Papadimoulis referred to civil rights, the Commission could in fact take action against the Member State in the event of damage caused by late and incorrect transposition of a directive. The relevant case law exists for such action."
"In this way, citizens are protected from damage which they might sustain as a result of culpable and illegal delay in the transposition of a directive by a Member State, in which case the national courts have jurisdiction and may rule on compensation provided that, first, the Member State has engaged in illegal, infringing conduct, such as the delayed or incorrect transposition of a directive into national law and, secondly, there is a link of cause and effect between the Member State's conduct and the damage sustained."
"As far as the case under discussion is concerned, given that the new presidential decree does not appear to contradict the directive and, subject to completion of the Commission's process of examination, there are no measures which could be taken against Greece."
"What steps will the Commission take to ensure that Member States implement fully the EU Race Equality and Employment Anti-discrimination Directives?"
". The deadline for the transposition of Council Directive 2000/43/EC implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin was 19 July 2003, and the deadline for Council Directive 2000/78/EC establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation was December 2003 with the possibility of an additional three years to transpose the provisions on age and disability discrimination."
"For the new Member States, the deadline for the transposition of both directives was 1 May 2004."
"In its role as guardian of the Treaties, the Commission has launched infringement proceedings against Member States which have failed to transpose the race discrimination and employment framework directives into national law by the abovementioned deadlines."
"Five Member States have been referred to the European Court of Justice for their failure to transpose the racial equality directive into national law."
"For those Member States which have already transposed the directives, the Commission is currently examining in detail the national legislation to check that it accurately reflects the requirements of the directives."
"Should this not be the case, the Commission will take the appropriate measures."
"I want to commend the Commissioner and his predecessor for the seriousness with which they have taken enforcement action on these directives."
"However, given the sheer number of European citizens affected by these directives concerning age, disability, race, sexual orientation and religion - this is not about minorities - does he find it surprising that there is such a contrast between the speed with which the Commission and this Parliament pushed through this legislation and the way that the Council and six Member States in particular have treated these directives in their failure to implement them?"
". There are five Member States which have either transposed only certain parts of the directives or have failed to transpose them in full conformity."
"For these Member States, as I said earlier, the Commission was quick to initiate infringement procedures."
"In the case of the employment framework directive, a reasoned opinion - which is the second phase of the infringement procedure - was sent in July 2004 and we are expecting an answer within two months."
"If no reply is forthcoming, the matter will be immediately referred to the European Court of Justice."
"We will use all the enforcement measures at our disposal in order to persuade these Member States to move ahead with these very important directives."
"As the time allotted to Question Time has elapsed, Questions Nos 35 to 58 will be replied to in writing."
"The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the humanitarian situation in Sudan."
". Mr President, honourable Members of Parliament, let me start by saying that the situation in Sudan continues to be a matter of grave concern for the international community."
"Reports on atrocities indicate the Government of Sudan's inability – and possibly unwillingness – to take the required measures."
"The world is gradually losing its patience with a government that appears reluctant to assume full responsibility for all its citizens."
"This applies to Darfur as well as to the North-South process."
"The EU remains firmly committed to assisting Sudan to return to peace and stability as a matter of urgency."
"Sudan should as soon as possible become a country in which all citizens are free and safe, not dominated by violence and discrimination."
"The government in Khartoum should be a true government for all Sudanese and assume full responsibility for the well-being of all its citizens."
"A stable and democratic Sudan is also a requirement for peace and stability in the region as a whole."
"The continued tensions between Ethiopia and Eritrea, the problems in Somalia, the war in northern Uganda and further afield, and the ongoing crisis in the Great Lakes area are all indications of instability on the African continent."
"Peace in Sudan would create promising prospects for peace in the wider region."
"The EU should be ready to support and engage in the Darfur conflict."
"In this respect, we welcome the active role of the African Union in the Sudan crisis."
"As much as is possible and realistic, the ownership of the solution to the Darfur crisis should rest with Africa itself."
"Therefore, the EU's support and engagement should, in the first instance, be through coordinating its policies with the African Union."
"Furthermore, the European Union should align and coordinate with other important players, such as the United Nations, the United States and other international parties, including the Arab League."
"Against this background, the EU's policy on Sudan is focused as follows. First of all, support to the African Union mission in Darfur."
"Second, support for the mission of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Pronk."
"Third, pressure on the government and the SPLM to conclude the Naivasha peace process."
"Fourth, pressure on the Government and the SLM and the JEM to conclude the Abuja peace process."
"Fifth, coordinating policies and actions with the other international actors."
"Sixth, provision of humanitarian assistance."
"Finally, active consideration of further measures to increase the pressure on the parties, including sanctions."
"Support for the African Union constitutes a simple element to the EU's Darfur policy."
"The Dafur crisis has shown that the African Union is prepared to provide leadership in meeting Africa's challenges."
"The EU is fully behind the African Union."
"A strong and able African Union is crucial for Africa's future."
"This applies in particular to conflict prevention, management and a solution of the Darfur issue."
"The African Union has taken two major initiatives."
"First of all, it has fielded the ceasefire commission which is monitoring the N'Djamena agreement and developments in Darfur and second, it has initiated negotiations between the Government of Sudan and the rebel movements."
"The AU mission is currently staffed by 125 monitors, including monitors from the EU and the United States, and has completed approximately 20 investigations into ceasefire violations."
"The AU monitoring staff is supported by a protection force of 305, made up of Rwandan and Nigerian troops."
"At the request of the African Union, the United Nations has prepared a comprehensive plan on how best to enhance the effectiveness of the AU mission on the ground."
"The plan envisages an enlarged AU mission to Darfur, with increased numbers of military observers, increased military personnel in the protection force, in the civilian police and civilian support staff."
"More staff will also be deployed at the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa."
"Depending on how these plans are further elaborated, the EU will consider supporting an enhanced AU mission in Darfur."
"In Abuja, the Government of Sudan and the rebels have agreed on a humanitarian protocol and a new round of discussions on the security protocol is also envisaged."
"The European Union has been represented during the first round of negotiations and urges both the government and the rebels to resume the talks with great urgency."
"Together with the African Union, the United Nations is an important player in resolving the crisis in Darfur."
"Secretary-General Annan visited Sudan in July."
"He reached an agreement with the Government of Sudan on a series of benchmarks laid down in the communiqué of 3 July."
"These benchmarks serve as a basis for the work of the Joint Implementation Mechanism, which is co-chaired by Special Representative Jan Pronk and the Sudanese Foreign Minister Ismail."
"On 6 August, Mr Pronk reached an agreement with the Sudanese Government on a plan of action."
"The EU supports the action plan but sees Resolution 1556 as the main framework to maintain pressure on the Government of Sudan."
"I believe that the message to the Sudanese authorities should be consistent and straightforward. The more so since in his report to the Security Council of 2 September, Special Representative Pronk acknowledged progress in safety in camps and in humanitarian access, but stressed that the situation in Darfur continues to be very serious."
"Recent evidence of continued killings of villagers in Darfur in attacks by armed forces and the Janjaweed illustrates how serious the situation remains."
"Since the presentation by Mr Pronk to the Security Council on 2 September, there have been ongoing discussions on a new Security Council resolution."
"The European Union is in favour of a strong resolution to maintain pressure on the parties in the Sudan."
"At the meeting of the General Affairs Council on Monday, we discussed preliminary options for sanctions."
"For the moment, the threat of sanctions is probably the best means to press the Government of Sudan to comply with its commitments."
"The United States supports this line also."
"In a public hearing in the Senate, Secretary of State Powell announced support for the expansion of the AU mission and for the idea of curbing Sudanese military flights over Darfur, and raised the possibility of introducing sanctions."
"At the same time, he urged the Government of Sudan and the SPLM, as well as the SLM and the JEM, to intensify efforts to conclude negotiations."
"This coincides with the EU point of view, as stated in our conclusions last Monday."
"Finally, a word on humanitarian assistance and the way forward."
"While access for humanitarian assistance has improved, the humanitarian situation is still critical."
"Violence may have decreased but the notorious Janjaweed and militia remain active."
"The security situation is absolutely unsatisfactory and an important indicator for this is that hardly any of the IDPs and refugees are returning to their homes."
"We once more urgently call on the Government of Sudan to curb the violence, disarm and bring the Janjaweed to justice, and guarantee the safety of civilians outside the camps."
"The EU is an important contributor to humanitarian assistance and so far has provided EUR 288 million."
"Much more is needed and, as Special Representative Pronk indicated in his report, only 50% of the funding requirements of the United Nations response to the Darfur crisis has been met, leaving a funding shortfall of USD 255 million for the Darfur crisis alone."
"The EU should also make a major contribution to this shortfall."
"In the meantime, we should prepare for reconstruction in Darfur to be started as soon as the crisis has ended and a comprehensive peace agreement has been signed between North and South."
"Finally, the way forward."
"The international community should continue to press for an early political solution to the conflicts that are destroying Sudan."
"Pressure on the parties to continue both the Naivasha and Abuja processes, support for the AU and the United Nations, humanitarian assistance and the preparedness to apply further measures, including sanctions, are key elements in the EU policy on Sudan."
"The EU is committed to helping to bring peace and stability to Sudan."
"The EU works shoulder-to-shoulder with the African Union and the United Nations, but will take its own responsibility based on the Council's conclusions of 12 and 26 July, and of 13 September."
"Peace in the Sudan is of enormous national significance but it will also have a crucial influence on peace in the region, as I have said."
"Peace in the Sudan is therefore a central objective of our African policy."
". Mr President, I am grateful for the opportunity to address the crisis which has developed in Darfur and for the interest shown by Parliament and the Committee on Development in making this its first mission of this new parliamentary term."
"The mission has returned with a clear picture of a complex situation and has expressed indignation at the terrible events which continue to unfold in Darfur."
"The Commission had been actively engaged in delivering humanitarian aid to the western part of Sudan before this crisis became what it has."
"Things are so terrible now that we have mobilised to date EUR 105 m."
"This has mostly been spent on basic humanitarian food aid, but we are also trying to support the political process."
"This amount corresponds to some 37% of what the EU as a whole has contributed."
"Normally, the Commission's share of support in these humanitarian crises is about 20% of what Member States give in total."
"I would add here that we see quite a spread when we compare what different Member States have contributed."
"I mention this because I find the qualitative value of what the EU as a whole is doing in a given situation is related not only to what the Commission is doing or the total amount of what we do, but also to the genuine character of commitment across Europe as a whole in support of our activity."
"We are also directing money and effort to the situation in Chad, by providing shelter for an estimated 200 000 refuges from Darfur."
"In mobilising aid we have been facing persistent administrative blockages from the Government of Sudan and major logistical problems resulting in substantial additional costs."
"More than 25% of the costs of this operation relates to the logistical problems."
"The administrative problems are progressively being solved, in my view thanks to a large extent to the international community's pressure on the Sudanese Government."
"As to logistics, ECHO is opening a technical antenna in Darfur and another in Chad to improve coordination in the field."
"They will be operational by the end of this month and we are planning for an initial period of 12 months."
"However, there is still a lot more to do."
"It is estimated that about 40% of the affected population still has no access to humanitarian aid and, in spite of improvement in some areas, violence, including systematic rape of women, is still being reported."
"I am aware that the mission has returned with accounts of terrible violence and great fear."
"It is important for the international community to remain mobilised, as the humanitarian needs will continue for another year, even in the best-case scenario."
"As we have seen, the effects of these crises continue to be felt and we must organise ourselves to handle them better in future."
"In parallel to humanitarian aid, the EU has been very active in the political sphere."
"We have mobilised for the first time the EDF-funded African Peace Facility, providing the bigger part of the budget of the mission of the African Union."
"This has allowed a rapid response from the African Union Peace and Security Council via a decision taken at its first official meeting and following the humanitarian ceasefire agreement in N'Djamena."
"It has sent some 150 observers and a 300 strong military protection force to monitor the ceasefire."
"In spite of the limited scale of this operation, results in the field have been positive."
"I firmly believe that only an African Union initiative will have the political weight and relevance to oblige the belligerents, and in particular the Government of Sudan, to comply with their commitments."
"This does not mean that others should not and cannot play a very important role."
"Partnership and ownership are not incompatible, especially when the partnership is carried out in a professional manner, reflecting the sound principle that visibility is fine but feasibility is better."
"It is clear that some of the existing weakness of the organisation experienced by the African Union could, and should, be addressed by an enhanced partnership with the United Nations and with the EU as such, including our Member States."
"However, I appreciate, as the presidency has also today clearly stated, that the African Union has to be in the driving seat."
"They have to initiate and drive this mission."
"In this respect the Commission is ready, in liaison with the Member States and if the AU so requests to envisage additional support through the peace facility to a well-planned extension of the AU mission in Darfur."
"The most urgent objective is clearly to ensure maximum protection for the civilian population."
"The whole problem of whether or not to return, and what to return to, essentially depends on people's feeling of security in that situation."
"We have to be ready to discus with the parties in appropriate fora a possible amendment of the current mandate of the AU mission, if the Government of Sudan is unwilling or unable to effectively protect the population of Darfur."
"This is a must."
"It is also important to note that we are facing a real conflict."
"There is more to this than some disorganised violence."
"There is not only the problem concerning the Government of Sudan, there are rebel groups fighting for their agendas they do exist."
"For that reason, all this has to be dealt with through a serious effort to mediate, putting pressure on all the parties."
"It is also important to emphasise that a sustainable political solution for Darfur necessarily has to be articulated and worked out in parallel with and in relation to the global Naivasha process."
"A solution for Darfur alone will not solve the wider problem."
"In fact the problem in Darfur did not come out of the blue, it was a result of the problems in Sudan."
"A measure of political agreement has been reached in Abuja and that is a good start, but we have to support all forces working to push this in the right direction and at the same time focus on the enormous task of improving the humanitarian situation in the field."
"Mr President, I was a member of a fact-finding mission of the European Parliament to Darfur."
"My conclusions are as follows: the security situation there is alarming; the political situation has not changed; the Sudanese Government is not willing to take any steps beyond those forced upon it by international political will; the humanitarian situation has improved only slightly."
"I am very sorry to state here that only a very short time after 9/11 we have tens of thousands of very poor people living in camps."
"There is no future for them, nor any way back."
"Fifty per cent of the population in the camps is under 15 years of age, so we are creating a new generation of deprived people who can only take up Kalashnikovs and become new fundamentalists and new extremists."
"We have to be very precise in the measures that we take to ensure our individual and common security."
"What are the points to be discussed?"
"The first is the ethnic context."
"We have seen that there are no Arabs in the camps."
"Ninety per cent of those to whom we have spoken do not have Arabic as their mother tongue."
"In Arabic they are called ‘Suda’, the black population."
"There is massive sexual violence."
"One sheikh told us that they have to send women out of the camps for food and water because they at least come back, whereas if they send men, they are killed."
"There is mass killing and a mass expulsion of the population from its camps."
"This should be stopped immediately."
"The situation is even more alarming in security terms than in humanitarian terms."
"With regard to humanitarian aid, it reaches up to 60% of IDPs in the camps."
"The situation has improved because the Sudanese Government allows NGOs and certain humanitarian organisations to reach the territories under its control."
"Mr President, I would like to say at the very outset that everything I saw in Darfur confirmed the view that what we are seeing there is a genocide."
"The evidence and the testimonies that we took from the people we spoke to all referred to collaboration between the Janjaweed and the Government of Sudan."
"What the people talked about was coordinated violence against them."
"It was not random violence, it was coordinated by the Janjaweed with the assistance and collusion of the Government of Sudan."
"We heard of decapitation, burning, brutality, terror and awful suffering from the people that we spoke to."
"It was only in 1994, when I was in Rwanda, that I ever saw the degree of terror in people's eyes that I saw in those camps in Darfur and in Chad."
"We need to see an effective global arms embargo, an international commission of inquiry; we need targeted sanctions against those, both in government and business, who have been connected with these atrocities and I believe that there should be an oil embargo."
"320 000 barrels of oil are produced each day but the benefits of those barrels of oil never reach the people of Sudan."
"To both the Commission and the Council I would say that in Al Fasha the African Union expressed no enthusiasm for an increased protection force."
"They had little coordination with the United Nations or discussion on the plan of action."
"They called for more monitors and for an international policing and human rights monitoring force."
"They said they were not able to deal with the current challenges they faced, never mind having to deal with a substantially increased force."
"They were very clear and very adamant on that."
"To both the Commission and Council I would also say that the plan of action agreed by the UN is leading to the Government of Sudan now deploying forces towards the safe areas, into the rebel areas, and causing immense instability and difficulty."
"They are contravening the no-fly zone."
"When we landed in Al Fasha, an attack helicopter was hovering overhead."
"On our visit to one village, we saw the rockets that had been fired at the people, destroying the village and sending the people scattering into the bush."
"We want to hear no more of 'never again' from anyone in the international community."
"We have to challenge the Government of Sudan and stop its relentless Orwellian denial of what is happening in its country."
"The pattern of violence must stop."
"Mr President, I was a member of last week's delegation to Darfur and I want to focus on the humanitarian situation there."
"As a result of brutal attacks by the government of Sudan and its allied militia, a quarter of the population of Darfur had fled their homes in terror."
"Two hundred thousand had crossed over the border into Chad and 1 200 000 are internally displaced within Sudan."
"Humanitarian access has improved as the Council stated but we were told that one in three is still cut off from assistance because of the rains and the lack of capacity, and because of ongoing clashes between government and rebel forces."
"This adds up to a situation of enormous fragility."
"All displaced persons need access to humanitarian aid and they will need it for at least another 18 months because they have not been able to grow crops this year."
"The worst possible scenario would be for humanitarian assistance to be cut off by renewed fighting or political obstacles."
"That would leave 1.2 million people facing starvation."
"When the delegation visited Darfur, all the people we spoke to in the camps told us the same thing: they wished to return to their homes but they were terrified of further attacks."
"There will be no end to the humanitarian crisis in Darfur until people feel safe to return home."
"That will only happen if there are no more violations of the ceasefire, and if there is a comprehensive political solution to the conflict."
"I should like to make a plea that in our discussions we do not get too bogged down on issues such as whether this is or is not genocide in Darfur."
"Let us concentrate on the actions that this Parliament can take to support the African Union ceasefire monitors and the peace negotiations."
"If we fail to be practical in this crisis, then we will let down more than one million Sudanese people who are dependent upon us for their survival."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we naturally share Parliament’s stated desire to come to the aid of the civilian communities of Darfur and to put an end to a civil war that has been appalling from both a humanitarian as well as a political perspective, and to do so, as has already been mentioned, with the support, for example, of the African Union’s initiatives. While it is useful and essential, however, to be a good fire-fighter, I feel that it is even more essential for us not to lapse into starting fires of our own."
"I should therefore like to address the subject of access to oil resources, which is becoming increasingly difficult and beset by conflict. It is an issue that has, to terrible effect, been fanning the flames of the situation in Darfur for a number of years."
"It is a familiar scenario: tensions and wars intensify as access to oil resources becomes a source of conflict and a major issue both for a number of international powers and for the local powers."
"Not only are the USA and Europe – particularly France, which has a major influence in the region – implicated in this situation, but so are China and a number of Asian countries."
"We are also all aware of the scandal of the misuse of oil revenue, which often serves only to fuel the personal enrichment, corruption and arms purchases that we see today, not to mention the worsening breaches of the human rights of the communities affected, all of this against a backdrop of successive dictatorships that are, in turn, sometimes supported more or less openly by the same people who are today expressing outrage at the situation."
"Faced with this situation, I feel that the EU has major responsibilities and is duty bound, at world level and thus within the UN, to launch an entirely different energy policy, one that is fair, sustainable and genuinely intended to serve the citizens, and to do so with the help of politicians, oil companies and civil society."
"We must also step up the fight against financial crime and against tax havens; we must block the financial accounts and the profits of dictators and profiteers of all kinds."
"We must, of course, offer our solid support for alternative energy policies both at home and in countries such as these, and Europe must also be much more demanding and much more vigilant as regards the support offered by the major providers of international funds to certain oil projects, such as the Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline."
"We must support civil society and the democrats in these countries and, in short, must be able to act diplomatically, politically and economically in a coherent fashion."
"I feel that this could constitute an essential and even priority task for the future representative of a strong common foreign policy – a policy that we all wish very much to see."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the displaced persons camps in Sudan and the refugee camps in Chad our parliamentary delegation came across an extraordinary, woeful section of humanity: civilians, women, children, men, the new damned of the earth, fleeing from violence and death and living in fear of being attacked and of having to flee yet again."
"They want to go back to their villages, hundreds of which have been destroyed, but they want to go back in safety."
"They are therefore asking the international community for a greater presence."
"They do not trust the Sudanese Government and are calling for justice to be done and for the crimes against them not to go unpunished."
"We are facing an immense tragedy – a million displaced persons, 200 000 refugees, 30 000 dead – faced with which the international community intervened very late in calling for a cease-fire and the opening of peace negotiations."
"In the camps we visited we did not see anyone dying of starvation."
"Emergency aid has arrived except in the rebel-held areas, which the humanitarian aid convoys cannot reach because of the rains, which is why there is no complete check on the conditions there."
"Even in the areas that the war has not touched, however, we saw immense poverty."
"Many Sudanese or Chadian citizens are registering as displaced persons or refugees in order to get food and medical care."
"Indeed, the Darfur democratic opposition groups that we met, whether they were African or Afro-Arab communities, agreed that the armed conflict begun by the SLA or JEM forces was rooted in underdevelopment and a policy aimed at marginalising the region, specifically the African communities."
"The danger that violence might break out again is always present."
"If the causes are not removed, it may not just be Darfur that explodes."
"I therefore think it is essential for the European Union to push for positive results from the Abuja negotiations."
"We must put pressure on the Sudanese Government and the SLA or JEM forces to observe the cease-fire and, as you yourself said, we must cooperate especially in strengthening the presence of African Union forces and human rights observers. We must also help those parts of civil society that uphold human and social rights to put across their message more strongly."
"I also believe it is vital to take the Naivasha agreements forward and to support them."
"As many people in Sudan told us, the only possible solution is a political one; it cannot be by military means."
"That is why I believe a strict arms embargo needs to be imposed on Sudan not only by the European Union but also by the United Nations, just as strong pressure also needs to be put on Eritrea or anyone who sells arms to the rebels."
"These are difficult times, because war and terrorism are destroying our lives."
"I believe we have to act wisely and with determination so that the people of Sudan can move on towards development and justice."
"Ladies and gentlemen, a humanitarian disaster on an almost unimaginable scale is taking place right now in Sudan."
"According to the UN’s international organisation, WHO, approximately 10 000 people are dying every month in the refugee camps in Darfur in Western Sudan."
"Most of these are children."
"The surrounding world is aware of what is happening in Sudan but, in spite of this, is powerless to act faced with this humanitarian tragedy."
"We agree that the surrounding world must act immediately."
"The issue is, however, that of how the conflict is best to be resolved."
"It is important to bear two principles in mind."
"Firstly, that of broad international support and, secondly, that of respect for international law."
"Intervention in Sudan must be based on a UN mandate, affording the greatest possible international support."
"The UN should act in cooperation with the African Union."
"The action would thus have the support of the African countries, which would facilitate a lasting solution."
"One UN organisation that could be used is, for example, the multinational force, SHIRBRIG."
"This intervention force was one of the UN actors in the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea."
"Military intervention by the EU would be in danger of making it more difficult to conduct a successful UN intervention."
"The plans for an EU intervention in the Sudan conflict also give the impression of being a springboard for the creation of an EU army able to act without a UN mandate."
"The EU Constitution makes it possible for the EU to intervene in conflicts without UN support."
"This would be in danger of weakening international law."
"Action within the framework of the UN is the best prior condition for creating broad international support for resolving the conflict."
"In that way, the intervention would also take place within the framework of international law."
"The solution to the conflict would thus be more legitimate and more sustainable."
"Thank you for giving me the floor."
"Mr President, the Sudanese Government has failed to carry out its serious international obligation under UN Security Council Resolution 1556 of last July."
"This is the opinion of many international human rights organisations, including International Watch and the International Committee of the Red Cross."
"It appears that many camps in the western region of Darfur in Sudan are still in control of both the Janjaweed armed militia and the Sudanese Government."
"That is simply an intolerable situation."
"The agencies must be given free and unencumbered access to these camps."
"That is not the case at the moment."
"Many aid agencies are working in very difficult situations."
"This too is the view of members of the Committee on Development who recently travelled to the Darfur region on a fact-finding mission on behalf of the European Parliament."
"We heard this afternoon from many of those who were on that mission."
"I congratulate them for undertaking it and for bringing their reports back."
"I look forward to the next meeting of the committee. I am sure we will hear in more detail about what they heard and saw."
"I believe that one of the best ways forward is to engage more African Union troops to act as peace-keepers in the Darfur region."
"That would also help to ensure that we could put in place an African solution to an African problem."
"Up until now we have not been able to achieve this because there are not enough African Union troops on the ground who could enforce a ceasefire."
"The Sudanese Government has, for the most part, imposed stalling tactics, which has resulted in the small numbers of African Union peace-keepers being denied access to all regions around Darfur."
"The Sudanese Government has said that there are enormous difficulties and that it needs more time; but as one of the earlier speakers said, is the government unable to carry out what we have asked it to do, or is it reluctant?"
"The more one listens to people - whether it is aid agencies or members of our Committee on Development or other groups - who have been out there and have seen first hand what is going on, one has to say that there is a total lack of commitment to do anything about the violence that is happening on the ground."
"I support the strong role that the European Union has played in providing humanitarian aid to the people of Sudan."
"Its value is in excess of EUR 400 million this year."
"The European Union will continue to be the largest donor of international aid to Sudan for some time to come."
"The Sudanese Government must now realise the clear challenge that it faces."
"It must fully meet its international responsibilities and its responsibilities to its own people, or face further international condemnation in the form of sanctions."
"The European Union, together with the United Nations, should seriously consider imposing a global arms embargo on Sudan."
"This would play a constructive role in helping to cut off military supplies to both the Sudanese Government and the Janjaweed armed militia."
"Thank you very much, Mr President. I shall try to make good use of the time."
"I should like to thank the Minister for also coming to the Committee on Foreign Affairs to tell us about the steps about to be taken to help in this situation."
"After listening to all this, I shall anxiously await next week’s Security Council decision and the decision of the UN plenary session with respect to this situation, so that the European Union will then also be able to make its own independent decisions as regards its own further measures."
"I believe that the horrors of which we have heard cannot be resolved by simply increasing the aid resources allocated to these people in order to provide for their basic needs for survival, but that there is a real need to attempt to settle these matters through economic pressure on the government."
"A joint approach by all the organisations which might be able to help here involves treaties with the African Union or the UN and also with the United States."
"I shall keep my fingers crossed that a decision will be taken as soon as possible on behalf of these unfortunate people."
"Mr President, in Darfur genocide has unfolded before our eyes."
"It demands immediate action."
"It is the world's largest current humanitarian crisis."
"It has led to the displacement of 1.4 million people inside Sudan, over 200 000 people into neighbouring Chad and the number of civilian deaths has risen to almost 50 000."
"The government in Khartoum has armed the militia group, the Janjaweed, to attack the non-Arab-speaking civilian population and supported them with rocket attacks by helicopter, Antonov and MiG planes."
"The bombardment of villagers and systematic rape have terrorised the population and caused a serious humanitarian crisis which will escalate with the arrival of the rainy season."
"The international community has accepted that genocide is now being committed and this brings into place a whole new series of legislative measures for us, including activating the United Nations Security Council to authorise the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court to Sudan to arrest and punish the perpetrators of these terrible war crimes, whether or not Sudan fails to exercise its sovereign jurisdiction or sign the Rome Statute."
"Despite humanitarian aid, refugee camps are currently witnessing around 100 000 deaths per month due to dysentery and the atmosphere of insecurity."
"The crisis could lead to a further genocide."
"We must show that this is not Rwanda, that we now know how to react to this type of crisis in order to save human lives as we demonstrated in Congo."
"Every day the situation worsens."
"For this reason, we must pressurise the Sudanese Government to honour its commitment made on 3 July to enable the flow of humanitarian aid."
"Khartoum also needs to accept the deployment of international observers from the African Union and the European Union."
"The cease-fire agreement should be respected."
"Military aircraft should be grounded in Darfur and the disarmament process of the militia speeded up."
"The UN should impose a global arms embargo on Sudan."
"The government, Chad, Libya and the Central African Republic should rigidly control the trade in small arms in the region and the African Union should establish an international police force."
"We must finally act to put an end to this situation."
"Mr President, the Darfur humanitarian crisis has political origins. The people of Darfur have been involved in an uprising, not for separatist claims, but against the under-development and political and economic marginalisation to which they have been subjected by Khartoum, which has been fomenting inter-ethnic conflict since the 1980s."
"We are not dealing with a government that is reluctant to carry out its responsibilities, but with a dictatorial government that spends over half of the State budget on ‘Migs’ and other military supplies, and does not invest the profits from oil in helping the Sudanese people."
"It is a regime that is accustomed to living with sanctions, adept at exploiting the rivalries within the international community and capable of mobilising countries to which it sells oil or from which it purchases arms, such as China and Pakistan, under the protection of the Security Council."
"It is a government that realises that there is no political will, when permanent members of the Security Council use words like genocide to describe what is happening in Darfur and do not act immediately with adequate resources to stop it with anything more than words."
"The Sudanese Government is therefore only partly meeting its obligations under Resolution 1556, but has not met the key obligation, which is to put an end to the war that it is waging on its people in Darfur."
"The African Union is undertaking a mission that is worthy of the European Union’s praise and support."
"More must be done as regards logistical and military capability; more needs to be done to assist coordination between the African Union and the United Nations; more needs to be done in terms of the rapid support provided to the humanitarian organisations and to the humanitarian agencies on the ground."
"It is essential that we increase the international presence on the ground, with both African Union ceasefire monitors and peace-keeping forces, and the humanitarian agencies, human rights monitors and an international police force. There must also be a clear mandate from the Security Council to protect the civil population at risk."
"This is what all of the refugees and displaced persons with whom Parliament’s mission spoke asked us to do."
"EU governments both inside and outside the Security Council have a particular responsibility to deliver a coherent message to the Sudanese Government, which, at its core, is weak, ridden with rivalries, dictatorial and corrupt."
"If Parliament and European governments think that the situation ‘amounts to genocide’, then the very least that they can do is recommend an arms embargo and an oil embargo."
"This is the only language that the Sudanese Government understands."
"The EU and the entire international community must demand that the ceasefire be enforced and must demand that the present agreement be extended to all regions."
"– Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are reacting to a crisis that was sparked off and exploded in March 2003."
"We are in September 2004, and this delayed reaction is not due to the fact that we did not know."
"Let us just think of how few doors we have knocked on in all these months."
"We have reacted late because of a political calculation that proved to be wrong, which was to focus everything on the Naivasha process, and therefore Khartoum thought it had to intervene elsewhere."
"I am merely trying to draw attention to the fact that major tensions are exploding in eastern Sudan, and I should not like us to react in a year’s time once it has turned into an inextricable crisis."
"It is a complex problem which, in my opinion, should be tackled as a whole."
"In conclusion, with regard to security, there is the problem of a real atmosphere of impunity."
"I should like to remind the Presidency and the Commission of the existence of an instrument, namely the International Criminal Court and in particular Article 7 of the Statute, on the basis of which the Security Council can ask the Prosecutor to initiate an investigation."
"I mention this because, alongside the Commission on Human Rights, this is an instrument on which Europe has worked so hard that I believe it can and must be brought into play in this particular crisis."
"Mr President, we have in fact known about the tension in Sudan for many years, not just one year."
"Once again we are witnessing a humanitarian drama which, in truth, disguises a political drama."
"It is this drama which must be dealt with: a humanitarian emergency, which could be even worse, is yet to come."
"According to the calculations of many NGOs, between 100 000 and 350 000 people may die as a result of a generalised famine."
"We must therefore take quick measures and I am therefore also happy that both the Council and the Commission are taking measures in this regard."
"We must continue with humanitarian aid, we must put pressure on the government of Khartoum to disarm the militias and if this means sanctions are needed, they must be imposed."
"The number of international observers must also be increased, and they must specifically be African."
"I would like to draw attention to the importance of emphasising the need to deal with the causes, of political origin, which relate to the poverty of the country, which relate to having allowed the authoritarian regime in Khartoum to exist for many years and which furthermore have allowed, amongst other things, while we remained silent, European countries such as the United Kingdom, Spain and Cyprus to export arms to that country, violating the code of conduct on arms, and we must therefore meet the need to review this process and once again demand that the United Nations enforce a complete embargo in relation to this issue."
"Mr President, the President of the United States has described the violence in Sudan as genocide and he is undoubtedly not far from the truth."
"The number of people killed in and around Darfur is currently estimated at 50 000, and more than a million people are on the run."
"The Arab militiamen who are responsible for these atrocities are given free play by the Islamic Government, which has a crushing responsibility for the events that are now unfolding."
"According to Mr Pronk, the UN special envoy in Sudan, the Sudanese Government is cooperating in good faith, but, and I quote ‘the agreements on the ground are not yet applied in Darfur’."
"The question is what should actually happen in order for there to be clear condemnation of the Islamic regime in Sudan."
"The Commission is similarly grappling with this politically correct diffidence."
"So far, the Council and the Commission have been extremely reserved, not to mention lukewarm, in their reactions to the events in Sudan."
"It is therefore time that bold sanctions were taken, such as for example an oil embargo, together with all other necessary measures, in order to put a stop to the violence in Sudan."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a humanitarian disaster of alarming dimensions is taking place before our very eyes in Sudan’s western province of Darfur."
"Although I have not been a member of the committee, and do not have relevant experience in this area, one thing that has become clear to me so far from this debate is that the crisis is following the same pattern as all such crises."
"We react too late and not forcefully or coherently enough."
"This makes it possible for genocide to continue unpunished, and for a government which bears responsibility for this ongoing massacre simply not to take us seriously."
"Even if there could be no question of conflict prevention, it is still essential for damage limitation to take place at least now, and for international pressure to be stepped up by the coordinated action of the EU, the USA, the UN and the OAU, so that a stop is put to this genocide."
"The deployment of more African Union troops should be made possible, the International Court of Justice should be able to take action, and, above all, I believe that we should not only toy with the idea of sanctions, but come to see them as a genuine alternative."
"This means sanctions of any kind, which will force the Khartoum Government to abandon the cynicism which they show in their dealings with us."
"Mr President, 50 000 have been killed in the last 18 months, there are a million refugees and the Government in Sudan, a dictatorship dating back to 1989, is still in government."
"A government which nods diplomatically in agreement with the international community and politely listens to its requests, but meanwhile accepts the Janjaweed militiamen in its own army, while the killing and raping continues as before."
"It is apparent that this government is prepared to conclude real peace agreements only if there is a real threat, and the willingness to realise this threat is being illustrated."
"In southern Sudan, we saw that the oil boycott threat worked with this government."
"Last week in the European Parliament, Mrs Van Ardenne stated that she considers the oil boycott as one of the measures to put the government under pressure."
"In the Security Council, Europe, together with the African Union and the United States, must continually and unanimously press home that either the Sudanese Government must observe the agreements with Kofi Annan or else that a specific oil boycott will be introduced which is irrevocably proclaimed via the Security Council."
"The question that many are left with is: will these remain just words, and does the Sudanese Government meanwhile have little to fear, or are we prepared to actually see this matter through via the Security Council?"
"I truly hope that there is strength in unity in this respect."
"Mr President, almost undoubtedly the Darfur humanitarian crisis is the worst in the world today, with approximately 1.4 million people displaced, many to camps in Chad, and an estimated 50 000 killed, and, according to WHO estimates, 10 000 dying monthly from disease and violence."
"The USA is now accusing the Khartoum Government of genocide by its proxy Janjaweed Arab militiamen against African local tribes, who rose up in February 2003 against the government."
"The government is said to be dominated by only two ethnic Arab tribes, who have excluded the Sudanese Africans from power and the sharing of Sudan's oil wealth."
"This a complex dispute, with the Justice and Equality Movement through its 'Black Book', circulated in Khartoum last year, calling for more democracy but from a radical Islamist perspective."
"The hands of Dr al-Turabi seem to be at work in Darfur, settling scores against President Bashir, responsible for expelling Osama Bin Laden from Sudan in 1996."
"It must also be said that the rebels have been brutal in their attacks on Sudanese Government workers, in particular policemen."
"The UN has now promised a review and Washington is calling for a UN commission of inquiry and for consideration of trade sanctions, including arms and an oil embargo."
"The EU will probably follow suit."
"Understandably, no one in the EU wants direct military intervention, but only supports the continued presence of African Union troops as monitors and possibly as peacekeepers."
"The UN and EU sanctions may be very difficult to enforce in such a vast country as Sudan, especially with the recent large investments in the oil sector by China and India, which would be negatively affected."
"Recent reports of the Janjaweed, who have razed 405 villages to the ground and continue to wreak havoc, including the systematic raping of women, claim they have been disgracefully integrated into Sudan's military."
"Something must be done, as Sudan is just emerging from the long civil war in the south."
"However, with the lessons of Iraq in mind, no western power, to my mind, will contemplate military intervention."
"I call upon the African Union to show the world what it can do."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think the figures and numbers that Mrs Hybašková and Mrs Morgantini have given us need no comment but just deserve our absolute respect."
"I shall be more cautious in seeing the shadow of al-Qaeda behind every conflict that breaks out on this earth."
"I am not particularly interested in President Bush’s definition of genocide or in deciding on a point of law as to whether we are dealing with genocide in this case."
"I am much more interested, as other Members have said, in what we can do and what we must not do."
"What we certainly can do is envisage direct, rigorous sanctions, such as an arms embargo or an appeal to the International Criminal Court, as Mrs Bonino has suggested, in order to seek a political solution."
"Of course, we must at all costs avoid creating the preconditions for a military intervention, even though it would be justified on humanitarian grounds."
"Mr President, we are all aware that the history of recent years, from Bosnia to Iraq, has been that of the arbitrary and often counterproductive use of force to resolve crises."
"That is an option to be avoided, most of all because we would risk turning this region into a never-ending war zone."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I personally am not inclined to use the word genocide too freely."
"Nevertheless, the situation in Sudan is extremely serious and requires a radical change in the European Union’s position."
"It is not enough to provide aid, but the populations need to be able to have access to it in complete safety."
"It would therefore be helpful if Parliament took a harder line in condemning the actions of the Sudanese Government, which is continuing to arm militias with the aim of terrorising the civilian population of Darfur."
"The Sudanese Government is cunningly playing for time in order to gain a unilateral advantage, while also benefiting from the difficult international situation that sees the supranational institutions and the whole of public opinion concentrating on the fight against global terrorism."
"Parliament therefore needs to pass a new resolution, which must include a demand for a total arms embargo as well as selective sanctions that can put pressure on the government and the armed forces without hurting the civilian population."
"From now on the Sudanese Government needs to feel the eyes of the world upon it every day."
". Mr President, the European Union and the Council of Ministers are deeply conscious of the worsening situation."
"We are following the situation very closely and I share your concerns."
"I have listened very carefully to the suggestions you have made and to your calls for action."
"I also agree with those speakers who have stressed the fact that what we need is a political solution, not a military solution."
"Military force would only lead to further bloodshed and we want to avoid that."
"It is in that context that we believe that the African Union, which has taken the lead, should continue to be in the driver's seat."
"At the same time, however, we see how important it is that a cohesive and coherent effort be undertaken so that the African Union, together with the United Nations, the European Union and the United States, exert increasing pressure on the Sudanese Government as we have done from the beginning - notably as the Dutch Government, but also as the European Union over these past months."
"We will also continue to push the African Union to implement the suggestions that have been made by the United Nations."
"I listed a number of possibilities: increase the number of observers, increase the military force supporting these observers, increase the civilian presence, send a police force even a European Union police force, if the African Union asks for one."
"It is very important that we cooperate very closely and that the African Union tries to find an African solution to an African problem."
"We must lend all the support we can muster."
"I believe that we should follow a twin-track approach on the calls for action."
"On the one hand, I share the feelings of all those who have said that continued, strong diplomatic pressure on the government of Sudan is an absolute requirement."
"We have done this and will continue to do so in the context of the meetings we have."
"For example, next week we have a meeting the United Nations."
"I have also met with ministers: at the end of July I invited Minister Ismail to the Netherlands."
"There was a strong exchange of words on the situation."
"Promises were made, but as we have seen they were not kept."
"That is why there should also be another track, and that track, as many of you have said, consists of sanctions."
"The European Union is currently examining all the possibilities for imposing sanctions very carefully, but we think that sanctions should be effective."
"They should really hit the government and they should also be all-encompassing, so, together with the Commission and the Council secretariat, we are drafting a comprehensive review of which sanctions are possible."
"Among those sanctions, we are considering an oil boycott, an arms embargo and many other possibilities to make it crystal clear to the Sudanese Government that we mean business."
"On the other hand as Commissioner Nielson mentioned we should not forget that humanitarian aid is of the essence."
"If one talks to Mr Lubbers or Mr Pronk as I have recently it is very obvious that one aspect is the situation in respect of the Sudanese Government."
"The other aspect pertains to the humanitarian aid situation, which is terrible at the moment."
"There too, the European Union is doing everything it can."
"As far as Mrs Bonino's suggestion on the International Criminal Court is concerned, you will understand that I wholeheartedly agree with this."
"The International Criminal Court with its seat in the Hague is something we endorse whenever we can."
"However, we should not forget that what we need first, in the United Nations, is to discuss the situation on the basis of Mr Pronk's report."
"Subsequently, the United Nations Security Council should make a request, and then we can act to initiate proceedings in the International Criminal Court."
"I can only repeat that we are very concerned about the situation."
"We take everything you have said into account and take it very seriously."
"We are deeply aware of the suffering of the people there and of what has happened."
"Whether you call it genocide or not, the situation is very serious."
"We have to be willing to take action."
"In the meantime, we are waiting for the outcome of the discussions that are to take place shortly in the United Nations."
". Mr President, I would warn against jumping into the terminology of genocide."
"At the moment there is no authoritative evidence that this is the correct way of characterising the events in question."
"This is an impossible discussion because, once the word is there, any attempt to clarify and analyse it is only seen as an attempt to cover what it looks or sounds like, an attempt to make it easy to understand."
"This is very serious: rushing to use certain words, and acting and speaking as if these words are the actual facts, is not the way to clarify to the public that what we see is unacceptable and has to be stopped."
"Taking that step and using certain terminology at this stage can be, in my opinion, problematic."
"We need to establish the facts, and I expect this to happen."
"There is a risk here that myself and others are seen to be taking this matter too lightly."
"Even with that risk, I would like to make the point that in relation to the tradition of impunity in these matters, I find it important that the African Union has been encouraged to do something and is not sitting passively waiting for the government to comply."
"The African Union is totally publicly committed to putting pressure on the government, and at the moment is making an effort to increase its engagement in Darfur, both quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of the mandate."
"This needs to be supported."
"It is a new experience for the so-called international community to be able to relate to and support something like this, which we have never encountered before in an African crisis."
"We need to do more."
"The UN's role is absolutely essential."
"The commitment throughout Africa, via the African Union, to use the newly created Peace and Security Council has created a basis for the UN to act."
"Without this there would have been little grounds for optimism."
"Even that word is perhaps out of place in this instance."
"What can we do to exert maximum pressure?"
"I still have not signed the country strategy paper for Sudan."
"More than EUR 400 million is available via unspent funds – which could not be used for normal development cooperation activities during the many years of fighting between north and south – and new money from the ninth EDF."
"This large amount of money cannot be made available until we see a comprehensive peace agreement."
"It is a political fact of life, which comes as no surprise anywhere not here and not in Khartoum that the situation in Darfur must be seen as part of any definition of peace in the country."
"This pressure is a major element in our effort to push things in a better direction."
"In the coming year we will face not only the demands relating to humanitarian aid, but we will also have to prepare to secure the livelihoods of the people whom we hope to assist in returning to their homes as soon as possible."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"I have received one motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.(1)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at noon. (2)"
"The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission Statements on the seizure of hostages and massacre in Beslan and the fight against terrorism."
". Mr President, last Saturday we commemorated the fact that the world suddenly changed three years ago."
"In this presentation, I would first like to look back and explain the basis for our policy, then address the current situation in the fight against terrorism before going into the work programme of the Dutch presidency."
"I will end with a few words on cooperation with Russia."
"Since 11 September 2001, it has become clear that terrorist attacks are closer to us than we wanted to believe."
"It is a threat that we cannot neglect."
"We have all seen the horrific terrorist attacks on television."
"We are witnesses to these attacks and are also jointly responsible for ensuring that they do not happen again."
"What we have seen, both outside the European Union – in Jakarta, Beslan, Iraq, Afghanistan and the Middle East – and inside the European Union – in Madrid six months ago – requires action now and in the future."
"Every attack poses new questions which require new answers and pose new challenges that we have to address jointly through concrete action."
"We need to protect our citizens better."
"We need to continue to look at our policy instruments in close cooperation with others."
"There are no quick fixes for terrorism."
"In the long battle against terrorism, two key words spring to mind: protection and cooperation, as well as the idea of protection through cooperation."
"On protection, the European Union has done a lot in the last three years."
"We have improved our legislation and widened our policy instruments."
"We have drawn up and implemented new measures to protect borders, aircraft, etc. We have started to put security first, also at international level."
"On cooperation, the terrorist attacks have taught us that internal and external security cannot be separated: they are two sides of the same coin."
"There are two basic reasons for this: firstly, terrorism does not stop at borders and, secondly, terrorism is a global threat: it can happen – and indeed has happened – anywhere in the world."
"True protection can therefore be realised only through international cooperation."
"We also have to look carefully at whether our approach matches those of our partner countries in order to create sufficient possibilities for close cooperation."
"National and international action should be dovetailed for their mutual strengthening."
"Terrorism is an attack not only on our political and economic freedom, but also on our norms and values: liberty, democracy, tolerance and the rule of law, values that we have to defend."
"Terrorism is also not just an attack on western values, it is an attack on universal values which form the foundation for the United Nations."
"The only way to defeat terrorism is to confront it."
"We must therefore be strong and active to fight this many-headed monster."
"There might be a temptation to believe that any measure could be used in this fight."
"But here, we have to be cautious."
"In our common fight, we should uphold the norms and values that terrorism is seeking to destroy."
"Terrorism to a large extent boils down to security, which is the core of our existence."
"A new approach to security has been developed, through various processes, with a view to taking more conclusive action against terrorists and preventing new attacks."
"The UN is at the core."
"UN Security Council Resolution 1373 has forced countries to improve their policies on terrorism, not only in word but also in deed, not only by improving old legislation or by drafting new legislation but also by implementing it."
"The resolution contains measures to combat the financing of terrorism and promotes efforts that should lead to the prevention of terrorism and the punishment of terrorists."
"The counter-terrorism agenda, incorporated in UN Security Council Resolution 1373, should therefore be considered to be the most important global point of reference for action – action that has to be taken by all United Nations Member States."
"Within the European Union, the European Council and the General Affairs Council – as well as other Council formations such as the Justice and Home Affairs Council, the Transport Council and Ecofin – has actively worked, from 9/11 onwards, on setting up, implementing and refining an extensive EU action plan."
"Amongst other things, this involved a European arrest warrant, joint investigation teams, Eurojust and legislation on terrorist financing."
"We have also been active as regards external policy."
"The key issue of security is at the centre of the European Security Strategy, which should contribute to a stronger multilateral system."
"It should address various threats – including terrorism – through active, more coherent internal and external action, with stronger capacities and in close cooperation with our partners."
"We have also decided to include a terrorism clause in new contractual relations with third countries, similar to the human rights clause."
"This will allow us to hold serious consultations with third countries which are not fully observing their international obligations in the fight against terrorism, including with regard to the implementation of Resolution 1373."
"By adopting the carrot-and-stick approach – carrots taking the form of assistance – we use the political and economic power of the European Union in the fight against terrorism."
"I turn now to the presidency programme."
"The work programme of the Netherlands presidency in the field of counter-terrorism is extensive and wide-ranging."
"In addition to a strong focus on implementation of EU measures and legislation, it entails new initiatives in many fields."
"An important tool in this matter is the EU Counter-Terrorism Action Plan."
"It was adopted by the European Council after the horrendous attacks in Madrid last March."
"The presidency works in close cooperation with the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, Mr Gijs de Vries, to implement and complement this action plan."
"Key areas in which we, as presidency, want to take substantial steps forward are Justice and Home Affairs, improvement of cooperation between intelligence services, prevention of terrorist financing and strengthening of the EU's external policies and counter-terrorism."
"On Justice and Home Affairs, we will focus on the implementation of measures like the European arrest warrant."
"We also need to improve the way our intelligence agencies work together."
"Having good information on what terrorists are planning and preparing to do is our first line of defence."
"The EU Action Plan already outlines some of the steps that we intend to take and Mr De Vries is fully engaged in this process."
"We are in the process of strengthening the EU Situation Centre that will be instrumental in pooling analyses on terrorism in Europe."
"We also need to strengthen the role of Europol and make sure it can play its role."
"In the near future, the European Union Justice and Home Affairs Ministers will sit with their US counterparts to see how we can strengthen transatlantic cooperation in the fight against terrorism."
"The prevention of terrorist financing is high on our agenda."
"Even though the EU is at the forefront of the fight against terrorism, we cannot sit back and relax."
"Money is the life-blood of terrorism and we need to reinforce our financial systems to make sure that they are not abused by terrorists."
"The third Money Laundering Directive is a fresh step in this matter."
"We also need to strengthen our policies to freeze assets of terrorists."
"We therefore seek to make the EU Clearing House more effective and to secure better implementation."
"Finally, we will be looking at ways to prevent cash couriers from circumventing banking regulations by taking their money in cash across borders."
"In our external policies we want to make sure that the resources of the Union are being used to their full extent in order to work with other countries in the fight against terrorism."
"As I have already said, terrorism is a phenomenon that does not respect international borders."
"It is our firm belief that we must work with third countries to promote the ratification and implementation of UN counter-terrorism conventions and to use political dialogue and technical assistance to support countries willing to cooperate."
"The EU is already active in Indonesia, the Philippines and Pakistan, where it is implementing specific programmes."
"The EU also operates other programmes in various countries with a view, more generally, to strengthening their judicial systems."
"We feel that the EU should do more and therefore we are talking to a number of key countries to explore how we can enhance our cooperation."
"That brings me to terrorism in Russia."
"Russia is very worried about the threat of terrorism, and rightly so."
"But, more than a mere worry, this is a true problem for Russia, which has suffered three major attacks in little more than a week."
"We must show – and indeed have shown – our sympathy."
"It is clear that the European Union has always systematically condemned all acts of terrorism."
"The Russians deserve all the support we can give them."
"Hence we stand by Russia to assist it in its efforts to fight terrorism."
"In our relations with Russia, we already discuss counter-terrorism on a regular basis."
"We stand ready to increase cooperation on a technical level and to share the counter-terrorism experience that we have gained in the EU."
"We will use the regular dialogues that we have with Russia to discuss how to proceed in this matter."
"We are willing to discuss anti-terrorism strategies and methods with the Russians so that we can learn from each other."
"This cooperation forms part of our overall strategy to strengthen relations between the European Union and Russia."
"It is part of our goal to make tangible progress on all four common spaces at the next summit on 11 November."
"In the field of external security, we have made progress."
"But the interaction should go hand-in-hand with building up cooperation in the common space of internal security."
"The terrorist attacks have prompted Moscow to continue to regard Chechnya as a predominantly anti-terrorist issue."
"This gives rise to concern."
"We have been consistent in our position that human rights should be respected in the fight against terrorism."
"Indeed, the European Union has a clear position on the situation in Chechnya."
"We will continue to present this position to Russia in future."
"As to the terrorist attack in Beslan, I will be brief."
"We have fully and unconditionally condemned this attack and have offered our condolences to the relatives of the victims, the Russian Government and the Russian people."
"We therefore fully supported your initiative, Mr President, for schools all over Europe to respect a one-minute silence at noon yesterday in commemoration of the victims of this terrorist attack."
"In that way our children were able to show the world their grief for its victims and their worries about terrorism."
"It is now up to us, the politicians, to translate these worries into further concrete action and to reinvigorate our fight against terrorism while respecting our core values."
". Mr President, let me begin where the Foreign Minister of the Netherlands concluded and make it clear that no-one possessed of any shred of humanity could be other than appalled and deeply saddened by the tragic events at the school in Beslan in North Ossetia two weeks ago."
"I reiterate the Commission’s condolences to the people of Beslan."
"I also unhesitatingly and unreservedly condemn terrorist acts wherever they are perpetrated."
"Attacks on civilians are always contemptible."
"When they deliberately target children, they plumb new depths of atrocity."
"Sadly, this event, as the presidency noted, was not isolated."
"In recent months, Russia has suffered several terrorist attacks, with targets ranging from the Moscow metro to domestic passenger flights."
"The sequence is deeply disturbing, and the Commission has of course expressed its readiness to intensify our work with Russia to combat the very real terrorist threats that it faces."
"We are, to take one example, already working with Russia to combat the financing of terrorism, by helping Russia to improve its efforts to tackle money laundering."
"We want ideally to pursue those efforts as part of our much-vaunted 'strategic partnership' with Russia, as part of a process of dialogue."
"Dialogue inevitably involves questions."
"Real help comes only with understanding, and understanding comes only with clarity."
"What happened in Beslan is still not fully clear, at least to the outside observer."
"Who were those involved?"
"How did the hostage-takers plan and execute this horrific act?"
"What provoked the storming of the school?"
"Why was the number of casualties so high?"
"However, the link with Chechnya is clear."
"Events in Beslan followed an intensification of rebel attacks in both Chechnya and Ingushetia since the spring."
"The current conflict, now in its fifth year, has been a vicious affair, with widespread human rights abuses and the targeting of civilians by both Russian armed forces and rebels."
"Many civilians have simply disappeared."
"The conflict has caused a massive humanitarian crisis and has laid the economy waste."
"We should all recognise, however, that this is not the time to read Russia lectures about Chechnya."
"This is a time of grief and shock."
"We have had, and will continue to have, our differences with Russia over Chechnya."
"We have made, and will continue to make, those differences clear in our meetings with the Russians, and to discuss them."
"That is what partners do."
"For the Commission, there are two principles that guide cooperation with Russia on terrorism."
"First, it is equally – if not more – important to work together to prevent terrorism, by which I mean addressing its root causes."
"Second – and I strongly endorse what the Foreign Minister has just said – human rights are paramount and must be respected."
"The fight against terrorism does not justify or excuse the violation of human rights."
"Rather, it is strengthened by a demonstrable respect for the human rights of all citizens."
"I noted a remarkable statement the other day by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in Israel."
"He was giving a judgment on the security barrier."
"What he said reminded me of what we share fundamentally with Israel, whatever our criticisms of the present government’s policies."
"Democracies, he argued, have to fight with one hand tied behind their backs."
"That is true."
"But it is also true that the moment you behave like the terrorists, you undermine your moral authority and you augment the number of citizens who either actively or passively support them."
"So when we return to discussion of Chechnya, we should continue to make clear our support for a political solution to the conflict, which fully respects Russia's territorial integrity."
"But we should do so in a consistent, intelligent way that does not risk changing from presidency to presidency, and that recognises the complex nature of ethnic conflict in the whole of the Caucasus."
"I note in passing that we and our Russian partners need urgently to come to a shared understanding of this point."
"Territorial integrity and stability matter throughout Russia’s near abroad, in the southern Caucasus as much as the northern Caucasus."
"They matter in the near abroad as well as within Russia itself."
"A shared recognition of that would do much to make our common neighbourhood a safer place."
"For our part we should recognise that no-one sensible in Russia could or should want to return to the Chechnyan status quo of the years immediately before 1999."
"They remember what that was like, and what it led to."
"So should we."
"It was appalling – a community that exported gangsterism."
"So the Commission welcomes efforts to rebuild properly functioning public health, education and administrative systems, but we have no illusions."
"This is the start of a very long journey, which will only be lengthened by the siphoning off of reconstruction funds by corrupt officials, by the apparent manipulation of elections and by a failure to protect human rights and the absence of dialogue."
"The challenge for Russia is to put in place a leadership in Chechnya in which the population of Chechnya has confidence."
"Without this, there can be no lasting, genuine reconciliation, which it is clear the majority of the population wishes to see."
"We can help in this, in a modest way, supporting efforts to promote reconstruction and institution-building in Chechnya."
"I repeat the Commission’s readiness to provide funds for reconstruction and rehabilitation in the north Caucasus, as soon as the security situation permits, and once a needs assessment mission to Moscow and the north Caucasus can be undertaken."
"But ultimately that, and any lasting resolution of the Chechnyan tragedy, depend on the pursuit of far-sighted, humane and resolute policies in Moscow."
"I hope they are forthcoming and that the government of the Russian Federation will not conclude that the only answer to terrorism is to increase the power of the Kremlin."
"Frankly, there is not much good history on the side of that proposition."
"Mr President, making a speech is always easier when you can say that you agree with the previous speakers, in this case, the Presidency and the Commission."
"Almost everything has already been said on the subject of terrorism, following 11 September, 11 March and now the Beslan tragedy."
"This is no longer merely a case of terrorism, it is a new reality that I would call hyper-terrorism, in which not only civilians, but also children are used as a terrible means of achieving aims."
"In the circumstances, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what can be said is very simple."
"First and foremost, we must insist that institutions and governments act firmly. We cannot accept, under any circumstances, any neutrality from an institution or State in the face of an act of hyper-terrorism of this nature."
"It is not only governments that must work together; we must demand that all governments and institutions work together in the fight against terrorism and hyper-terrorism."
"The firmness that we demand, as has been mentioned, must never, however, be at the expense of what makes us strong and what we strive for, which is democracy, the rule of law and human rights."
"This is an area in which we must not make any concessions."
"We do not want to establish police states anywhere, not even in those States with the greatest justification for so doing, because if we were to go down that road we would lose, as has already been said, all of our moral strength."
"What we need, in addition to firmness, is, therefore, closer cooperation and, at the moment, we feel that there is room for improvement in this area, firstly as regards intelligence, but also as regards the flow of money that is behind terrorism."
"The questions of who is funding this flow, and how the money is circulating around the world must be investigated in much greater depth than has until now been the case."
"The European institutions are alive to the problem."
"I applaud the work done in the Commission, in particular by Mr Vitorino, and this work should be carried on even more thoroughly."
"I shall finish, Mr President, by saying that in our view terrorism has always been a struggle against democracy, freedom and the rule of law, which are the very cornerstones of our European Union."
"This is one of the main reasons why we should combat it together."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Commissioner Patten said just now, this is a time of grief and not the time for us to read Russia lectures, and on that I very much agree with him."
"Nobody speaking in this debate can banish these images."
"I think we can all readily comprehend what it means when, in a particular town, not one single family is not lamenting a victim, and most of those families have lost children."
"We have to imagine that; there is a place on this earth, in which there is not one family that has not lost a child – grandchildren, nephews, nieces, the children of the family itself."
"Beslan will have to live with that trauma for a long time, and not just Beslan; we will all have to live with that trauma for a long time."
"The media world, in which we are at home, is fleeting and happy-go-lucky; today, already, other images are making the news."
"So I want to take up something Mr Cohn-Bendit has said, something that I think is very astute."
"‘A Rubicon of terrorism has been crossed’, he said."
"That is a fact; indeed, it has been."
"For the first time, we have seen in terrorism something characterised by two elements."
"It is actually an unwritten, but self-evident law of humanity that says that children are not to be targeted by such actions."
"Until now, as I recall, it was a fact of terrorism, albeit not of war, that children were not attacked."
"For the first time, something has been introduced, something that says: ‘We don’t care; we’ll take a whole school hostage, and we’re not interested in what happens to the children’."
"So it is that the end justifies the sacrifice of children; a Rubicon has indeed been crossed, and it is this against which we must defend ourselves."
"That is why I want, in this debate, to draw attention to something: as we all know how these terrorists think, we also need to make two connections here."
"There is, quite obviously, a connection between Chechnya and Islamic terrorism, with the idea being to use Chechnya and Ingushetia, regions with predominantly Muslim populations, as a means of taking the conflict to North Ossetia, inhabited by a different faith community, the object being to multiply the conflict two-fold."
"When, however, children were taken as hostages, the result was an effect that has gone unnoticed by our media."
"The fact is that, for the first time in a long time, in not one Arab country were there demonstrations in the street in support of this act of terrorism."
"Throughout the Islamic world, not one newspaper failed to condemn this act."
"Even the most radical of Islamic leaders anathematised and repudiated this sort of terrorism."
"It is in this element that there lies, certainly, an opportunity to revive a dialogue that has evaded us."
"If we can spot a lowest common denominator – and I believe that we can – then it is our shared repudiation of this sort of terrorism, and that smallest common denominator is also an opportunity to begin dialogue, an opportunity that we must make use of."
"That is why our group has discussed the need to draw the logical conclusions, to actually avoid talking only in terms of cultural confrontation, and instead seize opportunities for inter-cultural dialogue wherever they present themselves, even if it be at a moral nadir such as this one."
"To all the perceptive things that have been said here, I want to add that there is a particular question facing the governments of our Union, in this House and particularly here. It is this."
"The European Parliament was broadly unanimous in supporting those states that rejected pre-emptive warfare as a means of conducting international policy and as a model for conflict resolution."
"We will shortly be discussing Iraq and the failure of the approach according to which international crises and conflicts can be resolved by pre-emptive strikes. To be consistent, though, we then have to say that such crises are no better dealt with by nullifying the democratic system, by abolishing the rule of law, or by reintroducing authoritarian structures."
"While it is not for us to give Russia advice, anyone who reintroduces the death penalty absents themselves from our platform of action, which we in this House, let me add, share with our counterparts in the Council of Europe."
"That, too, is the honest thing to say, and if we cannot say that to a friend, then I think it is already too late, but, as we have friends in Russia, and as Russia is Europe’s most important partner, that must be said loud and clear."
"Pre-emptive warfare is no more use than the reintroduction of authoritarian structures."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are horrified by the terrorist atrocity in Beslan."
"We abominate and condemn it without reservation."
"The brutality meted out to children, parents and teachers beggars belief; these terrorists are not freedom fighters, but cynical murderers."
"Like all Europeans, we MEPs are entitled to ask how this tragedy came to pass, and whether it was unavoidable."
"Who was it who sowed the seeds of such terrorism, which kills so many of the innocent in such terrible ways, in Beslan and in a Moscow theatre a year ago?"
"Who is actually behind the aircraft crashes in Russia?"
"Questions such as these do nothing to diminish our solidarity with the victims and our horror at the hostage tragedy."
"There is no simple solution in the war on terrorism, for it goes far beyond the bounds of war as we know it, and is also far more complex than what was known as the Cold War."
"There are no defined battlefields, the foe is not readily identified, and that is what makes simple answers such as military intervention so ineffective."
"Terrorists must be hunted down ruthlessly, no question about that, and nobody doubts it, but it is not enough to combat the symptoms; we have to get to the causes of this war."
"The Russian Government must learn from the catastrophe of Beslan if the vicious circle of violence in Chechnya is to be broken."
"In this situation, warlike behaviour bars the way to a peaceful and democratic end to the conflict."
"For as long as the people of Grozny have no hope of a normal life, there will continue to be a perverse incentive for more terrorism."
"President Putin is playing tough, but he is not taking the tough road that a political solution would be, for his government seems not to believe that a political solution for Chechnya is possible."
"We are left with the lie of an unwinnable war."
"This week, President Putin announced amendments to the Russian constitution, effectively removing the elements of democracy from the country’s political system."
"That is no real war on terrorism, but it is Putin’s – a war on the political diversity that Russia needs so desperately, and his stronger government makes the country no safer."
"We Liberals and Democrats are convinced that we have the right and the duty, as the representatives of the people of Europe, to speak out on Chechnya and to speak up for democracy and the rule of law."
"It is not enough to relegate Chechnya to the small print in the margin, and that is why we find it regrettable and deserving of criticism that the Socialist Group and the Group of the conservative Christian Democrats have blocked a resolution of this House on this important subject."
"We must not take the manipulation of elections and the ongoing violation of human rights lying down."
"Nowhere in the world can we allow the idea of pre-emptive war on terror to take root, for it leads down a dead end."
"We believe in the universality of human rights and in the rule of law."
"If the European Union is to have the genuine partnership with Russia that it seeks, Russia has to be prepared to rethink its policy on Chechnya and find the courage to change tack."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are all agreed that this attack in Beslan was monstrous, and that those who perpetrated it showed themselves to be monsters by taking children hostage and demanding that their mothers should decide which children should die and which should survive."
"Taking that as our starting point, there are two options open to us: we can say that these monsters must be fought, which is a self-evident truism but rather simplistic, or we can ask ourselves how human beings could become monsters."
"The Chechens who carried out this operation were not born monsters, but became them."
"Who made human beings into monsters?"
"That is a legitimate question, and, in Chechnya, a colonial power has for years been waging a colonial war that, day after day, brings forth monsters."
"If we want to talk about how to put a stop to the barbarities of terrorism, we have to start by looking at how to put a stop to the barbarities of this colonial war."
"History has taught us what colonial wars are like."
"The atrocities committed by the Algerians against the French were barbaric."
"Colonial wars bring forth barbarians."
"The problem is with finding a way to end the barbarism, and here it is not enough to say that we are going to pour more money into the war on terrorism; we have to ask what we Europeans are going to put into the political balance in order to put a stop to the barbarism."
"In this context, the role we can play is that of political mediator between the Russians, who are incapable of coming up with a political solution, and the Chechens, who cannot extricate themselves from terrorism."
"That is why we call for a condemnation of Putin."
"What does the reform of the regional election process have to do with terrorism, or with the fight against it?"
"Nothing."
"It does, however, have something to do with the power of a tsar whose democratic legitimacy is dubious."
"The Russia of today – it has to be said – is in the process of leaving democracy behind."
"Turning to Chechnya, when there is talk of a political solution, we have to know with whom one is supposed to negotiate."
"A political solution will not be found in Russia alone; there must be partners on the Chechen side with whom it is possible to negotiate."
"If everyone – the terrorists and the Chechens who propose political solutions – is treated in the same way, that is to say, as terrorists, there will be no political solution, because there will be nobody to negotiate with. Negotiations will have to involve Mr Zakayev, they will have to involve discussing his proposals and recognising him, and it is only right that the European Union should recognise him and prompt him to abandon and denounce terrorism; he has to be treated as a political partner, as an enemy with whom it is necessary to negotiate."
"Negotiations are always conducted with enemies and never with friends."
"With friends, one organises surprise parties, if one feels in the mood for them; one does not conduct political negotiations with them."
"It is for that reason, Mr President, that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is proposing Natalia Estemirova for the Sakharov Prize."
"The daughter of a Russian father and Chechen mother, she is in Grozny fighting the good fight for the recognition of human rights: a symbol in herself!"
"She is a member of the ‘Memorial’ group that produced Andrei Sakharov, in whose spirit, and with whose friends, she campaigns."
"I hope that this House will find the strength to say that there is a solution other than terrorism to the conflict in Chechnya, and Natalia Estemirova would be the symbol of political action on its part in the face of this tragic situation."
"Yesterday, Mr President, the President of this House expressed on behalf of all of us our profound indignation at the monstrous hostage-taking in Beslan."
"Having radically and unanimously condemned terrorism, it is now for us to speak out equally clearly on the roots of these appalling outbreaks of violence, on the results of the much-vaunted war on terrorism, which was launched in order to curb them, and on the EU’s responsibilities in this crucial context."
"These questions, however, arise in a very similar way in respect of the Caucasus, Iraq and the Middle East."
"Mr Bush, Mr Putin and Mr Sharon are taking the same strategy further, with the same catastrophic results."
"The roots of terrorism, of course, lie in a state of permanent war, with bombings and acts of destruction and humiliation, when these are not acts of barbarism committed by occupying forces."
"Claiming to wage war on terrorism, one ends up waging war on peoples."
"Putting them through hell does indeed beget monsters."
"The outcome of this alleged war on terrorism is therefore the same in each of the cases to which I have referred."
"Vladimir Putin gained power by promising to restore order."
"Five years on, the Caucasus is ablaze and the blood is flowing as far as Moscow."
"Ariel Sharon promised his people security and peace."
"Since then, the people of Israel have been living in a climate of fear, division and confrontation, while Gaza, locked in and exhausted, is rapidly becoming another ticking time-bomb."
"George Bush saw good as overcoming evil and contemplated extending democracy to the whole of the Middle East; now Iraq is sinking into chaos while the list of innocent victims gets longer from day to day."
"What, then, is the EU’s responsibility, in terms both of its values and of its own best interests?"
"It is, in the first place, to be there, not as an inaudible entity, but as a recognised interested party; it is responsible, above all, for daring to sound the alarm when the world is falling apart before our eyes."
"It must not tremble at every frown from his lordship in the Kremlin."
"The accusation of interference carries no more weight today in the case of Chechnya than it formerly did in relation to Kosovo."
"It must also do away with the intolerable immunity granted to the Sharon Government, which is openly defying the UN, the International Court of Justice and international law in general."
"Finally, it must denounce the unjust, illegal, and increasingly dangerous war in Iraq, formally call for the withdrawal of the occupying troops and, in general terms, adopt as its own for the future the principle that war should be banned as a way of sorting out the world’s problems."
"We should reflect on the words of Kofi Annan, who said: ‘History is a harsh judge; it will not forgive us if we let this moment pass’."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the recent tragic events are among the latest unmistakable signs to bring the civilised world up against an obvious reality: the terrorist attacks of recent years have not been isolated incidents linked only by their cruelty and violence, but we are facing a war, albeit not a conventional one."
"It is a new war, because never until now have the forces of evil been mobilised on such a broad front and never has the civilised world, at all latitudes of the globe, found itself confronted with such widespread atrocity and such total indifference towards civilised values and principles."
"Never have children been struck down with such savagery and determination outside conventional conflicts."
"It is time for us to get over the stunned reaction that we, the civilised world, have felt, for we have all been brought up to respect human dignity and civil rights and we cannot comprehend that there can be men and women capable of the acts of savage cruelty that we have witnessed."
"They have declared global war on us using unconventional methods, and we must not forget that we were given many warnings, from the Dar es Salaam and Nairobi attacks to the escalation of the Taliban regime."
"One of the last warnings was given to this Parliament and the international community by Commander Massud, who was later killed on 9 September 2001, just a few months after his visit to Strasbourg and two days before the attack on the Twin Towers, the attack that marked the terrorists’ official declaration of war on the whole civilised world."
"We have to understand the reality in which we live."
"There are no more ambassadors to announce that we are at war, but there are bombs ripping our countries apart, child murderers and rapists, and new terrorists being recruited from within our own cities."
"Europe has a duty to listen to every voice raised in defence of the freedom of oppressed peoples, but it has to state clearly that terrorism must be fought and condemned with no ifs or buts, and that all those who justify, tolerate or support terrorism – surreptitiously or otherwise – must be isolated and that we must ensure that they can do no harm."
"Now that with a sense of solidarity we are struggling to fight this new terrorism that has declared war on us, it is difficult to understand how neighbouring countries that we respect and love, such as France, allow a terrorist convicted in Italy for four murders committed during the tragic ‘years of lead’ to escape."
"Our national and European laws also need to be adapted to the emergency situation in which we are living."
"Mr President, Abdel Rahman al-Rashid, the director of the Al-Arabiya television station, wrote a remarkable opinion piece in the 5 September issue of the British ."
"Those who took children hostage in Beslan, he wrote, were Muslims, just as were the hostage-takers in Iraq, those who commit acts of violence in Darfur in the Sudan, Bin Laden and the suicide bombers who blow up buses, cars, schools, homes and other buildings all over the world."
"We cannot clear our name, he went on to say, until we acknowledge the shameful fact that terrorism has become an Islamic activity, a virtual monopoly operated by Muslim men and women, end of quote."
"Courageous Muslims such as Mr al-Rashid must be supported in saying such things."
"Above all, we must become aware that a global war is being waged on Europe and on the West in general, a war waged by Muslim fundamentalism against our European democratic values and lifestyle, and I am, alas, less than convinced that the European Union is in the forefront of the fight against terrorism, as Mr Bot has just said."
"Far more than is at present the case, there needs to be cooperation with the United States, with NATO and with such countries as Russia."
"Member States must work together more effectively in exchanging information and must adapt their legislation better with a view to combating international terrorism, or else things will go from bad to worse."
"Mr President, what happened in Beslan is fundamental proof that Islamist terrorism is now, and will continue to be, the main problem affecting coexistence amongst Europeans."
"It is not just an emerging problem. We must have no doubt that it will be an increasing problem."
"The greatest risk facing us Europeans in relation to this phenomenon is that the European citizens may come to the conclusion that our reaction is fundamentally the failure to act, paralysis, doing nothing."
"That is the greatest risk, the greatest difficulty: not knowing how to confront this terrible risk on the basis of our principles, convictions and values."
"On the basis of my personal experience, I believe that, in order to tackle the scourge of terrorism, the first thing, the most important thing, is to increase awareness, awareness of the seriousness of the problem."
"Legislative and operative measures will be important, but the most important thing is to increase awareness."
"There are two sides to this increasing of awareness: firstly, we must have the courage to treat the fight against terrorism as our very top priority amongst all our problems."
"We must therefore say it, repeat it and affirm it in all the Union’s documents, in all our public statements: terrorism is the main problem."
"I would go as far as to say today that the principal gap in the European Union's anti-terrorist policy is not the lack of measures and initiatives, but the fact that we do not acknowledge sufficiently that terrorism is the main problem facing Europeans."
"Secondly, the second objective in terms of increasing awareness is the conviction that we can defeat this phenomenon."
"We cannot start to fight terrorism unless we are sure, on the basis of the moral strength of our convictions, that we will be able to beat terrorism."
"Terrorism is essentially about fear, it generates fear."
"And the fear of failure we feel when we deal with a problem of this nature is the first thing we must conquer if we are then to conquer the terrorist organisation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it takes time to tackle a terrorist phenomenon."
"There are no shortcuts and no possibility of magic solutions."
"But each and every one of us must have conviction from the outset."
"The fight against terrorism has nothing to do with the left or right; it is essentially a moral obligation."
"I therefore believe we must dedicate more time, more single-issue debates in this Parliament, to tackling terrorism."
"I believe we must state more frequently that terrorism is the main problem facing Europeans and we must promote a debate amongst governments in order to ascertain in certain circumstances, when terrorist attacks take place close to elections, what instruments are available to those governments in order to defend themselves, whether or not this may include delaying elections, in order to prevent terrorists from achieving their objectives."
"In summary, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we have a moral duty of the highest order."
"– Mr President, the frightful terrorist attack on a school in Beslan has claimed hundreds of children and their mothers as its victims."
"What should have been for hundreds of children a day of rejoicing – their first day at school – turned into an appalling tragedy."
"Yesterday, together with millions of schoolchildren throughout Europe, we kept a minute’s silence to remember the victims, and we thank this House’s President for this gesture of solidarity, which was also an expression of powerlessness, the powerlessness felt by everyone in the face of this cruel attack on those who cannot defend themselves – children and their mothers."
"Today, we want, above all, to affirm that we are alongside people in a remote corner of Europe, but the debate on the mounting threat of a terrorism that spares nothing and nobody must still go on, both today and in the months to come."
"Its keywords must be ‘comprehension’ and ‘action’."
"We must endeavour to comprehend the incomprehensible."
"We must be prepared to seek out the causes of terrorism, to open our eyes to people’s hopelessness and frustration and that of the conflicts that appear to be unending, without the prospect of a solution."
"I am quite clearly not saying that the existence of these conflicts is a justification for barbarous violence directed at innocent people, but rather that we must adopt a joint approach in order to do away with this source from which violence develops."
"In the same way, we also have to be prepared to act, to take international cooperation in the fight against terrorism further."
"It follows that the European Union must offer the Russian people, and President Putin, every assistance in attempting to prevent such far-reaching calamities from happening in future."
"The question naturally arises of how all of this was possible."
"It is a good thing that the State Duma is conducting an inquiry into how the calamity in Beslan ended and how that final stage was dealt with."
"Nor is there any getting away from the Chechen issue."
"The assistance to which I have just referred does, of course, include joint operations on the ground by the intelligence services, their training in specialized units and their learning from each other’s experiences."
"International terrorism cannot be tackled without international cooperation, and the European Union has an important part to play in that."
"My group has little sympathy for those who think that they can go it alone in combating international terrorism and who also believe that this is the only way to do so."
"I want to ask the House for an intensive debate, to be held by the end of the year and jointly with the Council and the Commission, on the European contribution to the fight against terrorism."
"Where do we stand, and what is our analysis of the threat?"
"This morning, Mr Bot made an important contribution to this discussion in his statement on what the European Union and its Presidency are doing."
"High on the list are seeking out the causes and dealing with them, but our European tradition bids us also look at how democratic structures are to be secured and fundamental human rights protected."
"– Mr President, I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Bot, what has happened to him in the space of a week."
"A week ago, Mr Bot, you asked the Russian authorities a very simple question as to how it had been possible for this tragedy to occur."
"A very simple question, and one that you were right to ask, but you are wrong today in your desire to see it buried."
"Why is this so?"
"After all, it is the question being asked by all the families in Beslan; it is the question being asked by all those families as they grieve."
"What happened?"
"What has come to pass?"
"How can you not see that, in this tragedy, the Russian powers-that-be have deployed all the calculating cynicism of which they are capable – manipulation, disinformation, poisonings – and the best journalists, experts on Chechen issues, found themselves being prevented from reaching the scene."
"How are these facts to be denied?"
"How can one not put these questions to the Russian authorities?"
"How, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, can you cooperate in the fight against international terrorism with a power that first denied that there was any connection with the conflict in Chechnya, with a power that then condemned the independent and moderate President Maskhadov, putting a price on his head?"
"Now this same power has proclaimed an international war on the global scourge of terrorism, finally asking all states to refrain from interfering in its internal affairs."
"Who is that power, inconsistent and manipulative, with which you seek to cooperate in saving democracy, the rule of law, and our code of values?"
"Think about it, Mr Bot."
"Ladies and gentlemen, September’s events in Beslan have shocked the world with their savagery and inhumanity."
"There are no words to describe the feelings caused by the murder of children."
"This act of terror can have no justification whatsoever."
"At the same time, I should like to emphasise that this event demands from the state political action to prevent such situations in the future, to remove the causes of terrorism."
"That is not easy."
"It is much easier to make irresponsible pronouncements about preventive strikes or merely to try and consolidate authoritarian powers."
"The President of Russia should be trying to assuage the mutual hatreds of the different peoples within Russia."
"These hatreds were bred by tsarism and continued by Stalinism, and have yet to be resolved."
"Quite recently, militiamen in Moscow beat up an ex-astronaut, purely because he had a Chechen-sounding surname."
"It is important for President Putin to show proper concern for every citizen of his country – not only Russians, but other peoples too, and for his immense power to be deployed to create peace and harmony."
"Mr President, on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland, who have known the cruelties of terrorism for more than a generation, I wish to convey my heartfelt sympathy to the parents and people of Beslan."
"The horrendous terror to which they have been subjected is unspeakable."
"Terrorism is wrong wherever it occurs."
"There is no justification or room for equivocation."
"Be it the IRA fire-bombing a packed hotel outside Belfast and incinerating a dozen innocent people, al-Qa'ida attacking the twin towers, or Chechen extremists in Beslan butchering innocent children, the strategy is the same – maximum impact through maximum carnage in the hope of extracting maximum political concession."
"Our experience in Northern Ireland should demonstrate that there is nothing honourable, enlightened or desirable about pandering to terrorism or finding excuses for it – it is evil in all its forms."
"Across Europe and the world, it behoves us all to stand resolutely against it and its despicable apologists."
"Mr President, the image of children running away from an explosion, only to be shot in the back, is too repugnant for words."
"Above all, our feelings of sympathy are for the victims, those left behind and the whole of Russian society."
"Different though our opinions may be about a conflict such as that in Chechnya, there can never be any justification for atrocities of this kind, nor should anyone attempt to find one."
"We as politicians owe it to the public to make every effort to prevent this from happening again."
"It is ever more frequently apparent that terror knows no boundaries and is a threat to every open society."
"In addressing this terror, we in the European Union will therefore, more than ever, need to join forces with countries such as the United States and Russia, while, within the Union too, we have an awful lot to learn in this area of cooperation."
"Many plans have been forged under the guidance of EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, Mr de Vries, during this and the previous presidency, but it is just as important to monitor the implementation of plans that have already been adopted."
"In the extra Justice and Home Affairs Council in the wake of the attacks in New York of September 2001, it was agreed that, from now on, all relevant information about terrorist threats would be exchanged within the EU."
"A few days before the attacks in Madrid, it transpired that this exchange is still very inadequate."
"We can no longer afford this."
"Have fine words meanwhile been translated into action?"
"In fact, the need for identical implementation also applies to terrorist organisations that have been included on the European list."
"Indeed, in our Union, which lacks internal borders, these organisations are banned in some countries, but not in many others."
"The discussion about an effective and identical implementation of the plans should be held at a higher level, and it would be useful if the coordinator, Mr de Vries, were to send his progress reports directly to this House too."
"After all, we show no real understanding for, and sympathy with, the victims of New York, Madrid and Beslan, unless ambitious words are turned into concrete action."
"– Mr President, we should express our deepest condolences to the victims of Beslan and their relatives."
"These people need our help: communities across Russia as well as Beslan and its surrounding regions."
"There is nothing more barbarous or mindless than the intentional killing of defenceless mothers and children."
"We cannot be impartial faced with terrorism of this sort."
"It threatens the rule of law, democracy, civil rights, the basis of our society."
"The whole world has realised that things have now gone too far."
"I headed a parliamentary delegation to Chechnya last year."
"Parliament stressed that the conflict in Chechnya could not be resolved by military means."
"The Russian Government stated that it would act accordingly."
"Terrorism cannot be fought in ways that curtail democracy, civil rights and equality."
"The background to terrorism involves social policy, and the remedy for it likewise involves social policy."
"It will not come about through the use of weapons or the continued centralisation of power."
"In Europe, we can see that Russia’s policy on Chechnya has failed."
"It is difficult to see how a continued centralisation of power in the Kremlin would help us understand this policy."
"Up till now, we have supported the policy to promote stability and democracy under Putin’s leadership, and hopefully it will not now come about that, as a result of these tragic events, we start to rethink and alter our policy on Russia, because now Russia itself is also a victim."
"Hopefully we will find, together with the Russian leadership, ways in which Russia could act in accordance with its own public proclamations, and which we could therefore support wholeheartedly."
"This is a matter of joint concern."
"– Mr President, although it is the total horror, the complete and utter condemnation of the mad events in Beslan, that unites us all, I would urge you not to narrow the facts in Beslan and Chechnya down to a simplistic analysis of the fight against international terrorism."
"There is a great deal more going on."
"In Chechnya, a messy war is being fought."
"Just read the reports by Amnesty International, or the report by our committee, of which I too was a member and to which Mr Paasilinna referred, or just look at what is happening in Chechnya."
"A military solution is not possible."
"What we need to establish is dialogue, a dialogue that should involve all parties, all parties within Chechnya, not only the clan around Mr Kadirov, but all clans in Chechnya, a dialogue including the rebels."
"Mrs Thatcher once stated that she would never talk with terrorists, and yet it is thanks to Mr John Hume that the British and Irish Governments sat around the negotiating table, along with the IRA and the Protestant terrorist gangs."
"This proved to be the solution for peace in Ireland, and this is also the solution for peace in Chechnya."
"They should enter into talks with all parties, and Europe should play an important role in this, just as the United States did in Northern Ireland."
"We must try to unite the parties and try to persuade them to work together."
"That is what the Chechens are asking us, because the Chechens essentially want peace."
"Mr President, words fail me in the face of the tragedy that has befallen children and adults in Ossetia, but words must be found."
"Words must be found and action taken to avoid further need for tears."
"There is no such thing as good or bad terrorism, as all kinds of terrorism are bad."
"There is no such thing as terrorism in the name of God, as every kind of terrorism is the work of the devil."
"That said, the film on Chechnya we have been watching for years is not a black and white film, with a good sheriff pitted against the bad guys."
"In this film the sheriff has also shot people in the back in the past, as in Chechnya there really are two kinds of terrorism."
"There is the kind currently being discussed at length, both in this House and elsewhere, and there is the other kind no one talks about, namely state terrorism."
"The fact that the EU is putting forward its views on this issue is to be welcomed."
"These views should be those of the entire EU, and this fact should be noted by Russia, which in the past has preferred to talk with selected Member States such as Germany and France, as demonstrated by the recent summit in Sochi."
"If we act together, Mr President, as a single EU, it will be easier for us to exert influence on Russia and to fight for human rights, both in Chechnya and elsewhere."
"– Mr President, a particularly painful tragedy took place in North Ossetia, where the brutality on one side met with a lack of responsibility on the other."
"It is reminiscent of the tragedy in the Moscow theatre and brings many things to mind."
"Today when the Russian authorities declare that they will fight terrorism anywhere, that may seem new and positive, perhaps it opens the door to combined efforts in Iraq, Afghanistan, to stop acts of terror in Quatar and elsewhere."
"When the Russian authorities condemn double standards, there springs the hope that Russian terrorists will also be persecuted, for example those who on the night of 31 July 1991 killed seven Lithuanian border guards in cold blood."
"The criminals are known; members of a unit of the terrorist 'Black Berets', they live in Russia protected and supported by its authorities, who refuse to cooperate with Vilnius in the pursuit of justice."
"While talking so much about the war on terrorism, Russia's leaders have shown more than one example of double standards and hypocrisy."
"The European Union could urge them to change this behaviour."
"Here is a quote, an excerpt from the shadow cabinet's statement at the beginning of the Beslan crisis."
"Quote: 'We categorically condemn this act of terrorism and unite with the United Nations Security Council in encouraging the release of the hostages."
"At the same time we deeply regret that the United Nations Security Council has never condemned and has not expressed sympathy for the deaths of 42 000 Chechen children, killed in Chechnya as a result of the Russian authorities' orders'."
"Unquote."
"At that moment the children of Beslan were suffering, but were still alive."
"The 42 000 other children were no longer alive, were no longer suffering."
"For them that anachronistic colonial war was long over."
"When will it end however?"
"Those who say, 'first victory, then peace', are wrong."
"That is a dead end."
"It is time for a different way of thinking – peace is victory."
"Peace, which would save thousands of lives, which would mean that children no longer die because of the stupidity and brutality of adults, cannot be shameful."
"General de Gaulle did not disgrace France when he ended the Algerian War."
"Thank you for your attention."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, one can scarcely find words to express the fury, grief and shame evoked by the terrorist attack in Beslan."
"The escalation of terror, in terms of its nature and degree, frightens us all and causes us grave concern."
"What frightens and concerns me, though, and many others among us, is the red line that connects Bush’s policy of preventive war in Iraq, via Sharon’s stubborn belief that violence can be countered only with violence, with Putin’s actions, which tend in that direction, the belief being that force can be dealt with only by force, with more force making authority necessary, which in turn makes authoritarian structures inevitable."
"I am grateful to all the speakers, to the Foreign Minister and to the Commissioner, for highlighting the alternative way, the one I would call European, which, far from bowing down before terrorism and yielding to it, involves combating its causes as well."
"To its partners, including Russia, Europe must make this way clear and unmistakeable."
"Terrorism must be fought, but its causes must also be done away with."
"Mr President, yesterday evening we joined in honouring the memory of the victims of Beslan with a minute’s silence."
"From today’s speeches, we can see various conceptual approaches to evaluating what happened."
"Let me briefly explain my own judgment."
"If we are to reject the proposition that ‘the end justifies the means’, then we must not exploit the situation that violent means have brought about in order to raise the question of our cherished aims."
"Otherwise, the terrorists will conclude that the events they stage bring results."
"The issue of a people’s right to self-determination, which should be respected as far as possible, must not be raised in connection with acts of terror."
"What is more, one would want to see the European Union adopt not double standards, but single standards towards events in Iraq, Russia, Turkey, Indonesia and other countries."
"Sunni terrorism, Chechen terrorism and Kurdish terrorism do not have a separate existence."
"This is all violent conduct based on exactly the same principles, and should be condemned, regardless of its perpetrator, its origin or the territory on which it is committed."
"Mr President, too often after a terrorist atrocity blame focuses on the authorities concerned."
"We have heard something of that this morning."
"Since the Beslan tragedy we have heard blame being put on the Russian authorities, either because of their own actions in Chechnya or because of their sheer technical incompetence in terms of handling a terrorist situation."
"But we should not be distracted from the simple observation that the only people really responsible for terrorism, for the horrors of Beslan, are the perpetrators – the terrorists themselves."
"No cause, whether it is the separation or autonomy of Chechnya, no injury, even brutal acts by Russian security forces – nothing justifies the mass murder of children and their mothers."
"Sadly, the Beslan attack will not be the last."
"What is to be done?"
"We do not have just a humane interest in the security and stability of Russia and her increasingly important southern reaches, but a selfish interest as well."
"We all want to see security and stability in the Caucasus and an end to the spiral of terrorism where we see endemic banditry and distorted nationalisms now fed by Islamic extremism."
"This is a dangerous mixture that threatens us all."
"The Russian authorities should not be too proud to seek assistance, which is needed on several levels."
"In terms of counter-terrorism that expertise does not rest within the EU as such."
"I do not entirely dismiss all EU actions in relation to terrorism."
"Closer cooperation between our police and security services is important."
"Controls of terrorist finance need joint efforts, but too much effort is focused on empowering the EU and extending its competence into new areas."
"I do not share Mr Bot's enthusiasm for the European arrest warrant, for example."
"Expertise rests in countries such as the United Kingdom and Spain."
"Certainly, Russia should be calling on that sort of expertise."
"The inability of the Russian authorities to deal with the Beslan situation reveals many worrying and enduring problems that seem to be deeply embedded in the Russian state."
"If the EU has anything to offer, it should be a single-minded condemnation of terrorism, together with humanitarian and reconstruction assistance."
"Russia has to recognise who her real friends are."
"– Mr President, the world was, once more, obliged to stand and watch helplessly while one of the most tragic hostage dramas in history was played out."
"The attack on Beslan immerses us in absolute horror, in the denial of humanity, into the age of barbarism, and we cannot help but feel sickened at the sight of parents put to death in front of their children, or at the sight of children being used as human shields at windows."
"The place itself is symbolic: a school, representing learning, that knowledge that makes possible the fight against obscurantism, against stupidity and savagery."
"That which makes us human, the barbarians have smashed; how can you deprive a child of water, of food, of sleep, and still be part of humanity?"
"At the European level, though, we absolutely have to build up our capacities."
"The ambitious goals set after the Tampere Summit in order to establish a European approach to terrorism, have not been achieved."
"To be sure, as you have emphasised, progress has been made, particularly in the creation of the international arrest warrant, but the process has been held back by the Member States’ lack of political will to make European decisions truly effective."
"We have to build up our fighting capacity if we are to counter this, the curse of the new century."
"Having said that, what can we say about State barbarism?"
"It is not acceptable that violence should be answered with violence."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, Mrs Flautre just said that the primary issue had to be the nature of Russian information policy, what was manipulative about it, how it was that journalists were kept away from the scene, and so on."
"There, Mrs Flautre, I have to tell you that you are wrong."
"That is not the first question that must be raised, but what is, is our compassion for the victims, and so it was a mistake on the part of the Dutch Presidency of the Council to start by demanding reports from the scene on information policy and everything else, rather than making it an absolute priority to express concern at the dimensions terror was taking on."
"On that I really do want to contradict you in the strongest terms."
"My second point is that, if you analyse what is going on there now, we have every reason to criticise Putin’s policy on Chechnya in recent years, but the underlying character of this attack has nothing to do with Chechnya."
"These are not ordinary Chechens ..."
"It is not ordinary Chechens who blow a school sky-high and kill children in this way, for to say that denies the Chechens their moral character."
"Let me tell you, Mr Cohn-Bendit, that those who commit these deeds are Ossetians, Ingushetians, and international terrorists, and that is why one has to make a very clear distinction between this and what is going on in Chechnya."
"We need other solutions for a policy on Chechnya, but we cannot equate these bandits and criminals, who band together and have Islamic connections throughout the world, with the people of Chechnya, and so this is where we need more subtle answers, rather than Chancellor Schroeder or President Chirac to approve these fake elections."
"What we need instead is ..."
"What we need instead, my dear Mr Cohn-Bendit, in the face of such a web of international terrorism, is clear answers, for this terrorism menaces the whole of the free world, it menaces us and it menaces the United States too."
"Mr President, it is worth reminding ourselves that we use the word 'terrorist' to describe one who seeks to cause terror, and truly do those responsible for the Beslan siege define that word – terror, horror, shock."
"All victims of terrorism are innocent: people on a commuter train, in a theatre, an office block or a nightclub."
"But children in a school are the most innocent victims of all."
"The survival of children, like seven-year-old Aida Sidakova – who we saw on our television screens returning to what we thought was her death – is a symbol of the hope that our human spirit craves in the face of such an unspeakable act of evil."
"Beslan must not be exploited for political ends, whether in the Kremlin or here in the European Union."
"I agree that there should be justice, but there should be no recriminations, no reprisals, no revenge, and, as all the institutions of Europe affirm in unanimity in this debate, no dilution of respect for human rights."
"Last week I accompanied my own daughter to her first day of school."
"It was a nerve-wracking experience for both of us."
"I cannot imagine the ordeal suffered by those children."
"As parents and fellow human beings, let us mourn those who died and express our absolute solidarity with their families: their suffering is our suffering."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ‘It was our principles that lead us to confront terrorism with determination and without concessions, because it represents the greatest denial of individual freedoms, since it is an attack on the very foundations of democratic co-existence, because we must defend ourselves against those whose fundamental aim is our destruction.’"
"I have borrowed these words from a victim of terrorism who spoke them last week in Berlin before a sensitive and committed audience."
"I would like my first comment, Mr President, to be one of solidarity with the victims of Beslan, and it is with emotion that I express my compassion and share in the grief."
"There is no justification for terror, no possible cause can justify it."
"Killing, murdering children, murdering mothers and fathers of children, killing children’s teachers is the most extreme expression of the most miserable of human behaviour."
"The victims were tortured for 52 hours and then murdered."
"Those are the undeniable facts."
"Shamil Basayev, who planned and authorised the attack, is not a leader of the Chechen independence movement, he is a murderer of children, an inhuman terrorist who has littered Russian soil with innocent bodies."
"This is the truth and is undeniably the fatal consequence of indiscriminate terrorism."
"So I would like to express my total and determined condemnation of this event which degrades the human condition in the extreme."
"We are seeing an unprecedented increase in the spiral of terror."
"I would like to express my support for the Russian authorities in their quest to arrest and prosecute the people responsible for this horrific attack quickly, and I can assure you all that my emotions are not purely rhetorical."
"I have visited Chechnya and Ingushetia;"
"I have visited the Chechen refugee camps; I have spoken to Kalamanov on two occasions;"
"I understand the complexity of the political problem and I am aware of the human rights violations of the parties concerned;"
"I also know what Politkovskaya has said."
"I have seen terrorism from close quarters in my own country, from less than five centimetres away, and I can state with democratic conviction that these savages cannot be given any advantage."
"They take advantage of our doubts and turn parts of our debates into their own arguments whenever it suits them."
"I would call for the democratic capacity to identify the problem properly and combat it with determination and without reservations."
"I call on you to restart the debate on Europol, to revise United Nations Security Council Resolution 1333 and to make the European Agency for the Management of External Borders operational."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first speaker noted that it is easy to take the floor when you agree with the previous speakers."
"Having listened to what you have brought here today, I can certainly vouch for that, and I am also grateful to you for the support that many of you expressed for the programme as I unfolded it."
"I was also moved by the image that Commissioner Patten conjured up, that if we enter into the fight against terrorism, in a way we have one hand tied behind our backs."
"I should like to say, though, that that means two things, namely that we should strengthen the hand that we have left over, but, at the same time, that we also have a mouth, with which we can step up the dialogue."
"In my view, as I said initially, this is about two things."
"On the one hand, we must protect ourselves in the fight against terrorism, but on the other hand, it is crucial that we join forces."
"I think that we should keep these two elements very much in the forefront of our minds."
"I have outlined the way in which we want to reinforce our cooperation."
"First of all, we must focus on cooperation within the European Union, because I believe that if we succeed in this, if we make it clear – as I have tried to make it clear to you – that among the twenty-five of us, we can organise cooperation more effectively in a different way, namely by stepping up our efforts to pool information, by adapting our legislation, by cutting off funding for terrorism, then I think we can also create a precedent in that way, one which we can use in our contacts with the rest of the world."
"As has been stated several times before, it is a worldwide fight, but a worldwide fight also requires a worldwide response."
"It is also in that context that the European Union is active."
"I have mentioned a few measures."
"I have told you that we are in the process of reinforcing and intensifying our contacts with developing world countries."
"For example, let me mention the forthcoming ASEM Summit, where we, along with the Asian world, will be discussing this topic."
"How can we fight terrorism jointly?"
"What are the means at our disposal?"
"How can we pool our information more effectively?"
"I noticed during my recent trips to Asia how great a concern there is about this in the Asian world too now that attacks have also taken place there, that people over there are increasingly prepared to work together in the spirit in which we would like to."
"It has also been stated that it is important for us to work more closely with the United States and with Russia."
"I have tried to explain to you in my introduction in what way we are trying to achieve this."
"This is a constant concern to us, both in respect of the United States and Russia, and I would like to eliminate a misconception here once again, which was re-emphasised by Mrs Flautre, when she stated that I took something back of what I had said earlier."
"I do not believe that to be the case."
"I have spoken out clearly in our dealings with Russia, and I stated, and I am reading out the English: ‘we will use the regular dialogue that we have with Russia to discuss how to proceed’."
"It is important for the dialogue to be in place, but at the same time for us to clarify our values."
"I should like to return to the image of the hand that is tied behind our backs, which leads me to conclude that we should be more emphatic in spelling out our values and the reasons why we fight terrorism."
"We do so with the aim of honouring our own democracy, our own belief in human rights, of respecting minorities, and in saying this I am also referring to Chechnya, and we must do this together, we require everyone’s support for this."
"I can only reiterate my thanks for the support you have expressed today."
"I can also state that in the coming months, the presidency will be actively committed to vigorously pursuing the programme I have unfolded and which, in my view, is somewhat extensive and covers many areas, but we will need everyone’s help in realising it."
"I was pleased to hear today that that help will be forthcoming."
"As is customary, the presidency will report on everything that has happened and what we have done at the end of this term, at the end of the presidency."
"In saying that, I am also responding to Mr Wiersma’s question."
"Thank you very much, Mr President-in-Office of the Council."
"The debate is closed."
". – The cold-blooded massacre of a thousand children in a Christian school in Ossetia is an outrage."
"Even so, it is to be feared that such an atrocity will be repeated, and not only in Russia."
"The attack committed in Spain on 11 March was a demonstration in blood that none of our countries is safe from Islamic terrorism."
"This is all the more the case as this terrorism is encouraged by certain commentators, who attribute responsibility for this massacre to Russia’s policy in the Caucasus: ‘If Russia did not defend the integrity of its territory, the terrorists would leave it alone’."
"Such, in essence, is the reasoning of these sophists, who can always find extenuating circumstances for the assassins and reasons to find fault with their victims."
"The same is true of the young thugs who set the areas in which they live ablaze when the police commit the impropriety of entering them to ensure that decent people can live in safety."
"Today, if we want to put a stop to these horrors, it is necessary, before all else, to name the guilty party: Islam, which, like Communism, seeks to use terrorism as a means of imposing a totalitarian system."
"In the face of such an adversary, our countries must put aside their differences of opinion and of direction, and unite in defending the values of Western civilisation which they have in common."
", . – We express our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims of Beslan."
"At the same time, we express our deep concern about future developments in the area in relation to USA and EU plans and the manifest copying of their strategy by the Russian Government in the areas of internal and external security, especially their adoption of the doctrine of preventive war."
"It is perfectly obvious that the recent tragedy in Beslan and the inauspicious predictions are yet another result of the break-up of the USSR and the fall of socialism."
"The imperialists engaged in internecine competition, which are responsible for the acute risk of destabilisation in the area and the widespread clashes, have their eye on the Caucasus region, through which the oil routes pass."
"The concerns expressed by the US and EU imperialists are particularly hypocritical."
"The 'political solution' which they propose and the so-called internationalisation of the problem aim to turn the area into a Kosovo-type protectorate."
"Only the grass-roots fight by the people of Russia seeking to overturn the current situation will create the preconditions to a fair and peaceful solution to the problems."
"The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission Statements on the situation in Iraq."
". Mr President, Iraq is an issue by which we Europeans have for some time been deeply affected, and, moreover, divided."
"Although the developments in Iraq have given us cause for concern, it is of the utmost importance that the European Union should support the Iraqi people in the coming months, and that we should not abandon, but should, in fact, keep providing them with support."
"Although the ongoing violence is causing us concern, the past few months have also created space for a coherent and unified stand on the part of the EU in its support for Iraq."
"In a moment, I will talk about the kind of support the EU could possibly offer, but first, I hope you will allow me to give a brief retrospective of what has gone before."
"June, in particular, was an important month for the long-term future of Iraq and the Iraqi people."
"First, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1546 on 8 June, and on 28 June, Iraq’s temporary occupation came to an end and sovereignty was restored."
"The coming into office of Mr Allawi’s interim government marked a key turning point in the history of Iraq."
"The new resolution also restored unity in the international community and, moreover, made it possible for the UN to again become involved in Iraq, which is an important step, certainly in view the elections to be held in January 2005."
"Just as important is the way in which the developments in June made it possible for the differences of perception, which there had been up until that point with regard to certain areas of Iraq policy within the EU, to be bridged."
"This became evident in the conclusions of the first general Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers under the Dutch Presidency in July."
"This Council ratified the European Union Medium Term Strategyproduced by Mr Solana and Commissioner Patten, as well as the Communication by the Commission with regard to Iraq, entitled ‘The EU and Iraq – A framework for Engagement’."
"These documents offer a clear framework for the EU’s involvement in general and also in respect of a number of details."
"As I have already stated, these conclusions also contain very specific action points."
"For example, it was agreed that the EU will be providing active cooperation to the UN in Iraq, and will be starting a dialogue with the Iraqi authorities to find out in what other way the EU can support Iraq."
"In order to examine this in more detail, an exploratory mission has meanwhile been to visit Iraq."
"I will return to their findings in a moment."
"It is in any case obvious that the objective of EU involvement is to aid in the reconstruction of Iraq and of the country’s internal political process."
"In that connection, the National Conference deserves a mention."
"Despite the major difficulties during the preparations, this meeting can be considered a success."
"All layers of Iraqi society were represented, including many women."
"Eventually, it appeared possible to reach agreement about the delegates who will be seated on the National Council."
"The formation of this Council is an important step on the way to elections."
"Unfortunately, this good news is also laced with a great deal of bad news."
"The abductions and killings of foreign citizens, including EU citizens, are a poignant example of this."
"Our thoughts are with the victims and their relatives."
"However, we should not overlook the fact that very many Iraqis have also become the victim of violence, in most cases those very Iraqis who have taken on responsibility in the reconstruction of that country."
"In addition, the many attacks on oil pipelines constitute a serious threat to the recovery of Iraq’s economy."
"The constant violence is not only threatening society and the Iraqi economy, but also the political process in Iraq."
"The situation in Fallujah is very alarming and over the past few months, what happened in Najaf and in Baghdad showed that violence is also bubbling away under the surface in the Shiite parts ofIraq and can explode at any time."
"In that connection, we welcome the agreement that was recently concluded in Najaf."
"Partly thanks to the courageous efforts on the part of Ayatollah Al-Sistani, the restoration of order and safety in Najaf under the leadership of the Iraqi Interim Government is in sight."
"Let us hope that this is a step in the direction of better relations in Iraq and improved conditions of safety."
"After all, it is clear that the sectarian violence is not in the interest of the ordinary Iraqi citizens who, as a result of terror, see their country lapsing into unnecessary delays in its construction."
"Needless to say, the security situation is a determining factor in the extent to which the EU can offer effective help in the reconstruction of Iraq."
"Clearly, this situation is currently not good."
"Nevertheless, the Netherlands Presidency has adopted the conclusions by the July General Affairs Council and as a result of this, there is already greater EU involvement in Iraq’s political process."
"Accordingly, I myself visited Iraq in August to underline the EU’s support for Iraq’s economic, social and political reconstruction."
"To this end, I had meetings with the President, the Prime Minister and the Foreign Affairs Minister."
"I also talked to representatives of the United Nations in Iraq."
"All the Iraqi people I spoke to underlined the importance they attach to the EU having a clear and visible role in Iraq."
"In that connection, they called for the opening of a Commission office in Baghdad."
"On behalf of the EU, I have also expressed our concern about the reintroduction of capital punishment in Iraq."
"Mr Allawi, who recently visited Iraq’s neighbouring countries, emphasised the importance of stability in Iraq for the region as a whole."
"My response to that was that the EU would be very happy to lend a hand to secure regional security and stability."
"I also told them that the EU would very much appreciate an invitation to take part in the next conference of neighbouring countries."
"Even now, the EU is regularly reminding Iraq’s neighbouring countries of their responsibilities."
"During my visit, the UN representatives indicated that EU support for their activities is vitally important, certainly where the election process is concerned."
"In Iraq, I also instituted the EU Exploratory Mission, which has now returned."
"Delegates of the presidency, the Commission and the Council Secretariat looked into the possibilities of concrete EU involvement in the framework of civil crisis management in the areas of police, the rule of law, public administration and elections."
"The mission did not only have talks with the Iraqi authorities, but also with representatives of the United Nations, the United States, NATO, the Multinational Force and the Election Committee."
"The upshot of the mission was that the following activities are under consideration. If you will allow me, I will briefly outline those areas:"
"First of all, police training."
"Secondly, in the area of rule of law and human rights: training of judges and prosecutors, technical assistance in the establishment of the Iraqi Special Tribunal; forensic expertise and assistance in exhuming victims from mass graves; assistance in setting up a national centre for human rights and democracy; education in the legal field."
"Thirdly, civil administration; increasing capacity in various ministries and in the prison system."
"Fourthly, elections: assistance with, and monitoring of, elections."
"Fifthly, the development of weapons export control legislation, demobilisation programmes for militias and support for the ownership committee."
"All in all, there are plenty of areas where the EU can become active."
"It is important in this respect that the activities that it undertakes should meet real Iraqi needs, and should add value and be complementary to any activities that may already be going on."
"In addition, the synergy between the EU instruments and activities needs to be monitored effectively."
"Also, the political, budgetary and technical aspects will all need to be weighed in order for the activities to be planned well, and the EU should therefore also be certain that it can actually deliver."
"What is of importance now is for a fact-finding mission to visit Iraq and to give a more definite picture of the possibilities for EU action."
"The Council Secretariat will start planning a mission of this kind in consultation with the Commission and the presidency."
"I would also like to briefly mention the importance of the UN presence in Iraq, which, as I indicated, certainly with a view to the elections, is considerable."
"For the UN to function properly, it is crucial that there should be sufficient protection."
"Resolution 1546 provides for this."
"The UN Secretary General has asked the EU governments for a financial contribution to the second protective ring, the so-called UN Protection Force."
"Apparently, the Member States set great store by the EU making a contribution to this."
"The presidency is currently working hard to ensure that this EU contribution will actually be made."
"To that end, the Member States are asked for a contribution and it is also examined to what extent a contribution from the CFSP budget is possible."
"Finally, I can report to you that I have invited Prime Minister Allawi to attend the European Council on 5 November."
"I am counting on us having a concrete offer of support for the reconstruction of his country ready by then."
". It is almost exactly five years since I appeared in this Parliament for my confirmation hearings as a Commissioner."
"Since then I have been fortunate to take part in literally scores of debates – more, I am told, than any other Commissioner: such is Parliament’s interest in external relations."
"I would like to thank Parliament and its Members for the courtesy that I have invariably been shown."
"I have enjoyed coming here."
"It is important, in my view, to try to establish democratic roots for foreign policy."
"It is not an area of public policy to be left to the diplomatic experts, whose record is at best somewhat patchy."
"Anyway, as I ride off into the sunset, I should like to record my appreciation for Parliament’s role in developing, not by leaps and bounds but – perhaps inevitably – by lurches and shuffles, Europe’s common external relations policy."
"The worst shambles to have overwhelmed us in the last five years has, of course, been the row over Iraq."
"I do not want to go back over old arguments."
"If we needed reminding that you cannot have a common policy if the larger Member States are deeply divided, then here was the evidence."
"Other evidence also speaks eloquently for itself."
"As someone once said, 'stuff happens'."
"Is the world today safer than before the overthrow of the appalling Saddam?"
"Is global terrorism in retreat?"
"Are we closer to building bridges between Islam and the West?"
"Is the world’s only superpower more widely respected?"
"Have the citizens in our democracies been treated in a way that will encourage them to give governments the benefit of the doubt next time they are told that force needs to be used pre-emptively to deal with an imminent threat?"
"I simply pose the questions."
"Honourable Members will have their own answers."
"But here we are: Saddam overthrown, violence raging across much of the liberated land, the regime changed, with an interim government preparing the way for democratic elections."
"Whatever our past criticisms, we are all now up to our ears in this endeavour."
"If Iraq goes badly, we all suffer."
"So we have to try to work together to hold the democratic project in one piece."
"What are we pledged to do as a Union, leaving aside the contribution of individual Member States?"
"We have already pledged, and are working hard to deploy, EUR 200 million this year."
"I very much hope that we will be able to secure agreement for a further EUR 200 million for next year."
"We are developing a good record in disbursing this assistance, having paid more than EUR 200 million into the United Nations and World Bank trust funds over the course of the past year."
"We are working well with the United Nations and the World Bank, helping to ensure that our resources are disbursed quickly and well."
"We have focused our assistance this year on three areas: on essential public services – health, education, water and sanitation; on poverty alleviation and the development of livelihoods; and on governance and civil society."
"I would not pretend, however, that all is well."
"How could I?"
"The hazardous security climate – evident not least in the appalling series of kidnappings, most recently of humanitarian workers dedicated to the well-being of Iraqis, and evident also in yesterday’s appalling atrocity in Baghdad – obviously limits the pace of disbursement, as does the fact that we are working with an interim government that is still feeling its way in public administration."
"That is life – at least in Iraq – and we will continue to do our utmost within the constraints of the situation on the ground."
"What I can say, firmly, is that I am convinced that our decision to take the multilateral, trust fund route was absolutely the right one."
"A comparison of our disbursement rate with that of other bilateral donors, including the largest donor of all, only confirms this."
"When we proposed to Parliament committing EUR 200 million to the reconstruction of Iraq, bringing to over EUR 300 million the amount we will spend in 2003-2004, some honourable Members argued that we were being parsimonious."
"They argued that we should do more: they suggested that we should spend at least EUR 500 million, though they were coy about telling us where the extra money should come from."
"This morning I was interested to read a report by the BBC from Washington: 'The US Administration wants to reallocate billions of reconstruction dollars for Iraq and spend them instead on security and other short-term needs."
"US officials say this new strategy has emerged after months of review.'"
"The report goes on: 'The shift is also being interpreted by critics as proof that grand long-term plans to reshape the economy just were not realistic."
"They also charge that the intensity and level of violent resistance was severely underestimated.'"
"I think we were right in our judgment about the amount of money that we could sensibly put into Iraq, and I think Parliament was wise to support that judgment."
"In the coming months, we will continue to implement the proposals set out in our communication of 9 June, which has received widespread endorsement."
"In particular, we will focus on the essential issue of support to the electoral process."
"Once the Independent Electoral Commission and the United Nations have identified exactly what they need, we stand ready to help – as I shall explain to the Iraqi President when I meet him later today."
"But I should be clear that, under the current circumstances, we cannot and will not propose a conventional election observation mission – that would be simply impossible, as honourable Members in this Chamber who themselves have taken a lead in election observation missions will know."
"But we will seek ways to ensure that we play our full part in assisting free and fair elections in Iraq."
"In the longer term, we will need to consider how best the Commission can be represented on the ground."
"Opening a delegation would obviously be difficult, expensive and potentially dangerous."
"But we are prepared to consider that route, if it is clear that it would add to our effectiveness in helping the Iraqi people."
"So let me be blunt: we will work for a better future in Iraq whatever the bitterness of past disputes."
"There is, though, one other general point that I would like to make, triggered by these reflections on Iraq."
"I hope that the House will be generous to me in allowing me to stray a little on what is, almost certainly, my last outing in this mother of parliaments."
"When, just over two years ago, some of us expressed concerns that the United States was abandoning the sort of multilateralism which had characterised its foreign and security policy since the Second World War, we were strongly criticised."
"America, we were assured, still wished to work with allies, provided they shared Washington’s view of how to cope with a dangerous world, and by and large kept any reservations to themselves."
"Some allies did indeed accompany America to Baghdad, a venture not yet blessed – as we have noted – with the easy and benign consequences that were famously predicted and promised."
"Liberation rapidly turned into an occupation – or what was seen as an occupation – bitterly resisted, with atrocity after atrocity."
"Democracy failed to roll out like an oriental carpet across the thankless deserts of the Middle East."
"Above all, peace in Jerusalem and Palestine was not accomplished by victory in Baghdad."
"So, partly because American neo-conservative unilateralism had clearly failed to establish an empire of peace, liberty and democracy, we have been more recently advised that allies and multilateralism were back in fashion in Washington."
"Even the United Nations was deemed to have its uses. the State Department."
"All done and dusted then?"
"Sighs of relief all round?"
"Can we now look forward to the restoration of that old-fashioned notion that allies have to be led not bossed, and that multilateral institutions have their important uses, even for the world’s only super-power – that, Machiavelli, there is much to be said for being admired and not just feared?"
"The rhetoric of the present United States election campaign inevitably raises a few questions."
"I do not seek to take sides."
"America elects its President and its Congress."
"The rest of the world looks on."
"We in Europe should work as well as we can with whoever wins."
"We are not partisans in the process, whatever our private opinions."
"Moreover, I am not so naïve as to confuse campaign rhetoric with a Platonic dialogue."
"I have, after all, been a party chairman myself."
"But campaign rhetoric reflects something and what is reflected here is pretty unsettling."
"If you want to get a cheap cheer from certain quarters in America, it seems that all you have to do is to bash the United Nations, or the French, or the very idea that allies are entitled to have their own opinions."
"Multilateralists, we are told, want to outsource American foreign and security policy to a bunch of garlic chewing, cheese eating wimps."
"The opinions of mankind, which the founding fathers of the United States thought their country should note and respect, are to be treated with contempt unless, I suppose, they faithfully reflect the agenda of the American Enterprise Institute and Fox TV."
"What are we to make of all this?"
"First, multilateralism is, above all, in the best interests of the United States, a point which previous Administrations would not have questioned and most political leaders would have subscribed to for the past 60 years."
"Second, surely the national interest of the superpower is to put its traditional allies on the spot, not challenging their right to consultation, but probing what they have to say and how they intend to turn their rhetoric about cooperation into effective, not effete, multilateralism."
"How, to take one obvious point, do we intend to go about not just draining the swamps in which terrorism breeds – to borrow the cliché – but also shooting some of the crocodiles?"
"Further, how and when will we in Europe countenance the use of force to support the international rule of law?"
"That is a question which we in Europe regularly duck."
"If the political culture of American exceptionalism excludes the notion of working with and talking to foreigners, if unpopularity overseas is taken as a mark of distinction, a source of pride, too many Europeans will make the mirror-image mistake of thinking that sniping at America is the same as having a European foreign and security policy."
"What I worry about most is that on either side of the Atlantic we will bring out the worst in our traditional partners."
"The world deserves better than testosterone on one side and superciliousness on the other."
"American and European citizens deserve better, too."
"After all, they face the same dangers and the same challenges."
"I want a Europe which is a super-partner not a super-sniper – a super-partner of a respected global leader."
"Any alternative to that offers only the prospect of a more perilous and more querulous future."
"Mr President, apart from the stabilisation, rehabilitation, reconstruction and democratisation of Iraq, tasks which I believe, Mr President, should not be the sole responsibility of the United States but of the whole of the international democratic community, I believe that there is currently an immediate priority which must not be put off – which the Presidency-in-Office of the Council has not mentioned explicitly – and that is the release of the kidnapped French journalists, Mr Malbrunot and Mr Chesnot, and their Syrian chauffeur, as well as the Italian aid workers, Miss Torreta and Miss Pari."
"It worries us, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that you have said that the Council interprets these events simply as sad news and that you said yesterday in the Committee on Foreign Affairs that the Council has decided that the best thing was to do nothing, proof, I believe, of the impotence of the European Union."
"It also worries us, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that the Council of Ministers has decided at first reading not to mobilise the flexibility instrument to fund the priority of Iraq, against the proposals of the Commission and this Parliament."
"I hope that this is a tactical position on the part of the Council which will be corrected at second reading."
"Technicalities apart, Mr President, yesterday was another day of tragedy in Baghdad with dozens of people killed."
"I believe that the previous debate this morning demonstrates clearly that we must not and cannot remain indifferent to the phenomenon of terrorism, that terrorism affects us all equally and that we must all respond equally."
"We must therefore be completely united in the face of terrorism."
"The best way for this Parliament to respond to the phenomenon of terrorism is to be united in the resolution we are going to approve tomorrow on Iraq."
"I believe that the best contribution – apart from the proposals in the Commission's draft initiative, aimed at guaranteeing peace, understanding, reconciliation and harmony in Iraq, with a view to the elections to take place in January – is to be united."
"I would like to end, Mr President, by acknowledging, on behalf of my political group, Mr Patten – I attended Mr Patten's hearing as coordinator for my group when he was appointed Commissioner – and thank him for always being available and for his constantly positive and constructive attitude towards this Parliament."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we discuss the prospects for Iraq, we see before us the images coming out of that country."
"They are images of war, a war that seems never-ending, a conflict that leaves no room for easy optimism."
"At the same time we anguish over the hostages, that odious form of violence and blackmail."
"The international community has to be united to save those people, who are journalists and volunteers, as well as citizens of Iraq and of other countries."
"We here should put out an appeal to the Arab and Islamic world to isolate terrorism and reduce the consensus around that kind of violence."
"At the same time, I believe we should appeal to the provisional Iraqi Government and to the international coalition forces to allow the efforts to obtain the release of the hostages to proceed unhindered, that is, to suspend their military operations and bombings, which cause so many civilian victims in the Iraqi towns and certainly do not help to create a suitable climate for negotiations that may save the captives’ lives."
"Looking beyond the tragic hostage crisis, we have turned our attention in the speeches by the representatives of the Council and the Commission to Iraq’s current situation and prospects."
"It is clear that to get out of this terrible crisis there needs to be political change both within Iraq and, in a more general sense, in the fight against terrorism, as has also emerged from this morning’s debate."
"The war and the military occupation of Iraq have proved to be a tragic mistake."
"Instead of containing terror, they have made it stronger and more dangerous; they have spread hatred of the West throughout the Islamic world and are in danger of embroiling the world in a clash of civilisations, which is the most fertile soil for fundamentalism."
"From Iraq to Chechnya and Palestine, the mindset of war, brutal repression and the denial of human rights and the rights of peoples has helped terrorism."
"It is now time to take a different road."
"This does not mean giving up the use of force, but re-establishing the primacy of politics and international law."
"We are not criticising the US conservatives for having fought against terrorism."
"On the contrary, we criticise them for having conducted the fight in the wrong way, adding to the insecurity in the world."
"What is needed is a return to multilateralism and a recognition that restoring peace in Iraq will probably require very clear and brave decisions."
"For example, the presence of US armed forces in the country is unlikely to help to restore peace, since it is evident that those who wanted the war and carried it out are attracting terrorism through their presence there, rather than bringing calm."
"It has to be realised that these forces must be withdrawn at the time of the elections and replaced under UN authority with forces from countries not involved in the conflict."
"In every area of activity there is a need to return to politics, multilateralism and international law."
"That is the feeling in Europe, and that is the feeling in this Parliament."
"We need strong institutions that are able to turn this feeling into coherent political action and not just into an appeal."
"Lastly, I should like to thank Commissioner Patten for his work and also for his words this morning which, in a fine speech if nothing else, reflected the prevailing feeling of the people of Europe."
"Mr President, on behalf of my Group I would like to thank Commissioner Patten for his willingness over the past five years to engage in debate with this House wearing a tie with a very light tinge of blue."
"I am pleased that he is enjoying the political freedom which my party helped him to find and we wish him every success in his future endeavours."
"There are many in this Chamber and outwith who still focus on a reckoning for responsibility for the war in Iraq."
"Whatever form that reckoning might take, Liberals and Democrats insist that we must not allow it to come between Europe and its urgent responsibility to that battered country."
"When your friend's house is burning down, you do not stop to argue over who dropped the match."
"With the oppressive brace of dictatorship ripped away, Iraq has burst like a broken dam."
"If we do not control the flood, it threatens to sweep across the region, engulfing Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Turkey."
"It will drown the hopes of democracy in the Middle East."
"Everything else in Iraq depends on stopping the killing."
"Iraq is a vacuum, and in Falluja, Talafar and Baghdad, violence and the unacceptable terror of hostage-taking has rushed in to fill the space emptied by the fall of Saddam Hussein."
"Yet too often, the coalition forces and the struggling Iraqi Government have met violence with blundering violence."
"Helicopter gunships and heavy-handed military tactics in crowded urban streets can only feed the resentment and the disorder that recruits for militancy."
"Iraq needs international help: a deep and wide commitment that cannot afford to countenance failure."
"Under the auspices of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546 the international community must offer every assistance to the interim government, and then to its sovereign successor."
"I welcome the commitment our diplomatic expert, Mr Bot, has expressed here today."
"Liberals and Democrats believe that the European Union has experience to offer in everything from restoring Iraq's devastated infrastructure to advising on the drafting of its new constitution."
"That is why we have backed the Commission's call for a further EUR 200 million to be made available in humanitarian assistance."
"But Iraq needs more than money."
"If the cycle of violence can be broken, Europe can help train policemen, judges and teachers."
"Europe can help rebuild civil society in Iraq through support for non-governmental organisations, trade unions and political parties."
"The European Union can play a key role in supporting and securing the elections to the Transitional Iraqi National Assembly in January of next year."
"In a country where almost every citizen relies on government aid, we can help find the rice and the wheat flour that stand between Iraq and starvation, and the soap that guards against devastated public sanitation."
"We believe that Europe must help Iraq take steps away from authoritarianism."
"The new Iraq must be built on stable democratic institutions."
"Iraq presents us with a challenge."
"Only stable, democratic government offers the chance to remake the Middle East, and that may require our commitment for a generation."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Commissioner Patten most warmly for his clear statement at the end."
"Commissioner, you have made it clear that our debate today is not just about Iraq, but must also consider an overall political approach."
"It has become apparent that Europe’s essential interest must lie, above all, in finding a peaceful solution for Iraq, and not only for Iraq, but also for the region as a whole."
"We have to develop a coherent policy for Iraq, Iran, Syria, and, of course, for Israel and Palestine."
"Any solution will be difficult, but, as we progress towards one, we should make use of this debate for clarification and analysis, even though we do not yet know what the definite answers will be."
"As far as Iraq is concerned, we have seen unbounded violence over the past months, with pre-emptive strikes on the part of the allies; Guantanamo;"
"Abu Ghraib with all the dreadful attempts to justify torture; fearful terrorist attacks; the execution of innocent hostages; and hostages held right up to the present day. In this context, let me mention another report that has shocked me today, the report of a secret service according to which Syria is alleged to have tested chemical weapons on Sudanese."
"All these acts of untrammelled force we condemn as a matter of fundamental conviction; not only that, we combat them, and have recorded our condemnation of them in the European Constitution."
"So where do we stand today?"
"Following yesterday’s cruel attack, which left many – over sixty – people dead, a look at the press may reflect the differences and the bewilderment in the political world."
"‘Get out of Iraq!’, says the ; says that the ‘USA must wage war to the end’; the reports that ‘Iraq is falling apart before its occupiers’ eyes’, and that ‘Bush has announced that the money intended for security purposes is to be used now, instead of for securing the people’s water supply’."
"Where do our responsibilities lie, and where do we go from here?"
"Despite all our differences, we must, I believe, try to join together in establishing political responsibility."
"I think we must become credible, for without credibility we will have no popular support and the United Nations will not be strengthened."
"That involves condemning what we have to condemn, and doing everything possible to prepare, by all democratic means, for free elections as soon as possible, so that the people of Iraq may be sovereign once more."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is clear that the primary objective of all of us here is to do everything possible to save all the hostages – French, Italian and Iraqi alike – because all lives are equally valuable."
"To achieve this, however, generic words and statements are not enough."
"Who in Europe does not want the hostages freed?"
"I wonder, however, how we can dare to rightly ask for people to respect human rights and to save the hostages’ lives when the armies of countries sitting in this Chamber then continue to drop bombs and kill civilians."
"We take up the NGO’s plea and call for the bombing to stop."
"Terrorism and war are mirror images and feed off each other."
"They are the real enemies of pacifism and of the solidarity that is working in Iraq to build a new society."
"We do not know who has carried out these kidnappings, but we do know there are various interests that want the NGOs to leave Iraq and not witness the violations of rights that are happening everywhere."
"I did not hear the Council make any condemnation of the war, a pre-emptive war that has trampled on centuries of human rights."
"We demand the immediate withdrawal of the troops and announce that, if our amendments against the war and for the withdrawal of the troops are not accepted, we shall vote against the draft resolution to be tabled tomorrow."
"We remain in tune with the major movements and with public opinion, which is standing firm against the war and against terrorism with no ifs or buts."
"Mr President, constructive Iraqi voices deserve a hearing from us."
"That was the case during the days of Saddam Hussein’s reign of terror, and it is just as true now that the future of Mesopotamia is directly at issue."
"At present, those deeply concerned Iraqi voices are urging the EU Member States, above all, to have a constructive presence in their country and region."
"In practical terms, they are asking for a clear, firm stand on the part of all EU Members against the sustained involvement of Iraq’s neighbouring countries in the insidiously-growing terrorism on Iraqi territory, failing which, the EU itself will eventually be called upon to foot the bill."
"In addition, these Iraqi voices are asking for a regional and local start to be made, as a matter of urgency, on that country’s reconstruction."
"Opportunities to do that are presenting themselves in the north and south of Iraq."
"The EU Member States should not let those opportunities slip."
"If this local and regional reconstruction is successful, the people in the terrorist hotbeds can decide for themselves what will benefit them the most."
"Which brings me, finally, to Iraq’s future political structure."
"Iraq’s neighbours are showing themselves very wary of a federal solution for maintaining that country’s territorial integrity."
"This is another excellent opportunity for Europe to display commitment to national and regional stability."
"I hope, and expect, that this commitment will also be evident at the transatlantic level under the Dutch Presidency, because we will thereby be looking after Mesopotamia’s future."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while we acknowledge its good intentions, we regret that Europe is essentially inadequate when confronted with the tragic events of the international crisis, the rise of terrorism and the situation in Iraq."
"Commissioner, if there is too much of the United States in international relations, it is because Europe is indeed impotent."
"We as Europeans would like to already have the Constitution, which we have taken so long to approve, because we would like to already have a European Foreign Minister who could be out in Iraq right now to perform his office with genuine authority and also to negotiate the release of the French and Italian hostages."
"I should like here to remember the two young Italian women, Simona Pari and Simona Torretta."
"Such terrorism, for which a human life counts for nothing, which kills and rapes innocent children, which kidnaps peace workers or civilians and holds the governments and peoples of Europe to ransom, can only receive our most severe and unconditional condemnation."
"Through its work of destabilisation, such terrorism is probably also aiming at somehow delaying or preventing the holding of elections in Iraq, an outcome that would be thoroughly unacceptable."
"In conclusion, to all those who are in Iraq, to the soldiers on peace-keeping missions, to the NGOs, which with admirable perseverance have chosen to stay and carry on their work of aiding the civilian population, to the victims’ families and, at this moment, if I may, especially to the families of the hostages – to all of them I believe the whole Chamber here in Strasbourg should raise its voice loud and clear in solidarity and fellow feeling."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like the vast majority of Polish people, I was and am opposed to the war in Iraq."
"I was also, like all of us in this House, opposed to Saddam Hussein."
"This is why I am entitled to say that Iraq should no longer divide Europe, and that the EU should act jointly to find a baseline consensus and put this consensus forward."
"This does not mean an artificial agreement or a fictitious unity."
"It means an understanding between the nations and governments of Europe, both those who supported intervention in Iraq and those who were opposed to intervention, and it means an understanding based on a concrete goal."
"This goal, which may not be very effective and may not solve all problems, but which is extremely concrete, would be to hold local elections as soon as possible, starting in Najaf and Karbala, for example."
"The building of democracy in Iraq must begin with the foundations, not the roof."
"These foundations are local elections and the establishment of regional authorities that have power and not merely rifles."
"The roof will be national elections, and this is the only appropriate order."
"We must be aware that local elections are a necessary medicine, but that they have side effects, and that they may result in the division of Iraq into Sunnite, Shiite and Kurdish zones of influence."
"This cannot be denied, but it is preferable to a situation in which everyone is permanently at war with everyone else."
"Finally, the European Union mission should be in Baghdad, not in Amman, which is a long way from the Iraqi capital."
"Let us not leave Baghdad to the US, as shirking responsibility is not a course of action that befits the EU."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, without stability in the region, society will not be reconstructed, there will be no security for investments, and without that no really peaceful development will be possible."
"We all know that this can be achieved only if the Iraqi people see their government as possessing an authority and legitimacy other than that lent to it by American unilateralism."
"That is why elections have such a major part to play, that is why the United Nations have a part to play, and that is why I was so shocked by Kofi Annan’s comment yesterday to the effect that ‘the UN can become fully involved again, can go in again, only if security is established.’"
"The whole thing is cyclical: if the UN does not go in, there can be no security, but if it does not go in because there is no security, that demonstrates the international community’s general helplessness in the face of the situation."
"I see this as a reason why we must make it clear that there can be no justification for terrorism and that we will always oppose terrorism, which is, in this case, engaged in by minorities in Iraq, and that we have to support the majority population."
"At the same time, though, we have to do this through dialogue, so that terrorism does not prove to be a Hydra, with several new heads growing every time we cut one off, and we must not create breeding grounds for it."
"I see this as a reason for us in the European Union to do what we can."
"By that I mean political change, support, including in the areas that the EUR 200 million is intended to deal with, the organisation of aid, the initiation of dialogue, the building of structures out of which sustainable development can grow."
"This is not just about Iraq, it is about the stability of the entire region, which will determine whether there is to be a ‘clash of civilisations’, and whether we can prevent the great war between the cultures."
"There have been quite a few mistakes, and they have already brought us much, much closer to one."
"Finally, I want to extend warm thanks to Commissioner Patten for his cooperation over the past years; perhaps there will be another opportunity for me to do so."
"Today, he has again made it clear that we in the West can succeed with our policies if they are combined with moral integrity."
"I get the feeling that our moral integrity is running low as a result of Guantanamo and much else, because of torture and all the things that are going on there."
"If we do not manage to have moral integrity, we will not have the credibility that is required if we are to shape this process in a reasonable way."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like all of you, I heard the President-in-Office of the Council speak to us of good and bad news, and I felt that he dwelled too much on the good news at the expense of the bad."
"I would like to thank Commissioner Patten for having, with his customary subtlety and frankness, invited us to cross the somewhat simplistic gulfs between Atlanticism and anti-Americanism, between unilateralism and multilateralism."
"That is indeed what we must do."
"Today, though, nearly two years after the onset of this crisis, we have to say that we are facing failure, as none of the aims that were set have been fulfilled, and I am not talking about weapons of mass destruction."
"There is no evidence of the region being stable, democracy has not proved infectious, Iraq is not a safe place, and the fight against terrorism has got nowhere."
"On the contrary, I would even say that military action on its own has led, in Iraq, to a growth in terrorism of all kinds."
"All of that is worthy of condemnation and of serious thought."
"We can take no pleasure in this failure, on the contrary: we have to act, to learn our lessons and try to be effective tomorrow."
"Today, though, what should galvanise us, what should be a priority for this House, is of course the issue of the hostages taken in Iraq – Italians, French, in short, Europeans – along with those accompanying them, whether Iraqis or Syrians."
"We must move to liberate these hostages, for liberty is a precious good, and because it is not just any professions that are under attack; these are journalists, humanitarian activists, workers for NGOs, in short, people who take risks."
"As Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra said, I believe that it is for all their sakes that this House must speak out today, on the basis of the principles of unity and solidarity, in favour of these hostages being released."
"At the same time, this will not mean that we will have finished with Iraq; we have to ask ourselves other questions if we are to be able to take the different political road to which Mr D'Alema referred."
"I will limit myself to setting out a few of them."
"We must therefore call for a change in the nature of the multinational forces."
"I believe it is now time to put this force, for all practical purposes, under the aegis of the Secretary-General of the United Nations."
"All of us, together, must concern ourselves with the democratic process."
"We know that elections are planned for early 2005, but, right now, it has to be said that they are not guaranteed and it is absolutely vital that they should be held under free and fair conditions."
"Finally, I believe that it is now time to call an international conference in support of the political transition and to facilitate the restructuring of Iraq."
"Finally – and this will be the last I shall say at this stage – I believe that we must be more insistent than we have been, more perhaps than the Council has been, on respect for human rights by all the parties on the ground."
"Commissioner Patten said it, as did Mr D'Alema, and it is indeed the case that we are confronted by intolerable images of war depicting an utterly hopeless confrontation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have to get back to Iraq."
"We have to consider what is happening now in the aftermath of the conflict."
"Let me repeat, however, that the priority is for the whole of this House to get behind the efforts to free the hostages, and I call upon all of us, on every side, to accept a resolution to that end, which will proclaim that we speak with one voice."
"Mr President, the present joint draft resolution is both totally harmless and absolutely obvious, so a cynic might argue that we might as well do without it."
"As a pragmatic and experienced politician, I take the view that this draft resolution illustrates in abundance that our European Parliament and its groups experience the same difficulties as the Commission and the Council in getting to grips with the situation in Iraq."
"Like the government in my country, I was myself a firm opponent of the invasion in Iraq."
"In previous capacities, I too have tried to persuade the United States that the invasion of Iraq is one thing, but the establishment of democracy there is something else entirely."
"I have also stated that invading a country is easy for them, but leaving a country is far more difficult and dangerous."
"I too take the view that the world today is a much more dangerous place than before the war in Iraq started."
"The question then arises, though, as to what we in the European Parliament, the European Council, the European Council of Ministers and the European Commission are doing about this much more dangerous place."
"Do we wash our hands of the whole situation, because we did not want it?"
"Are we hoping – or, if we are religious, praying – that everything will perhaps sort itself out miraculously?"
"Or are we taking refuge in the hopeless prospect of the war of civilisations predicted for so long by many, on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean – sometimes appearing to want it to happen?"
"We are all facing the very difficult task of leaving all of this behind us and of reaching unanimity about the future of Iraq, the Middle East and the world as a whole."
"Naturally, all hostages, of whatever nationality and whatever they are doing there, must be released immediately, and it goes without saying that we must all commit ourselves to this objective."
"I would like to conclude by addressing a few words to Commissioner Patten."
"Two weeks ago I had the opportunity to tell him what a great honour and privilege it has been to work with him."
"I would like to ask him, as he rides off into the sunset, not to sing the song 'I am a poor, lonesome cowboy', but to seize the opportunity to put in the occasional mean tango!"
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the recent dramatic events involving hostages – all hostages, Italian, French and Iraqi, for whose unconditional release we are once again appealing here – highlight the extreme gravity of the situation that has been developing in Iraq."
"The allied military commanders themselves now openly admit that part of Iraqi territory is outside their control."
"The military solution is thus revealing just how inadequate it is to solve the problem of terrorism and to ensure Iraq’s transition to democracy."
"In order to lay the bases for a new democratic order, it is not enough to set up an interim provisional government, which is actually a US puppet government and is therefore not recognised by the local population."
"There is only one way to stabilise the situation in Iraq, and that is to withdraw the troops immediately."
"It is not a case of giving in or not to the blackmail of terrorist groups, but rather a case of sending out concrete signs of a change in strategy, whereby the withdrawal of the occupying troops is seen as a precondition for sending in a UN contingent composed of forces from countries not involved in the war."
"The Bush doctrine of pre-emptive war has proved to be tragically wrong and unable to curb terrorism, which has instead spread further precisely in the areas of conflict."
"A worldview based on the exclusive political and economic supremacy of a single country is not sustainable."
"Europe can and must put across an independent and unified foreign policy proposal; it can and must play an ever-greater role in resolving crisis situations such as the one in Iraq."
"We need to make room again for diplomacy and politics."
"International organisations need to be present to guarantee free elections, elections free of any political or economic pressures from the occupation forces."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, representatives of the Member States, the Anglo-Saxon coalition’s invasion of Iraq solved nothing; on the contrary, it made the Iraqis’ living conditions worse and, above all, it enabled militant Islam to spread throughout the Arab world, giving it a new base and new legitimacy."
"What we see there, of course, is no more than the application of the USA’s imperial strategy, which aims to consign the world to an immense conflict of civilisations, one in which the civilised world will be gathered around Washington."
"It is equally evident that what claims to be the European ‘Union’ – a term I put in quotation marks – with its six doomed draft resolutions, none of which – this was last year, as you will recall– obtained anything like a majority, and with its immense jumble of useless and derisory pieties, has remained silent, with a passivity defying belief in the face of a war and a strategy that pits civilisations against each other, with the EU itself the first victim."
"France alone, flanked by Germany – which was, truth to tell, hesitant – and by Russia, which was lamentably weakened, was in the midst of the flurry of trans-Atlantic grovelling, yet again saved the European ideal."
"She did so with such clear emphasis that the world increasingly saw in her a sign of resistance to the empire."
"Indeed, let it be added, the American opposition see her as a symbol of the freedom of peoples, the basic condition for all true democracy."
"We now have the choice between two sorts of resistance: the Islamic resistance that the Americans – who will, one day, be obliged to clear off, just as they did out of Vietnam – certainly intend to leave behind them, and the national, or secular, resistance."
"Europe, the Europe of the Euro-enthusiasts, is certainly incapable of choosing, but it is certain that, in the face of militant Islam, it is on a victory by the national resistance that Mediterranean cooperation – so necessary, yet, alas, so unlikely – depends."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is time to put an end to hypocrisy."
"We are witnessing the geopolitical interests of the United States perpetuating themselves in Iraq."
"Ever since the Second World War, history has been punctuated by unilateral pre-emptive interventions by the great powers."
"A subjugated Europe has never been willing or able to stand up to the aggressiveness of the victors at Yalta."
"The role of the United Nations has been just as ineffective, for any UN resolutions that the great powers have found indigestible have been systematically ignored or sidestepped."
"Interim President Ghazi al Yawar has cancelled his visit to the European Parliament."
"It is worth wondering who wanted or elected him to be president."
"To hold him up as a representative of the Iraqi people is an insult to our intelligence and to that of the people we represent."
"We have to get out of the conflict in Iraq and remove any excuse for the occupation which, far from ensuring security, peace and justice for the Iraqi people, has led to fighting and shameful acts, costs the public purse a fortune, damages interests and increases resentment, endangering the security, peace and prosperity of the peoples of Europe."
"Mr Bot, these should be the objectives of the Council, the Commission, the governments and the Institutions of the European Union."
"– Mr President, the situation in Iraq remains precarious, with the deaths yesterday of 47 innocent Iraqis at the hands of a fanatic suicide bomber – mainly unemployed men seeking work as policemen and willing to try to re-establish law and order in their country and enable free elections to be held next January."
"Whether one agrees with the justification for the war or not, everyone now must sympathise with the long-suffering Iraqi people, who yearn for stability in their country."
"Everyone here must condemn the perpetuation of indiscriminate attacks against the new sovereign government of Dr Allawi and the multinational peacekeeping forces and the barbaric kidnapping and murdering of hostages, solely on the basis of being non-Muslim, or cooperating in rebuilding the country, such as the Italian aid workers."
"Clearly, with hindsight, mistakes have been made in underestimating the scale of resistance, but withdrawing all the coalition troops would only worsen matters."
"Mr D'Alema's request would, in my view, be surrendering to terrorism."
"Syria and Iran have also been extremely unhelpful in allowing Islamist fighters to infiltrate Iraq from their territories."
"I welcome Commissioner Patten's allocation of EUR 300 million in 2003-04 to rebuild Iraq."
"His characteristic eloquence will be sadly missed on all sides of this House."
"I call upon Member States who oppose the war – such as France and Germany – to put this behind them now and support new Nato initiatives to build up security in Iraq."
"After all, we all share a common interest in fighting international terrorism."
"By kidnapping two French journalists, Islamic terrorists have not respected French neutrality, instead blaming France for defending its understandable and much cherished secularism by its banning of the veil in its schools."
"I pray now for the release of all hostages."
"No stone should left unturned to achieve this objective."
"– Mr President, what brings us here today, with confusion in every group, is anguish at the fate of the hostages, and I ask you what the European Union can do to defend those who belong to it?"
"The French journalists and the two young Italian aid workers who were taken hostage are all innocent in this war, and they risk paying for their commitment to a free Iraq with their lives."
"Quite apart from the victims, we must not forget that the whole of the Iraqi people have been held hostage and that each new bloodbath brings fresh chaos."
"The confusions are beyond number and I shall mention only two of them."
"As the violence spirals, we are becoming unable to distinguish between victim and executioner, confusing resistance fighters with terrorists, the unfortunate fate of soldiers killed in action with that of civilian victims of what we euphemistically describe as excessive force."
"To be sure, those who kill hostages are unscrupulous criminals, but the origins of the tragedy and violence that are rife in Iraq are to be found elsewhere and nothing can excuse such things as the random missile strike on the Bradley tank last Sunday at a time when the wounded soldiers had been evacuated."
"These strikes killed children, civilians, and a Palestinian journalist."
"One day, international law will demand that justice be done."
"Let me turn to the second confusion."
"Islam has many faces; we often see it in the darkest light, but the extraordinary outcome of the siege of Najaf and the courage of French Muslims in committing themselves to the release of the hostages show us that moderate Islam can play a part in bringing peace."
"This is something we will have to remember in other contexts."
"We live in the – perhaps illusory – hope that, in 2005, free elections will be held and a government enjoying popular legitimacy will be formed."
"We ask the Commission and the Council to do everything possible to fulfil this hope."
"As Mr D'Alema said, the Iraq war has been a tragic mistake, and we cannot make history anew, but – and I say this to Mr Tannock – there is a point at which we must be able to recognise our own mistakes if we are to be able to rectify them."
"Mr President, the civil war in Iraq has inevitably meant that in recent months the media have focused almost exclusively on security."
"However, behind the headlines there is another agenda already in operation, and that is where the European Union should be involved."
"This is an absolute priority: the building of a peaceful society."
"Capacity–building, the fight against corruption, strengthening the fight against organised crime and bringing in human rights and the rule of law – these words are familiar to us."
"They are weapons of dialogue that we use every day of the week in turning post–Communist states into Member States of the European Union or wider Europe neighbours, away from totalitarianism and tyranny and towards democracy."
"Iraq is in just that condition today."
"The Iraqis are just like us: they share the same desire for freedom and for a settled society."
"Beneath the veil, behind the tribal dress, beyond the cultural differences of East and West, Iraq and Iraqis have the same high hopes of the essential freedoms and the rule of law that we Europeans and Americans enjoy. They look to us to help institute those freedoms and the fundamental freedom of human rights."
"The European Union should focus now on building that agenda with Iraq."
"It is a possibility."
"It is happening now, away from the guns, bombs and rockets, and that is what we should be involved in."
"I ask you to remember that under Saddam Hussein Iraqis had no such freedoms, no access to human rights."
"That is the reason why, even now, today, with bombs and rockets, with the difficulties of security, the majority of Iraqis prefer to be without the previous regime and in the situation they are in now."
"We should help Iraq build a peaceful society."
"– Mr President, the war in Iraq drags on, and Allied troops continue to kill civilians as they bombard cities on a daily basis."
"In terms of day-to-day life there, Iraq is very much a society at war, with battles, raids, hostage taking and the vicious circle of violence."
"It is, in essence, the war of aggression waged on Iraq that lies behind the present calamitous situation, which is getting worse from day to day."
"On the assumption that the interpreter got it right, Mr Bot said that ‘the occupation was brought to an end’, which is obviously nonsense."
"We call for the occupation to really be brought to an end, which means the withdrawal of the occupying forces."
"What is NATO doing?"
"What is the European Union doing?"
"NATO’s involvement in Iraq is ongoing; will NATO troops be going there once NATO has trained the Iraqi security forces?"
"It is obvious that the EU does not want to be left out; in contravention of international law, it seeks to push through an open market economy system in Iraq, and more and more private security firms from EU Member States are getting involved in the war."
"We are now thinking in terms of an EU force under the UN’s mandate."
"That is something to which we must say ‘no’; it must not be allowed to happen."
"We must not allow the EU to be involved in the war in Iraq or to support the occupation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing the EU’s declaration on Iraq."
"The very idea of issuing such a declaration ties in with the general belief that the European Union has something resembling a foreign policy."
"There is no such thing as European public opinion, and there can therefore be no EU foreign policy."
"The Iraq issue is the best possible example of this."
"Each of the Member States has its own foreign policy and its own opinion on Iraq."
"Within each Member State it is also possible to observe a diversity of opinion on foreign policy, but each state has its own government authorised by the voters to conduct foreign policy."
"The European Union has not been authorised in this way."
"What, therefore, is the point of a declaration on Iraq?"
"It is an attempt to impose upon us all the belief that this House has a mandate to conduct foreign policy."
"This is not true, as we do not have such a mandate."
"The European Union may provide humanitarian aid both in the case of Iraq and in the case of many other conflicts taking place throughout the world, and it may also offer its services as mediator and negotiator, provided that all sides in the conflict want the EU to do so."
"Political proposals would, however, be out of place, as we do not have the authority to conduct a common foreign policy."
"Mr President, the debate on Iraq has, so far, often been about how long it is taking to normalise the situation there, and there has been a lot of criticism from different quarters about developments in Iraq."
"Questions such as ‘Are things better now?’ have been heard, and people wonder whether the military presence really is leading to peace."
"To those who wonder whether that is the case, I can put a question: have you ever stood in the thick of a raging war and really wished that some outside force – the United States, the EU or NATO – would come and intervene in your country?"
"That is something I myself have done, and I also have a definite answer to that question: yes, a military presence can lead to peace."
"In the European Parliament, I represent Sweden, but I was born and brought up in the Balkans, a part of Europe that has seen many wars and a great deal of suffering."
"I have experienced war in Bosnia, and I know that it is extremely easy to start a war and extremely difficult to bring it to an end."
"It is still more difficult, and takes a still longer period of time, to re-build a country, and that much longer again to get people to begin to trust each other once more."
"I have a feeling that those who now criticise the process in Iraq have never even been near a war."
"That also makes me think of the saying, ‘Those who are well fed do not understand those who are hungry.’"
"It is so easy to see obstacles and problems and identify what might be done better and more quickly, but the fact is that many of the current problems in Iraq are an old legacy from Saddam Hussein’s dictatorship."
"The fact too is that today’s Iraq without Saddam is a better Iraq."
"We must ensure that we are involved and make our contribution so that the Iraq of tomorrow is a still better Iraq."
"Where the Balkans are concerned, the surrounding world has realised and accepted that it takes a long time to re-build a country, both literally and figuratively, but there is extremely limited understanding of the fact that development towards peace and democracy in Iraq will take time."
"Now, the EU must rally around our values of freedom and, united, actively support the forces that wish to build a new Iraq, a sovereign and democratic country that takes its place in the international community."
"Mr President, unlike the naive and sometimes cynical voices that have been heard in this House, the Commission, through its representatives, has presented a rational assessment of the situation in Iraq."
"It must be recognised that state and institution building is taking place."
"It must also be recognised that violence is escalating, and that this violence is being used as an instrument of political pressure both in Iraq and against countries that decided to participate militarily and politically in the rebuilding of an Iraqi state."
"This is a turning point, and either Iraq will win through with the support of the international community, or major destabilisation will occur."
"There is a chance of success, but this requires determination and a correct assessment of the situation."
"I would like to pay tribute to the soldiers and civilians risking their lives in Iraq."
"They are there in the interests of the Iraqi population and are protecting the lives of those people."
"I would also like to say that in taking this risk upon themselves, they are acting primarily on behalf of the Iraqi people."
"Thank you, Mr President, Commissioner Patten. It is not the first time we are talking about Iraq in this House, and that is only natural since the events in Iraq dominate the international news."
"The reports of terrible violence and of terrorism directed against women, children and civilians – mainly Iraqis of course, but also foreign journalists, aid workers, business people and military personnel – are alarming."
"The kidnappings are absolutely abominable, and it is good that we in this House are, in any case, one hundred per cent in agreement about our demand that those kidnapped should be released and that the violence must cease."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe naturally condemns all types of violence and calls upon the Iraqi authority to ensure that legal proceedings are taken against the people responsible."
"In this context, we would also regret the fact that the death penalty has been reintroduced."
"In common with many other countries in many other parts of the world, we are split on the Iraq issue, and this has meant that we have only been able to agree upon a fairly watered down resolution."
"I nonetheless hope that we can put the past behind us and look forwards."
"The whole world has a responsibility for supporting the Iraqi people and developments towards a democratic and sovereign Iraq able to take its place in the international community."
"We in the EU can offer support in many ways in cooperation with the UN and international bodies."
"We have a role to play when it comes to supporting the election, the economy, the construction of a civil society and the devising of a democratic constitution."
"In the future, a UN-led multinational force must accept responsibility for security in Iraq, and this is an area in which the EU and its neighbouring countries can play an important role."
"Naturally, the ultimate responsibility lies with the Iraqi people, but we all have a responsibility for ensuring that this process succeeds, both for the sake of Iraq and in the interests of stability throughout the region."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have serious doubts as to whether the actions of the European Parliament can influence the situation in Iraq."
"In any case, what is happening demonstrates the splits within the European Union and the lack of a foreign policy, in that 12 countries are present, 12 more are absent and one has withdrawn."
"It should also be noted that there is a lack of a common feeling of being European."
"In fact, every time there are killings or kidnappings, nobody asks whether European citizens were involved, but the Italians ask if there were any Italians, the Spanish if there were any Spaniards, the Greeks if there were any Greeks, the French if there were any French people, and so on. This observation is highly significant for those who at all costs want Europe to have a role, because such division will not allow it to have one."
"Lastly, with regard to the institutional situation, I believe that the principle of the self-determination of peoples should be fully applied to the minorities in Iraq."
"The autonomy or independence of the Kurds or of the other peoples living in Iraq should be decided neither by a foreign power nor by representatives of the old or new regimes."
"–The debate is adjourned at this point for the vote and will continue immediately after it."
"We now come to the vote(1)."
"That concludes the voting."
". I voted in favour of setting up a temporary committee on policy challenges and budgetary means of the enlarged Union 2007-2013, because it strikes me as crucial that we monitor this process very carefully, and gather and coordinate points of view on the different items of the budget that Parliament will evaluate through its various parliamentary committees."
"Parliament’s political priorities in these negotiations must be in line with the structure of the new financial perspective."
"I feel that it is crucial that Parliament’s final position should be incorporated into the Council’s common position, so that the negotiations can begin in a climate of mutual understanding of the European Project’s orientation in the near future."
"I feel that this process must make use of internal coherence comprising all of the institutions’ assets and that all efforts must be channelled not only into the negotiations themselves, but, most importantly, into placing greater value on the aims of the Lisbon Strategy, and on an energetic economic and social cohesion policy that will continue to enable convergence in levels of well-being among the peoples of the various Member States."
". Although we voted in favour of setting up a temporary committee on political priorities and budgetary means of the future financial perspective 2007-2013, there are two questions that we would like to see resolved."
"Firstly, the committee’s work must not be allowed to replace, reduce or subordinate the parallel work, in accordance with procedure, that will take place in the other parliamentary committees."
"This committee must bring added value, in close cooperation and in discussion with the various parliamentary committees, and must not be a motive for blocking or watering down."
"It is obvious, as far as we are concerned, that opinions on the regulations of the different funds proposed, specifically at the levels of cohesion, social affairs and the productive economy, must be developed in the relevant parliamentary committees."
"Secondly, different political and nationality groups must be guaranteed representation."
"We therefore welcome the fact that an agreement has been reached to increase the size of this committee to 50 members, provided that this representation is guaranteed."
". I voted in favour of Parliament setting up this temporary committee on policy challenges and budgetary means of the European Union."
"I sincerely hope that the guidance of the group chairmen and of the Conference of Presidents was passed on, as they consider that this historical moment and its practical implications for a Europe of over 450 million citizens justifies this particular committee."
"This methodology must enable the views of the different committees concerned to be gathered, considered and coordinated, thereby contributing to a more precise definition of Parliament’s political priorities, which will be reflected in the future financial perspectives."
"This must not serve to weaken positions already taken by Parliament, clearly opposed to reducing EU resources or abandoning, or simply weakening, the aims and policies of cohesion."
"This is not a matter, in my view, of setting a new starting point."
"On the contrary, this temporary committee must at least adopt the Commission’s proposal on the financial perspectives and must seek to set more ambitious targets as regards the EU’s budgetary resources. It must also move more quickly in its cohesion aims."
"This is the challenge in these times of an enlarged Union and the new constitutional Treaty."
"We believe that the European Union’s policy on fisheries agreements must be reviewed."
"Over-exploitation of fishing waters forces people into ever-greater poverty and robs the marine environment of a vital link in the food chain."
"It would be better if those countries with which the EU signs fisheries agreements were instead given assistance so that they themselves could develop their own fisheries."
"We do not accept Amendment No 7 by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, whereby the Commission would be given an independent source of income."
"We believe that, if the EU concludes a fisheries agreement with a third country, the total amount of the financial compensation for this third country must be funded by those EU Member States whose fishing vessels exploit the relevant opportunities under the agreement."
"Those Member States might then each themselves decide whether they, in turn, are to fund this expenditure by imposing taxes upon their respective fishing vessels."
". I voted in favour of the report by Mr Morillon on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol defining, for the period 3 December 2003 to 2 December 2007, the fishing opportunities and the financial compensation provided for by the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Government of Mauritius on fishing in the waters of Mauritius, because I feel that it is crucial to coordinate the protection of the EU’s interests in the area of fishing with the management of maritime resources and with the development of the populations that depend on fishing."
"The EU must make an accurate assessment of the sustainability of fishing agreements with third countries, given that specific measures have taken on greater importance in the correct implementation of Community actions aimed at developing local communities, especially coastal communities that rely on traditional fishing."
"Community tuna shipowners will also be protected, through measures imposing greater control over fishing activities aimed at combating illegal fishing. Those measures will make a contribution towards ensuring responsible fishing in the Indian Ocean."
". It has become vitally important to safeguard fishing opportunities for Community fleets, in particular the Portuguese fleet, in third-country exclusive economic zones, not only from the point of view of economics and of safeguarding jobs, but also the survival of countless regions that depend on fishing in the EU, in particular the outermost regions."
"Much of the Portuguese distant water fishing fleet has been disappearing owing to the fact that opportunities have been decreasing and the cost of licences increasing, and that the common fisheries policy rewards those who scrap boats and is set to stop giving aid for repairing fleets – in this respect Portugal has been an ‘exemplary pupil’."
"This also leads us to feel that the amendments aimed at passing on the costs to the tuna shipowners do not make sense."
"These agreements, which are commercial in nature, may also contribute towards the sustainable management of fishing resources and towards the development of local fishing communities."
"The current Fisheries Protocol, which runs until 2 December 2007, will enable the seven Portuguese surface longliners to continue to operate as they have been doing."
"The issue here is the conclusion of another fishing agreement between the EU and various Indian Ocean countries, in this case Mauritius. This agreement, with the necessary adaptations, extends the successive agreements concluded in the field since 1989."
"Although this a relatively modest agreement from a financial point of view and solely concerns tuna, the highly migratory nature of the species makes this agreement even more important to Community tuna shipowners."
"The agreement also makes economic sense given that the value of catches far exceeds the cost of the protocol to the EU."
"The further advantages of concluding the agreement, such as creating jobs on fishing vessels, in ports, auctions, processing factories, shipyards and service industries both in the EU and in Mauritius itself, strike me as similarly beneficial."
"Given that right now seven of the 90 Community vessels in Mauritian waters are Portuguese, I voted in favour of the report before us, as I feel that the amendments suggested by the rapporteur add value to this Proposal for a Regulation."
". These fisheries deals show the European Union in its worst possible light: greedy, exploitative and behaving like a colonial power."
"Over the last five years I have campaigned against this appalling environmental degradation and tried to highlight the human cost to the indigenous black African communities."
"In 2003 and early 2004 over 100 MEPs had, at last, begun to listen."
"Now I see that opposition has fallen to 70 or 80."
"The reason, I am told, is that the deals have been reformed."
"But I would be very cautious about the word 'reform' in an EU context."
"Invariably it is meaningless."
"In the case of Africa, it means that some aspects of the deal may be slightly less bad."
"It is the whole principle that is wrong and that is why UKIP will continue to oppose these deals until that tragic continent gets its fishing grounds back."
". I voted in favour of the report by Mr Morillion on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol defining for the period 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2006 the tuna fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Democratic Republic of Madagascar on fishing off Madagascar, because I am in favour of responsible and sustainable fishing."
"This Protocol sets fishing opportunities for the Community tuna fleet and promotes the development of cooperation based on respect for the laws and regulations under Malagasy national fisheries policy."
"The new Protocol’s global cost is identical to that of the previous Protocol."
"This agreement is equally crucial to the Malagasy economy, providing an important source of currency and creating jobs for local seamen, as well as in the processing industry and surveillance activities."
". This eighth Protocol to the Fisheries Agreement with the Democratic Republic of Madagascar runs until the end of 2006 and defines the tuna fishing opportunities for Community fleets – which include six Portuguese surface longliners – pursuant to the other agreements on tuna concluded by the Community with Indian Ocean countries, which we broadly welcome."
"Nevertheless, one question that raises a number of doubts is the so-called exclusivity clause, which suggests that vessels flying the flag of a Member State cannot obtain a licence by any means other than this Protocol."
"In practice, it will be forbidden to make any further agreements, such as bilateral agreements, which strikes us as excessive and also constitutes interference in the internal politics of individual Member States. This is particularly so given that there are countries that enjoy traditional, historical relations that are not covered by the Community Agreement."
". This agreement, which focuses solely on tuna, is another of the agreements concluded by the EU with Indian Ocean countries, enabling the European fleet to continue to operate in the waters off Madagascar."
"I feel that the EU’s fisheries policy must stress the need for transparency, which is especially important in agreements of this nature, the objective of which is not simply about European interests."
"Indeed, the development of the Malagasy economy, respect for the environment and the sustainability of the fishing effort in Madagascar’s territorial waters are three areas that must not be overlooked in this Protocol."
"I share the rapporteur’s concern that the Malagasy Government must take steps to monitor fisheries activities more closely. Otherwise, the balance of resources and his assertion that coastal communities must benefit from this Protocol will be in jeopardy."
"I therefore voted in favour."
". I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters concerning the extension of the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Cape Verde on fishing off the coast of Cape Verde for the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005, given the mutual benefits for both the Community and for Cape Verde that will result from the conclusion of this agreement."
"We understand that this extension is an attempt to improve certain aspects of this agreement, in view of the fact that the authorities of this country, of which the official language is Portuguese, do not have a reliable study of the state of resources and of the repercussions of the targeted measures designed to develop Cape Verde’s fisheries sector. Cape Verde and its fishing communities can only benefit if this situation is rectified."
"We welcome this report in view of its social and economic importance to the Republic of Cape Verde and to those countries whose fleets are involved – the Spanish, Portuguese and French fleets – amounting to 117 vessels. The report focuses mainly on tuna, but also covers demersal species."
"The extension of the current fisheries agreement for a further year – until 30 June 2005 – will enable tuna shipowners to pursue their fisheries activities in the exclusive economic zone of Cape Verde, including the two Portuguese pole-and-line vessels and the ten Portuguese surface longliners. The Portuguese fleet is, furthermore, allowed to catch up to 630 gross registered tonnes (GRT) by bottom trawling."
"These fishing opportunities appear miniscule, however, in view of the traditional and historical relations between Portugal and Cape Verde, but this is also a reflection of the fisheries policies of a CFP that has gradually led to the destruction of distant water fishing fleets, as in the case of the Portuguese fleet."
". The issue before us is the extension of the fisheries Protocol between the EU and Cape Verde for the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005, which focuses mainly on tuna and which is intended to enable Community tuna shipowners to continue to pursue their fisheries activities in the exclusive economic zone of Cape Verde."
"The Commission says that a thorough assessment of the current Protocol must be carried out for this relationship with Cape Verde to continue, and for a new agreement for the coming years to be concluded."
"Like the rapporteur, I feel that this commitment by the Commission is opportune and welcome."
"In view of the advantages for Community tuna shipowners, of the fact that the value of the catches far exceeds the cost of the agreement, of the mutual benefits for both the EU and Cape Verde and of the fact that these catches can supply the Community market, I must welcome the conclusion of this Protocol, which has been improved by the proposals tabled by the rapporteur."
"I voted in favour."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is abundantly obvious that the situation in Iraq is gradually deteriorating."
"Guerrilla fighting is spreading and the number of terrorist acts is rising."
"Last Sunday, 600 attacks of this type occurred."
"The position of the interim government is weakening, and there is a risk that the political process outlined in Security Council Resolution 1546 will be brought to a halt."
"Elections are meant to take place by 31 January 2005."
"If they do not, the constitution will not be adopted and a final, permanent government will not be appointed in early 2006."
"This means we are currently at a turning point, and that either Iraq will take action to abide by the timetable outlined in Resolution 1546, or the entire reconstruction of the country will be brought to a halt."
"This leads to the question as to how to proceed."
"Firstly, the military coalition should not be weakened, as the socialists wish, and troops should not be withdrawn."
"Instead, the military contingent should be increased, as the present number of around 200 000 soldiers is quite inadequate to stabilise the situation in Iraq."
"Secondly, the UN’s role in Iraq should gradually be stepped up, and it should go beyond its current role as midwife to the democratic process."
"Thirdly, and as set out in the motion for a resolution on Iraq by members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, it is important for the European Union to be extremely active in its support for the transformation of Iraq in various fields, on the premise that Iraq is our joint responsibility, the joint responsibility of all Europeans and that of the entire European Union."
"It is important to provide political backing, supporting the measures taken by the interim government, and later by the permanent Iraqi authorities."
"Expert support is also needed, in creating police forces, for example."
"Humanitarian and financial support on a far greater scale than this year is required too."
"A democratic Iraq should not be held hostage to last year’s arguments in Europe."
"Mr Bot said that Iraq is a divisive issue."
"It should not be, and a line should be drawn under the arguments of the past year."
"Iraq’s future requires all of us and the entire European Union to be fully mobilised, as was and is the case for reconstruction in the Balkans."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we in Europe have had very divergent opinions on the war in Iraq, but the disaster in that country, which is there for all to see, has unfortunately confirmed that the fears that many of us expressed were well founded."
"It is now urgent to try to bring a stop to the chaos and violence, even if it is difficult to talk of peace and democracy when every day is marked by kidnappings, murders, guerrilla attacks, terrorist ambushes and air bombardments."
"Europe is being called upon to act and Parliament itself must take a more active investigative and steering role in such a decisive matter of foreign policy."
"I believe, therefore, that the Presidency of the European Council should resolve to take part in an international conference on Iraq as soon as possible with a view to the multilateral management of the crisis, which should involve the United Nations, the major world powers and all those countries with an interest in the region, that is, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Syria."
"To promote this path to restoring peace, Europe needs to take strong, united action that is clearly in favour of dialogue with the Islamic world and strongly against terrorism and all kinds of violence."
"I thank Commissioner Patten for his very lucid and effective speech."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly appreciated Commissioner Patten’s words, but it is with great disappointment and concern that I note that the text of the joint motion for a resolution on the situation in Iraq that has been put before us is a serious step backwards compared with Parliament’s condemnation of the United States’ pre-emptive war that was issued early in 2003."
"Today, faced with the political and military disaster of the occupation, we cannot even demand or envisage the withdrawal of the occupying foreign troops and we avoid the need to identify those responsible for the current situation."
"I see no political realism."
"The evidence says that a mass uprising of the people is under way against the occupying powers and against a government that does not represent the country."
"The terrorist presence cannot hide that fact."
"Indeed, as Mr D’Alema said as well, it is the presence of foreign troops that is attracting and causing the terrorism."
"If it does not make a stand, Europe is in serious danger of finding itself in a few months’ time not only facing an even more widespread disaster but also of being jointly responsible for it."
"Under these conditions, the elections planned for January 2005, if they take place, will be neither free nor fair."
"Condemning terrorism without saying who and what created the whole situation means we are hiding our heads in the sand."
"I believe we should send out a different signal to public opinion in the Arab and Islamic world and also to public opinion in Europe, the major part of which is hostile to the war, calling first of all for an immediate halt to the bombing."
"Otherwise we all shall miss a great opportunity to contribute to justice and peace and to influence the international situation for the good."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Commissioner Patten for the work he has done."
"I wish him all the best – drive carefully, Commissioner!"
"Mr President, it is obvious that Iraq and the world are better places without Saddam than with Saddam."
"It does not help to blame others in this difficult situation; instead we should look ahead."
"Mankind has to answer the question of what we are to do with tyrants, despots who kill their own people or those of another country."
"Human suffering, whether it is in one’s own or another country, is always the same."
"There was no help from the League of Nations when Stalin attacked Finland."
"What is the role of the United Nations today?"
"To maintain world order we need a revamped UN."
"We need a UN with a Security Council and a UN on which there is also a seat for the EU."
"Before we can do this, however, we need a common EU foreign policy."
"Now, the issue of Iraq has split the EU, and the EU cannot play the role we should be able to in securing world peace, or peace in Iraq, because we are so divided."
"It is important for us to help Iraq on a wide front in this difficult situation."
"We must do all we can to combat terrorism, including its causes, as otherwise tomorrow we will find bombs in our own homes."
"We must do all we can to help Iraq to develop democracy, to develop civil government."
"Now is not the time to hide our heads in the sand."
"I am disappointed that the resolution makes no mention of prohibiting the death penalty."
"The Iraqi constitution should definitely contain a mention of the prohibition of the death penalty, as the protection of life is a basic value, the starting-point for everything."
"Finally, this is an opportunity to show the international community and the EU whether we are capable of leadership and keeping overall control of the situation, or whether we are just content with discussing the politics of the day."
"– Mr President, I should like to start by expressing my solidarity with and support for the European citizens – the two French journalists and the two Italian aid workers – being held hostage in Iraq."
"Their continuing captivity is causing serious injury to the European Union itself and its contribution to the reconstruction of Iraq."
"We must all strengthen our cooperation and join our voices to obtain their immediate release."
"Iraq is sinking deeper and deeper into violence and instability and is now lacking even fundamental security."
"Every day, the political process of transition to free elections, as provided for in UN Security Council Resolution 1546, is being undermined."
"The departure of the international and European aid workers will be a defeat for the international community and, more importantly, for the European Union."
"Last June we all welcomed unanimous Security Council resolution 1546 marking the start of the political process which would result in free elections and a new democratic constitution."
"Despite the legalisation of the occupying forces as a multinational force by the Security Council, the occupation continues; it is a fact of life and the source and main reason for the continuing conflict."
"Under these circumstances, who truly believes that the timetable set out in Resolution 1546 will be adhered to, who believes that it can guarantee smooth political process, who believes that the UN can play the leading role in Iraq?"
"The European Union must play its own autonomous role, make its own analysis of the security situation and proceed with its own analysis of the role and composition of and prospects for the multinational force."
"The 2004 Commission communication is important, just as the role of Commissioner Patten is important."
"However, I fear that they cannot be implemented."
"The European Commission and the Council of Ministers must proceed at once to draft a report evaluating the security situation in Iraq, just as an international initiative must be taken to convene an international conference."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during the debate I have listened to learned, elaborate speeches about geopolitics, with which in fact I agree to a great extent."
"It is, however, quite clear that, despite a declared common European feeling, Europe – and the Council in particular – will do nothing for the four European citizens who are being held hostage right now by the terrorists."
"Europe – and the Council in particular – will do nothing to make these four European citizens stop being considered just Italians or just French; stop being just journalists, doing a job assigned to those who feel they have a duty to report the truth; stop being just international aid workers, doing a job assigned to those who feel they have a duty to work for the common good; and start being adopted simply as children of Europe."
"This observation, though bitter, is not intended to be one of resignation, and in fact I continue to call insistently for the immediate release of all the hostages, without making them undergo any further ordeals, and for support for all efforts to achieve this outcome."
"With its people, its volunteers and its solidarity, including in peacekeeping or crisis containment operations, Italy has always done its utmost for the good of the population in the Italian areas of activity."
"The two Italian women volunteers, like so many others, are there to help, to protect the weak and to do good."
"That is why we want them released, together with all the other hostages."
"We also ask that the body of Enzo Baldoni be returned and, in this respect, we ask for his family to be shown pity as well."
"We must not now allow the ideal that those two young women embody to be held in check, for there is a real possibility to build a sense of the common good and brotherhood within the Iraqi mind."
"Those two women and the two journalists are genuine representatives of Europe."
"Mr President, one aspect of this debate that angers me is that neither the Council nor the Commission have had a word to say about women, who make up the majority of the population in Iraq, not a word about their exclusion from the transitional government or the process of democratisation."
"OK, so we want free elections, but what about Iraq’s female majority?"
"The Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality organised a hearing with Iraqi women, at which the hope was expressed that we would provide outside help, highlighting painful issues as we did in Afghanistan, and that women could be involved in the process of democratisation."
"For that reason, we women in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament want this aid with reconstruction to be tied to the stipulation that women be fully involved."
"No matter what the terror, hope must not be allowed to die, and it is through women and children that it lives on – the hope that they will again be able to work as police officers, as politicians, as doctors, and as university professors, as they did under Saddam, dictator though he was."
"That, I believe, is why we must not forget, while demanding the immediate release of the hostages, that Iraq’s women, too, have to be set free."
"The instability and terror that Iraq is currently enduring, and the recent nominal restoration of sovereignty in the country, with the establishment of an Interim Government, go to show the complexity of the process of creating a secure, stable and democratic Iraq."
"The EU must, however, play a part in that process, in these turbulent and dangerous times for all of us."
"Accordingly, the direction taken by European cooperation with Iraq is consistent with the process of reconstructing the country and restoring democracy."
"We must, now more than ever, be conscious of the thin line separating internal security and external security. Consequently, new approaches to cooperation are needed that go beyond bloody-minded unilateral acts, which are no longer acceptable and are little more than representations of outdated debate, as has already been said in this House."
"Nowadays, when anything can be deemed a target, it has become even more necessary for our alliances to remain firm in that fight. No effort must be spared against the endless horrors of terrorism."
"Europe must set an example of firmness in condemning terrorist attacks against civilians, the police, soldiers of the multinational force and civilian hostages. Parliament must bring all of its political weight and influence to bear to ensure that those hostages are released immediately."
"We must also support the Interim Government’s intention to press ahead, in spite of all the difficulties, with preparations for free and democratic elections in January 2005."
"When time appears to be against the Iraqi people who want to be able to prepare the route towards democracy and the dismantling of terrorist networks operating in the country, we have no doubt that the EU and its Member States share this commitment to support the Iraqi people in reconstructing a country that is secure, democratic, unified and prosperous, a country at peace within its borders, a country that wants to re-establish working relations with its neighbours and with the rest of the world."
"Mr President, Parliament must not waver in the face of the complex nature of these times. We must remain firm in our societies, our alliances must remain solid and loyal and, most importantly, our actions must form part of a concerted struggle for the peace, stability and prosperity to which Iraq and the Iraqi people are unquestionably entitled."
"After all, Mr President, nobody wishes to see this fail."
"Mr President, my observations are, above all, inspired by my role as member of the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"I realise that although the EU’s role is modest for the time being, it can nevertheless help determine the quality of democracy in future."
"My questions are concrete and I should say beforehand that I welcome the proposal by the President-in-Office of the Council to perhaps send a fact-finding mission to Iraq later on this year."
"My first question is about spending EU funding in Iraq itself."
"It appears to me that for practical considerations, it has been decided to spend these monies mainly via the existing, traditional channels in a bid to make the greatest possible impact."
"However, as a result of this, it looks as if minorities, and I am particularly referring to the Assyrian minority, which accounts for 10% of the population and mainly consists of Christians, are at risk of falling by the wayside."
"That would be harrowing, because they also suffered the effects of Saddam Hussein’s arabisation programme, and are now also suffering repression in the Kurdish region."
"Could the Commission, and also the Council, say a little more about how the funds will be spent, particularly where this minority and other small minorities are concerned?"
"My second point concerns the draft constitution, in which Arabic and Kurdish are recognised as official languages."
"Assyrian, however, is not, despite the fact that more than 10% of the population speak it."
"What role can the European Union play on this score in order to guarantee the positions of minorities and also in respect of minority languages in the new Iraq and Iraqi society?"
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I can say that I have listened with great interest, and also with much appreciation, to the many contributions today about this sensitive issue."
"I should like to say that after everything that has happened, we would do well to look ahead instead of heaping reproaches on one another."
"I think that that is what we should do, because our ultimate goal is not to leave the Iraqi people in the lurch."
"That is why we need to constantly remind ourselves of what our goals are."
"First of all, I think that we have to ensure that the political process is completed, as has also been clearly explained in Resolution 1546."
"I also think that the European Union is determined to make a constructive and effective contribution to that effect."
"We could, for example, help to ensure that everything in the election process runs smoothly and that all Iraqis can actually take part."
"We could help install a legal government, and ensure that, once that legal government is in place, it is also supported by effective administration."
"In short, I think that we must seek to introduce in that stricken country the values we regard as so important."
"Democracy, something that Iraq has lacked for so long, springs to mind."
"I am also thinking of human rights and respect for them, and I can tell you that that also includes women, something that was quite rightly pointed out earlier."
"I am thinking of respect for minorities, including the Assyrian minority, which is another of that country’s problems to which sufficient attention will need to be paid."
"I am thinking about the establishment of a constitutional state and the way in which we, the European Union, backed by our extensive experience, with the contribution we can make to restoring a true, independent, legal body with judges who truly render judgment, with everything that is involved in this and what is important, can train these people and give them guidance."
"Someone has also pointed out the importance of the neighbouring countries. This is a view that I readily support."
"As I already stated in my first intervention, during my meetings with the Prime Minister and ministers during my visit to Iraq, I noted that the European Union will gladly accept an invitation to take part in the next conference of neighbouring countries."
"After all, as has been said several times on this platform, stability in Iraq also means stability in the region."
"Peace and democracy in Iraq will also rub off on the neighbouring countries."
"I think that we should do our utmost, firstly, to ensure that peace and democracy are in place in Iraq itself."
"Therefore, once we have managed to bridge the differences of opinion which existed, we as European Union should also be able to make our presence clearly felt in Iraq."
"I know how much this is appreciated and wanted by the present government."
"I therefore think that we cannot avoid our responsibilities and that we must actually follow the clear trajectory that we have mapped out."
"The Dutch Presidency will ensure that this is done."
"I have clearly set out those goals."
"I have also explained that we have sent an exploratory mission, that we will now send a follow-up mission and that, based on this, we will very shortly state how we can give substance to this."
"That is our aim, and I hope that I will be able to report on the results at the end of our presidency."
"–The debate is closed."
"I have received six motions for resolutions to wind up the debate on the situation in Iraq in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.(1)"
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday."
"– Having learnt the lessons from previous experiences and failures, this was to be a surgical operation; complete in a matter of days, weapons of mass destruction located and eliminated, a dictator toppled, a democracy – another democracy – installed."
"Days passed; the days ran into weeks, and then months. We are now measuring the time in terms of years; the weapons never existed (as we knew); a country is being occupied against the will of its people, who are resisting; the war goes on, in increasingly dramatic fashion; the casualty figures mount up, from dozens, with names and faces, to thousands, who are anonymous and do not count towards the statistics."
"What is more, some political positions appear to be held hostage by hostage taking."
"The United States has installed military bases in that part of the Middle East whilst in Palestine violence against Palestinians has reared its head again, the price of oil has risen, thereby demonstrating all the inconsistency of an economy that is entirely dependent on oil, of a globalised economy that is in thrall to finance and speculation."
"In the countries of the EU, since the initial split, there has been relative unity in search of a share of the spoils of occupation and reconstruction."
"There are those, however, who have denounced this enormous sham, and it is essential that they do so because people now have access to information that was previously non-existent or much less complete."
"Let us fight to ensure that positions of this ..."
"The Minutes of yesterday’s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I would like to intervene on behalf of Mr Pannella of the Italian Radicals, who is in Italy, to make a point of order regarding the calendar."
"I am informed that Mr Pannella was refused the right to amend the calendar by the Presidency in the same way that I was two years ago, as it threatened the twelve Strasbourg part-sessions, albeit within the letter of the Treaties."
"In Parliament's verbatim report it fails to register your statement that 'no amendments were submitted'."
"In fact, of course, none were permitted."
"Can you ensure that the verbatim report accurately reflects what you actually stated, which is now being taped for verification purposes?"
"Thank you, Mr Tannock. Your comment will appear in the Minutes, which will be corrected to reflect precisely what happened."
"The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission Statements on the Stability and Growth Pact."
". Mr President, we had an interesting meeting in Scheveningen."
"The discussion was based on three papers."
"First, a Commission communication on the Stability and Growth Pact; second, a Court ruling on the excessive deficit procedure with reference to Germany and France; and third, a statement by the European Council on the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Ministers agreed that the Commission communication offered a good basis for discussion."
"The discussion was held in two parts."
"First, we had a long discussion in the euro group with the 12."
"Next, we discussed these conclusions in the group of 25, because the other 13 hope to become members of EMU as soon as possible."
"The first conclusion we came to – contrary to some press interpretations – is that Ministers are not seeking to water down the pact, but rather want it to be strengthened, clarified and better implemented."
"Of course, the discussions could not be concluded in a single day, so we gave our collaborators some political guidance to enable them to work on the question in the future, together with the Commission."
"The first thing we noticed is that, contrary to what is sometimes thought, the Stability Pact has proven its usefulness in anchoring budget deficits."
"If you compare, for example, the budget deficits in the Member States during the current slowdown with earlier slowdowns, or with what is happening elsewhere in the world, it can be seen that the pact has contributed to lower deficit levels than we would otherwise have seen."
"If you also look at interest rates and inflation, we can be pleased with the effects of the combined budgetary and monetary policy."
"The second point we agreed upon is that we will not change anything as far as the 3% or 60% criteria are concerned – these are in the Treaty, are of paramount importance and should not be changed."
"We also agreed that a rule-based system remains the best guarantee for ensuring that commitments are enforced for all Member States in an equal way."
"We agreed that the Treaty should not be changed at all and that changes to regulations should be kept to a minimum, if indeed they are needed at all, but we are not sure of that yet."
"In strengthening and clarifying the Stability and Growth Pact, due consideration should be given to strengthening its economic rationale and its implementation."
"To ensure the credibility of the framework, rules should be kept both transparent and simple."
"We think the following elements should be analysed."
"Firstly, the preventive arm of the pact should be strengthened."
"A more symmetrical approach to fiscal policy is needed through budgetary discipline during good times so as gradually to achieve budgetary surpluses when the upswing comes."
"Secondly, we shall use peer pressure and peer support at an early stage of budgetary deviations, rather than waiting until a country breaches the 3% rule."
"Thirdly, we need transparent budgetary figures and growth assumptions in order to identify and correct budgetary deviations in a timely manner."
"The second issue we discussed was debt and debt sustainability."
"The focus on these elements should be enhanced."
"Firstly, more attention should be paid to the fact that a debt ratio should be sufficiently diminishing if it is above its reference value, approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace."
"Secondly, in assessing whether a Member State has reached sustainable public finances, the costs of ageing should be taken into account."
"Thirdly, we agreed to look further into the issue of debt sustainability."
"One particular concern centred on the possible statistical implications of pension reforms."
"Thus concerns a few countries, but is something we should investigate further."
"A third important element is that when a country is subject to an excessive deficit procedure and we have to assess whether it is complying with the recommendations, we should make a clear distinction between measures taken, on the one hand, and economic forecasting errors."
"Until now we issued recommendations on the efforts required and hoped for a result, but that result was in the same spirit as the written forecast."
"Thus in future, when assessing whether or not a country has met the recommendations, we should make a distinction between policy mistakes and forecasting mistakes."
"Finally, within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact, budgetary policies need to set the right priorities for structural reforms, innovation and competitiveness in support of the Lisbon Agenda to promote economic growth and create jobs."
"We asked the Economic and Financial Committee and the Commission to work these principles out further so we can have another discussion at ministerial level."
"We also agreed that it would be best to hold this discussion in parallel with discussions on France and Germany and the excessive deficit procedure applied to them."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to start by thanking you for inviting me to this debate on the Stability and Growth Pact."
"As you know, in September the European Commission approved a communication on strengthening economic governance and clarifying the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"I believe it is very important that there be a debate not just in the Council, like the debate we held last weekend – and those we will have over the coming weeks and months – but also in this Parliament and in the national parliaments, on the framework for economic governance and, in particular, the situation and the future prospects of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"As the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Zalm, has said, last weekend in the Hague, both in the Eurogroup of 12 and around the table of the extended Eurogroup – the informal Ecofin of 25 – we held an initial debate on this issue."
"The Council has agreed that the Commission’s Communication provides a good basis for discussion and now we trust that in the coming weeks and months the work we are going to carry out at a more technical level between representatives of the Member States in the Economic and Financial Committee and the Commission will allow us to go to the November Ecofin with a degree of agreement with much more content than we have been able to debate and achieve on many points involving the more general ideas and principles included in the Commission’s Communication."
"As Mr Zalm has also said, the draft Constitutional Treaty approved in June ratifies what is already included in the Treaty and we do not propose changing it."
"They are the basic principles, the basic reference values in terms of the evolution of public deficits and public debt and the excessive deficit procedure, as defined in the current Article 104 of the Treaty."
"It is not therefore a question of discussing what is not subject to discussion, because that is in the current Treaty and is going to be in the future Constitution."
"What we need to do is debate proposals to improve, strengthen and clarify its application and improve the degree of compliance with the framework laid down in the current Treaty and provided for, amongst other things, in the Stability and Growth Pact."
"This framework is based on national but coordinated economic policies involving budgetary policies that must conform to the 3% limit for budgetary deficit and the debt criterion of 60 % of Gross Domestic Product."
"On this basis, the Commission’s ideas expressed in the Communication deal with both the coordination of economic policies and the coordination and surveillance of budgetary policies."
"With regard to economic policy, we believe there is a clear need to coordinate our actions better in the field of structural reforms and increase our efforts to implement the Lisbon Agenda."
"Europe needs to increase its growth potential and create more jobs and we cannot work solely on the basis of one instrument – the Stability and Growth Pact – in order to coordinate our economic policies."
"We must therefore use the broad economic policy guidelines more effectively, an instrument which, by its very nature, is more flexible than the Stability and Growth Pact and, at the same time, we must improve the application of the Stability and Growth Pact by applying the preventive measures and aspects of the Pact more frequently and effectively, strengthening mutual control (peer pressure) and, in particular, we must do so during favourable periods of the economic cycle."
"With regard to budgetary coordination, the Commission's proposals aimed at strengthening and adapting the Stability and Growth Pact are based on four main issues."
"Firstly, the need to place more emphasis on the level of indebtedness and on the sustainability of public finances throughout the process of monitoring the evolution of those public finances in each of the Member States."
"In principle, compliance with the maximum limit for deficit of 3 % must guarantee an adequate reduction in the level of indebtedness and the sustainability of the public finances of each country."
"In practice, however, in many countries the evolution of debt has not been as expected due to the application of exceptional measures or the appearance of implicit debts."
"We must therefore pay more attention to the evolution of debt in addition to tight control of the evolution of public deficit."
"It must be made clear that the problem of sustainability does not only affect countries that already have high levels of debt, above the reference value of 60 %, but also other Member States where the percentage of their debt in relation to Gross Domestic Product is increasing or where, though it is not increasing at the moment, they know that in the future very important and very difficult challenges have to be faced, including those resulting from demographic developments and the ageing of the population."
"Secondly, the Commission is aware of the need to take more account of the different national situations when it comes to monitoring the budgetary evolution of each of the countries and, in particular, when it comes to determining the mid-term objective."
"In a Union of 25 countries it is not a question of creating an pact – as some people have said – it is not the Commission’s intention to do that, but rather to apply the economic logic that suggests that it is not advisable to establish a uniform mid-term objective for the evolution of the public finances of each and every country of the enlarged Europe."
"At the same time, the specific mid-term objectives for each country must in all cases guarantee compliance with the 3 % of GDP rule for their public deficits."
"Equal treatment for the different Members States is thereby guaranteed, regardless of their differing situations in terms of the sustainability of their public accounts."
"Thirdly, the Commission believes that the debate must deal with the need to apply measures quickly, to increase the use of the preventive measures of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"We all know that, at the end of the Nineties and the beginning of this decade, not all the Member States took advantage of the good state of their economy, of the good stage they were at in the economic cycle, to consolidate their public finances sufficiently, which means that at times of economic difficulty they are not able, or find it very difficult, to obey the 3% rule."
"All of these aspects – these first three blocks of ideas – as the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Zalm, has said, were received favourably by the Council almost immediately."
"On the corrective part of the Pact there was more debate and there will continue to be so in the future."
"In order to be consistent in our preventive measures, we also need, in the corrective part of the Pact, in the excessive deficit procedure, to take account of the circumstances of each country and which stage of the cycle each country's economy is at."
"How can this be done?"
"By means of two possible procedures."
"Firstly, the current definition of exceptional circumstances included in the Stability and Growth Pact can be improved, allowing a country not be included in the excessive deficit procedure, despite being above the 3% of deficit, if it has been in a prolonged situation of growth beneath its potential level."
"In order to distinguish between periods of cyclical low activity and those of structural low activity and in order to avoid weakening the surveillance framework, the other two requirements contained in the current exceptional circumstances clause must be applied strictly in all cases. That is to say that the deficit must be temporary and there must not be much deviation from the 3%."
"A second consideration is the need or the possibility to adjust the path of deficit correction, the speed with which a country which is above the 3% must bring its public deficit below that reference value."
"The differences between the cyclical situations of the different countries in this position justify this approach."
"In any event, the Commission’s Communication maintains the principle that an excessive deficit must be corrected quickly, but – as Mr Zalm has said – the influence of other economic factors, other than the intensity of the effort being called for and being made by the country in question on the budgetary results must be considered."
"In any event, there is an interrelationship between these two elements included in the exceptional circumstances clause."
"There is a trade-off here."
"We cannot choose to increase the room for manoeuvre in the two simultaneously in an uncontrolled manner."
"If more emphasis is placed on reviewing the entry of a country into the excessive deficit procedure, we will have to be more rigid on the adjustment path."
"If the current rigidity in relation to entry into the excessive deficit procedure is maintained, the possibility of adjusting the deadlines once the country has been integrated into that procedure may be considered in order to conform to the Treaty."
"I am convinced that these improvements are going to provide a basis for strengthening the framework for economic governance of the Economic and Monetary Union, that these ideas and the debate which we will be holding following last weekend not only do not weaken the pact but in fact strengthen it, because the weakness of a pact, the weakness of a fiscal framework, does not just stem from the theoretical brilliance of the rules we all respect or in theory, but also from the capacity to apply those rules and, as the recent judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities states, the decisions fall to the Member States meeting in the Council."
"The Commission maintains its right to present proposals, but it is the Council, the Member States, who must apply the rules that they themselves have committed themselves to by approving the Treaty and the subsequent regulations."
"We cannot demand that the Member States approve rules which they do not believe in themselves."
"And, if experience suggests that certain rules require adaptation, it is better to adapt them than not to respect them, leave them unchanged and carry on failing to comply with them, which has unfortunately been the situation at times with the Stability and Growth Pact."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have ahead of us a debate that will be a difficult one and crucial to Europe’s future."
"What is at stake is the credibility of the European Union, of its institutions and of the governments of the Member States."
"Our experience to date with the single currency has been a good one; it is stable and it and the dollar are the most important currencies in the world, the ones on which all else depends, but the strength of a currency depends not only on the independence of the central bank and on price stability; it also, and in particular, depends on the government’s financial and budgetary policies."
"An unsound budgetary policy can be an even greater danger in a currency union and damage the Community as a whole, that is to say, all who participate in it, particularly if certain larger countries fail to take the required and necessary action."
"It is to prevent this that the Maastricht mechanism, the Stability Pact and the relevant regulations are there, and they have been breached in the past."
"The fact is that, during economic boom periods, budget deficits were not reduced."
"Of course, we are all for policies being more flexible when times are hard economically speaking, when greater flexibility is a necessity and has to be guaranteed, but, on the other hand, we can see that there is the great danger that, if the criteria are reinterpreted, deficits will not be reduced when the economy is doing well."
"Our great fear is that that is what will happen."
"We very much welcome the European Court of Justice’s decision as regards the relevant procedures, and, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we welcome last weekend’s decision to give the Commission a new mandate."
"I also very much welcome your statement to the effect that ‘we will stay within the 3% deficit limit, we do not want to exceed 60%’."
"When we look at overall debt, though, we see that it is already well in excess of 60% in some Member States, and so I think that reinterpreting the Treaty and the Stability Pact would encourage new indebtedness and should therefore not be contemplated."
"The course that the Council has chosen can – as we have seen – both guarantee that the preset Budget procedure will continue and encourage a number of Member States to revert to the budgetary discipline that the Treaty prescribes and which is vital to the future of Europe."
"I would like to encourage the Commission to put forward a new proposal within the framework laid down by the Council, and would ask them to prevent the impression being created that we, by reinterpreting or even by amending the law, are pursuing a new European deficit management policy for which we will all have to pay dearly."
"For how will investment be possible if interest rates end up spiralling and we have to service the debts, and then there is no money to invest in the economy?"
"My advice to this House, then, is that we stay within the framework of the Treaty, while making use of the necessary flexibility that it provides, both when times are hard and when things are going well, in order to guarantee the continued stability of the European currency in the future."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we note with pleasure the evidence of movement in the Council at the weekend, and I am addressing you, Mr Zalm, as one whom I know as a vigorous defender of the former interpretation of the Stability Pact."
"Pardon me if I exaggerate somewhat, but I sometimes got the impression that you and some of your colleagues had a positively Manichaean way of interpreting it."
"There is only ‘either/or’."
"Some life has been injected into the debate now that it has become evident that there is one thing that we must keep in sight if we want to save the Lisbon strategy, to defend it and advance it, and if its objectives are indeed to be achieved, and that is that all the resources at our disposal – including the Stability and Growth Pact – must be mobilised in making the Lisbon targets realities."
"Initiating an open-ended inquiry into whether all the measures associated with the Stability and Growth Pact, or all the interpretations placed upon it, were actually conducive to achieving this objective or whether certain modifications or revised interpretations are necessary, that is a step in the right direction, and that, I believe, is what was embarked on at the weekend."
"Commissioner Almunia made a very important point about the 3%, which nobody wants to abandon, nor should anyone give up the 60%, but the crucial point is that if we retain this guideline – and our group too knows that it is indispensable – then the Commissioner’s statement to this House to the effect that, because conditions differ from one country to another, no one objective can be imposed, and that each country must be enabled, within its own specific limits, to overcome its difficulties in order to get back on track for the goals when it has problems, is also a step in the right direction, for those who want to save the Pact are thereby put in a position to be able to do so."
"Those who interpret the Pact only in black-and-white terms – and recent developments in some countries show that this happens – and those who say that there can be no alternative to what we conceived fourteen years ago, overlook the dynamic social and economic changes that are taking place."
"Commissioner Almunia’s reference to demographic development shows that we must acknowledge and take into consideration the developments of which we were as yet unaware when we first debated the Stability Pact."
"That means modifying it, modernising it and adapting it to present circumstances, it means securing it and guaranteeing it as the long-term basis of a stable currency."
"Commissioner Almunia, you have shown courage, and we, in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, will back you up as you go down this road."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, history tells of many attempts at introducing a single currency in countries that were not joined together in a political union."
"Sooner or later, all of them ended in failure."
"It was intended that the euro should escape that fate."
"The Stability and Growth Pact was concluded in order to oblige the members of the eurozone to adhere to standards meant to guarantee the currency’s stability."
"There was meant to be an effective sanctions mechanism to bring those sinners who transgressed these rules promptly back to the path of virtue and thus make the euro credible to the finance markets and in the eyes of the public."
"The reality is rather different."
"For the third time in succession this year, Germany and France have breached the 3% deficit limit."
"Despite that, the sanctions mechanism has not yet kicked in."
"The pact risks being revealed to be a paper tiger; confidence in the euro is shattered, and so the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe welcomes the promptness and decisiveness with which Commissioner Almunia has come up with proposals for saving the Pact."
"We see it as a good thing that the deficit threshold should, in principle, remain at 3%."
"We think it right that a state’s overall indebtedness should be more closely monitored."
"We accept the need to take account of population change in the Member States and its – largely adverse – effect on budgets."
"We welcome the observation that Member States have to accumulate surpluses in good times in order to be able to build up reserves for the bad ones, self-evident though that is."
"Favourable though our assessment of individual elements is, we are critical of the Commission proposal as a whole."
"We could exaggerate and say that, as reality is not obeying the rules, the rules are being adapted to fit it."
"In policy terms, Germany and France have got their way, at least for the time being."
"For as long as the wrongdoers play a part in deciding whether or not an offence has been committed, it remains uncertain whether the sanctions mechanism will ever become operational."
"The origin of Germany’s difficulties is not to be found in the Stability and Growth Pact; the problems are structural and start at home."
"No reserves were built up when the going was good; reforms were needed but were not tackled with sufficient determination, and the state’s finances were not consolidated."
"The only things that will help to increase competitiveness and generate sustainable growth are a simple and attractive tax system, deregulated labour markets, and renewal of the social security and education systems."
"Our principal criticism of the Commission’s proposals has to do with the criteria for assessing whether or not a country is adhering to the Pact, which leave a great deal of room for interpretation of such factors as, for example, adverse economic conditions, particular circumstances resulting in poor long-term growth, and factors specific to individual countries relating to the adjustment of excessive deficits."
"We find it doubtful that group pressure has any positive effect on the way Member States behave; on the contrary, there will be even more political chumminess of the ‘you scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours’ variety."
"For that reason, the evaluation criteria must be unambiguous and easy to understand."
"We welcome the Commissioner’s intention to make Member States’ budget policies more transparent and more binding, not least as a result of the publicity that regular reports to the European Parliament and debates on them will attract."
"Last weekend, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker was elected President of the euro group for the next two years."
"We hope he will manage to get the Member States to identify more with the Stability and Growth Pact and develop a greater sense of responsibility for it."
"The euro is a unique success story and must remain stable for Europe’s sake and in the public interest."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens warmly congratulates the Commission on its plans for reforming the Stability and Growth Pact and is delighted that the Council appears to have given it a warm welcome."
"Starting with the Dublin and Amsterdam Councils, the Greens had taken the view that the Pact would, in time of recession, be neither applicable nor applied."
"That is what has come to pass."
"The Council imposed no sanction on the big countries when they went over the 3% threshold."
"Today, they account for 80% of Europe’s domestic product, and it is certain that, without this policy, Europe’s stagnation in 2003 would have turned into a recession."
"At the same time, the United States, China, Japan and even the United Kingdom triggered global recovery by applying a budgetary policy that would have been prohibited in Europe."
"There is indeed a need for reform of what President Prodi, two years ago, called ‘the stupid Pact’."
"Of the four recommendations that we made at that time, the Commission accepted three: to push for the restoration of a balanced budget only during periods of growth; to tolerate reasonable deficits during periods when growth is poor; to lay down monetary and budgetary rules as part of the governance of democratically debated broad economic policy guidelines."
"We do, to be sure, regret the failure to consider our proposal to remove from the remaining deficits those investments in the areas covered by the Gothenburg and Kyoto targets: economy in energy, shared large-scale transport networks, and renewable energies."
"However, we reject the idea that provisions for future expenditure, such as retirement pensions, should be included among debts from now on, for we need to bear in mind that, apart from the ageing process, the disruption of the climate is the most significant debt bequeathed to future generations."
"If, though, the Council proceeds now to adopt the Commission’s proposals, it will demonstrate that the requirement for unanimity in twenty-five countries does not prevent necessary and intelligent reforms from being adopted."
"Today, our fellow-citizens need such evidence and we are grateful to you for it."
"Ladies and gentlemen, rather than producing stability and growth in Europe, the Stability Pact has resulted in the opposite."
"Growth rates in most European countries are lower today than in previous years, and what has increased has been poverty, unemployment, McJobs and bankruptcies of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Do you seriously want to tell Europeans that this is what stability means?"
"Nobody wants inflation, yet price stability bought at the cost of employment and quality of life benefits only Europe’s rich, and harms the vast majority of Europeans."
"It is unfortunate that the Commission’s proposals on reform of the Stability Pact do not indicate a change in thinking, but are simply cosmetic corrections aimed at reviving an obsolete concept."
"It is obvious that critics who accuse the Commission’s proposals of watering down the Pact have simply not realised that the Stability Pact in its original version is beyond saving."
"After all, there are now six European countries which have been so successful in cutting back that they are now experiencing a crisis, and it is as a result of this, rather than of expansionist spending policies, that they are no longer in a position to comply with the ‘stability’ criteria."
"Use of the Pact as a cudgel to push through cuts in social services and privatisation policies demands that it be more flexibly applied, and this is why we of the Confederal Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left reject the Commission’s proposals as well as the spirit and letter of the Pact itself."
"Anyone who has a genuine desire for stability and growth in Europe must abandon neo-liberal dogmas."
"Budgetary consolidation cannot be an end in itself."
"Public investments secure the future and employment."
"The internal market requires mass purchasing power if it is to thrive, and this cannot be achieved without renewed increases in wages and social spending."
"While we are on the subject of deficits, if large European companies were finally forced to pay up by means of a high-level EU-wide harmonisation of corporation tax, and if a new Constitution committed Europe to disarmament, not rearmament, a much more effective step would be taken towards the prevention of escalating government debts than through any aggressive programmes of cuts which only serve to aggravate problems."
"We would unreservedly support a Stability Pact for Europe which was genuinely worthy of the name and which committed the Member States to reducing poverty and unemployment instead of to indiscriminate deficit goals, with sanctions imposed on countries that failed to meet them."
"We are, however, firmly opposed to life-prolonging measures for an instrument which is designed to destroy the European social model."
"Mr President, it is clear that the larger eurozone governments have no intention of tying their hands by promising to adhere to the 3% deficit limit."
"One would not expect them to."
"The Stability Pact is rather like the common fisheries policy: every country has an interest in other countries keeping to the rules but in not being restricted itself."
"The fisheries policy is not working very well, nor is the Stability Pact, but – to maintain the pretence – we are now going to have a more flexible pact taking into account economic growth rates and country-specific circumstances."
"It sounds like a good idea, but in practice all these criteria depend on judgment, as Mr Almunia has just explained."
"All it will mean in the end is that a country having trouble sticking to the rules of the pact does not have to."
"A flexible rule ceases to be a rule."
"The root of the problem is that there is no credible means of enforcement; there never has been."
"It was always ridiculous to suppose that a government having trouble paying its bills could be punished by imposing a fine; yet, as the European Central Bank points out, sound fiscal policies are vital for the euro."
"There are many examples of what happens to fixed exchange rate regimes when governments do not keep their budgets in order."
"An EMU is just a sophisticated form of a fixed exchange rate."
"Argentina is the most recent case of such a collapse."
"The problem could of course be solved by much greater control of national budgets, but that does not seem very feasible right now."
"Certainly we in Britain would not like to see Brussels running our Treasury."
"Let me end on a positive note."
"I can only say how thankful I am that Britain has not joined the euro ..."
"... and as the weakness of the Stability Pact becomes more obvious, the chances of us ever joining are becoming more and more remote."
"Mr President, we live in a European Union in which an internal market operates and where there is free movement of goods, persons, services and capital."
"We have also seen the success of the internal market in terms of net job creation."
"The success of economic and monetary union has eliminated the possibility of seeing hungry speculators playing one currency off against the other for personal gain, while doing serious economic damage to European countries and to their citizens."
"The euro is a strong currency for business and it is succeeding, but we must analyse the rules governing economic coordination."
"Some EU countries are breaching the Stability and Growth Pact rules and are doing so with impunity."
"There is a question of economic credibility at play here."
"We either all comply with the rules or we do not."
"There cannot be some rules for the larger countries and other rules for smaller countries."
"This not only impinges on the credibility of our economic rules, but it leads to a broader problem of selling a focused message to the citizens of Europe about the positive work of the European Union itself."
"For example, the Commission reprimanded the Irish Government a few years ago about the economic governance of our country, at a time when our economy was growing at 10% per annum."
"I support economic coordination, but everybody playing in the same pitch must play according to the same economic rules."
"I support a review of the rules governing the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Countries with low debt should be allowed to invest in key infrastructural projects of national importance."
"This is serious business and EU governments must look closely at the different options available to us."
"Any possible change to these rules must be fair and equal to all participants."
"In Europe we have difficulties concerning the operation of the Stability and Growth Pact, but we must work through them with a sense of purpose and determination."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am strongly opposed to some countries not complying with the Stability Pact and to the European Commission allowing any kind of discussion on a possible relaxation of the Pact."
"I believe that soft budget rules equal higher debts, and I believe that relaxation and non-enforcement of rules equal a loss of credibility for the entire European Union."
"The only message we are sending out about ourselves is that it is not those who prosper, make a profit and create jobs who are held up as an example in the European Union, but those who live on credit and put off finding a solution to their countries’ economic problems."
"Let us not hide from the fact that in Europe today a number of Member States are struggling with stagnation, high levels of unemployment and growing debts."
"I therefore believe that any display of leniency by the European Union would be out of place."
"In my opinion, the Commission must instead bring greater pressure to bear on the prosperity of individual countries, as well as calling for budgetary restraint, the reduction of debts and the creation of new jobs in these countries, and, above all, ensuring that the rules which the European Union has laid down for itself are complied with."
"I would like to point out that it will not be this House, or the spin doctors of individual politicians or individual governments, which pass judgement on the Commission’s economic measures, but the global market, and the market is well known for imposing extremely heavy penalties on debtors and those who are unreliable."
"If the rules are relaxed, I believe that we will see a massive stampede of firms out of the European Union to Asia and Ukraine, or quite simply to regions where taxes are lower, the workforce is cheaper and, it must be admitted, the social state is cheaper."
"Neither prosperity, nor more jobs, nor a greater competitiveness of the European Union in the global economy can be achieved by a relaxation of stability and growth."
"Unless the European Commission realises this and puts the brakes on spending which is not based on economic results, the Stability and Growth Pact will turn into an Instability and Failure Pact."
"I thank you for your attention."
"– Mr President, I am surely not the only one who feels a little strange when reading the communications and listening to the declarations that were made a moment ago."
"Although the intention is, reportedly, to strengthen the Pact, nearly all speakers have referred to its being weakened or relaxed."
"While it is apparently not the intention to touch the 3% standard specified in the Treaty, my gut feeling is that it is precisely this budget standard that is proving difficult to deal with. Furthermore, the enforcement of the Pact needs to be stepped up, but there is a great deal of wishful thinking about the greater impact of what is referred to as peer pressure, which certainly did not work for the big countries, and there is little in the way of more power for the Commission or of a decision-making alternative in the Council, which would lead to truly better enforcement."
"The advantage of the announcement is, though, that it was made now and that an open debate will follow suit, and we have plenty of cause for this."
"In the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, this has already been the topic of an extensive debate, and we want to contribute our might with an open mind, but we will not change our guiding principle."
"Consequently, we have never said that the Stability and Growth Pact is stupid."
"On the contrary, we found it to be a valuable instrument, and still do."
"The fact that more harmonisation is sought with other economic policy instruments, as well as fine-tuning in certain areas, an optimisation of the debt ratio, economic realism, all of these are open to discussion."
"What is unacceptable to us, however, is that the Stability and Growth Pact should be adapted to please a few governments."
"The Pact should prompt discipline, it should be a big stick to keep us on the right track."
"That means that the Pact must be geared to long-term challenges of our social market economy, and should not be thrown off course by short-term sirens."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as Mr Schulz has just said, my group fully supports the proposal that Commissioner Almunia has put forward."
"It breaks the taboo on tampering with the Pact as initially defined and suggests that you be pragmatic in learning the lessons of the first five years of the EMU’s operation. This it does in order to usher in a new period in the history of the single currency, which makes it possible, in reality, to combine stability with the prioritisation of growth and employment."
"The present framework has not only shown itself to be deficient as an instrument of growth in comparison with the performances of the world’s other major currency areas, including those of the EU Member States that remained outside the eurozone; it has also shown itself to be vulnerable in terms of its own credibility, bearing in mind not only the number and the size of the Member States that have broken its rules, but also the uncertainty prompted by the decision of November 2003, which the Court of Justice’s ruling in July really did nothing to allay."
"So it is that we endorse your proposals, particularly those about taking better account of the link between debt, deficit, economic cycles and countries’ specific situations in order to get away from the ‘one size fits all’ approach; we also endorse the emphasis you place on prevention, on early warnings, on peer pressure, and, finally, on anticipating events rather than simply relying on the sanctions machinery."
"My group, however, would insist on two other items, which my colleagues will address, as it seems to us that additional measures are needed."
"Reform of the Pact must have as its primary objectives growth and employment, an increase in which will contribute to stability – or, to be more precise, will give the eurozone a real basis for stability – and will be achieved by making a link, which is de facto absent at the moment, between reform of the Pact, the Lisbon strategy, coordination and the Member States’ economic policy guidelines."
"Specifically, then, we think that the issue that has to be addressed is that of how to encourage investment in growth and how to take into account, in a nuanced way, those investments that contribute to the Lisbon strategy and to achieving its objectives, namely research, innovation, infrastructures and the major trans-European networks, without forgetting lifelong learning."
"Secondly, we also have concerns about the long-term nature of debt and, at the same time, we are concerned to ensure that taking account of ageing does not become a pretext for propelling Member States towards the privatisation of their social security systems, pension schemes in particular."
"We would prefer this to be clarified and this argument not to be used tomorrow in an attempt the bottom line of which is to reduce social protection and social security that the people of Europe enjoy."
"–While endorsing the views expressed, that the main provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact do not need to be revised and that the means of implementation are clearly defined, I would still like to point out that the Pact's long-term stability depends on economic flexibility, taking into account ordinary citizens' preparedness for change."
"Now the impression has formed that the main criterion of this Pact is the size of the fiscal deficit, and its sole goal is to ensure the stability of the euro, and all that can only be achieved by carrying out structural reforms, but the purpose of economic decisions is to ensure a growth in citizens' prosperity, allowing them to realise their potential."
"Unfortunately, in real economics structural reforms mean a reduction in expenditure for social programmes, which make up the largest proportion in the state finance structure."
"Lithuania's experience of reforms shows that if a favourable environment is not created for the transfer of capital and labour from less efficient to more productive activities, i.e. a liberal window of new opportunities is not opened for the population or business, social expenditure on structural reforms is very great and the results, due to great opposition, do not match expectations."
"Thus the Pact's main priority ought to be to stimulate economic dynamism, creativity and a growth in new quality jobs, so that even my sceptically minded colleagues from Britain would not doubt the substantiation of financial and economic stability."
"– Mr President, when President Prodi, two years ago, described the Stability Pact as too inflexible, he was met with sneers."
"Mr Zalm, you were one of the harshest critics, because anyone who wanted to change the Stability Pact was considered a softie."
"As was often the case, you took visible delight in tarring all critics with the same brush, because they were all useless."
"May I ask you something? Is it not the case, though, that what is now acceptable to you, what you read out a moment ago, very much resembles what those self-same critics of the Stability Pact stated two years ago?"
"Two examples: my group has always argued for more attention being paid to the public debt and somewhat less attention to the annual budget shortage."
"We have always said that there are situations conceivable in respect of which a Member State should not be penalised for exceeding the 3%, for example in the case of slow growth over a long period of time."
"Finally, I applaud the fact that the Council and Commission now appear to be willing to be more flexible in their interpretation of the Stability Pact."
"Mr Zalm, I would urge you, though, to display the same level of honesty and flexibility, and refrain from saying that you will be clarifying and improving the statute."
"Instead, I would prefer you to say that you are finally taking the constructive criticism of the Green and Left Members of this House seriously and are therefore updating the Pact."
"Mr Zalm, there comes a time for everyone when they have to admit that they are wrong."
"This is the time for you to do so."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the fact that a number of Member States are now openly violating the criteria of the Stability Pact, thereby serving the short-term economic interests of the monopolies, the European Union insists that it be maintained, even underlining the need for it to be applied more rigorously in order to step up pressure for new anti-grass roots measures to be taken."
"The proposed amendments, in conjunction with the 3% deficit and 60% public borrowing criteria, make the Stability Pact even more reactionary, the aim being to implement the Lisbon anti-grass roots strategy more quickly, with a coordinated increase in taxation on the workers being promoted in order to generate financial surpluses."
"They put national budgets under greater control, in order to strengthen the competitiveness of the European monopolies by reducing taxation and granting new privileges to big business."
"They place particular emphasis on public borrowing, in order to persuade the pension systems to make immediate changes, they further commercialise care, they reduce social spending and they promote quicker capitalist restructurings, in order to reduce the cost of labour and increase the profits of big business."
"The proposed revision confirms that the only way to combat the Stability Pact and the anti-grass roots policy of the European Union in general is insubordination and disobedience on the part of the workers and by stepping up the working-class struggle."
"Mr President, in modern economies, the budget balance operates as an automatic stabiliser of the real economy."
"Stability in the real economy and, thus, employment therefore presuppose instability in the budget balance."
"The Stability and Growth Pact was, therefore, in essence badly thought out."
"By placing the emphasis on stability within the public finances, it contributed to instability in employment."
"The Commission’s reform plan is therefore a step in the right direction, but it gives cause for concern."
"This step is being taken because large and powerful countries failed to meet the demands made in the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Intellectual arguments and political will to stabilise employment were not enough."
"It does not bode well for continued cooperation within the EU that power is more important than intellectual arguments."
"It was therefore right, and important, to demand that large countries too follow the applicable rules even when these appear less appropriate."
"The problems are now diminishing for countries with high structural budget deficits such as France and Germany, but increasing for countries with high public debts such as Italy, Greece and Belgium."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Stability and Growth Pact is a success."
"Twelve countries belong to the eurozone, and the Pact lays down the rules for membership in it."
"It is the basis for public debate on the link between budgetary discipline, inflation, price stability, growth and employment, for the debate on structural problems in Europe and for the debate on the Commission’s role with regard to the Member States’ economic policies."
"The Pact must not be used as an excuse for personal failures and omissions; it is a mandate for action by the Member States and the Commission."
"The European Court of Justice has strengthened the Commission’s position and, in doing so, the Pact."
"The new Constitution has strengthened the Pact and the European Central Bank by including price stability as an objective in the Constitution."
"We will not change the ground rules, which is precisely what those who believe that flexibility means relaxation do."
"Those who, like Mr Eichel, wish to muzzle the Bundesbank, fail to recognise the role played by an independent issuing bank and the importance of transparency for trust, reliability and credibility."
"I support the Council’s position and the ECB President, Mr Trichet, in the comments he has made."
"We need clear rules that apply to everyone and successful implementation."
"We have no problem with the Pact; what we have is an implementation deficit."
"This is why I am also in favour of a debate on the ways in which we can boost the significance of total debt, establish criteria for accumulating much-needed budget surpluses during times of economic prosperity, incorporate the consequences of demographic change and conduct a public debate on the difference between structural debt and investment debt."
"We also need a debate on the Commission’s powers to implement the Pact."
"Anyone who incurs debt for debt’s sake is selling off the future."
"We want the European public to have confidence in the rules we set for ourselves, and we want the public to be sure that everyone in Europe is equal before the law and is treated fairly."
"Mr President, I should like to join in congratulating Mr Almunia, who has made a valiant attempt to breathe new life into the stranded Growth and Stability Pact."
"I should also like to congratulate, and thank, Mr Zalm, Chairman of the Ecofin Council, for the fact that, indeed, he has not remained stuck in the past, and like Mr Lagendijk, I would not like to be the one to resolve past issues either."
"What I do hope, though, is that he does not only act out of self-interest and on the basis of tactical considerations, but that, in terms of substance, he is now also convinced that it is important economically speaking to place more emphasis on the growth element of the Pact."
"I would also like to note that my group very much appreciates the fact that you have indicated a wish to continue the debate with our Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"I think it is important for us in the European Parliament to be involved in this too."
"As far as content is concerned, clearly, my group is positive about the direction that the Commission document is taking."
"We have always called for a better balance to be struck between the objectives for growth and stability."
"We would like to put a stop to the conflict of, on the one hand, ambitious Lisbon objectives and, on the other hand, budget standards that have been set too low over a longer recession period in order to be able to invest in renewed economic growth."
"It is absurd that, for example, in Portugal, expenditure for research and development and education is being cut rather than increased and that Greece is being punished – another example of a country exceeding its budget – in connection with those splendid Olympic Games which we all thoroughly enjoyed."
"Even in my own country, I can give the example of the discussion with local governments about the way in which they are permitted to fund investments out of the reserves."
"That would be positive for growth if it were not for the fact that they would be faced with an investment ban if the budget shortage of 3% were exceeded, which is absurd at this stage."
"My group therefore supports a Growth Pact that is formulated more precisely."
"I should like to bring you two elements at this stage."
"First of all, I am keen to hear your views about the golden rule. As you know, in the United Kingdom, of all places, a country outside the eurozone, a very strong appeal is being made to draw the distinction between current budget spending and investment spending."
"Your objection had always been that those boundaries cannot be clearly marked."
"My appeal would not be to leave this also to the resourcefulness of the national finance ministers individually, but, in fact, to find out whether we cannot extract common standards from the Lisbon objectives, the broad economic guidelines, and hopefully soon also the opinion of Wim Kok’s high-level group. My argument is that we would then be able to transform those many fine commitments of Lisbon and of subsequent summits into real investment and growth plans."
"Secondly, I would propose to implement this in multi-annual plans complying with the deadline of 2010 or later."
"What do you think of the idea of writing off that growth and those growth investments over several years, so that they are not included in the 3% standard on an annual basis?"
"I would like to hear from you whether you are prepared to conduct discussions of this kind in the Ecofin Council, and I hope that, in doing so, we can get the pact back on its two feet, which it needs, namely stability and growth."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, of the Prodi Commission’s final initiatives, the proposed reform of the Stability and Growth Pact is one of the most significant acts at a time of uncertainty in the European Union’s economy."
"The decisions made in recent years have ensured stability and kept inflation under control, but growth has remained low and there are no binding rules for implementing the Lisbon objectives."
"Growth in Europe must be raised in qualitative terms back to rates of at least 3%."
"Reform of the Pact may be one of the means by which we can get out of the slowdown."
"The Commission’s proposal, presented here by Mr Almunia, is a good starting point but needs to be improved."
"The Member States must turn this debate into a really thorough discussion, like the one that accompanied Maastricht."
"The discussion should be structured around three key points."
"First, the future Pact should be ‘Lisbonised’, giving greater weight to all those criteria connected with structural reforms, innovation and investment in research and development."
"The proposals concerning the golden rule should be restored, but with the constraint that investments beyond the 3% should be set up and managed at Community level and should not deteriorate into a mere market for the interests of the various countries, as Mr Klinz has just said."
"Secondly, with regard to debt, the trend needs to be the decisive criterion, not the amount."
"Thirdly, clarification is needed regarding the credibility that the Commission wants the Pact to have, since the Pact was thrown into a serious crisis by the Ecofin decision in November and by the final text of the Constitution on the balance of power between Ecofin and the Commission, which favours the national governments more than the Convention’s text did."
"In conclusion, I must point out that, if no solution is found to the political problem of the credibility of the Pact and of the Member States’ commitment to abide by it, then the whole point at issue is likely to be merely academic."
"– Mr President, the changes being promoted by the European Commission in the Stability Pact do not affect its neo-liberal philosophy."
"They serve the particular requirements – let us face it – of the French and German governments and they will place a particular burden on countries such as Greece with high public borrowing, borrowing which will increase as a result of the exorbitantly expensive Olympic Games and high defence spending."
"These changes to the Pact do not address the crucial problems of low growth rates, high unemployment or huge social and regional inequalities, problems which have blighted the progress of the European Union over recent years."
"The Confederal Group of the United European Left – Nordic Green Left, at the opposite end of the spectrum to criticism by European bankers mouthing their absolute neo-liberal doctrine, is demanding radical reform of the Stability Pact."
"We demand a European pact on employment, growth and social cohesion which will introduce social criteria with quantifiable and verifiable indicators and will make provision for penalties and sanctions for the countries which infringe them, such as countries which maintain high unemployment."
"Mr President, it is almost two years ago that President Prodi described the Stability and Growth Pact as stupid."
"In those two years, the debate has continued to rage and culminated in the Commission proposals which were discussed during the last Ecofin Council in Scheveningen."
"In my opinion, the Commission proposals offer a basis for continuing to shape the discussion about the Stability and Growth Pact, and the implementation of the Pact continues to benefit from clear and transparent decision-making."
"There is still a need for unambiguous sanctions."
"The discussion that is now being held should not harm the Pact’s implementation or trust in the euro."
"At the time, it was said in the debate that more account should be taken of economic trends, thus enabling the surpluses saved up from prosperous years to be used in lean years."
"I should like to hear from Mr Zalm whether this suggestion has been taken on board and whether that might well prove to be the key to an acceptable new Pact."
"I should also like to ask whether the Council could shed more light on the tasks and responsibilities of Ecofin’s next chairman, Mr Juncker."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, two or three years ago your predecessor, fellow countryman and party colleague, Mr Solbes, spoke before this House and responded to Mr Prodi’s comments, which have been quoted a number of times today already."
"The Pact is sufficiently flexible and does not need to be changed."
"The question we must therefore now ask ourselves is why, two years later, there is a sudden demand for change – one that may appear different, but comes from the same family of parties."
"The way I see it, it is to your credit that you are undertaking a final rescue bid for the Pact, because what has become apparent is quite simply that the finance ministers, in particular the German and French finance ministers, may create European legislation, but do not abide by it."
"I remember how Mr Zalm, the Finance Minister, addressed our committee and, amongst other things, called for everyone to be treated equally."
"I would like to stress this point; everyone must be treated equally, and the law applies to everyone."
"I also welcome the fact that you do not wish to amend the Treaties and that there will be no change to the figures of 3% and 60%."
"You spoke of flexibility, and indeed there are good economic reasons for flexibility."
"I would, however, like to make it quite clear that these reasons must be specified."
"In this instance flexibility appears to be a license for anyone with a few national peculiarities to ask to have these taken into account, and the Commission hands them what they want on a plate."
"The Commission must make improvements in this respect and elaborate on the relevant details."
"What I find particularly regrettable is that even the Commission is not addressing the problems relating to the Pact, and you need to have a better procedure for dealing with them."
"If you tell governments that they must make savings and reduce debt when better times arrive, I do not believe that they will suddenly do so merely because the Commission tells them to, but because they want to make good on their election promises when the income situation improves."
"This, then, is where the Commission’s role must be strengthened vis-à-vis the Council on this issue."
"The members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) in this House support you, and I hope that at least some of the finance ministers do too."
"Let me conclude with one final comment; the Stability and Growth Pact should not be blamed already for the likely potential failure of the Lisbon Strategy, which is the fault of national governments."
"That would amount to myth making, which should not be allowed under any circumstances."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I warmly congratulate you."
"Those who do not treat the Stability and Growth Pact as a fetish have been waiting for this moment for a long time."
"A taboo has been broken; we can talk about the Stability and Growth Pact, and can even talk about reforming it."
"Commissioner, you really do have my warmest congratulations, because the Finance and Economy Ministers have said that they regard your communication as a good basis on which to work."
"It seems to me, then, that we have taken a major step forward."
"No doubt you have been aided by the French and German situations, and by the ruling of the Court of Justice, but the step has been taken, so let us make good use of it and of the space that it has opened up to us."
"This is an opportunity to be seized, primarily to put things back in order, and so I cannot go along with Mr Radwan’s assessment."
"This is not a matter of ascertaining whether the Lisbon strategy has failed or whether the Pact needs to be saved."
"What is at issue is how we use the Pact to make the Lisbon strategy succeed, and, looking at it from that angle, it strikes me that we must and can make more of an effort to keep track of expenditure."
"By this I mean the expenditure that contributes to the implementation of the whole Lisbon strategy;"
"I do not think of competitiveness as being the alpha and omega of the Lisbon strategy."
"The Lisbon strategy will succeed if it is founded upon a strategy aiming at full employment and sustainable development on the basis of research and knowledge."
"Commissioner, I turn now to a point that you raise in your communication, but which appears to me to be no more than lightweight and needing more work to be done on it, namely the link between coordination and the Stability and Growth Pact. You know better than I do that this coordination exercise has been, up to now, a purely academic one."
"The thing that makes it possible for it to become a ground rule and to define the quality of policy, does not work. The result is that all we have is a Stability and Growth Pact that, like a balance sheet, enables us to observe how things happened, without being able to determine the dynamics of it or the collective choice."
"That brings me to my last point, the only thing that involves this House: the issue of the democratic debate on your proposals, on the implementation and coordination of the Stability Pact."
"Here there is much to be done."
"You make reference to this House at one point in your communication, but it would appear that this is almost a formality and that, at the end of the day, debate is, in essence, reserved for a very select and very definitely closed club consisting of the euro group speaking through the Ecofin Council."
"This wall has to be broken down."
"The debate must break out of this enclosure, for if it does not, economic policies, which are, in the final analysis, a matter for the collective choice of societies for the good of their peoples, will not be placed in the public arena."
"If this House, and the committee I chair, can contribute to this, I think we will have done a good job of work together."
"I wish you good luck!"
"Mr President, I cannot say congratulations to the Commissioner, but I have three questions."
"Why are you in such a rush, Commissioner, to devise new rules?"
"Why do you not follow your predecessor, Mr Solbes, who thought that the Stability and Growth Pact was perfectly alright."
"I think we must wait until the new Commission begins."
"It is the Commission that is to administer and oversee these rules."
"We also have Mr Zalm back in his seat as the Netherlands’ representative, so that we might again hear his normally tough position on this issue, which I of course love."
"So let us wait a little."
"Why is the time not being used to discuss the Commission’s role in the Stability and Growth Pact: the issue of whether a warning can be given without the finance ministers having to approve it, as well as the issue of its having been possible to contrive for those countries that act contrary to the Stability and Growth Pact generally to have voting rights in the Council?"
"I should also like to ask the chairman of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, who has unfortunately left his seat, why someone does not get hold of Mr Schroeder and tell him that he should observe the rules?"
"A flexible Stability and Growth Pact will not, of course, help him."
"Mr Schroeder has the problem of not keeping to the Stability and Growth Pact, and flexible rules will not help him, so make sure now that he is made to follow the rules."
"What Germany needs are major structural reforms."
"– Mr President, the Commission has finally acknowledged that the different economic and social realities of the various countries calls into question the rationale behind nominative criteria in applying the Stability and Growth Pact."
"This justifies, albeit belatedly, the criticisms that we have made from the very outset. We have criticised the 3% public deficit limit and warned of its social and economic impact."
"We can only regret, however, that these proposals have come to light only after successive years of non-compliance by France and Germany, and are really little more than a cosmetic exercise that lets France and Germany off the hook."
"We know how the Stability and Growth Pact has served to justify withdrawing public investment, particularly in the social areas for which the State is responsible, thereby encouraging further privatisation."
"We all know that the consequences of a slow-down, of stagnation and in some countries, such as Portugal, of economic recession are rising unemployment and social exclusion."
"What we are saying, therefore, is that we urgently need to revoke the Stability and Growth Pact and to undertake a root and branch review of economic and monetary orientations in the EU."
"In order to safeguard economic and social development, it should be replaced by a pact that genuinely helps to create jobs and to foster social progress, a pact that prioritises social economic cohesion, jobs and social inclusion."
"Mr President, I am well aware that I represent a nation that is not a member of the European Monetary Union and I represent a party which is opposed to future membership of the euro."
"I am not going to apologise for that because I believe the British economy is better off outside the eurozone, and our significantly higher growth rate compared to the average eurozone country bears this out."
"However, as my party leader, Michael Howard, noted in a recent speech in Berlin, we believe that different combinations of Member States should have the possibility of pooling their responsibilities in different areas of their own choosing."
"Thus we wish our colleagues in the eurozone well."
"I am all for the principle that governments should avoid excessive budget deficits, especially when an economy is growing strongly and unemployment is low."
"It should have been simple for us to have kept our spending within the limits required of members of the European Union, since all of us – not just members of the euro – are supposed to abide by these guidelines."
"When Britain exceeded the 3% budget deficit ceiling, it escaped the censure of the Commission because it is not in the eurozone."
"The people of other European nations were not so lucky: the Dutch and the Portuguese have had to rein in their public spending in a tight effort to comply with the pact at a time when they have been hit by recession."
"However, far from being congratulated they were kicked in the teeth by the governments of France and Germany using their muscle to bend the rules and escape the fines which, if imposed, might have given them the incentive to be the team players that they sometimes urge us to be."
"It is difficult to overstate the damage this has caused."
"The euro is an ambitious project."
"All such projects require the injection of a vast amount of political capital."
"Strong currencies require credible leadership, which is lacking in this case."
"Ever since the euro was introduced, the very authors of the rules are the least prepared to abide by them."
"The new guidelines announced last week pay lip-service to the need for clear and effective rules."
"They are in essence a surrender to political might."
"Many have suggested that the eventual success of the euro will be measured in the long run by whether Britain, Sweden and Denmark decide to join. I am not going to look into the crystal ball, but I have to say that the most recent moves by the guardians of the currency have done nothing to encourage those of us who are cautious and wary to sign up."
"Mr President, a Community with a shared destiny, such as this Europe of ours, cannot function unless freely accepted rules are complied with."
"This was the essence of the Court of Justice’s message on the case relating to the Stability and Growth Pact."
"The Court’s ruling confirmed that the Member States have discretional power at their disposal and that they have no obligation to follow the Commission; the Court also helpfully supported the Commission’s sole right of initiative."
"The Commission recently took an initiative aimed at altering the existing rules."
"We must welcome this political act by the Prodi Commission and must thank Commissioner Almunia."
"Socialists advocate a policy of stability and of fighting inflation, yet stability without growth leads to a sacrifice of future expenditure and to an austerity policy, on account of which the poorest sections of the public will be the first to suffer."
"Even though the two pillars of the Pact, the famous 3% and 60%, are not based on pure science, the aims must not be changed."
"The individual situation in each of the twenty-five Member States varies markedly."
"According to the evidence, a State with a debt of around 60% of its GDP has more room for manoeuvre than a State saddled with a public debt of over 100%."
"Socialists would like to give Member States a margin of flexibility in the event of an economic downturn, so that they can pursue a structural policy of regeneration, even if that means – and on this point I agree with Mr Radwan – imposing tighter budgetary discipline during times of strong growth."
"We must, above all, assess the quality of public spending."
"We must choose between consumer spending and expenditure for the future."
"Borrowing must be restricted solely to productive investment."
"This is based on a premise of better economic governance at EU level and of more thorough coordination of economic policy."
"Whilst one must welcome the fact that the Eurogroup has a permanent chairman in the shape of Mr Junker, it nonetheless remains the case that a chairman simply presides over meetings and does not make decisions."
"For the Stability Pact to become a Growth Pact too, coercive measures must be implemented in the area of national budgetary practice."
"The ECB has reacted negatively towards the Commission’s proposals."
"I am grateful to Mr Zalm for responding somewhat frostily to what was said by the European Central Bank."
"The ECB’s independence is, and will remain, set in stone by the Treaty."
"Whilst the responsibility for monetary policy lies solely with the Central Bank, the responsibility for economic policy lies solely with the Member States."
"European economic policy must be coordinated by political power, not against the ECB, but independently of a world view that is limited solely to monetary considerations."
"Mr President, the Court of Justice’s ruling of 13 July was a positive development in the battle of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"It was a clear signal from an independent body, which decided in the European Commission’s favour with regard to its approach towards Member States exceeding the 3% standard structurally."
"Now, however, the self-same Commission, albeit with a new Commissioner, is tabling a proposal for reforming the Stability and Growth Pact, the ambiguity of which will make it particularly welcome in the auditors’ offices of those governments that do not play by the rules."
"The Commission has a more intelligent application of the Pact in mind, but I wonder which definition of intelligence it is using, for since when has it been intelligent to reward infringements?"
"Let us not make things more complicated than they already are."
"The Pact’s strength lies in its simplicity."
"Two large Member States are now seeking a solution for their economic situation in difficult times, at the expense of the Pact, and are all too pleased to take an advance on the future."
"How can we be certain, though, that in a new system, those Member States, France and Germany, will continue to observe the agreements and above all, as Mr Klinz commented earlier, will carry out the necessary economic reforms?"
"I totally agree with the Chairman of Ecofin that a review of the Pact could, of course, prove useful."
"However, whilst in the past I was a fervent advocate of a much stronger role of the Commission in enforcing the Pact, the new Commissioner will have a job persuading me that the Pact is in good hands with him."
"It is just as well that the Council, under the Dutch Presidency, has at least demonstrated its responsibility."
"Mr President, Mr Zalm, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the French contingent in our Group feels that the Stability and Growth Pact is one of the pillars of the European economy and currency."
"We want it to be implemented in practice, so that we can keep control of public spending, combat excessive deficit and ensure sound management of Member States’ public finances."
"This is precisely why we support the Commission’s proposal and why we are pleased with the Council of Ministers’ positive reaction."
"Taking on board what has been learnt from experience, the Commission’s proposal consists, purely and simply, of making the rules of the Pact fully and intelligently enforceable, without changing the two main criteria: deficit percentage and debt percentage."
"The communication of 3 September builds on principles of which we approve: enabling the Commission to issue early warnings, placing the emphasis on the level of debt, establishing budget surpluses during times of economic growth to allow room for manoeuvre in times of economic slowdown – the squirrel strategy – being responsive to exceptional circumstances – a concept that the Council of Ministers should incorporate thoroughly – and, finally, coordinating the main objectives of economic policy with the decisions made in national parliaments."
"This proposal therefore places greater importance on economic developments and makes strenuous efforts to avoid the risks to which dogmatism is in danger of exposing business and jobs."
"If France can make a major contribution to growth in Europe this year, for example, it is clearly because the Pact has not been applied to it like a hatchet."
"We also welcome the appointment of a permanent chairman of the Eurogroup in the shape of Mr Juncker, which is a step in the right direction."
"In the future, budgetary policy will make a greater contribution to growth and will, accordingly, play a decisive role in achieving the Lisbon objectives, which determine the prospects for competitiveness and prosperity in the EU."
"Mr President, I am speaking in support of the Commission’s Communication entitled ‘Strengthening economic governance and clarifying the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact’."
"It is important to return to economic governance because what we are seeing now stems from the Treaty of Maastricht, when Economic and Monetary Union was decided upon: Monetary Union was defined and realised, Economic Union less so."
"And the Stability Pact, which is now ten years old, was conceived on the basis of a degree of mistrust towards certain countries which appeared incapable of passing the exam."
"The European Union’s capacity for creation demonstrates that those who were the exam candidates are now the most virtuous and, curiously, those who demanded virtue are the ones who have sinned most."
"So this gives us hope in terms of European integration."
"Since then, we have introduced the euro, we have decided upon the Lisbon strategy, we have drawn up a Constitution – I would like to point out that all the representatives of the governments went to the Convention’s working group to oppose the implementation of economic governance."
"We are therefore obliged to review and update the Stability and Growth Pact, because in many respects it does not work – particularly in relation to growth – and because we have had to go to the Court of Justice to get certain States to apply it."
"I believe that this is what justifies both the Commission’s actions – which we clearly support – and the positive reaction of the Council, because, just as the European Central Bank has to be monetarist, the Council has to concern itself with the functioning of the economy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, strengthening economic governance and clarifying the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact are important matters, not only in order to refocus attention on the Pact’s underlying ethos and to strengthen the foundation which lends stability to the monetary union, but also in order to avoid undermining the trust which the public placed in us in 1997 during the discussion on the introduction of the euro, a discussion which took place both in this House and elsewhere."
"The Stability and Growth Pact is a requirement for justice and sustainability."
"It must therefore remain in existence, and its direction and application must be preserved and strengthened in accordance with the spirit of the Treaty of Maastricht and the European Constitutional Treaty."
"The Stability Pact illustrates the simple economic and fundamental truth that today’s debts always end up being tomorrow’s taxes, to be borne by future generations."
"The Pact therefore rightly calls for an end to state indebtedness and for a budget that is balanced across the economic cycle."
"Under the Pact’s rules, as has already been noted, temporary deficits can and may be tolerated during economic upturns, but during the next economic upturn these new debts must then be cleared again."
"Against this background, the Commission communication rightly poses the question of long-term viability, and calls for better links between the essential features of economic policy and the Stability and Growth Pact."
"A critical view should however be taken with regard to an issue which is given much space in the communication, namely that of placing greater emphasis on the Commission’s recommendations on economic development."
"The Commission communication contains a total of five key proposals; due to a lack of time I can only evaluate one of them, the improved coordination and implementation of budgetary policy."
"The closer links between the Commission’s recommendations on the essential features of economic policy and the Stability and Growth Pact are to be welcomed, and have meant that the Commission has been able to stimulate competition among systems in the Europe of 25 and to make a major contribution to moving closer to the goals set in Lisbon."
"We should therefore lend our unreserved support to these renewed proposals for increased transparency and accountability in the Member States’ budgetary policies, and it must be especially in the interests of all participants in the monetary union to support the credibility of the Stability and Growth Pact by means of transparent data."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the primary task of the European Union’s financial policy must be to provide a sound basis for the economy."
"It must be stable and predictable, but must never become ideological."
"I am quite astonished to hear it said in this House that confidence in the euro has been shaken."
"Where have you found even one piece of economic evidence to support such a statement?"
"The truth is quite the opposite; the businesses with which I am in contact are more concerned at the strength of the euro against the US dollar and at the fact that we are experiencing low economic growth."
"The people with whom I am in contact are concerned at the high rates of unemployment in the European Union."
"I am sure that Mr Almunia will have the opportunity to discuss confidence in the euro and the international view of the euro in his answer, and we can in any case continue the discussion in this House."
"Mr Poettering, it was with great interest that I discovered how broad a discussion is being conducted on this issue within your group."
"This discussion is a fascinating one, and apparently this is also the case within the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats)."
"Our proposal is this: let us be reasonable and avoid ideology, and let us support the Commission’s ideas, which are capable of making the Pact more effective and of turning a stability procedure into a Stability and Growth Pact."
"It is high time for us to tackle this task."
"– Mr President, Commissioner Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, every day in our debates we say that for Europe to be competitive in the world economy it needs more economic growth, more concrete and materials-based infrastructure, and more reforms."
"Every day we say we must implement the Lisbon Agenda, but the results are there for all to see."
"The current Stability and Growth Pact, as structured, cannot provide a solution either for growth, or for the infrastructure gap or for the call for reforms."
"It is just a poor surrogate for a common economic and growth policy which does not exist."
"It was wanted by the strong countries because they did not trust the weak ones, but in the end it was the strong countries who were the first not to abide by it."
"Something, therefore, is not working, and we have to be honest and admit it."
"As we all know, the three strategic objectives of growth, infrastructure and reforms can be synthesised by policy makers in a formula that economic theory calls the golden rule, which allows for intergenerational investment spending to be financed through deficit and at the same time requires current spending to be financed without generating a budget deficit."
"Until now, European bureaucracies and governments have said no to the introduction of the golden rule for fear of opportunistic behaviour by the Member States."
"Such fears are correct, but Europe cannot be built on fears."
"To prevent national opportunism if the golden rule is implemented, it is important that there should be clear European objectives and clear European rules, as well as equally clear financing with checks on its appropriateness and checks on the outcome, without leaving any room for accountancy tricks or bullying tactics, which have been used all too often in the recent past, even by countries considered to be hard-liners."
"Why not try out the golden rule?"
"If the golden rule is not included in the Pact reforms, the ECB will be right in saying that it is better to give up and leave the Pact as it is, stupid and open to being bypassed at will by the strong, but also useless if not damaging, given that the timid interpretative corrections, sponsored by various parties, regarding the flexibility of medium-term deficits as well as the sustainability of debts are of little use."
"Mr Almunia, I wish you all the best in your work and urge you to be as courageous as necessary at such a difficult time for the integration of this Europe of ours."
"Do not listen to the hordes of self-interested sirens in disguise that are likely to permanently sink not only the credibility of the Pact but along with it the credibility of Europe as a whole."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to point out to the Members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – but evidently not to Mr Brunetta, who has rather different ideas on the matter – that the Stability and Growth Pact is not being changed to make it less strict."
"That would be a mistake."
"The Pact should be changed because it has started to contradict itself."
"Its mechanisms balance if the nominal growth of the economy comes to around 5%."
"Our potential growth in Europe is consistently below that figure, and so the Pact does not hold."
"If it is left like that, debt will rise as a result."
"The Commission’s proposals are sound."
"They can be enhanced and strengthened in relation to Lisbon and in relation to the strengthening of European integration, which means avoiding the risk of policies breaking down at national level."
"If, for instance, precise mechanisms are identified to make the Pact fully and automatically cyclical, to support European investment programmes or to give set flexibility margins to countries that approach the Lisbon reforms structurally, all that would not mean making the rules less strict but making them more effective and directed towards growth and integration."
"Lastly, it is fair to look more carefully at debt, not the amount of debt but its dynamics."
"In fact, for mathematical reasons, under equal conditions of growth and deficit reduction, a larger debt falls more rapidly, and so it is appropriate as well as fair to punish not the accumulated errors of the past but, if anything, the laxity in remedying them."
"– The President-in-Office of the Council has informed us that he has to leave our debate for unavoidable reasons."
"We shall therefore proceed as follows: I shall give the floor to Minister Zalm of the Council, who will give an account of the impressions and content that he has gathered from the debate, and then we shall return to the debate, which will conclude with the speech by Commissioner Almunia."
". I am very grateful that you have given me the opportunity to say a few words now."
"I apologise for leaving earlier but the problem is that I am not only President-in-Office of the Council and Netherlands Minister of Finance, I am also replacing the Prime Minister at the moment because he is in hospital."
"I have many obligations to fulfil."
"After listening to all the statements it is clear that there is a wide variety of opinion in Parliament."
"I am not surprised by that."
"Maybe we can reach some consensus here."
"As President-in-Office of the Council I must be very careful in expressing my views because I have not had an opportunity to check whether all my 24 colleagues agree with my answers to some of the remarks made."
"Let me pick out a few themes."
"First of all, as asked by various speakers, why did we have problems with the Pact?"
"The basic mistake in the past has been that we did not make use the good times for consolidation."
"I believe that both Mr Poettering and Mr Klinz said a few words in that regard."
"My colleagues in France and Germany also concluded that if they had been in surplus or in balance before the downswing started, they would not have breached the 3% limit and all these troubles would not have arisen."
"I think that is an important consensus."
"Those who now criticise the Pact for its rigidity are probably not the same people who advocated more rigid consolidation in the good times."
"Perhaps they felt that the good times were so nice that we could spend even more than the governments planned."
"That is my experience, at least."
"We must be consistent during the entire cycle."
"If we consolidate firmly in good times then we can be more relaxed when the economic cycle takes a downturn."
"Stabilisation over the entire cycle – that is one of the lessons learned."
"I hope, as I am sure you do, that we are now at the start of the upward part of the cycle."
"If we use that time well, the inevitable downturn will not, once again, lead us to the problems that we have previously encountered."
"We do not need any change to the text of the Pact in that regard."
"As has been remarked by some speakers, the Stability and Growth Pact is not a solution to everything."
"We also have the Lisbon process."
"I do not believe that there has to be tension between the Stability Pact and the Lisbon process."
"Mr Schulz spoke of this tension."
"Personally, I do not believe that low deficits, the fact that the deficits were not high enough, are the real problem in relation to the lack of growth in Europe."
"We have to look at the necessary reforms and also set the right priorities in our budgets, so that we really spend the money within a budgetary framework and on the issues that are important for the Lisbon process."
"I must point out that if we were more relaxed on deficits, interest payments would gradually crowd out other expenditure, such as expenditure on R[amp]D and education, which we all want."
"In the medium and long term, higher deficits are certainly not a solution for any Lisbon objective."
"They may even conflict with the Lisbon objectives."
"A few of you were a bit afraid of an ad hoc approach, that we would not apply equal treatment to all the countries based on clear criteria."
"We discussed that in the Council and stated that we need a rules-based system for the future."
"There were some questions about the golden rule."
"As such, the golden rule is a pro-cyclical system."
"It was used in the 19th century in many countries."
"I do not think it would be good for economics today."
"Other questions were asked about the role of Mr Juncker."
"He will be President of the Euro Group."
"There are some advantages to having a longer-term president, who will also be its face the outside world, for example in the G-7."
"If people see a new minister of finance come from the Euro Group every six months, it will not make a very strong impression."
"Such a president also organise and plan for a longer period than just six months."
"I hope that in the coming weeks and months we can work further on this issue."
"As I said, the Commission proposals are a good basis for discussion."
"They will probably not be accepted lock, stock and barrel, but I do not think the Commission ever expected that."
"We already have some basis for consensus in the paper I presented to you today."
"I hope that we will get full consensus on an operational Pact that is really implemented."
"Mr President, Commissioner Almunia has interpreted Shakespeare brilliantly."
"As in Mark Anthony’s funeral speech, he sings the praises of budgetary austerity but, at the same time, tells us that he has put in place the necessary explosives to bring down the pillars supporting it."
"The Commissioner advocates simple rules but, at the same time, he tells us that we must take account of the national circumstances of each country, which means there will be 25 different rules."
"What we were saying yesterday about the Stability Pact is still true today."
"It is absolutely true that we must maintain the austerity pact in order to maintain price stability; that budgetary austerity serves to free up resources for education, research and development in order to make the Lisbon process possible; and, above all, that it is necessary to meet the implicit, hidden, unbudgeted-for obligations resulting from the ageing of the population."
"What we were saying yesterday is still true today."
"And if we are saying other things, that is simply because we are treating the Stability Pact as done for."
"The Stability Pact was good, the bad thing was that it was not complied with."
"Secondly, Commissioner, all of those who have always been in the Stability Pact are the ones who are today applauding your measures and all of us who have always been in favour of the Stability Pact are the ones who are against the Commission’s proposal for making it flexible, unequal and discretionary."
"Thirdly, Commissioner, the applause of the governments is not disinterested applause."
"The Stability Pact is not a pact in favour of the governments, it is a pact against governments, for restricting their action, in order not to neutralise the actions of the Central Bank and in order to maintain price stability."
"And if it is a pact against the governments and in favour of the citizens – and in this regard I agree with what the chairperson of the committee has said – you will have the support of my group in enhancing the powers of the Commission, against the Council, and the powers of Parliament, as representative of the citizens, to defend that budgetary stability, which will provide the citizens with lower prices, lower interest rates for their mortgages and will help to guarantee that we will have resources in the future to attend to the needs of our pensioners and that we will not have squandered those resources by paying interest and paying off debt."
"The PPE-DE Group will support the Commissioner in this debate."
"But if the intention is to draw up rules that make the application of the Pact discretionary, unequal and ultimately unfair, in accordance with the ‘’ principle, the Commissioner will not have our support."
". – It is in the interests of Hungary, and presumably in the interests of the newly-acceded countries, that the euro should remain strong and become attractive for the population since, we too have to step into this zone and it will be extremely useful for us too."
"I support the fact that, in the interests of the euro’s prestige, there should be strict framework rules for the Member States and this is why I do not agree with the weakening of the Stability Pact, or in an extreme case, its abolition."
"I also agree that the Commission had examined the experiences of previous years and, in the area of implementation, it foresaw more flexibility which must, however, strengthen the willingness to observe strict framework conditions."
"I also agree with the Commission’s approach that several views must be considered when revising the Pact, such as supportable state debt, protracted slow growth, harmonisation and co-ordination of economic and budgetary policies."
"One must be careful however, that for the unity of the requirements system an equal judgment must prevail."
"I see that as a very important criterion."
"As for myself, I believe that it would be very complicated to work out a country-specific conditions system."
"Instead, one ought to concentrate on the individual characteristics of the economic situation and incorporate this into the whole system."
"Apart from such a characteristic as excessive indebtedness, there could be other aspects to consider such as the excessive openness and vulnerability of small countries, but, above all, the consideration of the principle according to which one of the most important aims of the Union is cohesion, that is, the joining up of less developed countries and regions that are lagging behind."
"This is particularly pertinent to the ten out of the twenty-five Member States, the newly-acceded states where, apart from ensuring conditions of growth, one must pay attention, when assessing the observance of the criteria, to certain reforms in public spending, such as for example the reform of the pensions system, the need for a quota of higher investment and the appearance of an occasional higher rate of inflation."
"But these of course, in these circumstances, are economic phenomena."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I could perhaps accept that the Stability Pact has been useful. However, it needs amending, because it has not always been applied correctly or fairly."
"In some countries, the Commission has exhausted its strictness, and in others the Council has exhausted its leniency."
"I agree that we must take account not only of the actual but also of the structural deficit, by overlooking short-term cyclical fluctuations in GDP."
"Had we done so, Germany would not have had a problem in either 2002 or 2003, or even this year, while France would have had a problem in 2002 and 2003, but not this year."
"A source of friction would have thus been eradicated."
"I also agree that we should not overlook borrowing, but this means that we need to use the primary structural deficit; in other words, we need to subtract amortisation costs."
"I also agree that we need to examine the extent to which a country has exorbitant expenditure for which it alone is not responsible, as with Greece and the extraordinary spending on the Olympic Games."
"Finally, I want a pact which will achieve stability in the eurozone, not unequal treatment of Member States, a pact with a long-term strategy, not knee-jerk reactions, which safeguards the Lisbon objectives without sending the economies into a vicious circle of recession."
"If we are to achieve all this, we need to clearly amend the Stability Pact, the Regulation itself, not merely hope that it will be applied better in the future."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by making one point: let us look to what is really important in the European economy, namely that we now have low inflation and low interest rates throughout the European economy."
"It is easy to look back to the Seventies and see how matters were then, for at that time we had high inflation, high unemployment and governments that added to their budget deficits."
"Thanks to the Stability and Growth Pact, we have a common code and a common criterion that has counteracted these factors."
"The paradox is that we are now having this debate partly because the Stability and Growth Pact has operated as it was supposed to do."
"It has put political pressure on those countries that increase their deficits and, for that reason, it is of interest to us all, irrespective of whether or not we have the euro or of whether or not we participate in monetary union."
"The basic problem in the European economy, affecting the image of the Stability and Growth Pact, is that too many countries have inflexible economies that are incapable of handling the deficit situation when times are hard."
"In this context, I want to say that there is a direct link between the Stability and Growth Pact and the Lisbon process because we either develop flexibility in the Member States’ national economies, providing dynamism and growth, or have a more flexible interpretation of the rules, but we do not solve Europe’s problems by introducing other rules."
"I therefore wish to appeal to the Commission to be objective and clear, no matter what form the criteria take."
"The solution does not lie in change but in reform of the European economy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to share with you my concerns as an MEP from a new Member State."
"Especially before accession, we saw the Stability Pact as a powerful and comprehensible symbol of Europe’s stability, and this was not because of its name, but thanks to its contents."
"It was the symbolic custodian of a healthy economy and of reliable rules and justice, for everyone and without exception."
"I say ‘was’, because today this is no longer the case."
"It is a symbol which needs rehabilitating."
"Budgetary discipline is a political risk today for governments which have embarked on public finance reform, and yet it is of crucial importance for the stability of the entire European Union."
"Flexible interpretations and relativisation of the Pact are a stab in the back for these courageous governments."
"It is not flexible interpretations of the rules which citizens and businesses expect, but a flexible EU trade policy."
"I would like to draw the Commission’s attention to the threat posed to the EU’s internal market by the dishonest trading practices of third countries."
"These mean that it is important for the Commission to open negotiations with the WTO on import quotas, in particular with regard to imports from China, which disregards the social and environmental regulations of our market."
"A threat to three million jobs in the textile industry and women’s unemployment are at stake, which means a threat to employment stability as of January of next year."
"A flexible trade policy and reliable rules are conducive to stability."
"I welcome the Commission’s efforts to increase the transparency of rules, I believe that it will open negotiations with the WTO, and I am keeping my fingers crossed for it."
"Mr President, it is imperative for me in this debate to set out clearly the issues at stake, and to highlight what is necessary and realistic."
"We start from a most regrettable situation. Non-compliance with the Pact on the part of a growing number of Member States is clearly a serious breach of good budgetary behaviour."
"I am not unaware of the effects of the economic situation, yet I have noticed that the Member States that have had the courage to avoid slipping into extravagant spending show indicators that are perfectly in line with the legislative provisions."
"The good behaviour of some is unfortunately suffering from the backsliding of others."
"Having said that, let us not fall into the traps either of blind devotion or of dogmatism. The future ex-President of the Commission, moreover, did not hide his feelings on the Pact, using extremely undiplomatic language."
"I find the guidelines set out by the Commission interesting because they could lead to a less simplistic understanding of Member States’ public finances."
"Therein, however, lie further difficulties: how can we reconcile an understanding of the complex and unique situations of each Member State with maintaining rules that are clear, understandable and applicable across the board?"
"I wish all the best to those who will have to undertake the task, including my compatriot, the future President of the Council and the future ‘Mr Euro’, who is well known for unravelling the most complex problems."
"Lastly, the crisis that we are enduring is highly symptomatic of the way in which the EU operates."
"Nobody would deny that the EU is a community governed by the rule of law, yet it is clear that the power to exert force over the Member States quickly comes up against its limits."
"Overall, the dilemma is a tough one: rather than witness the slow death of the Stability and Growth Pact, I would prefer to see its regeneration, given that its demise would also have incalculable repercussions for the euro and that I still set some store by the value of the currency and of the money in my wallet."
"– Proposals for the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact would be worth discussing, even though the proposed amendments to the Pact would require careful evaluation."
"However, in my view, in the current situation a revision of the Pact should not be contemplated, because certain states chronically fail to observe the existing criteria and a growing number of states may well fail to observe them in the future."
"Nor does the inadequate penalty regime serve to encourage the maintenance of budgetary and fiscal discipline."
"The proposed reforms give a dangerous signal to market forces about inability to control the situation even in the long term."
"That is why I cannot support the proposed reforms, especially those relating to anchoring the budget deficit level and the different deadlines allowed to Member States for eliminating excessive deficit."
"Budgetary and fiscal policy are particularly sensitive areas of political responsibility."
"Any exceptions in these areas will inevitably tend to be never-ending."
"Of concern is the proposal for an extended period of weak economic growth, which would in effect offer a limitless time for those politicians who are unable or do not want to undertake structural reforms in their countries."
"A relaxation of the rules will not motivate politicians to undertake unpopular reforms."
"Similarly, the proposal for country-specific adjustment paths for correction of excessive budget deficits is of special concern."
"These specific adjustment paths for various countries may prove to be not simply specific but also significantly different, because transparency in these matters is hard to ensure."
"That would lead to a loss of confidence in the Pact as a whole."
". Mr President, I would firstly like to thank all the honourable Members who have contributed to this debate, sometimes with support, sometimes with critical support and sometimes simply with criticism."
"All these contributions will be extremely useful for me as I carry out my future duties as Commissioner responsible, insofar as it falls to me, for carrying out this adaptation and improvement of the Stability and Growth Pact and of economic governance in general, and they seem to me extremely useful in terms of communicating arguments and objectives on such an important issue as the economy of the Member States of the Union and of the European Union as a whole from Parliament to the public."
"I would like to say once again – I have done so in my initial speech and it has been said in several of your speeches, but I want to repeat it in this final speech – that the Treaty is not in question, nor what the Treaty says about public finances and about budgetary stability."
"The limit of 3% of GDP for the public deficits of the Member States of the Economic and Monetary Union and the limit of 60%, in relation to GDP, for public debt remain in force."
"The countries that are not complying with these limits are obliged to do so."
"They do not remain in force for no good reason, but because one of the objectives of the Economic and Monetary Union must continue to be budgetary stability as a condition for the effectiveness of the extremely important political decision we took when launching the Economic and Monetary Union and, in particular, the creation of the single currency."
"And it is still necessary to preserve the objective of budgetary stability and those reference values by means of the system of rules – as has been said on many occasions during the debate."
"But we must also be aware that the ultimate objective of the Economic and Monetary Union, of the budgetary stability of economic policies, is to guarantee more growth and well-being for some of our citizens."
"And some of you have expressed the opinion that the debate on the reform of the pact could even in some way affect the stability of our currency, the euro."
"I do not believe that is the case if the debate is held within the limits we have set for it as in the Council last weekend and as in this debate today in Parliament."
"What has been discussed is the fact that the eurozone and the European Union as a whole are growing less than other areas of the world."
"We have more stability, thanks to the decisions we have taken within the framework of the Economic and Monetary Union, but we have less growth."
"And that is a response we must find not only through the instrument of the Stability and Growth Pact, but also by rereading it, revising it and adapting it, introducing more economic rationality into it, taking account of the heterogeneous nature of the European Union of 25 following enlargement, taking account of the fact that the Treaty also talks about the need to preserve the sustainability of public finances and not just of preserving and ensuring budgetary balance in each financial year, by monitoring public deficit, and bearing in mind that, over the years the Stability and Growth Pact has been applied, its credibility has suffered because the rules in force have not always been adopted and applied by the institution which must ultimately do so, which is the Council."
"We must therefore strengthen the pact, the framework for budgetary surveillance and our instruments for economic governance."
"And how must we do this?"
"With more flexibility or more rigour?"
"With both things."
"In certain respects, we must be more flexible, because experience shows us that the room for manoeuvre, which a reasonable interpretation of the rules we decided upon allows us, is not sufficient to take account of very powerful arguments arising from economic rationality, from the specific situation of the economy of the country at a particular time."
"And in other respects we must be more rigorous, such as in our surveillance of the evolution of levels of public debt or in the mechanisms for application of the Pact for example, both in the preventive part and in the corrective part of the Pact, in the excessive deficit mechanism."
"We must take account of the economic cycle, preserve equality of treatment for each and every country – and this is a task the Commission identifies itself with in particular – and ensure better compliance."
"And we must link the Pact better with the other instruments of economic governance – as many speakers have said this afternoon – the Lisbon Agenda and the economic growth objectives in order to make the European Union’s Economic and Monetary Union the most competitive area in the world and, at the same time, the most socially cohesive and the most sustainable from an environmental point of view."
"Does this require a debate?"
"The Commission believes this is obvious."
"Should this debate take place within a certain limits?"
"Of course, and that is established in the Commission's Communication."
"Must we seek agreement and the greatest possible degree of consensus in our dialogue and cooperation with the Council?"
"I believe this is absolutely essential."
"The debate – and the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Zalm, has said this as well – must lead us, and I trust that it will lead us, in November, on the second analysis by Ecofin of the adaptation and improvement of the Stability and Growth Pact, to a level of agreement and consensus between the Member States, at Council level, and between the Council and the Commission, which is even greater than the very considerable level of agreement demonstrated last weekend."
"Changes to the rules will be necessary, as few as possible."
"In any event, the touchstone of the discussion must not be whether or not an article, an item or a paragraph of a regulation should be changed."
"The touchstone will be whether the reason why it has become necessary to change that regulation has been agreed, is reasonable and is in accordance with our objectives of budgetary stability, of maintaining a framework for fiscal and economic governance and of that framework preserving the stability and growth of the European Economic and Monetary Union."
"Finally, Mr President, a comment on the issue often mentioned in many speeches from France and Germany."
"The judgment of the Court of Justice of 13 July basically considered the European Commission to be right."
"The Council was not entitled to act as it did last November."
"We must now apply the Treaty, as interpreted by the Court of Justice."
"The Council has no choice but to respect the Commission’s right to initiative."
"The Commission is the guardian of the Treaties and must therefore ensure compliance with the rules of the Treaties and their implementation by means of the Stability and Growth Pact in force and we are committed to doing this and we are going to act on the basis of the judgement of the Court of Justice."
"What action are we going to take?"
"We are following the development of the public finances of many Member States very closely, but in particular that of France and Germany during 2004, and the budgets that each of the two governments are beginning to draw up and which they will communicate for discussion to their parliaments in the coming months, before the end of the year."
"At the end of October, when we will know the content of the budgetary policies formally announced by the two governments and while we await the final decision of their respective parliaments, the Commission will publish its estimate and economic forecasts and we will estimate how public debt in France and Germany may develop in 2004 – we could practically give an accurate estimate now, but I would prefer to wait until October – and our estimate for 2005."
"On the basis of the Commission’s economic forecasts and with the precise information we will have in the weeks following the publication of those assessments of the real and concrete content of the budgetary policies agreed by both of those countries for 2005, the Commission, employing its right to initiative and carrying out its duty fully, will tell the Council what its proposal is."
"The Council will have to take the appropriate decisions, of course, in a climate of cooperation, but naturally with the greatest respect for the principles and rules laid down in the Treaties and in the regulations in force in the field of budgetary stability."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"Mr President, with the Commission proposal, we are out of the frying pan and into the fire: more flexibility but without clear-cut criteria."
"In my view, the core of the Pact should remain intact, namely maximum 3% of GDP for budget shortage and 60% of GDP for public debt."
"If the Pact is to become more flexible, this should be done on the basis of objective and general criteria. This is where the proposal leaves a great deal to be desired."
"The Commission should have more powerful means at its disposal to force Member States to adhere to the terms of the Pact."
"At the moment, the Council has too many fingers in the pie, which leads to a politicisation of the Stability Pact."
"The sanction mechanism in the present Stability Pact did not appear to be rock-hard or neutral: large Member States, on the basis of their position of power, were able to violate the rules and get away with it."
"Although the present Pact does not conclusively specify that in times of economic prosperity its members have to work on building up a surplus, that is essential if the Stability Pact is to be successful."
"The creation of such a buffer, for example, with a view to an increase in the ageing population, is indispensable."
"It is therefore to be welcomed that the Commission underlines the importance of such a buffer in the revised Pact."
"At the same time, with the 3% limit, in principle, the Pact offers Member States enough leeway to invigorate their economy in times of economic decline."
"The next item is the debate on the following oral questions"
"- to the Council:"
"B6-0008/2004 by Mr Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, to the Council, on the ratification procedures for the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe;"
"- to the Commission:"
"B6-0009/2004 by Mr Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, to the Commission, on the communication strategy concerning the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Constitution has successfully overcome its first two hurdles in the shape of the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Over the next two years we now face a third hurdle, which could prove to be the most complex and demanding for this historic project – its ratification by the EU’s 25 Member States."
"We must recognise that work will by no means be completed with the ceremonial signing of the Constitution on the Capitol in Rome on 29 October."
"On the contrary, work must go on, and everyone must bring this project to a close with the same energy, vigour and discipline."
"I am aware, and our committee is aware, that there is a risk that the European spirit, which was very much present in the Convention, but which became less and less so, without disappearing entirely, in the Intergovernmental Conference, will be lost in the national debates and domestic political battles of coming months and of the next two years."
"It is already noticeable that a populist and opportunist movement is being organised against the European Constitution, and it is a cause for concern that this germ has already infected one of the originators of the European idea, as is evident from the debates over recent weeks in France."
"The fact that a populist and opportunist movement is turning against the Constitution should give us pause for thought, even when the reasons have little to do with this project."
"We must not allow the power games and power struggles of domestic politics to water down or even destroy this historic project, and everyone who has fought for the Constitution in the past years and decades must rise up in opposition to this."
"Parliament, the Commission and the Council were active participants in the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference, and I believe that the three European institutions also bear a particular responsibility in this ratification stage, as we must be advocates of the compromise that has been reached."
"It is therefore unacceptable for individual articles to be extracted from the overall compromise and used as a pretext for rejecting the entire Constitution, and this must not happen."
"An overall compromise has been reached, and we must see the wood and not just the trees, to put it metaphorically."
"It is also the task of the European institutions to explain the fundamental goals and content of the Constitution to the European Union’s 450 million citizens, and to provide them with information on this issue."
"We would therefore like to ask the Commission and the Council whether a communication strategy exists, and whether suitable activities aimed at informing the European people about the project are in preparation."
"This House would also like to ask the Council whether a strategy exists for coordinating ratification in the 25 Member States."
"We are well aware that ratification will take place in accordance with the national law of each Member State, and it is also clear that some countries will require more time than others."
"It would however be entirely wrong if no attempt at coordination were made, especially when this has already taken place in the ten accession countries with regard to ratification of the Accession Treaty, and with visible success."
"The Commission, the Council and Parliament may not now sit back and content themselves with watching from the sidelines."
"On the contrary, and as I said before, the same vigour and ambition must continue to guide us over the next two years in order to ensure that this project clears the final hurdles."
"The 2004 Constitution must not suffer the same fate as the 1984 and 1994 drafts, which went straight into the archives and never made it off the printed page and into reality."
"This 2004 Constitution must become a reality, as only then can progress result in increased democracy, transparency and efficiency in the European Union and hence for the people of Europe."
"This is our goal, and this is what we must work towards."
". Mr President, thank you very much, I shall try to be brief."
"I have another opportunity later on, in reaction to other comments on this subject, but it is a hugely important topic."
"First of all, I should like to say that Mr Leinen’s words are very much my own sentiments, especially when he points at the enormous importance, after the steps we have now taken and will be taking on 29 October when we will be signing the Treaty, of carrying on with the same fervour, because we are not there yet."
"Mr Leinen is absolutely right in saying this, and a very important next step is to be taken in connection with the ratification and the referendums which will be held in a number of countries."
"I am also in total agreement with him that this responsibility is shared between Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"To date, our three institutions have managed to achieve that, and we will indeed need to continue in the same manner at the next stage."
"I am pleased that he himself indicated that there is, of course, a national responsibility where legislation, the implementation, the organisation of the ratification and also of possible referendums are concerned, and that this does not fall within the remit of Brussels."
"We will at any rate ensure, though, as we have also discussed, that information about this ratification process is collected."
"The Council’s Secretariat will be collating this information and compiling a rolling document, so that new information with regard to the planning and organisation of the ratifications and possible referendums can be processed in this document at any time."
"This will be a permanent concern for us in the Council and will also be discussed during the European Council."
"I can tell you that we have also agreed that this will also be routinely on the agenda of the European Affairs Ministers who usually meet at least during each General Affairs Council for an informal lunch."
"It follows that from this position, we will be able to keep a finger on the pulse over the next few months."
"The European Council has drawn attention to the problem in a wider sense than simply the ratification and the general involvement of the public, partly further to the low turnout at the most recent European Parliament elections."
"We the presidency, and particularly the European Affairs Ministers, will make sure that we can table concrete proposals that will be discussed at the European Council of 5 November."
"We will set to this task in Amsterdam on 5 October, and will discuss, as already stated, both communications in a more general sense and also specifically the best ways of taking account of the ratification procedures in the different Member States and of the harmonisation that is required for this purpose."
"That means, in any case, exchanging information and learning from each other’s experiences in this procedure."
"Where harmonisation in time is possible, that should be done, but once again, that is a national responsibility."
"We will also ensure, and this will probably be handled centrally, that all citizens can have access to a text of the Treaty."
"On this score too, scope will need to be provided, though, for all possible information-related campaigns and activities to be handled at national level."
"I think that the signal which the new Commission has sent out, also by appointing the first Vice-President with specific responsibility for communication, is an important step, and further attention is also being paid from those quarters to communication."
"Perhaps I can finish off with Mr Leinen’s remark about the anxiety level, which may be rising here and there nationally with regard to public opinion."
"It is precisely that too that makes it so important for national governments to be able to choose the right way and have enough scope to give their own interpretation to the entire ratification process and possible referendums."
"Rest assured that we in the presidency, and in the Council, are very aware of our responsibilities and will make every effort to ensure that this whole procedure will have a successful outcome."
"Thank you Mr President. I should also like to thank Mr Leinen for enabling us to hold this debate on a very important issue."
"We are, in fact, convinced that the European Constitution will help us to build a Europe that is democratic, more transparent, more efficient and placed at the service of Europeans."
"It is true, however, that, to make this institutional construction succeed, we need the combined consent and participation of the public. The Commission therefore deems it essential that this Constitutional Treaty should be extensively presented and explained to the public."
"Let me say at this point that I am answering on behalf of my colleague Mr Vitorino, who asked me to convey his apologies, but I should like to make it clear that, alongside Mr Vitorino, I have followed recent Council debates on the draft Constitution, on behalf of my colleague Mr Barnier."
"I shall therefore respond briefly, Mr President, in accordance with your wishes, whilst trying to be as accurate as possible."
"I should first like nonetheless to point out, Mr Nikolai – and I shall just greet Mr Leinen as he goes by – the important share of responsibility that falls to national governments that are signatories of the Treaty."
"I feel that each government is best placed to develop the most suitable approach on a country-by-country basis, depending on the particular sensitivities, and the political and social context peculiar to the country concerned."
"That being the case, we in the Commission naturally intend to offer our complete support to this effort, and it is against this backdrop that, from as early as July, Mr Prodi, the President of Parliament and the Chairman of the Committee of the Regions, along with Mr Vidal-Quadras and Mr Vitorino, have been appealing to all European, national, regional and local parliamentarians to contribute to this debate."
"It is also in this context that we launched the campaign entitled ‘A thousand debates for Europe’."
"This is a target that we should like to reach and even exceed."
"May I call on each of you to promote these debates and contribute to them?"
"I naturally call on the Members of the Commission to do likewise."
"I should also like to announce what has been done within the scope of the PRINCE actions, the European citizens’ information programme."
"Here, too, the Commission, in conjunction with Parliament, has endeavoured to make it easier to produce explanatory notes to present and explain the text adopted and the process that was followed in order to prepare it."
"With the 2004 credits, we have begun updating brochures for the general public and multilingual guides to the Constitution."
"More than ten million copies of these brochures and guides will be published."
"I believe we will therefore have a volume of information never previously achieved."
"We have made arrangements to have a video produced, which will be distributed from 29 October, together with information panels intended for all our intermediaries and networks, as well as for the national and regional public services that will be using them."
"Next, the Commission has endeavoured to arrange seminars for journalists: we hope to reach at least five hundred journalists, who will come to Brussels to familiarise themselves with the Constitution and talk with forums comprising MEPs attending the Convention and representatives of civil society."
"Lastly, Parliament and the Commission, along with the Council, may decide to hold another version of the ‘Springtime of Europe’ initiative, which had reached numerous young people; schools are asked to arrange information meetings on their premises."
"Mr Leinen, there is therefore a wide range of tools being put in place."
"I should therefore like to say that the Commission is not in favour of launching an overall, wide-ranging, pan-European campaign on the Constitution."
"That would be potentially counterproductive, because such an initiative might be perceived as a supranational propaganda exercise."
"Let us not forget, as I said earlier, that ratifying a Treaty is a constitutional process and that in each Member State, therefore, there is a need to sense what is appropriate and to determine the ways in which the Commission is to intervene by means of European public funds."
"All of this requires a tailor-made approach, hence the need for dialogue between our three institutions: Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"Next, turning to Mr Nikolai, I should like to thank him and the Dutch Presidency for arranging the informal meeting of competent ministers, taking place on 5 October, precisely to look into how this major information campaign can be organised."
"Mr Leinen, I am certain, as you are, that factual and objective information will be able to dispel a lot of the misunderstandings. Consequently, following the meeting on 5 October, we must be in a position to envisage what can be done in each of the Member States."
"It is on that basis that the Commission will support the efforts undertaken to this end."
"I also clearly noticed your concern, which I share, that this informal meeting should able to specify timetables and to see who is in the best position to address each national situation."
"All of this will, of course, demonstrate clearly what might be the best use of budgetary investment earmarked for these actions."
"This is my answer on the Commission’s behalf."
"We want to set up a programme and an information plan following up this meeting organised by the Dutch Presidency with the specific aim of adopting a practical, concerted approach and of setting up realistic action programmes that cater to our countries’ specific needs."
"Please allow me, Mr President, on behalf of the Commission, to thank Parliament for having, by organising this debate, already stressed the importance of this information which, once again, we want to be objective but which, above all, we want to be as complete as possible and as accessible as possible to the greatest number of people."
"Mr President, I am pleased to see you chairing this plenary sitting because it has a very important significance: that the President of the European Parliament stands by his word and that the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty is this Parliament’s political priority."
"I also believe, therefore, that this oral question from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs comes at a good time and – Jo Leinen said this very appropriately – it appeared that we had finished our work by approving the Constitutional Treaty."
"It appeared that the issue of ratification was now something which fell to the national authorities, to the Parliaments, to the peoples."
"I do not believe this, I believe that it falls to all of us and also to the institutions of the Union."
"I was very pleased, Mr Nicolaï, to hear you say that the Ministers are going to deal with this issue."
"You have signed the Constitutional Treaty and, therefore, you, like us, have an interest in seeing it ratified as soon as possible."
"Nevertheless, Commissioner Barrot’s speech worried me because, apart from the leaflets and the video, I heard that the Commission believes it would be harmful to carry out an information campaign at European level."
"How can it be harmful?"
"What is the Commission’s view of the Constitutional Treaty?"
"If it believes it represents progress, a step forward for the European citizens, it should say so, as Parliament will do."
"We are currently producing a report which will be approved on 15 December."
"If that report is in favour of the Constitutional Treaty, this Parliament must not remain neutral, but must campaign in favour of it."
"I therefore believe, Mr Barrot, that the Commission must consider what it is going to do on this issue."
"I believe it is very important to send a clear political signal of where we are, because the European Constitution is very important for the future of Europe and, therefore, all of us – the institutions of the Union and the Member States – must stand together in order to win this battle as well."
"Mr President, 25 Member States are about to sign and then embark on their ratification procedures. These procedures are national."
"They are matters for national and internal debate."
"Does that mean that there is no legitimate interest in members from other countries participating in those national debates?"
"With all due caution, it is legitimate to draw attention within each Member State to the fact that their national decision on ratification has implications for everyone else in Europe as well."
"It is not insignificant that 25 elected governments of our Member States have all come to the conclusion that this new Constitution is the best way forward for the European Union."
"It will not be insignificant either if our Parliament endorses that Constitution in December by an overwhelming majority."
"It is right to draw this to the attention of people."
"It is right to try and Europeanise the debate in that way."
"Some have suggested having national referendums all on the same day."
"That we know is virtually impossible, but some Member States may wish to coordinate their referendums within a certain time period."
"That is up to them."
"It would make the debate more European."
"But the most important thing we can do is coordinate our information work."
"I welcome the fact that the Council is meeting to discuss that."
"It is necessary if only to avoid contradictions, with the Commission saying one thing, the Council saying another, the Parliament saying something else."
"We must focus on getting the facts across because the facts speak for themselves."
"This debate is myth against reality."
"All we need to do is provide factual information and I am confident we will win the battle of ratification."
"Mr President, to some extent I feel that the wonderful camel of the Constitution has now approached the eye of the needle."
"It can, of course, be squeezed through, but it can only be squeezed through if all Members of the European Council accept that they have a collective and individual responsibility to campaign for it to be brought into force."
"For several national leaders, this means that they will be obliged, for the first time, to campaign on European questions."
"Coordination of the plot, getting the story right, seems to me to be extremely important."
"Secondly, the European Council must avoid a scramble to be at the end of the list – ."
"There should be a cluster approach to ratification with the keener, more assured integrationists going first, rather than forming a nervous queue."
"Public opinion will query why our national leaders are frightened of their own shadow on Europe and fearful of putting the argument for the Constitution in a positive and trenchant way that embraces the European dimension."
"This is a chance for our leadership to grow the European polity."
"To the Commission I would say that public relations exercises are all fine."
"One should ask why the Commission, at this sensitive moment, has seen fit to cut the budget in half, but what we really need is a political Commission, a campaigning Commission that will complement the role of the European Council to bring real leadership to the European citizen."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am extremely surprised at your position on this issue."
"During the debates of the coming months on the ratification of a European Constitution, who else should act as an advocate of this Constitution, and as a guardian of the broad consensus achieved in the European Convention and of the concept of European integration, if not the European institutions, and if not this House?"
"Yet the institutions present a curious sight, which reminds me of children who lose their ball while playing, and who watch spellbound as the ball bounces onto the road and under the wheels of cars to see if the ball will somehow appear again undamaged on the other side of the road."
"We cannot allow this Constitution to become a pawn in what are purely national and nationalist debates, and we cannot leave it to the mercy of domestic political grudges and calculations."
"I would have expected the Commission to ensure that this does not happen."
"What action is the Commission taking?"
"There is no longer even a portfolio for the Constitution in the incoming Commission, or a Commissioner responsible for it."
"There were two Commissioners responsible for the Constitution in the outgoing Commission, yet there is no longer even one at this decisive stage of the debate on it."
"What action is the Commission taking?"
"It is quartering the budgetary appropriations for communication and for campaigns to inform the public about the European Constitution."
"If you wish to relinquish your responsibility for the Constitution, and if you wish to be an engine of European integration and the Treaties, but not an advocate of the development of European integration, you should continue on your current course of action."
"You have an extremely important historical decision to take; do you wish, together with this House and the Council, to prevent the Constitution becoming a pawn to nationalism, renationalisation in Europe and chauvinism?"
"Take a look at your own country, where members of the Convention have now come out in opposition to the Constitution."
"Has it not become clear to you that a great deal of courage is required to defend together this common project for a common future?"
"Mr President, I am very pleased that referendums on the Constitution are to be held in an increasing number of Member States, and I hope that the Government of my own country will open the way for such a referendum as quickly as possible."
"Every effort must, however, be made in this connection in order to ensure that Europe, and, more specifically, the text of the Constitution, are actually debated."
"Mr Leinen and Mr Voggenhuber are entirely correct to say that we must face the risk of the Constitution becoming a pawn in domestic political or intra-party intrigues."
"There can be no doubt that one of the main problems in the various public discussions which have been initiated is a lack of detailed knowledge on the contents of the Constitution, and in some cases a fair amount of nonsense is being talked already."
"More action therefore needs to be taken to provide targeted information, and this is a point that I would like to make to the Commission."
"Maybe for once it should not just be the facts which are conveyed to the public, but also the difficulty of the debate, the pros and cons of individual arguments, tax policy, and so on."
"Many examples can be given of debates that have already taken place in this context."
"My final observation, Mr President, I would like to address to Mr Nicolaï."
"I noted with interest that the Council is considering arranging ratification at a similar time in all Member States."
"Perhaps a date should be set for May of next year?"
"Such a date would be of high symbolic value, as it will be the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War."
"The aim would be to set an example for peace and stability in our continent and for greater integration, and this would be a viable way of doing so."
"Mr President, both my party, the League of Polish Families, and my political group, the Independence and Democracy Group, always have been and always will be opposed to the creation of a constitution for the whole of Europe."
"It is appropriate for an issue of such significance for the future of our nations to be the subject of a broad and fair public debate and referendums in all 25 Member States, without exception."
"The funds made available in the EU budget for informing citizens about the constitution should be split fairly between supporters and opponents of the Treaty, however."
"As to the proposal by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that the Treaty should be ratified between 5 and 8 May in all Member States, as some kind of reminder of the end of the Second World War, it should be regarded as a dismal historical joke."
"Europe’s times of strength have been when it existed free from domination by any country, and when cooperation between free nations was not hampered by supranational bureaucracy and structures."
"Our position is clear."
"We will always oppose the building of a federalist Europe with a constitution that takes precedence over the laws of sovereign nations."
"At a time like this, it is always very difficult to know what balance should be struck between looking for support for a Constitution and looking for fairer debate, but the two ideas are not mutually exclusive."
"In fact, further and fuller debate should be welcomed by all sides, because it would allow us to get rid of some of the misconceptions with regard to what aspects of the Treaty we would be voting on in our countries, or debating in our national parliaments."
"It is also only right that we as a European Parliament, as the directly-elected representatives of the European people, should be seen to give leadership in relation to the way the discussions and the debate should take place in the Member States."
"Let us not forget that, first and foremost, our most important role as Members of the European Parliament is as public representatives of the people."
"We are here not to hold on to one ideological viewpoint, but to give what we consider to be a fair, honest and truthful account of what is contained within the text of the Treaty."
"Therefore, I can go along with what was proposed in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, to ensure that this kind of debate can take place; to ensure that some of the lies that were told in the past about what was in the Treaty are refuted; and to ensure that those rightful concerns that people have with regard to the future of Europe are given an opportunity to be aired within a public debate."
"I would urge all Members to support this resolution."
"Mr President, a few days ago the Committee on Constitutional Affairs discussed the allocation of large amounts of EU money to institutions whose job it is to inform the European public about the Constitutional Treaty."
"Yet one cannot help thinking that this is not intended to be an objective discussion on the draft Constitution, but rather an extremely biased one, and what might even be called propaganda."
"In view of the fact that to date the European public has known relatively little about the content of the Constitutional Treaty, an overly biased campaign promoting the Constitution would have a negative impact on EU citizens, who would feel that they had once again been presented with ."
"This would mean a further increase in the euroscepticism recently highlighted by the low turnouts in the European elections, and we will therefore need to find the courage to allow a controversial discussion on the Constitutional Treaty to take place."
"We will also have to acknowledge the Treaty’s shortcomings and deficits, or else citizens will not truly accept this Constitution for Europe."
"Domestic referendums on a national scale and the attendant debates are in no way connected with chauvinism or nationalism, but are merely part and parcel of democracy."
"Mr President, I am one of those who, within the Convention, were, along with you, the first to campaign for the future Constitution to be submitted for ratification by the people, and, if possible, on the same day."
"I am delighted to note that the decision to hold referendums is catching on."
"The problem with a referendum, however, is that while it is the most democratic process, it is also, by its nature, the most likely to be used for the wrong objective."
"In all the countries concerned, there is a risk that the European referendum will turn into a national plebiscite."
"Furthermore, given that the danger and the aim are identical everywhere, our governments have every interest in adopting a joint ratification strategy."
"Such a strategy must, to my mind, comprise at least three elements."
"Firstly, the question put to the public and the explanatory notes relating to it should be presented jointly."
"Secondly, there should be a timetable."
"In this respect, the best solution would be, as certain Members of this House have already stated, to hold referendums on the same date in all countries concerned."
"Thirdly, and I feel that this point is of particular importance, the issue of the final borders of the European Union must be set out clearly."
"This is a debate that neither Parliament, nor the Council, nor the Commission have thus far had the courage to hold."
"It is, furthermore, impossible to put the creation of a political Europe before the public without specifying what we mean by the word ‘Europe’ and without fixing the borders or at least the criteria for defining the borders."
"In several countries, including mine, the notion of belonging to a political Union without borders – the future composition of which would be left entirely to the good will of the governments of tomorrow – would be rejected by the vast majority."
"The Council must be aware of this when it comes to making its decision on Turkey."
"Mr President, I too am glad that you are here, though I am naturally not surprised, because we in this House are lucky enough to be headed by somebody who in the Convention, as a member of that Convention, worked courageously to achieve the very Constitution whose ratification by the people we are trying to achieve."
"The process of creating a Constitution is only complete when those whose sovereignty is at stake, in this case the people – the European citizens – give their final word on the text – in this case, the Constitutional text – which is submitted to them for consideration."
"Nevertheless, we are seeing a truly worrying phenomenon: only those who are against the European Constitution are expressing themselves clearly, those who have doubts, those who are trying to use this process for party-political or opportunist purposes."
"The governments in the Convention, the parliamentarians, restricted ourselves to saying that this Constitution is good and that it should therefore be supported."
"Well, now we must explain this Constitution, we must state what is positive about it and that, without it, we would be heading for the paralysis represented by the Treaty of Nice."
"We must do that from a European point of view."
"Mr President, we must Europeanise the debate on the Constitution, we must Europeanise the process of ratifying the Constitution which, as its name indicates, is a European Constitution. And there are only two ways of doing this."
"Firstly, by coordinating its ratification in the Member States."
"There are 25 of us, but we are only one Union and the referendums must therefore be held within a few days of each other and why not close to the Day for Europe."
"Secondly, the institutions cannot be neutral in this debate."
"Parliament, the Council and the Commission, in common agreement, must carry out a strategy of information, debate and persuading the public, in order to defeat our main enemy, which will be low turn-out."
"With majority participation, this Constitution will come into being."
"Mr President, given that a ‘no’ vote in one country can cause the process of adopting the Constitutional Treaty to fail for the whole of the EU, we can no longer deem the ratification processes to be national."
"We are well aware, for that matter, that ratifying the Treaties, and in particular by means of referendums, is contaminated by internal political issues."
"France recently gave us a lamentable example of this."
"We must, as far as possible, denationalise the debate and encourage Heads of State or Government to coordinate their actions towards successive ratifications."
"In order to create a positive spiral of adoption, it would be worthwhile preventing the most reluctant countries from holding their vote first."
"Accordingly, the proposal to hold the vote in all EU countries during the same period, namely 5 to 8 May 2005, should enable us to employ certain symbols in the cause of adoption: the symbol of unity of place – an entire European Union expressing its opinion at the same time, as opposed to 25 countries voting one after another; the symbol of the unity of one text – one joint answer to one joint question; the symbol of the unity of time – the whole Union voting at the same time, from Thursday 5 to Sunday 8, whilst complying with national traditions of polls held either during the week or on a Sunday; and lastly, the symbol of 8 May 2005, the 60th anniversary of the last conflict that set us against one another."
"It is therefore on the platform of these sixty years of peace, thanks to the European Union, that we could build the Europe of tomorrow."
"This is the thrust of this proposal."
"Mr President, I will go along with Mr Borrell’s proposal that we Catalans in the House should not speak our own language."
"Instead, I will use a language which is very close to Strasbourg and the Alsace region."
"As a linguist, I would like to make known my strong opposition to the fact that Spain is calling for the EU’s linguistic regime to include Catalan and Valencian as if these were two entirely different languages."
"Catalan is spoken from north to south, from Salses, in Roussillon, to Guardamar, south of Valencia, and from west to east, from Fraga, in the Autonomous Community of Aragon, to Alghero, in Sardinia."
"To speak of Catalan and Valencian is to promote linguistic secessionism, which has long been one of the strategies of cultural destruction."
"As the Romans said, ‘!’ which, translated into an official EU language, means ‘divide and rule!’."
"If Europe is moving closer to an ever more effective unity, what point can there be in fragmenting both languages, which in actual fact are spoken across borders and other divisions?"
"A Europe which does not give a voice to all its peoples will be an incomplete Europe."
"We have a great opportunity to build a true European federalism."
"Mr President, I love the word 'democracy' because it puts the word 'people' in front of the word 'rule' – government by the people, of the people, for the people."
"I have heard the word 'democracy' repeated many times in Parliament and in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on which I sit."
"However, the word is empty without the reality."
"I see little evidence of democracy in the strategies being designed to guarantee a positive outcome to the Constitution."
"In the committee we are told that it is our job to 'sell the Treaty', that we should restrict the debate in our home countries, that referendums should be scheduled to maximise the 'yes' vote."
"We are told that we must get the Council to supply funds for the pro-Constitution campaigns."
"In committee draft questions were proposed to ask the Council to specify a strategy to ensure a positive outcome to the ratification procedure."
"I called for the question to be amended to ask the Council to ensure a fair and free ratification procedure."
"I am sorry to say that 'fair and free' lost."
"I turn to the Council, Commission and Parliament: if we believe in democracy – especially in this process that you, Mr President, called the most important since the founding of the Union – I entreat you to do whatever you can to ensure a fair and free process, to ensure that resources are used to truly inform people, especially by distributing copies of the Constitution to all the electorate, and by ensuring that all sides of the debate are thoroughly aired."
"If we insist on democracy in this process – not just in word but in reality – then we will have a real outcome that every true democrat can accept."
"Mr President, on a point or order and so that it may appear in the Minutes, I would like to congratulate the interpreters on the translation into Spanish of Mr Joan i Marí’s speech, which was perfect."
"Thank you very much. I feel that the interpreters will be very grateful, as I am, because I will be able to recognise German spoken by a Spaniard more easily next time."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although it is not the subject of the debate, I take the opportunity to express my feeling of regret at the fact that it was not thought desirable to insert a reference to Europe’s Christian roots in the preamble to the Constitution."
"Having said that, I can only agree with the requirement to give the people as much information about the draft Constitution as possible and to establish a coordinated timetable for ratification of the Constitution itself, in the hope that all European citizens can have the right and the opportunity to take part in this stage of the constitutional process through popular referendums in all the Member States."
"We should not be afraid of participation and democracy, because it is the only way in which the new Europe of peoples, of rights and of the Constitution will really be a strong and empowered Europe."
"I too am a dissenting member of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the Constitution."
"I oppose the Constitution because I dare still to cling to a belief in maximising meaningful national sovereignty."
"Could I, in that context, ask the Council and the Commission to agree that the first priority in any referendum should be that it should be seen to be both free and fair?"
"In this regard, is it not imperative to guarantee two things: first, to guarantee that the case against the Constitution is not suppressed in a welter of one-sided propaganda emanating from the European institutions and, secondly, that the democratic referendum process is not distorted by unbalanced funding from external sources?"
"Therefore, could the Council and the Commission agree that they would resolutely resist the temptation of bankrolling a pro-Constitution propaganda offensive across Europe?"
"These are national referendums and they should be allowed to be so."
"– Mr President, my speech is in Finnish and Swedish."
"I would like to raise three issues."
"Firstly, I take a very positive view of this Constitutional Treaty."
"It is a notable improvement on the Treaty of Nice, the Treaty of Amsterdam and all the earlier treaties."
"It makes the EU more democratic, more transparent and more effective."
"Secondly, it is the responsibility of all the institutions to approve this Treaty."
"It is the Commission’s responsibility, it is the Council’s responsibility and it is the European Parliament’s responsibility."
"If the Treaty fails in one country, it fails in the entire Union, and that is not in our best interests."
"The third and last part in the Swedish of the Moomins."
"I think we must all work enormously hard to get this new treaty through."
"In 2005, our task as Members of the European Parliament is precisely that described by Mr Méndez de Vigo, Mr Leinen, Mr Duff, Mr Voogenhuber and Mr Corbett, so we must try to push this treaty through."
"It is in our interests."
"– Mr President, a start may be half the battle, but it is not the be all and end all."
"A start was made on the Constitution by the Intergovernmental Conference, with the acceptance of the Constitutional Treaty, a conference which finished its work during the Greek Presidency in June 2003."
"It is a success of which we are all particularly proud."
"However, that is only half the story; this Constitution needs to be approved."
"It would, I believe, be a tragic mistake and somewhat schizophrenic on our part, to coin a phrase, if we were to consider that our worries were over and that the entire matter and the entire problem had now been shifted to the national governments because, even if this Constitution is approved by everyone, if it is approved on the basis of internal political or micro-political dialogue in each country, its approval will be a pyrrhic victory for Europe."
"Given, of course, that the lion's share, as far as information is concerned, lies with the Member States, the national parliaments and the citizens, I consider that there are three basic elements of coordination which are vital to us:"
"First, as European and institutional bodies, we must not interfere or engage in repellent action; we need to coordinate so that the left hand knows what the right hand is doing."
"Secondly, at the very least we must help to inform citizens in clear, simple words about the differences which exist between the Treaty of Nice and this new Constitution."
"Anyone who disagrees with this Constitution will need to explain to themselves and everyone else why and how the present treaty protects their reasons for disagreement better than our Constitution, because we shall continue to function; it will merely be with the Treaty of Nice."
"Thirdly, and this is especially important, information will also need to continue after the referendums."
"The Constitution is alive. It does not end with its approval."
"On the contrary, it starts with its application."
"It gives our citizens rights."
"Rights of participation and cooperation to force us to legislate."
"Rights which they need to know in order to take advantage of them."
"We have this obligation if our Constitution is to be a constitution which promotes not only democracy, not only transparency, but also the power of the citizen in the Union we are building together."
"At least ten countries are to hold referendums on the Constitution."
"That is wise, because a constitution regulates the power wielded by politicians."
"Such power can only be given by the people, not taken away from them."
"I hope that my country will be the eleventh country to believe in democracy and let the people decide in a referendum."
"The EU institutions must support the people and democracy by being neutral in what they have to say and by matter-of-factly pointing out the changes in respect of previous treaties."
"It is not the role of the institutions to engineer ‘yes’ votes in referendums but to provide people with a basis for taking a decision."
"Otherwise, the EU is failing to live up to its own democratic ideals."
"I am pleased that the Commission will not be funding campaigns but, if it does so, the ‘yes’ and ‘no’ sides must be given equal resources."
"Mr President, as a member of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs I greatly regret that today’s discussion has been dominated by military jargon."
"There has been talk of the ‘fight for the Constitution’, and of the need to win the ‘battle for the Constitution’."
"It should be remembered that wherever there is a battle there are enemies."
"Yet there are enough divisions in Europe and the European Union without now creating new ones by using military jargon reminiscent of the Cold War."
"My question to Mr Barrot and Mr Nicolaï is this: do you really believe that the idea of holding constitutional referendums in Europe on one single day, an idea which to my mind is quite impracticable, is a feasible one?"
"This would after all amount to propaganda and imposing happiness on nations by force."
"Mr President, if this must take place on a single day, I would like to propose 30 February."
"Mr President, I would briefly like to say that we have all come to the European Union because we share the same constitutional values."
"Whilst there is nothing essentially new in the Constitution, apart from greater legal and political integration of the Member States, it heralds a new political era, by making it clear that Europe is more than just an economic area or a market."
"It is an area of values, a constitutional area, where the guiding principle is human dignity."
"As a joint operation, Europe requires joint mobilisation."
"The Constitution will not be made in the classical manner of the old constitutions; it will mobilise European institutions, States and the public."
"The European institutions that gave birth to the dream cannot now give birth to fear."
"They must mobilise themselves in this joint task of involving the public in objective and genuine debate on the reasons behind the Constitution, which is purely and simply an extension of the constitutional convergence between different States."
"The institutions must now therefore communicate directly with the public and must get away from exclusive mediation by the States."
"The institutions are taking the required steps towards transversal action in the process of concluding the constitutional foundation."
"We must get away from the absurdity of partitioning European discourse and, more importantly, from the absurdity of instrumentalising European discourse."
"We are entering a new political era."
"The European institutions must be at the forefront of this."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Nicolaï, I should like to begin by registering my displeasure at the brief introduction to nationalist-style populist rhetoric and to parochial attitudes to national languages to which we have been treated."
"Even a constitutional debate offers an opportunity to people with that parochial mentality, people who are incapable of grasping what is at stake."
"Commissioner, I should like to draw your attention to the fact that, in our view, it would be crazy for the Commission, which had a decisive role to play in tabling the draft Constitution, to renege on its responsibility to take part in a joint strategy aimed at its approval."
"A joint strategy between the Commission and the Council carries a good deal more weight and goes beyond a mere information campaign used to disseminate objective information."
"Whilst that role is very important, a common strategy goes beyond that and carries more weight."
"Given the nature of the European Project and, in particular, of the conditions for approving the draft Constitution, as has most aptly been said earlier, in any national process of approving a draft, in every country the interests of other States, the interests of all States and the interests of all European citizens are an important factor."
"The intervention on the part of the Community institutions, the Commission, the Council and Parliament itself, is, moreover, the only one, in view of its unquestionably supranational nature, in particular that of the Commission and Parliament, to intervene firmly in this process without laying itself open to the charge of interfering in the internal democratic process of the States concerned."
"Supranational institutions do not lay themselves open to the charge of interfering in the internal democratic process of States and therefore have a greater responsibility in fighting for the approval of the Constitution."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight to have Europe’s Christian roots written into the prologue of the European Constitution will have brought into conflict, throughout the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference, the most hardened proponents of secularism, headed by Mr Michel and Mr Chirac, on the one side, and certain countries such as Poland, Italy or Portugal, supported by no less prestigious a figure than Pope John-Paul II, on the other."
"In the end, the atheist and Masonic lobbies won the day, thereby turning their backs on Europe’s past and its magnificent Christian civilisation."
"This was no doubt in order to pave the way for Turkey’s accession to the EU."
"Think, ladies and gentlemen, of the terrible sentence addressed by Cardinal Pie, a great Bishop of Poitiers, to Emperor Napoleon III: ‘If the time for Jesus Christ to reign has passed, then the time for governments to reign has also passed’."
"Three years later, there was Sedan."
"A Europe without memory, which is unfaithful to its past and deprived of its Christian soul, is a Europe without a future, condemned to the worst depths of servitude."
". Mr President, your predecessor was kind enough to point out that the Council is entitled to speak for longer."
"I consider it not so much a right as a duty to be able to comment on a number of really important remarks."
"I cannot guarantee that I will be finished in five minutes. I would remind you, Mr President, that I still have some minutes left over."
"I will of course abide by your rules."
"In my view, a number of your Members have made very crucial remarks about whose responsibility it is, and to what extent, to bring these ratification processes to a successful conclusion."
"Mr Corbett, Mr Vigo, Mr Stubb and many others have pointed out that there is, of course, a joint responsibility for the success of the process after 29 October when the ratification is signed."
"I asked the Council to remain within these time constraints, given that there is another debate to follow this one in the Council’s presence and that the Bureau was notified of your time constraints, Mr Nicolaï."
"Nevertheless, we are certain that Parliament will benefit from any time that you spend beyond that limit and from the time you spend giving answers in Question Time, which follows."
". Mr President, I will of course comply with your rules."
"In my view, a number of your Members have made very crucial remarks about whose responsibility it is, and to what extent, to successfully complete these ratification processes."
"Mr Corbett, Mr Vigo, Mr Stubb and many others have said, there is, of course, a joint responsibility for the success of the process after 29 October, when the ratification is signed, albeit because we all rely on each other."
"We all rely on the success of all 25 ratification processes for this Treaty to enter into force."
"Where we can – and I am specifically saying this on behalf of the Council, we will actually do this in the Council as well – where we can, we must support and strengthen each other in this, and also learn from each other."
"It would be unfortunate, as Mr Voggenhuber pointed out in his critical remarks, if we were to blame each other and pass the buck to one another, because I consider it, in fact, important and valuable, as many in this House have said, that the three institutions carry a responsibility in this."
"It is my conviction that, so far, the Commission has played a very constructive, positive role in communicating Europe and informing the public about the Treaty, and it would, in fact, be wrong to put the ball in their court, because I see the Member States and Members of this House as also having a very considerable responsibility in this area."
"Many of you raised the point about the coordination in time of the different referendums."
"Many fine words have been spoken about how good it would be to have these referendums take place at a symbolic moment within a limited timeframe."
"I hope that you will agree with me that, although we might like the idea, we will not actually entertain it, because these are matters specifically related to constitutional legislation and should remain in the national sphere."
"I assume that this House, in terms of subsidiarity and the question as to which government layer would need to deal with what area, would not like to meddle in this anyway."
"What is very important, though, is that the different Member States examine when and how harmonisation could be possible, and that is exactly what we at the Council and the Council’s Secretariat are doing."
"We are publishing the national schedules, thus allowing governments and parliaments nationally to take these into consideration when drawing up their own schedules so as to see whether dates can be organised close together."
"This has nothing to do with whether you believe in a European approach to this issue or not, as some of you suggested."
"It has everything to do with constitutional law and it also concerns precisely the sensitivities which many of you have mentioned that referendums are at risk of becoming a national plaything."
"Many Members have given voice to this concern."
"That is precisely why the Council is convinced that it is good to give national parliaments and national governments some leeway in choosing a sensible date for such a referendum."
"This could be connected to all kinds of things, including other elections, or other current issues, in the country in question."
"I think that the ratification by 25 countries benefits from those countries having a good look at each other, but that those national responsibilities should remain intact at the same time."
"Talking of referendums, further to Mrs Kaufmann’s and Mr Schlyter’s remarks, I would point out that at present, nine Member States have decided to hold a referendum, eleven Member States have decided against it and five countries are still undecided."
"What is crucial is the way in which we, the different institutions, the different governments, enter into these ratification procedures, the way in which we enter into discussion with public opinion, and the way in which we will tackle the referendums in those countries where referendums will be held."
"I think that to start with, Mr Méndez de Vigo emphatically stated that we should be in favour, and I also considered this as an appeal to the Member States and governments."
"We as governments and Council will be signing that Treaty and are in favour of it."
"We are not impartial towards that Treaty."
"It is important to us for this Treaty to be adopted and ratified."
"It is important because anyone who reads this Treaty will see that, however you look at it, Europe will, thanks to the new Treaty, become much more democratic."
"Simply consider the enormous widening of responsibilities of this House; finally, it is a fully-fledged European Parliament."
"Or consider the level of decisiveness, which will visibly improve with the new Treaty, again an example of decision-making by majority."
"Consider transparency, clarity, which will improve with this Treaty."
"Another point that is very important when I listen to all your remarks is that even the Eurosceptics are, in my opinion, pleased with this Treaty."
"Why?"
"Because it stipulates, in detail and effectively, this very subsidiarity, those questions of who decides on what. As a result, Europe becomes more democratic not only at European level, but also nationally, because national parliaments can stand up and can argue that something could be done more effectively at national level and is not a matter for Europe."
"I do not think that there is a conflict – as a number of you mentioned – between devoting all our attention to those in favour, or working on the opponents, or, as the question has been raised, giving factual information as against preliminary information."
"In my view, Mr Crowley, among others, is right to say that the two are not mutually exclusive by any means."
"I am also looking in the direction of the Commission, because it had already hinted at this fact, with good reason."
"Factual information is a way of despatching the myths, the lies as they were referred to here."
"Using factual information, we can illustrate why this Treaty means progress for everyone in Europe."
"Finally, I should like to comment on the meeting that is to be held in Amsterdam on 5 October, involving the European Affairs Ministers, to deal specifically with communicating Europe and also with ratification and with those referendums that are scheduled."
"I am delighted with what Mr Barrot had to say about this."
"It is also gratifying that Mr Vitorino will be attending that meeting, and I welcome his statement that what we discuss at it should impact on the Commission’s further plans and in turn, needless to say, also on the decision-making in the European Council on 5 November."
"I am also thrilled that the President of your House, Mr Borrell Fontelles has already confirmed that he will be attending that meeting, because as I said earlier, without the three institutions, we are unable to bring this to a successful conclusion."
"This meeting should be a meeting about communicating Europe, but one that also reveals how it is possible to communicate about Europe."
"It will not be a platform for reading out written-down statements, the media will be present, and I hope that we can demonstrate that Europe benefits from debate."
"What is helpful in that connection is the fact that your previous President, Mr Pat Cox, was prepared to act as moderator during this meeting."
"The principle underlying this meeting, and undoubtedly the entire further procedure where this Treaty’s ratification is concerned, is that it benefits the public and that we take the public seriously."
"Mr President, I wanted to be brief, but should not want any brevity on my part to have given rise to any misunderstandings."
"To Mr Méndez de Vigo, the first and distinguished speaker, I would like to say that there is obviously no ambiguity."
"Firstly, the Commission is fully committed to the draft Constitution, and I can testify that Mr Barnier, followed by Mr Vitorino, whom I assisted during the Council’s closing moments, really did do everything possible to bring it about. It will mark a very important step towards making this Union of ours more democratic and towards a whole series of advances, in which codecision, or rather the extension of Parliamentary codecision, is a major element."
"It follows that there is a manifest commitment to the draft Constitution on the part of the Commission, and that there is no question of it not having an interest in the consultation that will result or in the consultations that will be held in the Member States."
"Quite simply, I tried to explain that the Commission had already undertaken to prepare documents that I believe have the dual merit of being very objective and of presenting the situation as it is now and as it will be once the draft Constitution has been ratified."
"All too often, in fact, the debate on how the EU should develop rather confuses matters, and it is not always very easy to distinguish what exists today from what will exist tomorrow, so we wanted the tools we provided to be practical, clear and operational, even though there is certainly room for their further improvement."
"I hope I have given an account of what the Commission has done about this."
"I do not want there to be any doubt about the fact that funding is a problem."
"We did not allocate EUR 1.5 million to the preliminary draft Budget for 2005 in order to reduce the projects, but because, at the time the preliminary draft Budget was being drawn up, we were still too uncertain of the eventual outcome."
"In any case, we declared our intention of reviewing the situation with you in the course of the Budget procedure."
"The situation is clearer now, and we are ready to act on the basis of the appropriations that your House and the Council, represented by Mr Nicolaï, estimate will have to be set aside for this purpose."
"The Commission is imposing no restrictions in this respect."
"What does actually matter is that the necessary funds be used once the enterprise is underway."
"So let there be no misunderstandings on that front."
"Nor let there be any misunderstanding of what I have said."
"We think that the Commission would be incapable, on its own, of devising an information campaign."
"While again thanking Mr Leinen, I would also like to stress the fact that we are agreed, in particular, on item 6 of the motion for a resolution, which states that the Council, the Commission and Parliament must prepare an appropriate campaign and a communications strategy, and that this necessitates a joint effort by all the parties."
"When stressing the need for a sufficiently confident and effective partnership with the Member States, I certainly do not mean that there should be, in certain Member States, campaigns that are not coordinated and are not harmonized with those of other Member States."
"The simple fact, which Mr Nicolaï has just explained, is that we have to take into account certain national aspects in order to be certain that our information campaign will be as effective as it needs to be."
"It is, then, the desire for effectiveness that motivates us, and the Commission must not be seen as any less interested in the joint effort towards winning the battle to keep the public properly informed."
"It follows that one and all must take their share of responsibility; the Commission will entirely accept its own."
"If Mr Vitorino were here, he would say so forcefully."
"As Mr Nicolaï has just said, Mr Vitorino will be in Amsterdam, and we may hope that the meeting on 5 October will be productive, not only in terms of guidance for our joint information project for all Europe’s citizens – with information that will, let me repeat, be objective – but also perhaps in terms of that coordination for certain consultations for which many of you have rightly expressed a wish."
"It is indeed in our interests that what is becoming a body of European citizens should be able to be heard through consultations organised in the various Member States and through their coordination."
"I will close, Mr President, by expressing the wish that this meeting in Amsterdam might be able to shed as much light as possible on what would make for an effective partnership between Parliament, the Council and the Commission in winning the battle on the information front;"
"I would suggest that it would be objectivity and truthfulness, for I have confidence in Europe and am convinced that truthful information will be likely to win widespread public support."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this debate is now closed."
"Voting on the resolution relating to this debate will take place on 14 October."
"The next item is questions to the Council."
"I now give the floor to Mr Nicolaï to answer the first question by Mrs Ludford on fair trials for European citizens and European residents."
"The debate on these questions put by Parliament to the Council demonstrates that rather than ensuring a frank, clear and illuminating debate, in which different political opinions and arguments are aired on the Constitutional Treaty, Parliament has reacted tentatively and fearfully towards the national referendums that have been announced."
"This is the only way one can interpret the fact that it has questioned the Commission on the action it intends to pursue within the scope of a communication strategy aimed achieving ratification of this Treaty."
"This was also true of the fact that the Council was asked about actions that it intends to pursue aimed at defining a joint Member State approach and, if possible, a coordinated timetable for ratifying the Constitution for Europe, and of preparing a communication strategy with the aim of achieving positive results in the ratification processes."
"Parliament wants an ‘approach’, a ‘timetable’ and a ‘strategy’ to be adopted – using Community resources, including financial resources – to ensure ‘a positive result’, which means approving the ‘European Constitution’."
"This is unacceptable."
"This idea is nothing new, since the Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederations in Europe (UNICE) has called for the same thing."
"The next item is Questions to the Council (B6-0007/04)."
"We shall examine a number of questions."
"Can the Council please give details of what it has done to seek a fair trial or repatriation for European citizens and European residents imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay, Bagram, Abu Ghraib, Diego Garcia and other camps administered by the United States authorities, and to what effect?"
". Mr President, as I have already said in reply to a number of questions from your House, the Council repeats that it is the responsibility of the individual Member State concerned to protect the rights and interests of citizens of the Member States overseas as provided for by the Treaty of Vienna on consular relations."
"Member States whose citizens are held in Guantanamo Bay or elsewhere are taking the steps they consider necessary in order to ensure that their citizens’ rights under their bilateral relations with the United States are respected."
"The Council is unable to provide details of these courses of action, questions concerning which should be addressed to the Member States in question."
"Speaking in general terms, I will point out, in response to this question, that the EU has always expressed its concern about the situation in Guantanamo Bay and has, on several occasions in its dealings with the United States, stated that the treatment of prisoners should conform to the standards laid down by the Geneva Convention and of human rights."
"As recently as July, there was an official discussion between the European Union and the United States, at which the United States highlighted the establishment of what it calls ‘combatant status review tribunals’ following recent rulings by the American Supreme Court."
"Representatives of the European Union set out the concerns that still exist on the European side, including those relating to the creation of a new category of prisoners, termed ‘hostile militants’."
"In conclusion, the Dutch Presidency will, in its dealings with the United States, continue to raise the concerns that remain about the status of the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay and the treatment they receive."
"I thank the presidency of the Council for that reply, but I am bound to say that I find it, yet again, disappointing."
"The European Union is supposed to have a human rights policy under Articles 6 and 7 of the EU Treaty."
"We have the Charter of Fundamental Rights and we are constructing an area of freedom, security and justice."
"We insert human rights clauses in external agreements."
"Indeed, I heard the President of the Council say this morning that in future we will have anti-terrorism clauses in those agreements."
"Yet when dealing with our most powerful and important international partner, the European Union has not reached a common position or made – as I understand it – any formal to the United States."
"Today a lawyer for some of the remaining British detainees has described the stance of the UK Government as craven."
"How would the minister describe the European Union stance overall, when some of our citizens and residents are still under illegal detention, being abused and even tortured and denied either release or a fair trial?"
"Why is the European Union, as such, not making formal representations?"
"Mr President, I regret to say, on behalf of the Council, that I cannot dispel Mrs Ludford’s sense of disappointment, but I do hope that I have clearly expressed our concern and that I have stated that we, where we are able to do so, are discharging our responsibilities and taking the action described in my first intervention."
"Mr President, the Council is not aware of the practice of caging, as described in this question, being carried out in any Member State."
"Having said that, the Council would remind the House that it is fully committed to respect for human rights and to fighting every kind of discrimination on the basis of age or handicap."
"At the same time, too, the Council wishes to point out that all Member States, including the Czech Republic, have signed the European Convention on Human Rights, which includes, as you will be aware, in its Article 3, provisions on the combating of cruel or inhumane treatment, and that they have also ratified the Convention on Children’s Rights and the Convention against Torture."
"The Convention on Children’s Rights contains specific provisions on discrimination on the grounds of disability – Article 2 – and on mentally and physically handicapped children, in its Article 23."
"The Council will remain constantly committed to respect for human rights and to the outlawing of any form of discrimination."
"I am somewhat surprised by the Council's response, as I think we should be aware of the issue of caged beds."
"Not only is it cruel, unjust and undignified, but it causes the children concerned anger, aggression and depression."
"The use of caged beds breaks international law: it is contrary to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and is condemned by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch."
"I have a number of supplementary questions."
"How will the Council monitor the situation?"
"What pressure can the Council bring to bear to end this outrageous use of caged beds?"
"They exist not only in the Czech Republic but also in Slovakia, Slovenia and Hungary."
"What support can be given to the various countries to ensure that a ban is properly implemented?"
"And finally, what is the Council proposing to do in terms of the enlargement negotiations with Romania, where I believe this is also a problem?"
"I would welcome your response, Mr Nicolaï."
"I urge you to take this issue very seriously."

"Mr President, Mrs Stihler will also be aware that the Council’s options and powers are of course limited, but there are, fortunately, other channels and other bodies that can deal with situations of this kind; subject to these limitations, the Council is, of course, always alert, and she will also be aware of the ways in which it can exert influence and become involved should information come to its attention."
"The Dutch Presidency has not included the promotion of the EU's relations with Balkan countries or the promotion of the reconstruction process among its priorities for the external relations sector."
"In its most recent report (the Third Report on the Stabilisation and Association process for South East Europe) the Commission states that an additional amount of EUR 71 million (an increase of approximately 13%) has been granted to the Western Balkans in the 2004 budget for reconstruction together with new measures for the promotion of regional cooperation."
"Within these new frameworks, does the Council intend to take specific initiatives to reinforce reconstruction and regional cooperation between the Balkan countries and the EU Member States?"
"Is the Council satisfied with regard to the implementation of commitments by the countries in the region for enhanced regional cooperation and the promotion of a series of specific goals and initiatives decided on at the Thessaloniki Summit?"
"Does it intend to ask the Commission to produce new proposals on these issues?"
". Mr President, the Western Balkans are still among the European Union’s priorities."
"Mr Bot, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, visited the region between 21 and 23 July; this was one of his first journeys in his capacity as President of the Council of Ministers and emphasised that the region will remain a priority for the EU under the Dutch Presidency and that those countries’ future lies within the European Union."
"The importance that the Dutch Presidency attaches to the Western Balkans is apparent from the various other ministerial meetings, including the very first meeting of the stability association council with the FYROM and the preparations for the first military mission, Operation Altea, in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"At Thessaloniki, in June 2003, the European Union again promised its strong support for the efforts to consolidate democracy and stability in the Western Balkans and undertook to promote their economic development and regional cooperation."
"The European Union and the countries of the Western Balkans already share a strategy and an agenda, the Stabilisation and Association Process (SAP), with which you will be familiar."
"What has to be done is clear and apparent from the new instruments, known as partnerships, which lay down priorities for action and offer the countries of the Western Balkans a coherent framework for their drawing closer to the EU."
"Further progress with the SAP will be dependent on both parties, the EU and the countries of the Western Balkans, being determined to discharge their obligations."
"The speed at which the countries of the Western Balkans move forward on their way to the EU will depend on the results achieved by each of them in carrying out reforms."
"In certain countries, progress must be accompanied by increased regional cooperation, and the European Union will continue to cooperate with the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe, the SEECP, and the other actors concerned in further improving regional cooperation."
"– Thank you very much, Minister, for your reply and confirmation of the commitment of the European Union and, more specifically, the Council, to the process of stabilisation in South East Europe."
"As the European Parliament noted in its annual report and as clearly formulated at the summit in Thessaloniki, we need to start taking stock and evaluating the implementation of the commitments undertaken by the countries in the area in question."
"My question addressed precisely this point."
"I too have taken a stand by saying that there is a further source of assistance over and above the familiar financial framework and over and above the 2004 budget: are you assessing whether these countries in South East Europe are honouring their commitments?"
". I think that the honourable Member has raised an important issue and I was happy to be able to enlighten her about it."
"Other than what I said in my first speech, I have no more detailed information to give in response to her comments."
"The EU is actively involved, in particular via its ECHO programme, in dealing with ecological disasters throughout the world."
"Such disasters, which are increasing in scale, are the result of decades of ecological negligence and may eventually outstrip the EU's ability to provide assistance."
"The EU is a party to the Kyoto Protocol; it is also the world's leading economic and trading power."
"Why does the Council not tackle the causes of environmental disasters which affect the world as a whole, before they occur, by making ratification of the Kyoto Protocol a prerequisite for negotiations and agreements between the EU and third countries?"
". Mr President, the EU’s policy on climate change is clearly recognizable in the EU’s external relations."
"The Council regularly puts climate change and climate issues on the agenda, thereby stressing time and time again the particular importance of the prompt implementation of the Kyoto Protocol."
"This is the case with a number of meetings forming part of policy dialogue, some of which are held at the highest level with partner states such as the United States and Russia, ratification by both of whom could, as you know, tip the balance in getting the Kyoto Protocol implemented."
"Furthermore, I would remind the House that sustainable development, of which climate policy forms a very important part, is a concept featuring in all areas of cooperation with third states, the Cotonou agreement with the ACP countries being one example."
"I am particularly disappointed by the answer given by the Council, as we know we are bringing pressure to bear on the United States and on Russia, but today we know that we have certain means at our disposal, including conditions relating to the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol in the agreements with the Member States."
"What I wonder, and what I want to ask you, then, is whether the EU is ready, whether the Council is ready, when negotiating with third countries, to make trading agreements conditional upon the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol."
"You gave no reply."
"It is obvious, though, that if you want to fight greenhouse gas emissions, that is where you have to start."
"Moreover, the means are there."
"We lead the world."
"Let us use this lever to have the Kyoto Protocol enter into force."
"I would like to add to Mrs Isler Béguin’s question by asking whether the Council is really in a position to try to defend the Kyoto Protocol in its relations with third countries, when I still do not know the Council’s true position on that Protocol."
"How much harmonisation is there amongst the Member States’ policies on the implementation of the Kyoto Treaty and what position will the Member States’ take on 28 September when the International Civil Aviation Organisation considers an amendment which would turn the ICAO regulation on its head in terms of emissions from aeroplanes on international flights?"
". Mr President, I should like to answer the second supplementary question."
"The Council’s powers are in fact limited when it comes to exerting the pressure of which the honourable Members spoke."
"We do what we can, and I can produce evidence of that."
"Perhaps, Mr President, I can do that by adding that the Dutch Minister concerned, as part of the presidency of the European Union, will this autumn be undertaking an international climate tour, against the background of the problems that the two honourable Members have raised."
"He plans to visit the United States, China, India, Brazil, South Africa, Qatar, and also a number of EU Member States, in an effort to mobilise the positive forces around international climate policy and the intended outcome of the tour is that the countries he visits should come to recognise that there is a climate problem and are willing to talk about a long-term climate policy."
"Given the lack of a real debate on European issues during the recent European Parliament elections, will the Dutch Presidency state what new initiatives it wishes to promote to highlight the positive role played by the European Union in the lives of the citizens of the 25 EU Member States?"
". Mr President, this question has everything to do with the debate that we have just had in the plenary on communication with the public, on the poor turnout at the most recent elections to the European Parliament, and on the subject of greater involvement by the public, which is also important to the Council, and on which it made a statement in July."
"The question also indicates the importance of dealing with the public and with the problems that they see themselves as having most to contend with."
"That is precisely the approach that we will be considering at the meeting – to which reference has already been made – on 5 October; the Ministers concerned will be getting to grips with them and will report to the European Council of 5 November; another aspect will be the need to deal not only with day-to-day problems but also to discuss the crucial issue of how to bring Europe closer to the people."
"I think that this subject was adequately discussed in the debate we have just had, but perhaps I might make an additional comment on the procedure."
"This is in particular a matter for the four presidencies following that of the Netherlands to deal with, and needs to be addressed not only in the referendum context but more broadly in the context of communication with the public."
"I wish to thank the President-in-Office for his response to this question and also for his earlier remarks."
"Under the Irish presidency, Minister Roche set up a working group in the Council to look for better ways in which to inform citizens of the benefits of Europe."
"There is a need for greater communication and understanding not only of what Europe does but also of the responsibility of its citizens to ensure we are as good as we can be."
"The only way to guarantee that is by involving the people more directly in open fora and in communication, etc."
"I would like the President-in-Office to reaffirm his commitment to continue this kind of process to find the best way of ensuring that people know exactly what we do and what we do not do at European level."
"Mr President, I will quite willingly reiterate the undertaking I have already given that we shall continue to carry the torch that was indeed lit by my predecessor Dick Roche, Minister for European Affairs during the Irish Presidency, for at least the next four presidencies, and that this torch shall continue to burn."
"– I should like to ask the President-in-Office if he would allow me to extend the search for the positive profile of Europe somewhat, beyond the Europe of the twenty-five to the rest of the world."
"We should not forget that the European Union, with its Community budget and its Member States, is the biggest source of development and humanitarian aid in the world."
"It is clear, however, from the experience of numerous honourable Members who have visited the developing world that this is not visible: the citizens of the developing world are more aware of individual Member States or international organisations, such as the International Bank or the United Nations, than they are of the European Union."
"I believe that, in the effort we are making today to raise our political profile and increase our intervention in the world, we must also pay attention to our image in the outside world."
". Mr President, the debate on ‘Communicating Europe’ has, as the honourable Member said, everything to do with the image of Europe both within and outside Europe, and on that I am in full agreement with her."
"What we are focussing on is public concern in Europe as regards the European Union, which certainly does include discussion of the role played by the European Union in the world, for this too is something that the public increasingly expect of their European Union."
"The Dutch Presidency has stated its desire to work to ensure that transatlantic relations, including economic cooperation and trade relations will be strengthened on the basis of a positive agenda."
"Will the Council now provide a detailed statement on what it intends to include in its positive agenda and will it develop initiatives outside the sphere of economic cooperation and trade relations, for example, in the areas of culture and development aid?"
"Mr President, as the honourable Member rightly observed in his question, the positive agenda for trans-Atlantic relations goes far beyond economic cooperation and trading relationships; it does indeed encompass a whole range of subjects."
"Our partnership with the United States is founded upon shared values and common concerns; our relationship across the Atlantic, as set out in the European security strategy, is unique."
"The European Union and the United States are working on common strategies for dealing with emerging threats such as terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, rogue states and organised crime."
"Both are working closely together to promote respect for human rights in the countries belonging to the United Nations."
"They take joint action to promote peace, stability, democracy and development in such regions as the Balkans, the Southern Caucasus and in countries like Afghanistan."
"They both want to see Iraq develop into a stable, democratic and self-governing country."
"As regards the peace process in the Middle East, they are both committed to working towards a peaceful solution in line with the road map."
"They also work together in crisis management, Darfur in the Sudan being one example."
"It became apparent at the recent EU-US summit on 26 June how strong, deep-rooted and significant the relationship between the European Union and the United States is."
"This summit was an outstanding opportunity to draw up a forward-looking agenda, and, as you know, was the occasion for the adoption of seven joint declarations on the main priorities for cooperation between the EU and the United States."
"The Council’s priority is to concentrate on purposefully following up these declarations."
"As regards cooperation between the EU and the USA in the field of development aid, the EU, in its capacity as donor, is given the opportunity at tripartite meetings to raise issues relating to support."
"The EU’s development policy is framed by poverty reduction, the Millennium Development Goals and agreements on development funding."
"The EU is open to further discussions with the USA relating to these projects."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, relations with the United States are also a factor in many international agreements, for example the Kyoto Protocol, which has not been signed by the United States."
"Do you believe it would be possible for us to conduct negotiations with the United States, with the aim of still reaching an agreement on the Kyoto Protocol?"
"The principle would be to strive for common legislation on both sides of the Atlantic."
". Mr President, the subject of Kyoto has of course been discussed with the United States."
"When discussing Kyoto and the matter of its ratification a moment ago, I stated how we in the Council were handling it and, to be specific, I also stated that the member of the Dutch Presidency concerned is engaged in dialogue, including with the United States."
"As the time allotted to Question Time has elapsed, Questions Nos 7 to 23 will be answered in writing.(1)"
"That concludes Question Time."
"()(2)"
"The next item is two oral questions to the Commission on the Dutch boat belonging to the ‘Women on Waves’ association:"
"- oral question (B6-0010/2004) by Ilda Figueiredo, Francis Wurtz, Eva-Britt Svensson, Miguel Portas and Sérgio Ribeiro, on the ban on entry into Portugal of ‘Women on Waves’ boat."
"- oral question (B6-0011/2004) by Lissy Gröner, Edite Estrela, Jamila Madeira, Emanuel Vasconcelos Jardim Fernandes, Hiltrud Breyer, Jillian Evans, Raül Romeva Rueda, Maria Carlshamre and Claire Gibault, on the banning by the Portuguese Government of the Dutch boat belonging to the ‘Women on Waves’ association."
"Mr President, it is well known that in Portugal the social stigma attached to women who have abortions is actively encouraged and that the political and legal apparatus is used and abused in investigations and court cases of women accused of back-street abortions. This is because of the continued existence of an unjust and disgraceful law that takes no account of social reality or of the reasons why women turn to abortion."
"It is against this backdrop that we have been seeing significant acts of international solidarity towards Portuguese women, including the recent attempt by the Dutch ship belonging to the organisation ‘Women on Waves’ to enter Portuguese territorial waters. It was disgracefully refused entry by the Portuguese Government, thereby preventing debates from being held and information on sexual and reproductive rights from being provided."
"This intolerance reached ridiculous proportions when the Portuguese Government sent two Navy corvettes to surround the Dutch organisation’s ship."
"Following declarations made at the Cairo and Beijing United Nations Conferences, Parliament, in its resolution of 3 July 2002, recommended that governments should develop high-quality national policy on sexual and reproductive health, in conjunction with pluralist civil society organisations. Ample information should be made available on effective family planning methods, with high-quality access to all forms of contraception, which does not happen in Portugal."
"It was also recommended that, in order to safeguard reproductive health and women’s rights, voluntary interruption of pregnancy should be legal, safe and universally accessible. Governments were called upon to avoid taking legal action, under any circumstances, against women having illegal abortions."
"Against this backdrop, we feel that the European Commission cannot turn its back on what is happening in Portugal, on the appalling hypocrisy and violence against women, which clearly encourages back-street abortions and pushes women on the lowest incomes and those with the poorest access to information into the most dangerous activities for sexual and reproductive health."
"We therefore hope that the European Commission will show solidarity with Portuguese women, that it will oppose intolerance and will fall into line with positions that Parliament has already taken in this regard. In so doing, it will promote the actions needed to raise awareness of defending and promoting women’s rights and dignity."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the European Parliament, too, ‘Women on Waves’ are having an impact."
"Why is this so?"
"Ever since the end of August, the Portuguese Government has been preventing the Dutch vessel from entering a port on the west coast of Portugal."
"This Dutch vessel belongs to the ‘Women on Waves’ organisation, which Portuguese women’s organisations have invited to Portugal to give out information on abortion, contraception, and the RU 486 abortion pill, which is the least traumatic method of terminating pregnancy."
"The Portuguese Government evidently regards this as putting Portuguese women in grave danger, or else it would not have taken this drastic course of action."
"The Portuguese Government thought it was worth violating two of the European internal market’s fundamental freedoms: the right to information and the right to freedom of movement within the EU."
"This is a serious political incident; never before has the right to freedom of movement been violated for purely political reasons."
"We in the Socialist Group cannot accept this, and so we are asking the Council and the Commission what they are proposing to do to prevent this unprecedented occurrence in the history of the European Union from being repeated."
"I see this as an important question and one that has to be put to the incoming Commission right now, and we want to see it made perfectly clear that this is not acceptable."
"The incident has had repercussions right across Europe; it is all over the media, for there is of course more to it behind the scenes."
"The fact of the matter is that women in the European Union really are having their freedom curtailed, and we cannot accept the creeping rollback that is going on here."
"We see from the Treaties that, at the level of the nation state, the freedom of movement may be restricted only in the case of a danger to public safety, from terrorism for example, but is that what is at risk in this particular instance?"
"Is women’s health threatened by an epidemic?"
"If so, perhaps it is an epidemic of free thought or of the freedom to decide;"
"I adopt this rather ironic tone in view of the very different views expressed even in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, where the Christian Democrats wanted this case to have a lower profile."
"I do think, though, that it is a very important one, and one that needs to be dealt with here in the European Parliament."
"We want all women in Europe to know how to get access, in the safest possible way, to contraceptives and terminations and to information about them and the safest ways to use them and then to be free to decide for themselves what they want."
"It is clear that this case, at the end of the day, not only has the most profound effect on individual women’s right to choose, but that it is also and at the same time a highly political act, and that is why we cannot accept the violation of two of the four basic freedoms."
"Although we want Mr Barroso to say where he stands on this, I would also ask Commissioner Wallström to add her weight to the women’s case."
"Mr Barroso is presenting eight women as Commissioners and claims to want to give women a better future, but it may be that the substance of his programme will suffer a setback."
"That is something we want to prevent, and that is why we are having this debate today."
"I hope that both the Commission and the Council will clearly state their positions on this."
"If they do not, then I think the or the ‘Women on Waves’ organisation ought to write a thank-you letter to the Portuguese Government for giving us the opportunity to discuss the principle whereby women must be able to decide freely when and how they want to receive information on the termination of pregnancy and what they do with it, and, at the end of the day, also have a free choice as to when and how they want to have a child."
"This is a fundamental issue, and it needs to be discussed in this House."
"Mr President, as the last speaker said a moment ago, a debate on ‘Women on Waves’ soon changes into a debate on abortion, about a woman’s right to choose."
"This happens, of course, in the debate in this House, but also in the media, where the discussion about the reproductive rights of women, which are not recognised in all EU countries, is once again cranked up."
"This is exactly what the ‘Women on Waves’ association wants."
"Consequently, any politician who speaks for or against this organisation and wants to enter into the fundamental debate about abortion, does complete justice to the objectives of this women’s organisation."
"I myself can be brief about this."
"I fully support this House’s position, as set out in Mrs Van Lancker’s report, which is that, although a termination should not be decided upon lightly, women should, have the right to decide in favour of a safe, lawful termination."
"That is what was said by the majority in this Parliament, as indeed it is what is said by ‘Women on Waves’.Portugal, however, has refused to allow the ship access to the port, which is bizarre."
"‘Women on Waves’ is not engaging in illegal activities in Portuguese waters; what it is doing is providing information about a topic which is not to the government’s liking."
"This may well be the thin end of the wedge."
"Indeed, it is only a matter of time before Greenpeaceis refused entry to ports if it says something not to the government’s liking, and that we cannot accept."
"The Portuguese used the argument that the ship is a threat to public health."
"Is the European Commission of the same mind?"
"Mr Bot has already stated that refusing a ship entry on those grounds is not justifiable."
"Does the European Commission share his opinion?"
"Access should not, however, be denied on the grounds of public order either."
"Information activities are not violent."
"They take place in the privacy of the ship in the spirit of dialogue and respect, so the government’s tough response is unfounded."
"The ship has now crossed the border again, just as some 10 000 Portuguese women do every year in search of the treatment they need."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is quite simply in my capacity as a European woman that I would like to speak today on the issue of ‘Women on Waves’."
"Like the Socialist Group in the European Parliament (PSE Group), I wonder whether the Portuguese Government’s decision to prevent the Dutch ship from entering its territorial waters was a breach of international law."
"I also, however, view it as a ban on the provision of care to fellow European women."
"Although in my opinion the ‘Women on Waves’ campaign is conducted in a somewhat provocative manner, I still believe that it is fundamentally legitimate."
"The association’s campaign is concerned with two women’s rights which to my mind are indispensable: the right to health and the right to dignity, both of which are included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"In many Member States these rights have been defended for decades by women who fight to win governments over to their legitimate cause."
"This is also why I personally am shocked to find out that even today and within the European Parliament there is a movement of women trying to question the gains won over a long struggle."
"I am not here to reprimand those Member States which have chosen to restrict, prohibit or punish the practice of abortion, but I believe that the event of which I am speaking today should be an opportunity for these Member States to reopen the debate on this difficult issue."
"Women often have to take the serious decision to end a pregnancy on their own, and it is always a time of great distress."
"It is a choice which is never made casually, but in all conscience, and accusations of guilt or even criminal guilt are not the right response."
"Only dialogue and information will make it possible to move public opinion forward."
"Incidentally, repression is a godsend to illicit businesses which exploit ignorance and social weakness."
"This type of network should have no place in our Europe of freedoms."
"It is the duty of the European institutions to set an example in this field and to ensure that individual freedoms are respected."
"If the Commission fails to take a clear stance, it will be seen not just as a social injustice for these women, but as an unacceptable setback for their fundamental rights."
"I would like to add that the problem does not affect women alone."
"I find it a pity that there are so few men in our Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, and I would like to express my sincere thanks to those who have realised that we must unite to defend our ideas and to demonstrate our commitment."
"Our duty as Europeans is to use our judgment and compassion to help the women of our Member States confront their problems."
"This is why the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE/ADLE Group) calls on the Council and the Commission to adopt a clear and democratic position."
". Mr President, the Commission has been following developments in this situation."
"According to the information available to the Commission, 'Women on Waves', together with other persons and organisations, appealed against the refusal of entry of the vessel into Portugal."
"On 6 September 2004 the administrative and fiscal court of Coimbra adopted a decision on the appeal which has been the subject of a further appeal by 'Women on Waves'."
"The Commission would recall the principles of Community law in connection with the free movement of persons."
"European citizens are entitled to have access to the territory of other Member States in accordance with the various rights to freedom recognised by the EC Treaty, subject to the conditions and limitations provided for by that Treaty and its implementing provisions."
"Member States can restrict this fundamental right enshrined by Article 18 of the EC Treaty solely when this is justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health."
"Where a Member State adopts a measure refusing entry to its territory based on one of these grounds, it must respect the general principles of Community law."
"It must respect fundamental rights, including the right to freedom of expression, and in particular the proportionality principle, as well as the provisions of Council Directive 64/221/EEC of 25 February 1964 on the coordination of special measures justified on grounds of public policy, public security and public health, as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Communities."
"When decisions are taken on grounds of public policy or public security, the conduct of the persons in question must pose a real and sufficiently serious threat to the fundamental interests of society."
"Only the diseases or disabilities referred to in the annex to Directive 64/221/EEC can justify refusals to enter Member States on grounds of public health."
"Under Directive 64/221/EEC, decisions refusing entry or ordering expulsion from the territory must be notified to the person concerned, informing him or her of the grounds of public policy, public security or public health upon which the decision has been taken."
"The person concerned must be able to lodge a complaint against this decision."
"It is for the Portuguese national courts to rule on the validity of the decision, while respecting the general principles of Community law and the provisions of Directive 64/221/EEC."
"The Commission has not yet received a complaint about this incident from the representatives of the 'Women on Waves' organisation."
"However, it intends to contact the Portuguese authorities to obtain more detailed information on the facts related by the honourable Members."
"– Mr President, there is no reason to hold this debate."
"In the case in question, a Portuguese court ruled that the Portuguese Government had acted within the law."
"Under due process of law, the judiciary is independent of the other authorities."
"The Portuguese Government does not give orders to the judiciary."
"Parliament cannot give a ruling on voluntary termination of pregnancy, nor, indeed, on the legality of a judgment."
"Voluntary termination of pregnancy is a matter of exclusive competence for each individual Member State."
"Portuguese law is not substantially different from that of most Member States and was approved by a democratic parliament."
"In a recent referendum, it was decided that it should not be changed."
"I understand that pregnant women must be able to make their own decisions in this delicate matter, but we must also respect the fact that a majority of citizens expressed a different view."
"This is a majority and we operate under due process of law."
"I should like to inform you, Commissioner, that no member of ‘Women on Waves’ was refused entry. They had previously enjoyed complete freedom of movement and expression in Portugal."
"They had no restrictions – they spoke where they wanted to, with whom they wanted and gave the interviews they wanted to give."
"That was until they helped people to obtain and take medicines that are prescription-only because of their potentially harmful side effects."
"One woman, whom I understand to be a doctor, confirms that she obtained this drug over the counter in a Portuguese pharmacy, in violation of basic public health rules."
"Given that these allegations have come from a doctor, this is very serious."
"Long-standing members of the Portuguese Medical Association and of the Portuguese Pharmacists’ Association have protested."
"Limiting freedom of movement in the European area is intrinsically linked to protecting public health and to preventing the practice of illicit acts."
"What actually happened was an incitement to clinically unassisted – I repeat, unassisted – abortion, with the aim of exploiting the fact that many pregnant women are needy and ill-informed, encouraging them to break the law purely for propaganda purposes."
"This really is an appalling violation of human rights, which Parliament should condemn outright."
"Mr President, you would have been better off, and the Conference of Presidents would have been better off, having this debate aborted."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, this debate is a victory for democracy, and is entirely appropriate here today in the European Parliament."
"This is an issue that concerns not only Portugal and women; it is also an issue for men and women throughout the European Union."
"It also concerns the Commission, the Council and Parliament."
"When it refused the Dutch vessel entry into its territorial waters, the Portuguese Government breached not only international law, but also Community law and the Convention on the Law of the Sea."
"Citizens of Europe and defenders of women’s rights have been prevented from entering a European country and treated as though they are criminals."
"The Commission and Parliament cannot and must not remain indifferent when men and women belonging to a non-governmental organisation from one Member State, invited by an NGO from another Member State, with the aim of jointly promoting awareness-raising activities on sexual and reproductive health, have been compared to drug traffickers, illegal fishermen or smugglers."
"The Commission and Parliament cannot and must not remain indifferent."
"The Portuguese Government cited compliance with national law and protection of public health, yet which Portuguese laws were breached, when and how?"
"The law-breakers here were not the women’s organisations, but the Portuguese Government, which violated women’s rights."
"There is also no substance to the alleged danger to public health, since no one aboard the vessel was carrying an infectious disease."
"The Lisbon government made its decision, an incorrect decision, based on assumptions and hearsay in order to intimidate women who support voluntary termination of pregnancy."
"The Portuguese Government prevented the free movement of European citizens within the European area, by means of deliberate obstruction, in order to prevent an awkward debate for the ruling coalition. Stranger still, while the vessel was in Portuguese waters, it was watched at all times by two Portuguese Navy corvettes."
"Should Portuguese warships be used to intimidate citizens who are peacefully and courageously promoting their causes?"
"In a democracy there is no such thing as the crime of expressing your opinion."
"What happened in Portugal with the ‘Women on Waves’ ship must not be allowed to happen again and must not go unpunished."
"If it does go unpunished, it will set a worrying precedent that may lead to restrictions of the rights, freedoms and safeguards that belong to all of us, the citizens of Europe."
"This debate may be divided into two parts."
"Portugal is said to have at least 20 000 illegal abortions per year and to have some of Europe’s highest figures for teenage pregnancies."
"Midwife Maria do Ceu, who carried out illegal abortions, was sentenced to seven and a half years’ imprisonment."
"Portuguese women are not alone in being refused the right to free abortion. Irish, Maltese and Polish women are in the same position."
"Women have rights over their own bodies, and the right to sexual and reproductive health is part of the Convention on Human Rights, ratified by all the EU countries."
"States that have ratified international conventions must also respect those conventions."
"The second part of the debate is about the measures actually taken in connection with ‘Women on Waves’."
"When it became a member of the European Union, Portugal promised, as a state, to respect the four freedoms of movement."
"The exemption invoked is that of national security."
"In this case, I wish to invoke both Community law and the Convention on the Law of the Sea."
"I do not believe that Portugal is so unstable a country that six people in a boat can jeopardise national security."
"Consequently, the proportionality principle may not be invoked in this case."
"Finally, Portugal has broken its promise to the EU, other Member States and the European people when it comes to the freedoms of movement."
"I would ask MEPs to reflect upon how it would look in Europe if other European governments were to ponder which groups of citizens did not share their own views and were then to call out their navies to prevent these groups from entering their ports."
"Such a situation would clearly be unacceptable."
"Through its action, the Portuguese Government has challenged not only women and others throughout Europe who wish to defend human rights and respect for international conventions, but also the whole European idea, together with freedom of movement in Europe."
"I thus wish to call upon both the Commission and the Council to take clear action on this issue without delay."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel that we are not debating here whether or not Portuguese law is among the most backward in Europe – it is – given that, in the area of abortion, it is worse than, say, Tunisia."
"We are not debating why Portuguese women have to go to Spain to have abortions that could be carried out in Portugal, or why those without the means to go to Spain have back-street abortions, which is a matter of concern for Portuguese public health."
"This is not what we are debating."
"It is not even because Portuguese women still have to go to court to expose their pain and their intimate details in a humiliating ordeal. No."
"Nor are we discussing why the Administrative Court of First Instance took the decision that it took in Portugal. No."
"What we are actually discussing here is whether it is legitimate in Europe – because this is a European issue – for a military corvette to confront three men and three women on the high seas and prevent them from reaching a Portuguese port, when they were on a legal vessel and were providing a medical service that has been duly legalised in another Member State."
"This is what we are debating."
"We are debating whether it is possible to create a European project when the Portuguese State, in defence of the vilest and most controversial law in Portugal, is able to, and gives itself the right to, send a military corvette to the high seas against a civil vessel."
"It is this and nothing else that we are discussing."
"Mr Graça Moura may, therefore, wish all he likes to abort this debate, but he has no way of doing so."
"The Commission’s response was an encouraging one, which, while falling short of what was required, ensures that the kind of incident that took place recently will continue to be met with firm opposition by the many people in Europe who believe that the free movement of people and ideas is an integral principle of the European project itself."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank God for giving me the chance to speak before Parliament on the most important issue of modern times, namely the defence of life."
"This is of particular significance at a time when over 50 million children are killed each year in their mothers’ wombs, which amounts to genocide on a considerably larger scale than the millions of Holocaust victims."
"Many people the world over are asking whether there can be any greater degeneracy and bestiality than the murder of a child in its mother’s womb."
"A mother ought to be the embodiment of love and affection, and her womb should be the safest of places."
"Unfortunately, however, it can become a grave."
"The killing of a child in its mother’s womb is not a human right."
"What kind of rights do ‘Women on Waves’ therefore wish to defend, if the leader of this organisation was not even entitled to practice medicine in the countries where they landed, and nonetheless prescribed life-threatening hormonal medication to induce early abortion, as well as publicising drugs which can terminate pregnancy and carrying out abortions?"
"I wonder whether twenty-first century Europeans really do desire a freedom allowing free rein to people with disturbed personalities, no conscience, higher feelings, dignity or compassion, that have of late been described as immature, in order to not awaken dormant consciences."
"After all, such people were formerly classed as psychopaths."
"Rational and responsible doctors and researchers have observed with horror the manipulation and degradation of science taking place in laboratories and under the microscope."
"It amounts to thinly disguised terrorism inflicted on the weakest of children, and the creation of modern extermination camps."
"In what way does the killing of defenceless children in their mothers’ wombs differ from the bloodbath in Beslan?"
"Against the public’s wishes, the death penalty for the most serious of crimes has been abolished in Europe."
"Yet at the same time, and invoking this same public opinion, the death penalty for the most defenceless and innocent is being advocated."
"Upon what basis does the European Union venture to assume the right to decide on the life and death of human beings?"
"It is because of the adoption of such an approach to an issue involving the most fundamental of values and human life that Europe and all of Western civilisation is now increasingly at risk of collapse."
"Anyone who cannot see this has been blinded and deafened by political correctness."
"I have the highest regard for the Portuguese authorities, and commend them on preventing this ship of death from entering their territory."
"Finally, I call for the sanctity of life to be respected from conception to a natural death."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue we are discussing today, or rather which we are unfortunately discussing, has two dimensions."
"One would appear to be obvious in this House, namely whether an EU Member State has the right to prevent an act from being committed on its territory if it is a crime under the laws of that country."
"This issue seems to me to be completely clear-cut."
"We want a Europe in which each country is able to lay down laws for its own territory and use every means to uphold those laws."
"In my opinion and in that of my colleagues, the Portuguese Government was fully entitled to prevent a ship bearing death and crime from entering its territorial waters and reaching the Portuguese coast."
"Of course this debate has a further dimension too, as a speaker from the Left quite rightly noted."
"That Member was absolutely right to point out that this debate is also about the way in which contemporary Europe treats unborn children."
"The fact that in many countries the fundamental right to life is not respected is deeply shameful for today’s civilisation and today’s Europe."
"Praise God, since the recent European elections there is an increasing number of Members in this House with the courage to proclaim that unborn children do have the right to life, in Europe and the world over."
"It is a very welcome fact that there are now a great many more people in this House who do remember the words of our Saviour 2 000 years ago, when He said: ‘As you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to me’."
"These words have underpinned human civilisation for 2 000 years."
"They must never be forgotten!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are two aspects of the ban on the entry into Portugal of the ship belonging to ‘Women on Waves’ which are worthy of consideration; firstly, the violation of the principle of free movement of goods and persons, as the Dutch ships were expressly prohibited from entering Portuguese territorial waters and thus from berthing, and secondly, the propaganda spread by ‘Women on Waves’."
"This ship, nicknamed the ‘abortion ship’, has been transformed into a floating clinic in order to supply the RU-486 pill, known as the ‘abortion pill’. It should be noted that this pill is banned in Portugal and hence not sold in the country."
"As it is, we do not believe that the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality has the necessary competence to deal with these two subjects, one relating to the application of international law and the other, concerned with abortion and contraception, relating to morality, ethics and religion."
"In this context, I should like to note that in its resolution of 3 July 2002, Parliament called on the Member States to conduct information campaigns on sexual and reproductive rights, and not to encourage women to use abortion as a method of contraception."
"With regards to this extremely sensitive issue, there is no place for politics, to say nothing of politicking, especially if the issue is used purely to win votes, as appears to be the case here."
"The European countries and their governments have the right to ensure that their cultural, ethical and religious sensitivities are respected, and they have the necessary authority to do so."
"The protest by our fellow Members appears to us to be nothing but a political act against the Portuguese Government, and this is an act with which we do not wish to be associated."
"Mr President, this is the third time the boat has put out to sea."
"As you know, it has already sailed to Ireland and Poland."
"According to the agenda, the boat is Dutch."
"That is incorrect, although it does sail under the Dutch flag."
"The boat is an initiative by a handful of Dutch women, and in view of that, I am amazed that it features here on the agenda."
"We are not going to discuss boats by Greenpeace or other organisations."
"I set great store by a debate on ethical questions, such as abortion and women’s rights, and indeed applaud it, but the discussion is specifically about this boat and what happens on it."
"I think that what happens on this boat is unfortunate."
"Attempts are being made to change the law in Portugal, but in a democratic culture, this is hardly the way to persuade another country to do this."
"Interference of this kind from abroad in respect of Dutch legislation in the areas of drugs or euthanasia, for example, could equally meet with the same wave of protest in the Netherlands."
"We should enter into a debate with each other in a different manner, not like this."
"I also consider this action to be irresponsible."
"Given that the boat sailed to Ireland without permission, it did not even comply with Dutch legislation, which is already very lenient in this respect."
"Following the trip to Poland, a heated debate arose about the use of the non-approved abortion pill, and there are now discussions about the aftercare that cannot be provided."
"‘Women on Waves’ has now published on the Internet a way to induce a termination yourself using over-the-counter medication, and this is accompanied by a word of caution about the gigantic risks that this entails."
"The boat then leaves again a few moments later."
"I do not think this the right way to go about things, not even to promote what you want to promote."
"Countries think differently about matters such as abortion."
"We must enter into a debate with each other about this. I am all in favour of that."
"We may be a community of values, but not in this respect."
"Mr President, I should like to address the Commission about European citizens’, and particularly women’s, right to information."
"Since this right aims to enhance and share knowledge for the benefit of women’s health and sexual rights, it is perfectly compatible with the Lisbon strategy."
"It was not the intention of the ‘Women on Waves’ ship to export the Dutch achievements in the area of abortion to Portugal, but rather to give Portuguese women and men objective information about their sexual rights."
"It is up to them what they do with this information."
"Two years ago, by means of a resolution following a report by Mrs Van Lancker, this House called on governments to provide objective, scientific and clear information about sexual and reproductive health."
"This also included the prevention of unwanted pregnancies and the risks of dangerous terminations performed under inadequate circumstances."
"By foiling the activities of ‘Women on Waves’ which aims to provide information, the Portuguese Government has not given evidence of having taken this House’s resolution seriously."
"Although the ship has now left Portugal, ‘Women on Waves’ has indicated its intention of returning in time for the forthcoming elections in Portugal."
"This could provide the Portuguese Government with a good second chance to act upon this Parliament’s resolution and to demonstrate that it does not want to deny its citizens the right to information."
"Commissioner Wallström, can the Commission ensure that best practice in the area of providing information about women’s reproductive and sexual rights will again be put more firmly on the map, and will it take concrete steps in this respect, for example in the form of organising a conference on this topic in Lisbon?"
"Mr President, the Portuguese Government claims that the activities on board the 'Women on Waves' ship violate Portuguese law."
"I cannot judge if this is so, because I do not know exactly what activities were taking place on board that ship and, indeed, I know nothing of Portuguese law."
"I believe the case will be judged by a court that is competent to do so."
"However, I also believe that this was a provocative act by 'Women on Waves' and an attempt to undermine the principle of subsidiarity because, while in this House we may or may not agree with Portugal's stance on abortion, we must at all times recognise its right as a democratically elected government to make these decisions."
"In this House on Tuesday, I listened carefully to one speaker after another talking about 'respecting the dignity of difference, respecting the right of Members to hold different opinions and showing tolerance to those opinions'."
"Indeed, the President, Mr Barroso, said: 'nobody has a monopoly on truth' – and that includes the Portuguese Government and 'Women on Waves'."
"We must all have respect and tolerance for different opinions, different laws and the right of any state in the EU to legislate and enforce that legislation within its borders."
"Surely, in this House, we must recognise and value that principle of subsidiarity."
"It is my understanding that the EU and the Court of Justice have stated that laws relating to abortion are dealt with at national level only and that the EU has no competence in this area."
"So, while the Portuguese Government has no monopoly on truth, it has competence, which it considers was threatened."
"Finally, a parallel: we in Ireland have introduced a ban on smoking in the workplace."
"This extends to Irish ships."
"If a Portuguese or Dutch citizen were to smoke on board an Irish ship in international waters, that would break Irish law."
"It is not the same situation, but this example helps to illustrate how complex and sensitive these situations are and how the principle of subsidiarity should apply at all times."
"Mr President, as all my fellow MEPs know, women have had the right to vote and the power to take decisions concerning themselves and their assets for more than a century."
"In addition to accepting responsibility for their own lives, women have had responsibility for their children’s lives too."
"In spite of the fact that women have been empowered in legislation etc for such a long time, we women are clearly still incapacitated when it comes to taking decisions concerning our own bodies and sexuality."
"There is no other way of interpreting the Portuguese Government’s action in connection with ‘Women on Waves’."
"The action taken by the Portuguese Government is not only a declaration of women’s incapacity but also breaches the European Parliament’s resolution to promote information campaigns concerning sexual and reproductive rights."
"I do not want only to debate women’s rights, but also to put children at the centre of this debate."
"Taking a different view from certain participants in this debate, with their lack of empathy and understanding, I wish to say that children’s lives are too important simply to depend upon chance."
"Children have an unrestricted right to be welcomed into the world with the prospects of a good life."
"I do not usually go in for conspiracy theories, but I cannot refrain from reflecting upon whether the action taken by the Portuguese Government does not in large part have to do with the fact that it is precisely women and women’s own organisations that are at issue."
"If this vessel, that is the subject of our debate, had been called ‘Men for violence as a means of conflict resolution’, would it, I wonder, not, in all likelihood, have been permitted to enter the port?"
"If the Council and the Commission are serious in their talk of a women’s Europe, they cannot refrain from taking issue with the action taken by the Portuguese Government."
"We must now side with women and children."
"Mr President, I could not agree more with Mr Graça Moura."
"It is beyond me as well why we here in the European Parliament are debating an issue between Portugal and an action group sailing under the Dutch flag."
"The case is to be judged by a court, and it does not fall within this Parliament’s remit."
"The whole issue would therefore seem to be resolved, were it not for the fact that this case is not only judicial in nature, but also moral."
"Since when does the attack on legislation of another Member State fall under the scope of the free movement of persons, goods and services?"
"That is precisely what is happening here with ‘Women on Waves’."
"In Last Saturday’s , this organisation urged people to back the fight for free abortion in Portugal."
"That is quite different from providing a service, and in doing so, this organisation is showing its true colours."
"That is indeed something completely different from providing information on board the ."
"I would note in this connection that the Dutch Public Health Inspectorate is launching an inquiry in order to assess whether the activities by ‘Women on Waves’ are permitted."
"Progressive activism is testing the boundaries of the law. is not automatically accepted in the Netherlands either."
"At the time, only a narrow majority was in favour of a statutory regulation to make possible."
"Even to this day, a large minority is having great difficulty accepting this abortion legislation, coming from the standpoint that life is worth protecting."
"The Netherlands need not show the way in this matter."
"I should like to address the questions that my fellow Members have put to the Commission."
"They state that the Commission should take steps on the basis of Community law."
"Article 28 of Community law stipulates that there should be free movement of goods and services."
"Article 30 of the same Community law stipulates that free movement of goods should not apply when common decency, public order, safety and public health need to be protected."
"It follows that Portugal has every right to refuse an action ship access, even if a Portuguese organisation has invited that ship to be there."
"It is therefore quite a privilege for the EU Member States to still have the right to adopt their own policies."
"In that light, it is a sign of little respect if attempts are made, via European legislation, to prove that the progressive line is right."
"The Portuguese Government should be praised for considering the unborn life worthy of protection."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must be aware that when we discuss the ‘Women on Waves’ boat, the discussion relates in large part to the problem of abortion, which is an entirely new problem for the EU."
"It should be borne in mind that in the majority of European countries abortion has only been permitted in the past few decades, and even now it is not permitted in all of them."
"I rejoice that there are still countries where it is not permitted."
"Even those supporters of abortion who believe that it is a matter of moral indifference must be aware that this discussion will give rise to much opposition."
"They must appreciate that for a great many people in Europe and for a large majority of people in many European countries abortion is a serious crime."
"Both supporters and opponents of abortion on demand are aware that it is one of the great problems of civilisation."
"If this problem is reduced today to a debate on whether Portugal has violated the right to information or the right to freedom of movement, this will be an exceptional display of hypocrisy, ill will or stupidity."
"As Members of this House, we cannot allow ourselves to act as villains or idiots."
"Consequently, if this House begins to consider this problem in terms of the freedom to travel and the freedom of information, it will send out the worst possible message about itself and contribute to the collapse of civilisation, and thus also the collapse of the European Union and the European Parliament."
"It is important to remember that in many European countries, including Ireland, Malta and Portugal, abortion is not permitted."
"Abortion is not permitted in Poland either."
"The ship belonging to the ‘Women on Waves’ association also sailed to Poland, and its presence in Poland was an incitement to criminal behaviour."
"Members of this association who entered Polish waters should be aware that if they ever enter them again, they will not only have to answer for the crimes they committed previously, but they will also, I hope, encounter restrictions and not be allowed into Poland."
"I believe the Portuguese Government took the best possible decision in this regard."
"Clearly, Portugal did not act under Community law."
"This point has already been made."
"Portugal is a sovereign state with independent courts."
"I would like to call once again for the problem not to be reduced to mere discussion on information and freedom of movement."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament’s attention, and that of the Commission and the Council, ought to be directed, as others have stated here, towards the pathetic way in which the pathetic mission by the Dutch vessel ended and towards the unbridled, irresponsible propaganda on illegal abortion that women can carry out themselves, by means of the illegal acquisition and use of medicines."
"I am not talking about the RU-486 pill, which, as in many EU countries, is not licensed in Portugal and which was being transported on the ship, but about the irresponsible acquisition and use of medicines that can be obtained in pharmacies, albeit subject to certain restrictions."
"The unbridled propaganda presents extremely serious risks not only to the right to life of the child that dies when an abortion is committed, but also to the woman, whose health may suffer severely, as documented in pharmacological literature on the subject."
"This debate is, furthermore, a waste of time, out of place and improper."
"It is also offensive."
"I must say that frankly it pains me to see my country slandered abroad and it pains me all the more to see my compatriots taking a leading role in doing so, giving a distorted picture of the facts to those who do not know better, and seeking to caricature the people in question in a propaganda circus."
"I have the greatest respect for the Netherlands, for the Dutch people in the European Union and for the Dutch Presidency, but we have our laws."
"We have always debated these issues freely without the need for such digressions."
"As we all know, we are a democratic and free country."
"Our laws are the fruit of our democracy. In other words, Portugal is not a colony of the Netherlands or of any other country, and less still, the target market of some opportunist group that comes along to educate the local population, as happened during the 1975 ‘cultural dynamisation’ and when the PREC (Ongoing Revolutionary Process) was at its peak."
"We practise respect and democracy; we demand democracy and respect."
"It has been suggested that freedom of movement was violated."
"This is ridiculous."
"Dutch women may go wherever they want to, as everyone knows."
"It is the boat that cannot go wherever it wants to."
"It has been suggested that freedom of expression was violated."
"This is ridiculous."
"We all took part in the debate and said whatever we wanted to at the time, just as on all other occasions."
"The only acts of violence committed were the extremist and intimidating language – laden with hate and intolerance – used by the supporters of the Dutch group’s nautical circus to condition the Portuguese people and dilute their rights as citizens, the bias on the part of the media, which was in thrall to the boat trip’s demagogical populism and the vandalism perpetrated at our party’s headquarters."
"In conclusion, the Portuguese Government acted within the law."
"The court found in its favour and this matter has nothing to do with the European Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, I should first like to mention the first victory in this debate. It has become clear that the Commission will request explanations from the Portuguese Government as regards the ."
"In Portugal, at least one in four women has had a back-street abortion, which is, as much as anything, an extremely serious public health problem."
"That statistic speaks volumes; we cannot continue to bury our heads in the sand."
"How, therefore, shall we, the European Union, condemn these women?"
"Should we have them arrested?"
"What about those who terminate their pregnancy in London or in Badajoz?"
"Should we close the borders?"
"Should we keep them under constant European Army surveillance?"
"Should we have all of the Portuguese newspapers that publicise foreign, or more specifically European, clinics carrying out safe and legal voluntary terminations of pregnancy confiscated?"
"What if the were a train, or a TIR lorry?"
"Would army tanks be stopping the train or the TIR from entering Portuguese territory, so as to make sure that there was no chance of the law being broken and so that the Portuguese people were not informed?"
"Is the Commission aware that, although the two Portuguese war corvettes were in permanent use, no military or civil authority ever asked to board the and check for any potential dangers on board?"
"Is the Commission aware that the Portuguese Ministry of Defence’s only information had come from a series of media cuttings and not from first-hand observation?"
"Against this backdrop, it was important to know that the Commission clearly intends to ensure compliance with the Treaties."
"Otherwise, if Turkey accedes to the EU, the Commission will have to take military action in the case of a married Portuguese man moving to Turkey, having announced that he has a girlfriend there and who will therefore be committing adultery."
"Commissioner, it is crucial that action is taken at this time, so that we are not faced with the warped logic of ‘more of the same’, also in the EU."
"This is not a question of morals or of personal opinions, Commissioner; this is a question of legality."
"Just imagine that fanatic, aggressive anti-abortion activists were to descend upon the Netherlands in order to protest there against abortion using the kind of improper arguments I have heard from that side of the Chamber, and they were stopped at the Dutch border by military police."
"If that were to happen, this House would be up in arms."
"Abortion legislation is indeed a national issue, but freedom of expression of opinion is a fundamental right of all European citizens across Europe."
"Every six minutes, somewhere in the world, a woman dies of the effects of an illegal termination, and in Portugal alone, these practices have already claimed one hundred casualties in the last two decades."
"In that light, the Portuguese Government’s blocking of information and debate is incomprehensible, and, as far as I am concerned, a disgrace for democracy."
"Our fellow-Europeans in Portugal have the same right to information and debate as all others."
"I therefore rely on the Commission to uphold European basic rights."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in June of last year I witnessed the entry into Polish territorial waters of the , a Dutch vessel housing an abortion clinic belonging to the organisation ‘Women on Waves’."
"We of the League of Polish Families, an organisation defending the life of unborn children, decided that we would not allow this monstrous provocation to occur."
"For two weeks I saw how the organisation ‘Women on Waves’ repeatedly mocked Polish law by violating a large number of regulations, for example by entering the port of Władysławowo without the consent of the port authority."
"This posed a navigational risk to other seafaring vessels in the port."
"A further instance in which laws were broken was the import of drugs prohibited in Poland."
"I would also like to stress that the hygiene and sanitary conditions on the ship were appalling."
"If ‘Women on Waves’ wish to enter Polish ports again in the future, we will not allow this to happen."
"– Mr President, there are differing views as to how the law should treat abortion, but, listening to some of those who have spoken, I got the impression that they regarded abortion as progress."
"I think we should, at least, be united on one point, that being that every abortion is a catastrophe and a failure."
"An abortion is a catastrophe for the unborn child, who is killed."
"An abortion is a catastrophe for the mother, who is often emotionally scarred for the rest of her life."
"An abortion means failure on the father’s part, for he has often made off in a funk."
"An abortion is a failure on the part of the state and of society, which have not created the conditions in which life can be adequately fostered."
"For these reasons, we should deal with this issue very carefully and with a deep awareness of our responsibilities."
"States decide in different ways how this is to be dealt with by the law, or, to be more precise, in a democracy, it is the people who take that decision, and their decisions differ."
"What made Portuguese law what it is was not some sort of shadowy conspiracy, but the Portuguese people – who, in a democracy, decided that they wanted to combat abortion by restricting it, and, indeed, by the use of the criminal law."
"Poland and many other Member States do likewise, some of them very effectively."
"Let me say yet again that this is a subject on which opinions can differ."
"I do, however, find it unacceptable to behave as if information were the point at issue."
"Not one Portuguese citizen, whether male or female, is not fully at liberty to seek out information about anything."
"Anyone would think that the Portuguese were ill-informed yokels."
"Portuguese men and women are extremely well informed and have access to every possible source of information."
"What is going on here is agitation and an attempt at undermining the law of a Member State and an important principle of the European Union, that being the subsidiarity principle, and the most important principle in our Charter of Fundamental Rights, the right to life."
"Mr President, just because abortion in Portugal is illegal in most cases, it does not mean that it is not needed there."
"Women in Portugal need help and advice on abortion, sexual health and reproductive rights."
"I would remind this House that in most Member States abortion is legal."
"I would also draw your attention to the Van Lancker report, which has already been mentioned."
"Here we are talking about abortion, which is accepted throughout most Member States of the European Union and has been accepted by this House."
"We need to be very clear on this."
"We also need to be very clear that illegal, unsafe abortions present not only danger to the women concerned, but danger of death."
"We have already heard from Mrs Madeira about the fatalities which take place in Portugal itself and I would like to remind all of you that every six minutes across the world one woman dies from an illegal, unsafe abortion."
"I put it to all of you that we have a duty to deal with this and put an end to this suffering and this toll of death."
"It is also important to recognise that 'Women on Waves' is only called into countries when women's organisations in those countries concerned actually request it."
"We are not talking here about something being forced on people, we are talking about something being requested because there is a clear need and demand for it."
"We also need to be aware of the position on the free movement of people within the European Union, which is one of our fundamental principles."
"I would like to end by quoting from the Treaty on European Union: 'to maintain and develop the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice, in which the free movement of persons is assured in conjunction with appropriate measures with respect to external border controls, asylum, immigration and the prevention and combating of crime'."
"This is what we are about."
"We are about basic human rights, and this is one of them."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. The political events which we are considering so diligently today have been the subject of wide-ranging discussion in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality."
"I should like to confirm that every member of our committee has been able without exception to express his or her views."
"The committee has devoted sufficient time to discussion of these events, even in a situation where we did not have sufficient information and in-depth analysis, especially with regard to the possible contravention of human rights, community rights or rights of freedom of movement or information."
"Despite completely open and lively discussions, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, in view of the divergent opinions expressed, was unable to reach a consensus on a common standpoint."
"I should like to turn to a more fundamental aspect, however."
"This goes far beyond political polemics and even the legal advisors do not have a clear solution for it."
"The following reflections are simply the reflections of a woman in solidarity with other women."
"I should like to point out that a woman who feels compelled to have an abortion never does so with relish."
"This often involves a situation where the woman does not believe she will be able to cope with pregnancy and childbirth and where it seems to her that, in this confused situation, she has no other option."
"This personal upheaval may be associated with extreme situations, when the woman is compelled to stop work, is deserted, raped or suffering from other physical or mental trauma or abuse in a family, economic or social environment."
"The situation today is a manifestation of the failure of a developed human society which is incapable of contributing to the needs of all human beings, including the poorest, smallest and weakest."
"We must work towards an internal stability pact, which will give people more trust in society, supporting inter-generational solidarity and enabling us to engage together in this direction."
"Mr President, the fight against terrorism and organised crime must be a priority at the moment for any European government."
"Prioritising means mobilising all available resources – police, investigation and intelligence resources – and ensuring that the legal system is ready and able to take quick and effective action."
"The Commission recommends that Member States strengthen all resources for this fight."
"Nonetheless, in spite of notoriously scant resources, Portugal has been diverting important investigation and legal resources into a different objective: punishing illegal abortion."
"The Portuguese police have been bugging the telephones of law-abiding citizens and of their family members or of medical professionals whom they suspect may be involved."
"They have spent years observing them and hounding them; legal professionals have spent years of working time – in an already overloaded, understaffed and poorly equipped system – putting women accused of abortion on trial."
"Taxpayers’ money is spent on criminal investigations into medical operations that Portuguese women can go to Spain to have, perfectly safely and legally."
"Women who have the wherewithal to pay can have these operations in Portuguese private hospitals disguised as other kinds of surgery. The many women who do not have the wherewithal have no choice but to have back-street abortions, where they risk their lives, and risk being arrested, taken by the police to hospitals, forced to have gynaecological tests and then put on humiliating trial."
"The hypocrisy has now, however, reached new levels of insanity, with the ban on entry into Portugal of the ship belonging to the ‘Women on Waves’ organisation. The Portuguese Government, the one that Mr Barroso has left, has sought to stifle information and debate on family planning, in clear breach of human rights, international law and Community law."
"It has done this by using totally disproportionate methods, police and even military resources, without hesitating to use warships. Resources have thus been diverted, once again, from important activities, such as the fight against international terrorism and organised crime, and observing vessels used in drug-trafficking that use Portuguese waters as a point of entry into the rest of Europe."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner, in addition to the points that she mentioned, not to ignore the unjustified, excessive and almost obsessive use by the Portuguese Government of criminal, legal and even military resources in the fight against abortion and against providing family planning information. In so doing, they have removed the resources and the efforts that Portugal ought to be putting into EU crime prevention policies in the joint fight against international terrorism and organised crime."
"I wish to join other colleagues in showing solidarity with the Portuguese Government for its decision not to allow the ship ‘Women on Waves’ in Portugal."
"I show my solidarity and congratulate the Portuguese Government for its courage and, why not, also its moral courage when taking this decision."
"It is not easy in today’s world with, pressures being exerted from every quarter, that one makes a bold stand and adheres steadfastly to the decision taken more so when knowing that one would not necessarily be popular by taking such a decision."
"I must say that I do not agree that the abortion issue should be raised in this Parliament for any reason except to put pressure on one country or another."
"I do not agree as all of us are aware that this Parliament has no power to decide or to legislate on abortion."
"In the same manner the Commission has no jurisdiction concerning abortion."
"This is a matter that should be decided at a national level in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and every country should decide according to its circumstances and according to how its society looks upon such a sensitive issue."
"This means that, by raising this issue here when we know that this Parliament has no jurisdiction, all we are doing is mixing people up and creating total confusion, when, in fact, this is a clear issue and upon which there is no place for confusion."
"This confusion has even caused a number of countries, including Malta, my country, to seek clarification regarding this issue in the context of negotiations by negotiating a specific protocol regarding the abortion issue."
"The same was done by Ireland, and, if I am not mistaken, even Poland, not because there was any legal doubt about this issue but so that there would be certainty and all would have their minds at rest."
"Therefore whilst again congratulating the Portuguese Government that set an example to others, I appeal that we should not muddle people’s minds regarding this issue by entering into matters that do not concern us."
"Mr President, I find it somewhat ironic that all of the men who have spoken on the other side of this House have had the temerity to tell women what they should do with their bodies."
"I am proud to stand here and defend a woman's right to choose."
"That is fundamentally what this is about."
